19142,"EU Threatens Poland Over Logging, Risks Fresh Clash With Right-Wing Government - Breitbart","BRUSSELS (AFP)  —   The EU warned Poland on Thursday it may take legal action to stop logging in a UNESCO World Heritage forest, risking a new clash with Warsaw’s   government. [Brussels gave Poland one month rather than the usual two to address its concerns about the ancient Bialowieza forest or face being summoned by the EU’s top court.  “One month was considered the right time considering the urgency of the situation,” European Commission spokesman Enrico Brivio told reporters. He said Poland’s reply to requests to stop   logging in the forest was “not satisfactory” amid concerns it could cause irreparable biodiversity loss. The Bialowieza forest includes some of Europe’s last primeval woodland and has been granted protected status by the UN heritage organisation. The threat comes with Brussels and Warsaw already at loggerheads over changes to Poland’s constitutional court which the EU has warned could merit sanctions as a “systemic threat” to the rule of law. Since the populist PiS administration came to power in Warsaw in October 2015, it has come into conflict with Brussels on several fronts. The EU launched both the logging inquiry  —   based on a complaint by environmentalists  —   and the rule of law investigation last year. If the logging case goes before the European Court of Justice, Poland could face fines. But if found at fault on the rule of law Poland could face the far more serious prospect of seeing its EU voting rights suspended. The Bialowieza forest straddles Poland’s eastern border with Belarus and is home to unique plant and animal life, including a herd of some 800 European bison, the continent’s largest mammal. The vast woodland includes one of the largest surviving parts of the primeval forest that covered the European plain ten thousand years ago. The Polish government began logging in May last year, saying it was clearing dead trees to prevent damage caused by the spruce bark beetle, and insisting the policy was entirely legal.",0
19143,"Putin: “If Americans vote for Trump, they’re voting for peace! ”If they vote for Clinton, its war.”","(Translated from Russian, of course. Here is another translation of the same interview as well.) 
We will certainly welcome anyone who wants to work with us, and no, we are not interested in quarrelling constantly with anyone, which only creates threats to oneself and the world, or at the very least makes it harder to achieve the desired results in the fight against terrorism. 
We do not know what will happen after the election. We do not know whether or not presidential candidate Trump will follow through on his intentions, how far he will go in cooperation with us, whether Ms Clinton will stick to her harsh anti-Russian rhetoric if she is elected President, or maybe she will also adjust her position. We cannot know this now. 
I will repeat this again: sacrificing Russian-American relations for the sake of internal political events in the US is harmful and counterproductive. 
He’s always so full of reason. I like the way that he speaks without having to remember which opinion is public and which is private. Russia uses the US as a scapegoat for plenty of things but they generally seem to have good intentions, even if they conflict with ours.",0
19144,"We Came, We Saw, He Died: How Gaddafi Was Hunted And Ruthlessly Killed","Email Exactly five years ago, Libya’s ex-leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi was brutally murdered by rebels who discovered him in drainage pipes following a NATO air strike that hit his convoy on the outskirts of his hometown, Sirte. The following day, his body was put on display in a storage freezer in the city of Misrata. Via CollectiveEvolution 
This probed a controversial response from then U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who remarked, “We came, we saw, he died.” On April 2, 2011, she received an email from Sidney Blumenthal, who served as her unofficial intelligence operative. The message discussed France’s reasoning for joining the war against Gaddafi in Libya. Blumenthal wrote in the email that Gaddafi had “nearly bottomless financial resources” for pursuing his campaign against the rebels. And while Libya’s frozen bank accounts had become an obstacle, he still had nearly 143 tons of gold and a similar amount in silver that accumulated to a total of $7 billion. SPONSORED LINKS Scroll Down For Video Below! 
The email goes on to say that Gaddafi had taken the gold before the rebellion in order to “establish a pan-African currency based on the Libyan golden Dinar.” The idea was apparently to present a currency in the African region in order to compete with the French Franc. Blumenthal said, “French intelligence officers discovered this plan shortly after the current rebellion began, and this was one of the factors that influenced President Nicolas Sarkozy’s decision to commit France to the attack on Libya.” 
Just months later, on October 20, 2011, Gaddafi was murdered . Now, five years later, the once successful Arab country is in a state of chaos filled with tribal wars, leading to tens of thousands of Libyans dead, and displacing hundreds of thousands more. Gaddafi’s death immediately led to an intense power struggle that turned into a civil war. Ultimately, Islamic militant and terrorist groups, like ISIS, carried out attacks on Libyan oil and other important groundwork. 
Gaddafi had, prior to his reign, advocated socialist ideas. Upon graduating from a military academy in Benghazi, he joined a plot to throw out King Idris I, which eventually happened in September 1969, leading to Gaddafi being promoted to Colonel, and his officers taking on a grand campaign to overturn Western capitalism. British and U.S. military bases in Libya were then closed down, and Western oil companies were immediately nationalized. 
Gaddafi promised to rule out corruption and enact serious changes in the country’s social, economic, and political life. He created the Jamahiriya, which is an Arabic term that translates to “state of the masses.” His republic vowed to incorporate anarchist, Marxist, and Islamist practices. 
By March 1977, Gaddafi called for a “people’s republic” referred to as the Great Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. Gaddafi served as president, banning all political organizations, with the exception of his devised Arab Socialist Union. 
By 1979, Gaddafi resigned in order to work for a “continuation of the revolution,” and changed his title to the Leader of the Revolution. The government took advantage of oil money to create extensive and seemingly outlandish social reforms. He proposed that women be allowed to study, serve in the army, and move up the social ladder, for instance. 
The West and conservative Arab countries remained hesitant of the successful and passionate leader, and remained hands-off until the 2011 region was hit with Arab Spring “revolutions.” 
The protests-turned-armed-conflict in Libya came about in February 2011, with people demanding Gaddafi to resign after 40 years of ruling the Libyan Arab Republic. Eventually, opponents gained control over almost all of Libya. On March 17, 2011, the U.S. and Western allies proposed a settlement by the UN Security Council that implemented a no-fly zone over Libya which caused Western airstrikes on Gaddafi’s forces. Gaddafi was accused of bombing his own people, and using foreign mercenaries to halt anti-government protests. 
On March 19, 2011, NATO airstrikes commenced, led by France, and then followed by the US, the UK, and several other countries. NATO jets eventually targeted Gaddafi’s home on April 29, where he survived, but his youngest son and three children were killed. 
On June 27, the International Criminal Court granted a request to issue a warrant for the arrest of Gaddalfi, as well as his son, Saif al-Islam. 
By August 21, rebel fighters from Libya’s National Transitional Council bombarded the capital Tripoli to take over the government compound. Gaddafi refused to back down and leave the capital, and called for his loyalists to fight until the bitter end. By the 23, NTC fighters had overrun Tripoli, and taken Gaddafi’s reign out from underneath him. This caused Gaddafi and his loyalists to flee the capital 10 days later, ending up in his hometown of Sirte. 
Throughout September 2011, Gaddafi loyalists were overrun, and by October, all of Sirte had been captured by the rebels, except for a northern neighborhood referred to as Number Two, where Gaddafi was hiding out. But by October 20, the Libyan rebels had pinpointed Gaddafi’s location there. 
With Tripoli in ruins, and Number Two under attack, Gaddafi’s life seemed a ticking time bomb. That day, the once leader was injured from a NATO air attack, but many others were killed. Gaddafi sought refuge in a nearby drainage facility along with some of his closest aids. 
His hideout was soon discovered by a unit of the National Transitional Council, who then assaulted him, including sexually, and then took him prisoner, and are believed to have tortured and killed both him and his son before they were murdered.",0

19146,Trump’s Inconvenient Racial Truth - The New York Times,"With the race for the presidency entering its last days, Donald J. Trump last Wednesday once again made his pitch to black America: a new deal aimed just at them. “I will be your greatest champion,” Trump said at a campaign rally in the battleground state of North Carolina. “I will never ever take the   community for granted. Never, ever. ” The hyperbolic remarks elicited the same collective eye roll among black Americans and white progressives that they have since Trump began regularly including black Americans in his platform in August. It was then, following days of unrest in Milwaukee after the police killed a black man there, that Trump flew to Wisconsin to give a speech on race. He headed not to the heavily black city where the embers of outrage still smoldered but instead, as his critics noted with glee, took the stage at the county fairgrounds of a   deeply conservative Milwaukee suburb in order to address the problems of the “inner city. ” There was, of course, the usual and expected “law and order” and   rhetoric that elicited hoots and cheers from the crowd. But then Trump, as he is known to do, added an unexpected twist. “Our job is to make life more comfortable for the   parent who wants their kids to be able to safely walk the streets,’’ Trump said. ‘‘Or the senior citizen waiting for a bus, or the young child walking home from school. For every one violent protester, there are a hundred moms and dads and kids on the same city block who just want to be able to sleep safely at night. ” He pointed out the high unemployment rate among black men in Milwaukee, the number of households run by single mothers who were living in poverty and the low    rates. “I am asking for the vote of every   citizen struggling in our country today who wants a different and much better future,” Trump told the crowd, which at times stood eerily silent. “It is time for our society to address some honest and very, very difficult truths. The Democratic Party has failed and betrayed the   community. ” Trump went on to say that Hillary Clinton “panders and talks down to communities of color,” “seeing them only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future. ” It was time, Trump proclaimed, that Democrats compete for black votes. There was something utterly surreal about that moment. Trump had spent months whipping up his supporters, focusing on other   minority groups whom he labeled rapists and terrorists, and now he was telling the nearly   crowd that if they voted for him, he’d use his power to help black residents in the inner cities by bringing jobs back and improving their wages. Trump’s message did not seem to be directed at his audience (recent research by professors at the universities of Chicago and Minnesota showed that white Trump supporters are less likely to support government programs if they think they will help black people). As one resident of West Bend, the approximately    town where the rally was held, put it to The Times: “They think we owe them something. I don’t want to seem racist or anything, but the black heritage has been raised in a certain way that there’s no incentive to get out and work, because all of a sudden you have five kids and there are no dads around. ” Nor was it directed to black people, who of all the nonwhite voters are the least poachable by the G. O. P. The message was presumably targeted at white moderates, the independents and disillusioned Bernie Sanders legions, whom Trump was most likely hoping to reassure that he was not racist despite his years of fueling the birther conspiracy theory and months of spewing bigotry about Muslims and Mexicans. But in his speeches, Trump was speaking more directly about the particular struggles of   black Americans and describing how the government should help them more than any presidential candidate in years. Let that uncomfortable truth sink in. Whatever his motives, Trump was talking about the black working class in a way that few national politicians do. By now it’s no surprise that when they talk about black Americans as at all, Republican politicians typically conflate blackness with poverty, and then quickly blame black people for their struggles. In March 2014, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said that the problems in the “inner cities” Trump was talking about were rooted not in the loss of manufacturing jobs and the flight of businesses and the tax base to   suburbs, but on an absence of a “culture of work. ” Liberals quickly lambasted Ryan for those remarks. But far too often, the way Democrats talk to, and about, black Americans is indistinguishable from the way their Republican counterparts do. And President Obama has been as guilty as anyone. A year before Ryan made his remarks, Obama delivered a commencement address at the historically black Morehouse College, where he warned the graduates at the prestigious   school that they shouldn’t use racism as an excuse, and to be good fathers. Politicians regularly deploy this type of shaming when referring to, or even when addressing, black Americans. But it’s hard to fathom a politician, Democrat or Republican, standing before a predominately white crowd in a sagging old coal town, and blaming the community’s economic woes on poor parenting or lack of work ethic or a victim mentality. Those Americans, white Americans, are worthy of government help. Their problems are not of their own making, but systemic, institutional, out of their control. They are never blamed for their lot in life. They have had jobs snatched away by bad federal policy, their opportunities stolen by inept politicians. It would have been easy, expected, for Trump in his speeches to recycle the same old   narrative for black voters. But Trump didn’t call for black people to stop lazing around and use a little more elbow grease on those bootstraps. He was pushing for more government  —     government  —   to help black folks prosper, a racially specific new deal that included investing in schools,   jobs and black entrepreneurs. And in doing so, Trump, at least rhetorically, did something the Democrats and Republicans have largely failed to do  —   he took black citizens into the ranks of “hardworking Americans” worthy of the government’s hand. To be clear, I am not arguing that the man who called for the execution of the   Central Park Five (and who still insists on their guilt) and who seeks nationwide implementation of the    program ruled unconstitutional in New York City, and who warns that voting in heavily black cities is rigged, is a racial progressive who will enact policies that will help black communities. Nor am I saying black voters should buy what Trump is selling. (And they aren’t: A poll released last week by The New York Times   College of likely voters in Pennsylvania found that “no black respondent from Philadelphia supported Mr. Trump in the survey. ”) What I am saying is that when Trump claims Democratic governance has failed black people, when he asks “the blacks” what they have to lose, he is asking a poorly stated version of a question that many black Americans have long asked themselves. What dividends, exactly, has their   loyalty to the Democratic ticket paid them? By brushing Trump’s criticism off as merely cynical or clueless rantings, we are missing an opportunity to have a real discussion of the failures of progressivism and Democratic leadership when it comes to black Americans. Trump is not wrong when he says that black Americans have suffered in a particular way in blue cities and blue states. (Of course, they suffer in red states as well.) The most segregated cities have long been clustered above the   line and are Democratically run. Some of the most segregated schools in the country educate students in New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Milwaukee. Efforts to integrate schools in these cities have met resistance from white progressives. Democrats did as much to usher in the era of mass incarceration as anyone else. And in these cities, with their gaping income inequality, black communities shoulder a terrible burden of gun violence, high unemployment, substandard schools and poverty. Though black Americans these days consistently vote Democratic at higher margins than any other racial group, this wasn’t always the case. Before 1948, black voters were fairly evenly split between Republican and Democrats. Then President Harry S. Truman pushed a civil rights platform, and a majority of black voters swung Democratic, though a significant percentage still identified as Republican. That changed in the 1960s, when black voters moved en masse to the Democratic Party after Lyndon B. Johnson showed he was willing to lose the South in order to pass the most sweeping civil rights legislation since Reconstruction. Southern Democrats abandoned the party to become Republicans, and Richard Nixon won the presidency in 1968 on a Southern strategy of stalling forward movement on civil rights. And the party of Lincoln came to be considered anathema to black progress. In the intervening years, modern Democrats have been far more likely to support social programs that help the poor, who are disproportionately black, and to support civil rights policies. But since Johnson left office, Democrats have done little to address the systemic issues  —   housing and school segregation  —   that keep so many black Americans in economic distress and that make true equality elusive. At the federal level, despite the fact that the National Fair Housing Alliance estimates that black Americans experiences millions of incidents of housing discrimination every year, Democrats, like Republicans, have avoided strong enforcement of federal   laws that would allow black families to move to   areas. Both Democrats and Republicans have failed to pursue   policies that would ensure black children gain access to the good schools white kids attend. In the 1970s and ’80s, Trump battled   lawsuits, while Senator Clinton was noticeably quiet when Westchester County, N. Y. a county that twice voted decidedly for Obama, fought a court order to integrate its whitest towns, including Chappaqua, the    town she calls home. Instead of seeking aggressive   initiatives, Democrats too often have opted for a sort of   liberalism. If we work to strengthen unions, that will trickle down to you. If we work to strengthen health care, that will trickle down to you. If we work to make all schools better, that will trickle down to you. After decades of Democratic loyalty, too many black Americans are still awaiting that trickle. While Republicans rarely make any effort to court black voters, Democrats do reach out to them. But Democratic politicians have also shown again and again that they will sacrifice the needs of their most loyal constituents in order to win larger political points. I will never forget how in February 2013, President Obama flew to Chicago to give a speech that touched on gun violence. He spoke of the random shooting of Hadiya Pendleton, a Chicago teenager who had performed at his inaugural events. “There’s no more important ingredient for success, nothing that would be more important for us reducing violence than strong, stable families  —   which means we should do more to promote marriage and encourage fatherhood,” Obama told the predominantly black audience. But two months earlier, when he gave a speech about the Newtown shooting, he’d said no such thing about fathers and marriage, even though that violent act was carried out by a young white man from a broken home. Instead, he emphasized Congress’s inability to pass gun control. The message: Black killings are the black community’s fault white killings are a failure of government. Trump, in turning the usual rhetoric on its head  —   claiming that black people are living in   hells and should therefore spurn the Democratic Party  —   has forced progressives, both black and white, into the uncomfortable position of arguing that things aren’t nearly as bad for black America as Trump would have us believe. In the weeks before Trump’s alleged sexual improprieties overtook everything else, writers dashed off thousands of words arguing that the “inner cities” are improving (gentrification!) and that poverty is not just in the inner city but in suburban America too, and that there are lots of   black folks doing just fine, thank you. Writers pointed out that Trump was wrong when he said nearly half of   black children are poor when it’s actually just  . If Trump had raised these statistics and said black people needed to simply work harder, these same people would be arguing that candidates needed to be talking about what they were going to do address the systemic causes of devastatingly high poverty and unemployment rates that black Americans experience. And they would have been right.  Most black Americans live neither in poverty nor in the inner city. And even those of us who do live in inner cities aren’t living in hell. But the inequality that black Americans experience is stark. Black children are more segregated from white children now than at any point since the early ’70s. United States census data shows that a black   family is more likely to live in a poor neighborhood than a poor white family. The wealth gap between white and black families is the widest it has been in nearly three decades. This is true in cities and states run by Republicans. This is true in cities and states run by Democrats. Regardless of how you feel about Trump, on this one thing he is right: The Democratic Party has taken black Americans for granted. The problem is  —   and this is where Trump’s rhetoric is just that, rhetoric  —   black people aren’t loyal Democrats because they don’t know any better. They are making an informed decision. As Theodore R. Johnson, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy and an expert on black voting behavior, points out in his research, black Americans are an electoral monolith out of necessity. Black people care about the environment and the economy and international issues, and they generally fall across the spectrum on a range of issues, just like all other human beings. But while the Democratic Party might be accused of upholding the racial status quo, the Republican Party has a long track record of working to restrict the remedies available to increase housing and school integration and equal opportunities in employment and college admissions. And most critical, Republicans have passed laws that have made the hallmark of full citizenship  —   the right to vote  —   more difficult for black Americans. Since first securing the right to vote, black Americans have had to be   voters  —   and that single issue is basic citizenship rights. Maintaining these rights will always and forever transcend any other issue. And so black Americans can never jump ship to a party they understand as trying to erode the   rights black citizens have died to secure. But it is also true that black Americans have not always been   voters, and they don’t have to remain so. If Democrats want to keep black voters, they need to work for those votes, because one day Republicans might wise up. Until then, when Trump asks what the hell do black Americans have to lose? Well, a hell of a lot.",0
19147,These Declassified Emails Show NATO Killed Gaddafi To Stop Libyan Creation of Gold-Backed Currency,"Share on Facebook Hillary's emails truly are the gifts that keep on giving. While France led the proponents of the UN Security Council Resolution that would create a no-fly zone in Libya, it claimed that its primary concern was the protection of Libyan civilians (considering the current state of affairs alone, one must rethink the authenticity of this concern). As many “conspiracy theorists” will claim, one of the real reasons to go to Libya was Gaddafi's planned gold dinar. One of the 3,000 Hillary Clinton emails released by the State Department on New Year's Eve (where real news is sent to die quietly) has revealed evidence that NATO's plot to overthrow Gaddafi was fueled by first their desire to quash the gold-backed African currency, and second the Libyan oil reserves. The email in question was sent to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by her unofficial adviser Sydney Blumenthal titled “France's client and Qaddafi's gold” . From Foreign Policy Journal : The email identifies French President Nicholas Sarkozy as leading the attack on Libya with five specific purposes in mind: to obtain Libyan oil, ensure French influence in the region, increase Sarkozy's reputation domestically, assert French military power, and to prevent Gaddafi's influence in what is considered “Francophone Africa.” Most astounding is the lengthy section delineating the huge threat that Gaddafi's gold and silver reserves, estimated at “143 tons of gold, and a similar amount in silver,” posed to the French franc (CFA) circulating as a prime African currency. And here is the section of the email proving that NATO had ulterior motives for destroying Libya (UPDATE: The link has since been killed, but here is the web cache ): This gold was accumulated prior to the current rebellion and was intended to be used to establish a pan-African currency based on the Libyan golden Dinar. This plan was designed to provide the Francophone African Countries with an alternative to the French franc (CFA). (Source Comment: According to knowledgeable individuals this quantity of gold and silver is valued at more than $7 billion. French intelligence officers discovered this plan shortly after the current rebellion began, and this was one of the factors that influenced President Nicolas Sarkozy's decision to commit France to the attack on Libya . According to these individuals Sarkozy's plans are driven by the following issues: A desire to gain a greater share of Libya oil production Increase French influence in North Africa Improve his internal political situation in France Provide the French military with an opportunity to reassert its position in the world Address the concern of his advisors over Qaddafi's long term plans to supplant France as the dominant power in Francophone Africa Ergo as soon as French intel discovered Gaddafi's dinar plans, they decided to spearhead the campaign against him- having accumulated enough good reasons to take over.",0
19148,California AG Warns About Data Mining of Students,"Email 
In a report released November 2 by the California state attorney general's office, private educational technology companies are warned to be very vigilant in their handling of sensitive student data obtained by them in the course of their dealings with public schools. 
“In some instances we’re seeing evidence of companies mining data from school children beyond what’s necessary for their education,” said Daniel Suvor, chief of policy for California Attorney General Kamala Harris. 
Harris’s office released their report, entitled ""Ready for School: Recommendations for the Ed Tech Industry to Protect the Privacy of Student Data,"" to convince these corporate educational conglomerates with substantial contracts with school districts nationwide to come up with procedures that aren't careless with the private data obtained from students in the course of complying with the various standardized tests and other activities required as part of the big money agreements signed by administrators and the companies. 
According to the report, education has become an $8-billion-a-year business. No wonder these companies care so much about pleasing their clients. 
The purpose of the report and its recommendations is to limit ""the collection and use of the student information acquired through the technology,” Harris' office said in a written statement. 
As a teacher, this writer can witness firsthand to the subtle and substantial ways that these ""educational companies"" collect personal data from students. I have seen the forms that these companies include as part of their packets, and the information demanded of students goes far beyond anything necessary for the purpose of improving education or the classroom experience. 
Naturally, much of this data mining comes from the adoption by so many states of the Common Core standards. 
Common Core State Standards Initiative is the official name of the scholastic standards copyrighted by the Washington, D.C.-based National Governors Association (NGA) and the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO). Common Core has come under significant fire from parents, teachers, and school administrators across the country, who declare that the standards are a bid by the federal government to take over the education system. Additionally, privacy advocates have voiced concerns over the distribution to contractors of personally identifiable information about students and their families. 
As we noted in an article entitled "" Orwellian Nightmare: Data Mining Your Kids, "" published in 2013: One of the most troubling aspects of the “education reforms” currently being advanced by the Obama administration and its allies is the unprecedented monitoring and tracking of students — invasions of privacy so pervasive George Orwell might blush. Everything from biometric data to information on children’s beliefs and families is already being vacuumed up. Opponents of the “reform” agenda have highlighted the cradle-to-grave accumulation of private and intimate data as among the most compelling reasons to kill the whole process. Aside from data produced by the looming Common Core-aligned national testing regime, most of the data-mining schemes are not technically direct components of the plot to nationalize education standards. However, the vast collection of personal information and the accompanying data-mining are intricately linked to the federally backed standards in multiple ways, not to mention myriad other federal schemes. Despite protestations to the contrary, the new standards and the data collection go together hand in hand. 
Later in the piece, we presented some evidence of just how massive the menace has grown: All across the country today, Big Brother-like technological developments in biometrics are also making schools increasingly Orwellian. Earlier this year in Polk County, Florida, for example, students’ irises were scanned without parental consent. “It simply takes a picture of the iris, which is unique to every individual,” wrote the school board’s “senior director of support services” in a letter to parents. “With this program, we will be able to identify when and where a student gets on the bus, when they arrive at their school location, when and what bus the student boards and disembarks in the afternoon. This is an effort to further enhance the safety of our students. The EyeSwipe-Nano is an ideal replacement for the card based system since your child will not have to be responsible for carrying an identification card.” In San Antonio, Texas, meanwhile, a female student made national news — and exposed what was going on — when she got in a legal battle with school officials over her refusal to wear a mandatory radio-frequency identification (RFID) device. The same devices are already being implanted under people’s skin in America and abroad — albeit voluntarily. Also in the biometric field, since at least 2007, children in states such Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and New Jersey have been fingerprinted at school under the guise of “school lunch” programs and other pretexts. 
""Most of the companies we spoke to throughout this process thought it made sense for us to lay a set of recommendations they could use to govern the sector,” Suvor said, after a meeting with the companies involved in the collection of student data. 
Again, it's not hard to see why these companies would bend over backward for the school districts considering the enormous financial benefits that they derive from playing according to the schools' rules. 
Of course, our children wouldn't be subjected to this siphoning of data if the people of the states would come to understand one simple and undeniable fact: The Constitution does not grant to the federal government any authority over education. 
Parents must demand that administrators and state education officials refuse to enter into a contract with any company for any reason for any amount of money that would carry out federally mandated information collection. Furthermore, the people must insist that their local leaders reject out of hand any educational program or policy that would turn our children into informants. 
If we fail to force our elected leaders to adhere to their constitutionally imposed oaths of office, we will find that our children are the latest individuals to be caught in the ever-expanding net of federal surveillance, putting our youngsters under the never-blinking eye of the potentate on the Potomac.

19149,Obama May Create Monument to Gay Rights Movement - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The White House is considering the creation of a national monument to the gay rights movement on a small piece of Greenwich Village parkland across the street from the Stonewall Inn, where a 1969 uprising helped inspire the push for equality, advocates said on Tuesday. The interior secretary, Sally Jewell, and other federal officials are scheduled to attend a listening session next week in New York, during which supporters of such a park will make their case. The advocates include Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand and Representative Jerrold Nadler, both Democrats from New York. “We are excited about this, and we do think that the president should move forward on it,” said Kristen Brengel, the vice president for government affairs at the National Parks Conservation Association. The scheduled meeting was reported by The Washington Post. Robert Atterbury, a spokesman for Mr. Nadler’s office, said the National Park Service has completed a “reconnaissance survey” on the Greenwich Village land, known as Christopher Park, a routine step before making any recommendation to the president. White House officials said no decision had been made. President Obama has the power to create national monuments, as he has done repeatedly during his two terms. The push to create a national park or monument near the Stonewall Inn is intended to recognize the protests that erupted at the Manhattan bar after the police raided it in summer 1969. Those spontaneous protests by primarily gay men who frequented the bar are viewed by many as the beginning of the modern gay rights movement (though historians have noted the movement began before Stonewall). The bar has been granted landmark status by the city, even as it continues to serve as a watering hole that caters not only to the area’s gay residents, but also to tourists from around the world, gay or straight. “Stonewall deserves to be remembered,” said Brian Sullivan, a former bartender at the tavern who returns almost daily. “When I started coming here, gay people were disowned by their families, so this is the place where we formed a new gay family of our own. ” Mr. Sullivan, 57, leaned against the bar’s   edifice as he recalled some of the history he had witnessed there, from harrowing police raids to resolute speeches by the drag queen Marsha P. Johnson. “This is the mecca it’s where it all started,” he said. Chad Walter, a market researcher who plays for the Stonewall billiards team, said he hoped a monument would strengthen the continuing gay rights movement. “People are still being discriminated against all across the country,” Mr. Walter, 39, said. “This adds legitimacy it tells people that even the government agrees this movement is important and historic. ” Advocates of creating a national park near the Stonewall Inn have been working to build support for years. They are hoping that members of the public will turn out at the meeting next week to encourage Mr. Obama to act before he leaves office in January. The Parks Conservation Association has collected about 20, 000 signatures on petitions that have been sent to the White House. But even as advocates are urging the president to act, New York lawmakers  —   led by Ms. Gillibrand and Mr. Nadler  —   are trying to build support for legislation that could create the national park if the president chooses not to. Marc Brumer, a spokesman for Ms. Gillibrand, said they were making “good progress” on the legislation, which he said had recently picked up support from Senator Mark S. Kirk, Republican of Illinois. “Whether it’s the right to marry the person you love, or the repeal of ‘don’t ask, don’t tell,’ we’ve come so far in the push for equal rights,” Ms. Gillibrand said in a statement. “It’s past due for a national monument honoring the legacy and events that took place at Stonewall and the L. G. B. T. rights movement in our country. ”",0
19150,"Rape Hoaxer Drops Charges Against Trump, No Comment from Lawyer","
A woman who accused Donald Trump of repeatedly raping her two decades ago when she was a 13-year-old aspiring teen model has again dropped a federal lawsuit over the alleged assaults.
The accuser, identified in the lawsuit by the pseudonym “Jane Doe,” was expected to appear at a news conference in Los Angeles Wednesday, but that appearance was abruptly canceled.
The lawyer who organized the event, Lisa Bloom, said Trump’s accuser had received threats and was too frightened to show up.
The accuser’s lead attorney, Thomas Meagher of New Jersey, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. He filed a one-page notice dismissing the case Friday evening in federal court in Manhattan. No explanation was given for the action.
Bloom did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday.
Through his attorney, Trump had flatly denied the woman’s allegations.
There was plenty of speculation — and skepticism — from social media users about the validity of the charges.
Hillary Clinton’s niece came out for TRUMP because ‘selfish’ aunt wants to win for all the wrong reasons.

19152,Frank Gaffney: Trump Will Target ‘Beachheads of Terrorism’ and Infrastructure of Islamic Radicalization,"Center for Security Policy President Frank Gaffney said he thought President Trump handled his address to Congress “overall terrifically” on Wednesday morning’s Breitbart News Daily. [Gaffney said:  If I could just make one sort of overarching observation, it seemed to me, as it’s being noted by a lot of people, this was a very presidential address. Which, I think, came as a surprise to some. It was also a very principled address, and the real message here is, they were his principles. He was not abandoning the beliefs and the promises and the policies that he had laid out up to this point. I think it’s fair to say he packaged them brilliantly, and I think that’s especially true in the national security space. The main themes of that were easy to recognize: sovereignty, and a commitment to   a principle that he’s referred to, as had my old boss Ronald Reagan, as ‘peace through strength.’ Rebuilding our national security, and protecting our people, and building that great, great wall, and dealing with the threats that are internal to our country  —   whether it’s drug traffickers, or gangs, or violent illegal aliens of other stripes, or the people who are trying to create beachheads of terrorism. I think that is, if not an explicit reference, then certainly a code for the Muslim Brotherhood. After SiriusXM host Alex Marlow played a clip of Trump delivering the remarks in question, Gaffney said he thought the president was properly concerned with “people coming here from elsewhere, imbued with a different value system than we have  —   and I think specifically what that suggests is an appropriate concern about what I think is best described as sharia supremacism. ” Gaffney defined sharia supremacism as “a value system that says it’s not the U. S. Constitution and the freedoms it guarantees that should govern our people, it is sharia: a totalitarian, brutally repressive doctrine that the Islamic world has long sought to impose  —   not all but a lot of it. ” “It’s not just the people who come here to do the violence, it’s the infrastructure that they can tap into, whether it’s mosques and madrassas or influence operations, front groups, Islamic societies, Islamic cultural centers. That’s of concern as well, and I think he’s absolutely right, and it is such a refreshing thing to have him talking about it,” he said. He also praised Trump for focusing on “what he calls radical Islamic terrorism. ” “Reports that advisers, that others in his administration don’t agree with that term notwithstanding, he’s   about it, and he’s going to try to take it down,” Gaffney said. Marlow said it was “incredible” to hear a president use the phrase “radical Islamic terrorism,” and doubted Hillary Clinton would have been able to say it. “It wasn’t said at all in the administration in which she served, the Obama administration,” Gaffney observed. “And frankly, it wasn’t possible to say it in the George W. Bush administration. It’s been 16 years getting this right, and I think it’s a huge step forward. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern.

19153,Integration Expert Warns: ’Globalist’ Le Pen Rival Is ’Dangerous’,"“Multicultural” establishment candidate Emmanuel Macron endangers France, and “sorcerers of globalism” have put the West in a state of decay warns engineer, writer, and integration expert Malika  . [Noting that Germany received more than a million migrants in 2015 alone, the Algerian engineer and writer highlighted how former investment banker Macron “travelled to Berlin to pay tribute to Angela Merkel’s welcome policy” and warns Macron’s approach to migration is “dangerous”.  Drawing attention to the globalist   president’s declaration that “there is no French culture” in her interview with Le Figaro   said he also has a “blind spot” with regards to integration policies. The engineer, who was a member of France’s High Council of Integration, went on to contend there is “hardly any” common ground between Macron and his   rival, Francois Fillon. “For one, French culture does not exist, when the other is part of a desire to continue France from a cultural point of view,” the author of Decaying France told the broadsheet newspaper. “[Macron has] repeatedly made clear the fact his line on these issues is globalist and multicultural, and so his positioning on migratory flows and French culture is coherent. “[He sees France] as a country with open doors and windows, under the reign of a ‘buffet culture’ under which everyone places his and her dishes on the table and people only take what suits them. ”   also drew attention to remarks in which Macron described France’s colonisation of Algeria as a “crime against humanity” writing that the   president’s objective was to “seduce” voters of North African descent. But, noting the accusation “is likely to pit different groups against each other” she warns: “[The comments were] extremely serious at a time when France is at war, targeted by terrorists who justify their acts with what [the nation] is and what it has been. ”   said Macron represents a continuation of the ‘Terra Nova’ strategy on the left, referencing the “progressive” think tank whose name has become synonymous with a strategy in which minorities are encouraged to band together to fight against “an electorate that defends against change”. Last year, Wikileaks revealed Macron, a former Rothschild banker, was working on an alliance with Hillary Clinton before her shock defeat in the U. S. presidential election. The globalist candidate had requested the Democratic presidential candidate’s presence at a private roundtable dinner in October with several European politicians, according to an email published by Wikileaks. Breitbart London reported Macron announced the world has entered an age of mass migration which will be inescapable for Europe. “We have entered a world of great migrations and we will have more and more of it [migration]” he declared during a debate on climate change. And earlier this month, maintaining that the mass migration of people from the third world to Europe will only accelerate, the establishment favourite to win the election said immigrants are good for France and bring “fresh bursts of creativity and innovation” to society.",0
19154,Baseball’s Too Slow. Here’s How You Fix It. - The New York Times,"Major League Baseball officials are finally addressing something that many fans have complained about for years: the length of games. The average game last season took three hours. Playoff games are even more trying, now often stretching beyond three and a half hours. So what should be done? We invited our reporters and readers to submit proposals. Here’s a selection (add your ideas in the comments section): Major League Baseball wants more action and less downtime during games. That’s probably asking too much, because hitters are paid to work deep counts while pitchers throw harder, with better movement, than ever before. It’s no accident that the number of strikeouts rises every year. The larger issue, of course, is expanding the business, which means attracting more fans. And baseball won’t touch the biggest impediments to that effort, because it would mean less money now. Want to make the game move more quickly? Cut every commercial break by 30 seconds. Want more people to watch in the postseason? Insist that Fox show the League Championship Series on its regular network, not on the    Fox Sports 1. This is most important: Make the World Series appointment viewing, as it was a generation ago. October will mark the 30th anniversary of the last World Series game held in the afternoon. If you want to appeal to young fans in all areas of the country, let them watch at least one World Series game every year before bedtime. They’ll repay that   gesture when they grow up, if baseball can wait that long for the payoff.  —   TYLER KEPNER Boredom is the whole point of baseball, an antidote to the accelerated hysteria of modern life. But if you want to speed it up, why not make the experience as unpleasant as possible, as they do in English soccer games? Make the fans enter through tiny turnstiles surrounded by armed police officers. Make the seats really uncomfortable and humiliate anyone who leaves in the middle of play to get food or go to the bathroom. Encourage people to shout abuses at one another and to chuck garbage onto the field. No kiss cams. No   stretch. You want to sing “Take Me Out to the Ball Game,” or, worse, “Sweet Caroline”? Do it on your own time. Anyone who attempts to propose to his or her partner via the Jumbotron will be ejected from the game and banned for life. As for the players: No relaxing. No chatting. No being nice to your opponents. No doing that thing where you waste time knocking the dirt out of your shoes with your bat for good luck, or whatever. You’re hit by a   your   from an open wound? Suck it up. Cap the games at five innings. Make sure at least 75 percent of the crowd is in a vile temper by the end of the game. If the score is tied, the winner should be determined by penalty kicks.  —   SARAH LYALL Ban all mound visits except when using one of three allotted timeouts per game. Imagine a basketball player has just entered the action. The buzzer sounds and she walks onto the court. But before play resumes, the coach strolls to midcourt to discuss strategy with her. A preposterous idea, of course, but that happens in baseball every time there is a pitching change, and often when there is not. The relief pitcher was just sitting in the bullpen spitting sunflower seeds for the last two hours with a telephone hookup to the dugout five feet away. Talk to him before he goes in. Now, picture a soccer goalie halting play to walk 30 yards upfield and chat about tactics with a teammate. Everyone waits until the discussion ends and play resumes. But two minutes later the goalie stops play again to walk upfield again and talk to the same teammate, and never has to ask for a timeout. That’s what catchers do with regularity. But there is no need for it. They have signs. If they can’t keep the signs straight, then practice more. That should be on them, and not on the fans who suffer through the endless mound visits.  —   DAVID WALDSTEIN O the interminable glory of  ! O the joyous expectation that, for the willing surrender of a mere coin, we might see a match between the respective nines of New York and Chicago that could last to the End of Days! Imagine: Our sainted Christy Mathewson, “the Christian Gentleman,” twirling against those shifty   triplets, Tinker and Evers and Chance  —   forever. Be still my sclerotic heart. Alas, this cannot be. Our children have been raised without proper discipline (I, for one, am grateful to my dear pater for having once tied me to a tree after my refusal to eat a tomato that mater had so lovingly stewed). As a result, our youth lack the necessary patience for   so eager are they to return to their wireless devices and motorcars and  . Now the august custodians of our national pastime are forced to consider changes to the game’s sacred text. To which I say: Bosh! Forgive me, dear readers of the female persuasion, for my coarse language. But this cannot stand. Your humble scribe suggests the following. Make the distracting billboards along the outfield walls smaller. Order dawdling batsmen to step into the box  —   like men!  —   or pay the consequences of a first pitch thrown in their absence. Prohibit the spitting, the tugging of nether regions and other unseemly habits that waste time and offend refined sensibilities. We must address these matters posthaste, before some contraption of illumination is invented that leads to this game of sunshine being played at night. Then all will be lost it truly will be the End of Days.  —   D. FRANCIS BARRY Part of baseball’s charm is the quirks: No two games are the same. But long ones can leave an unfavorable impression on at least some fans, so here are some ideas on how to shave off some time. First, instant replay needs refinement. The time it takes for a manager to signal for a review, or for the umpires to rule on a play, needs to be shortened. Second, games can turn painfully slow in September, when rosters expand from 25 players to as many as 40. With so many relievers suddenly at their disposal, managers start to change pitchers with every batter. But the game should not be played by one set of rules for five months and then a different set in the final month. Perhaps allow teams to choose up to, say, 28 active players per game in September, but not 38. Finally, a more radical idea: Cut down on television commercial breaks, especially when they are longer during national broadcasts. Keep the flow of the game constant, and make up for the lost revenue by putting advertisements on the jerseys, as they do in soccer and will next season in the N. B. A.  —   JAMES WAGNER Ban all   armor and padding on batters  —   it’s an unfair advantage and wastes thousands of minutes as straps are adjusted between pitches. Prohibit any hitter from leaving the batter’s box once an   commences, except for obvious, debilitating injury (feeling uncomfortable at the plate does not count). The penalty for stepping out: A strike is called. Do it twice in one  ? Take a seat  —   automatic strikeout. Institute a pitch clock and strictly enforce it (a ball is called if the time expires). Any pitcher going over the clock more than five times is ejected, as with fouling out of a basketball game. Stipulate in the umpires’ union contract that each ump gets a $500 bonus for every game that ends in less than 2 hours 40 minutes. The bonus is $1, 000 for games ending in under 2 hours 25 minutes, and the entire umping crew gets the next weekend off, with pay, for games lasting less than two hours.  —   BILL PENNINGTON Enough about the idiosyncratic habits that obviously slow the game down, but are also part of the game’s natural appeal and help build drama. My advice is to shorten the game. No, I mean, really shorten the game. Reduce it to seven innings from nine. Beyond the time saved, think of the benefits in eliminating two innings. Starting pitchers would throw far fewer pitches, needing to only go four innings to record a victory. The scourge of serious arm and shoulder injuries would very likely diminish. Not having to rely on   mediocrity before getting to the   studs would also quicken the pace of games. Many games might take between two and two and a half hours, or the time it takes to play most soccer and basketball games. Games starting at 7 in the evening would be over by 9:30, making it easier for fans on work and school nights. After the seventh inning, everyone could get up, stretch and go home.  —   HARVEY ARATON Baseball is timeless, and often endless: enduring truths my friends and I came to appreciate as Mets fans in the empty upper decks of Shea Stadium in the early 1980s. Whenever those terribly played games got too long, copious inhalation helped along our Zen appreciation. Ah, the color schemes.   …     My mind is clearer now. So I’ll acknowledge that I like pitch and innings clocks. If batters haven’t adjusted gloves and cups, it’s too late to start once they step into the batter’s box. I’d limit coaching trips to the mound. Otherwise, leave the beautiful game alone. I don’t expect I will convince Commissioner Rob Manfred to put a sock in it. He is that neighbor puttering around his garage, tinkering with an old lawn mower. So here’s a thought: Forget putting a greased pig of a runner at second base in extra innings, and instead call the owners and general managers and urge them to hire blacks and Latinos and women. He’ll feel virtuous and his deeply white and male sport will benefit.  —   MICHAEL POWELL Enough of these suggested baby steps and timid tweaks to make baseball games shorter. It’s like trying to make a marathon markedly shorter by making it 26 miles, instead of 26. 2. Thanks for nothing. What baseball needs are a few spectacular changes to make it not only faster, but also more appealing to young fans whose attention spans have melted into the abyss of their iPads. Let’s get rid of the fourth ball, too. Let’s use a chain saw instead of a scalpel and say three strikes, three balls. Also, there should be no more free passes in this new world of speed baseball. Every foul ball would be counted as a strike. Make those changes, and the marathon becomes not much more than a 10K, just with hot dogs and beer, of course.  —   JULIET MACUR People keep looking for innovative ways to speed up the game, but baseball was played briskly for 100 years, so looking to the past may offer more answers. Specifically, we could look to April 16, 1993, when Mark Hirschbeck, a veteran umpire, decided there was someplace he would rather be than standing behind a catcher in San Francisco’s notoriously chilly Candlestick Park. With two outs in the ninth inning and one strike against him, Atlanta’s Ron Gant called for time and stepped out of the batter’s box. Unfortunately for Gant, Hirschbeck did not honor the request. Gant defiantly strode away from the plate and Hirschbeck, who perhaps had movie tickets or a late dinner engagement, ordered Rod Beck to start pitching. The Giants’ closer was happy to oblige, firing in another strike as Gant frantically raced back to the plate. There were plenty of words exchanged, but Beck ultimately retired Gant on a   to preserve a   victory. Laugh all you want about the thought of pitchers letting things rip regardless of whether the batter is in the box, but that game was over in 2 hours 16 minutes, and Gant probably thought twice for the rest of his career about calling a timeout.  —   BENJAMIN HOFFMAN I don’t want less baseball. I want less nonbaseball. Stepping out of the batter’s box to call a timeout, peer vaguely down the   line or scratch or adjust oneself is not baseball. Stay in the box. Pitchers aren’t blameless, either. Fondling the rosin bag or chatting with your catcher is not baseball. Pitch the ball. A visit to the mound? Let’s not. If you want to make a pitching change, just sound an air horn or something, have the pitcher leave the mound and have the new one come in. And he gets three   pitches, not eight. Come on, you’ve done this before! Vigilant and rigorous eradication of nonbaseball will give us the same dose of baseball in far less time.  —   VICTOR MATHER Several of our readers defended the game and its slow pace, claiming that the problem lay with the attention span of today’s viewers. Here are some of the best comments: Fix baseball? Fix baseball? I’ve got news for you. Baseball doesn’t need fixing! It is just about perfect the way it is. Oh, you in a hurry? Need to get back to the office? Well, then you don’t belong at a baseball game. What are you? From the MTV generation? Shorten the game? Please. You don’t go to a baseball game because you’re in a hurry. You go to a baseball game to relax and watch how it all unfolds. One of the great things about baseball is that there is no clock. You get to chill out, have a conversation or two, and take what amounts to a  . The game doesn’t need shortening and those who think it does need to go to a basketball game. Or a football game. Or any other sport with a clock, so you can make sure not to miss your dental appointment. Now, leave it alone!   —   Bill Leeman, San Rafael, Calif. **** As a practicing Buddhist, I try to live in the present moment at every moment. A slow baseball game allows me the opportunity to meditate between pitches, compose my soul with the personnel changes on the field, calm my feelings with foul balls and intentional walks, and generally muse about life, its vicissitudes and joys, throughout a   game. And how I miss the doubleheaders! May I suggest therapy for those sorry, frantic fans who have lost touch with their inner selves? Go to England and watch a cricket Test match. Go to Norway and watch their “Slow TV. ” Life is short. The calmer you are, the slower things are, the more life you have. Don’t fix baseball, FIX YOUR SOULS! Breathe!  —   David Glidden **** Why does baseball need fixing? Baseball isn’t checkers, it’s chess! It feasts on strategy. The visits to the mound the stepping out of the box the examination of the ball, the     tosses  —   all of it gives us the chance to restart our thoughts about how the next half inning is going to play out. The pitcher’s toss to hold a man on base provides an opportunity for something exciting to happen that can change the game. The same is true for throwing four intentional balls from the mound to the catcher. One of those pitches can go astray, or possibly be close enough to the strike zone to allow a batter to swing  —   and hit the ball to an unprepared second baseman or left fielder or whomever. Baseball is a great game the way it started. Get rid of the d. h.! That was the biggest mistake  —   and took all the fun out of the American League. Otherwise, LEAVE BASEBALL ALONE! Not every game needs to be played for television viewing.  —   Barbara Ames, Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. The majority of our respondents agreed that baseball was too slow and offered  their opinions on how to fix it. Here is a selection from the submissions we received: If you accept that the problem with M. L. B. is that it moves too slowly and that the exciting moments are too few and far between, and that it takes too long to play, then I would fix it by borrowing from other versions of the game and other leagues: 1. Shorten the game to seven innings (like various youth and scholastic leagues) 2. Start hitters with a   count (like some recreational softball leagues) 3. Allow players to “foul out” with a   count (like some recreational softball leagues) 4. Move the fences in (similar to the N. H. L. effectively making goals bigger by making goalie pads smaller) to have even more home runs, and 5. Reduce the number of players on the field (like the N. H. L. ’s    overtime) to create more space for base hits.  —   Jacob Ritvo, Palo Alto, Calif. **** Fewer commercial breaks. I feel like this is easily the worst addition to baseball games and the worst contributor to wasted time and the No. 1 reason why I don’t watch baseball on TV and don’t love going to more than a few games a year. Commercials add another 45 minutes to an hour to a game! Alas, I feel that even if changes are made to the rules, nothing will change about ridiculous advertising time and thus games will still stay the same length. I’m there to watch baseball. That is why I bought a ticket  —   to view a live sporting event. I did not purchase a ticket to wait around for a commercial break on TV. And shorten pitcher changes and make the pitchers and batters go faster.  —   Mattie Vukmir, San Francisco **** Outlaw batting gloves, which slow down the game because of the ritualistic ripping and repositioning of the Velcro on them. They don’t loosen up that fast, dudes! This is also associated with the batters stepping out of the box after every pitch, a practice that should be prevented.  —   Gabriella Howard, Augusta, Me. **** Start every inning with a man at second base. Have that man be Bartolo Colon.  —   Howard Cole, Los Angeles **** You know how fans boo every time a pitcher throws over to first base in a halfhearted attempt to pick off a runner? Limit the number of times a pitcher can do that in any given   with a runner on first or third base. Say, the pitcher can attempt a pickoff throw twice, but then must throw home. If a runner is stealing second, the catcher has the better vision and ability to throw him out than the pitcher does, and if he’s stealing home, well   …     he’s probably not Jackie Robinson.  —   Max Rettig, New York **** After 11 innings, the home team can send up their best slugger (even if he was in the game and taken out). The visiting team can send out the pitcher of their choice for a   home run derby. If the home team hits a home run, they win the game. If they don’t, the visiting team wins the game.  —   Robert Azar, Brooklyn **** Every time there’s a pause in the game (a manager’s visit to the mound, a catcher’s visit to the mound, replay review, etc.) that’s long enough, the stadium plays music, and all players on the field not involved in the specifics of the incident must dance. I figure this will either result in fewer pauses because players don’t want to dance, or will make the pauses much more entertaining.  —   Rebecca Thorsness, Providence, R. I. **** Abolish the abominable   rule in the majors and minors.  —   Nelson Hernandez, Austin, Tex. **** How is it that a baseball game used to take two hours to complete and now can take up to four hours? The easy answer is to blame the players. And certainly they deserve some of it. But I believe that before commercial TV got involved, the time between innings was a lot shorter than it is now. With 17 changeovers in a full   game, that really lengthens a game. Of course, there is no such thing as a complete game for a pitcher anymore, and managers are prone to add to commercial timeouts with three pitching changes for each team. But before we add a clock on the players, let’s think about putting the clock on those who are off the field  —   managers and TV broadcasters.  —   Jeff Byron, Los Altos, Calif. **** If no one is on base, let the batter run in either direction  —   i. e. to first base or third. All batters and runners who follow have to go in the same direction until the bases are empty. This will bring an element of suspense and interest to the game.  —   Mark Flannery, Fullerton, Calif. **** To improve offense, eliminate radical shifts by fixing the locations of fielders within zones until the ball reaches the plate. Inspect   photos so the zones match what Ted Williams faced in 1941. Violations are errors.  —   Robert LaRose, Taiwan **** Relegation! Adopt the global soccer system of sending down the worst teams and bringing up the best from the level right below. This would inspire   teams to compete with the larger markets rather than muddle along for decades in third or fourth place. In addition, it would bring pro baseball to smaller markets and give those cities a taste of major league talent.  —   Kurt Gardner, Brooklyn **** Some of us like watching professional soccer in part because we know it will be a   game. You can count on it. Not so with M. L. B. Isn’t it ironic (moronic?) that M. L. B. officials are quoted as saying that they can’t shorten the breaks between innings because of the ad revenue that would be lost. So if I understand this, they’d rather have the dollars than the fans. What a strategy. How about this strategy  —   put the customers first by shortening the game, and that in turn would increase viewership and attendance and eventually maybe even increase revenues.  . This should be all about improving the customer experience. Once you do that, the data shows, you increase your revenues.  —   Dennis Stern, Lyme, N. H. **** Award multiple runs for gigantic home runs, much as the basketball   shot. This wouldn’t speed up the game, but it would add some excitement.  —   Steven Sherwood, San Francisco **** What if the batting order were eliminated? What if a manager could send up a particular player to bat as many times as he wanted in a game in whatever order he wanted? A batter could even get up consecutive times if he didn’t reach base. Presumably the team’s best hitters would get up over and over  —   maybe the best six would only see   and the other players on the team would be defensive specialists.  —   Alan Stricoff **** Legalize the use of certain   drugs, to be monitored by medical professionals. The drugs to be legalized should focus on maintaining health and recovering from injury. Sure, we’d have to consider stats and records from prior eras as distinct from current player accomplishments. But today, it appears we are at the point where “  drugs” is almost synonymous with “medical advancement. ” These guys play a lot of baseball. Healthier, better players spread across the league would be great for the game. And, yeah, keep the hitters in the box between pitches, too. It’s ridiculous already.  —   Dan Davidow, New Jersey **** Baseball is the sport where superstars have the least impact at the most crucial times. In every other sport the star can hit the big shot, throw the touchdown pass or score the goal when it counts. Here is my idea, and it’s radical for sure. In the eighth or ninth inning, the team at bat, if losing or tied, can advance the batting order back to the top of the order (one time only). We need more offense. More excitement. Let the best players put the bat in their hands against the best relievers at the most important times.  —   Doug Tumen, Woodstock, N. Y. **** Basically, I have only one problem with baseball that stops me from viewing a game at certain times, and that’s while I’m eating. And that problem is SPITTING! SPITTING! SPITTING! I don’t enjoy watching grown men, nor anyone for that matter SPITTING! It’s not pleasant, it’s not cool as most players and   think it is and it’s certainly not  . TV producers have an affinity for showing it but it needs to stop.  —   William McGrady, Piscataway, N. J. **** Easy fix: have one lineup for offense and one for defense (like the N. F. L. ). M. L. B. will get more hitting, more base running, more scoring   …     more excitement!  —   Larry Sternbach, Marlboro, N. J. **** One sure (and radical) way to speed up the game would be to make ALL foul balls be strikes no matter the count. If there are two strikes on the batter and he fouls a pitch off, he’s out.  —   Paul Morrison, Boston **** The biggest improvement M. L. B. could make is to institute an electronic strike zone. Aside from providing ultimate consistency and fairness to both pitchers and batters (and fans) the electronic strike zone would eliminate the hidden,   gamesmanship practiced by pitchers, batters, catchers and bench jockeys as they try to influence the umpires’ calls. Statisticians at Stanford have determined that   umpires are biased by game situations when calling balls and strikes (the same   pitch with the bases loaded is more likely to be called a strike than ball four).  —   Andreas Lord, Brookline, Mass. **** Why don’t we enforce the rules that already exist? Batters are supposed to stay in the box, and mound visits are limited to 30 seconds. The umps and baseball need to actually, and consistently, enforce this. What’s the point of the rule if no one pays attention to it?  —   Erika Crawford, Washington **** 10 contemplated rule changes for 2017 that would revolutionize the sport (time saved is per game): 1. After a home run is hit, the batter just touches home plate without running the bases. Average time saved: 98 seconds. 2. A pitcher gets one free strike per inning. Thus, a     count with the bases loaded and two outs becomes an inning ending   with a wave of the hand. Average time saved: 21 minutes. 3. If a team is ahead by more than four runs in the seventh inning or beyond, they forfeit their right to bat. Average time saved: 36 minutes. 4. One batter on the opposing team can be designated as ineligible for any game. The same player cannot be chosen more than once per series. Average time saved: 38 minutes. 5. The third inning, and any extra inning, is three balls and two strikes instead of four and three. Average time saved: 39 minutes. 6. Managers are eliminated. Average time saved: 56 minutes. 7. Home teams get to call games two hours after the first pitch is thrown. The dilemma is the team must make this choice before the game starts. Average time saved: 58 minutes. 8. One fan, coming to the park with two screaming children, is chosen to decide when he has had enough and wants to leave. At that point, everyone, including the players, has to go home. Average time saved: 78 minutes. 9. There can be only one pitching change per inning, and none in the second, fifth and eighth innings. If a game lasts more than 10 innings, the opposing squad gets to designate the pitcher( s) for the 11th and 12th innings. Average time saved: 81 minutes. 10. The season is reduced to 12 games. Average time saved: infinity, as baseball dies.  —   Robert Nussbaum, Fort Lee, N. J. **** Limit visits to the mound by players and coaches a team must use them the same way football, basketball, hockey teams use timeouts. A batter must always have one foot in the batter’s box. Batters must learn to stop fidgeting around they are professionals, not    kids. Shortstop and third baseman must be on the   side of second base, second basemen and first basemen must be on the   side of second base. Outfielders must stay in the outfield. This is before the pitch. Anything else is an illegal defense. Learn from basketball. This has nothing to do with the speed of the game but make “high socks” fashionable.  —   Vincent, Encinitas, Calif. **** Require all M. L. B. teams to designate a certain number of games (one per month, say) as “Youth Games. ” In a Youth Game, all tickets  —   and at least certain concessions  —   purchased by someone under a certain age (say, 16) would be STEEPLY discounted  —   say, by 90 percent or so. And, ALL tickets should be set aside for those games, so a box seat that might normally go for $150 would be only $15 and $20   seats would be $2. Teams might also consider ways to subsidize transportation to those games.  —   Ken Landau, Overland Park, Kan. **** One free pickoff attempt per   after that, each pickoff attempt counts as a ball. This will speed up the game and increase excitement with more stolen bases and runs.  —   Rick Dorfman, Boca Raton, Fla. **** Nine innings, nine positions. The players rotate one position each inning, as in volleyball. Players would be better rounded and the disproportionate importance of pitchers would disappear. Then I would watch it with interest.  —   Tom Jones, Boulder, Colo. **** Drop the fourth inning. Nothing ever happens in the fourth so just go from the third to the fifth. You would still have the ninth inning, and we would be there at least 20 minutes sooner.  —   John Connolly, Rockville Centre, N. Y. **** We were a little surprised at how passionate people were about this subject and how much thought they put into it  —   we received nearly 3, 000 submissions. If you would like to see some more ideas about how to fix the game, or why it should be left alone, we’ve published the best of the rest. ",0
19155,Weiner’s Teen Victim Just Called Out Comey For Politicizing Her Abuse,"Comments 
The teenager whose explosive allegations led to a federal investigation against disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner has published an open letter about victim’s rights, and her utter betrayal by FBI Director James Comey’s partisan memo that is so heart wrenching, that it must be shared and read by every single law enforcement officer in the country, if not the world. 
This entire weekend, intense media coverage has focused on one woman – Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton – most observers believe was wronged by Comey’s intentionally vague memo. All the while, the woman most harmed by FBI Director Comey’s partisan attack has been suffering in silent agony, victimized first by her abuser and then by the men with badges. 
FBI agents claimed that they spoke with her to seek justice, only for Comey to turn around and betray her, to victimize her yet again, by thrusting her story into the white heat of the last week in a bitterly contested general election campaign’s final media feeding frenzy with one vaguely worded memo guaranteed to draw maximum questioning by the press. 
The anonymous teen who only went to the FBI under the promise of anonymity and was grilled by agents for seven hours just last Friday. Only minutes after ending that interrogation, she was contacted by journalists who knew her identity only minutes after ending the discussions with the federal law enforcement officers. 
Clearly, her identity was somehow no longer a secret. The media contacted the teen victim and her family before even the FBI case manager let her know about Comey’s memo, and it all happened before she could escape the public eye to safeguard her privacy. So she wrote this letter and delivered it to a national entertainment website : 
I am the 15-year-old (now 16) who was the victim of Anthony Weiner. I now add you to the list of people who have victimized me. I told my story originally to protect other young girls that might be a victim of online predators. 
Your letter to Congress has now brought this whole matter back into the media spotlight. Not even 10 minutes after being forensically interviewed with the FBI for seven hours, I received a phone call from a REPORTER asking for a statement. Why didn’t you communicate with the local FBI agents that I had just spoken to? They could have scheduled our interview sooner or scheduled a time to interview me later, or change locations of the interview. My neighborhood has been canvassed by reporters asking for details about me. 
In your letter, you chose to use a vague approach, meaning the media had to keep searching to try and find out what evidence you had uncovered and how. Every media outlet from local to national has contacted me and my family to get my “story.” Why couldn’t your letter have waited until after the election, so I would not have to be the center of attention the last week of the election cycle? 
In his “cooperation” with you and with his love of the spotlight, Anthony Weiner has given information that led to the media finding me. You have assisted him in further victimizing me on every news outlet. I can only assume that you saw an opportunity for political propaganda. 
I thought your job as FBI Director was to protect me. I thought if I cooperated with your investigation, my identity as a minor would be kept secret. That is no longer the case. My family and I are barraged by reporters’ phone calls and emails. I have been even been blamed in a newspaper for causing Donald Trump to now be leading in some polls and costing Hillary the election. 
Anthony Weiner is the abuser. Your letter helped that abuse to continue. How can I rebuild my life when you have made finding out my “story” the goal of every reporter? When I meet with my therapist next time, she will already know what we are going to talk about before I get there by reading Friday, October 28th, 2016’s New York Times article. 
I may have been Weiner’s victim, but the real story here is that I am a survivor. I am strong, intelligent, and certain that I will come out from under this nightmare, but it will not be as a result of your doing your job to protect me. I hope that by making my letter to you public, you will think about how your actions affect the victims of the crimes you are investigating. The election is important, yes, but what happened to me and how it makes me feel and how others see me, is much more important. It’s time that the FBI Director puts his victims’ rights above political views. 
— Girl that lost her faith in America 
P.S. To all reporters: AP, FOX, CBS, NBC, and all other media outlets, please respect my position and stop interrupting my life! 
It’s impossible to read this letter without tears for the teenage girl who was victimized by Anthony Wiener, and bravely stepped forward to alert the authorities so they could stop a sad sex predator so mentally ill, that after his out of control actions cost him his career and his public image, he continued his behavior until he lost his marriage and perhaps next his freedom for the safety of others. 
Instead, the very authorities at the FBI who pledged to maintain her anonymity and seek justice for her, and to prevent she, and others from facing the same ills, have turned into a political party with badges – and not a very well coordinated group of people with badges either. 
Our nation needs leaders who place their duty above partisan politics, and in law enforcement we need cops on the beat to protect the victims, not to abuse the victims for their own partisan games. 
Our nation needs for FBI Director James Comey to admit his mistakes and vacate his position, before the next victim of crime gets victimized by his unsavory political maneuvering using the country’s top law enforcement agency to slander someone else into political compliance.",0
19156,SORRY LIBERALS…You Can Stop With The Petitions…Hillary Did NOT Win The Popular Vote,"Go to Article Dear Abby, I supported a woman I knew had a history of criminal activity, who is married to a rapist and who left 4 men to die in Benghazi. She put our national security at grave risk by leaving top classified emails on her private server, and she took money from nations who throw gays off rooftops and treat women worse than cockroaches. She is likely very sick and would be unlikely to serve out her first term without someone there to prop her up, but nevertheless, I supported her anyhow, because she’s a Democrat and has a vagina. Someone told me she still has a chance of winning the presidency if I just signed a petition. They said that Trump really didn’t win, because Hillary won the popular vote. Is that true? 
Okay, let’s address this “Hillary might win the popular vote, isn’t that Electoral College situation just awful” thing head on. 
No, it’s not awful. It’s great, and it protects the importance of your vote. It’s also uniquely American and demonstrates yet again the once-in-creation brilliance of the Founding Fathers. 
First of all, she’s probably not going to win the actual number of votes cast. She may win the number of votes counted, but not the votes cast. 
States don’t count their absentee ballots unless the number of outstanding absentee ballots is larger than the state margin of difference. If there is a margin of 1,000 votes counted and there are 1,300 absentee ballots outstanding, then the state tabulates those. If the number of outstanding absentee ballots wouldn’t influence the election results, then the absentee ballots aren’t counted. 
Who votes by absentee ballot? Students overseas, the military, businesspeople on trips, etc. The historical breakout for absentee ballots is about 67-33% Republican. In 2000, when Al Gore “won” the popular vote nationally by 500,000 votes and the liberal media screamed bloody murder, there were 2 million absentee ballots in California alone. A 67-33 breakout of those yields a 1.33- to 0.667-million Republican vote advantage, so Bush would have gotten a 667,000-vote margin from California’s uncounted absentee ballots alone! So much for Gore’s 500,000 popular vote “victory.” (That was the headline on the N.Y. Times, and it was the lead story on NBC Nightly News, right? No? You’re kidding.) 
Getting back to the “win the popular vote/lose the Electoral College” scenario: Thank G-d we have that, or else California and N.Y. would determine every election. Every time. 
But the Electoral College brilliantly smooths out the variances in the voting proclivities among states and regions. Farmers in the middle of the country and importers and exporters on the shore get roughly equal say, as do Madison Ave. execs and factory workers in Tennessee. 
Shortcomings? Sure. The E.C. can make an R vote meaningless in a very few heavily D states or vice versa. But without the Electoral College, the country’s entire population is subject to the disproportionate voting preferences of the few most populous states. – American Thinker Comment on this Article Via Your Facebook Account Comment on this Article Via Your Disqus Account Follow Us on Facebook!",0
19159,"Protesters, Police Still Clashing Over Disputed North Dakota Pipeline","Protesters, Police Still Clashing Over Disputed North Dakota Pipeline 11/03/2016 
NPR 
Police used pepper spray and what they called nonlethal ammunition to remove Dakota Access Pipeline protesters from federal land Wednesday. Demonstrators say they were trying to occupy land just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation where construction of the controversial pipeline is scheduled. 
This was the first significant clash between law enforcement and protesters since demonstrations turned violent last week and more than 100 people were arrested. 
According to the Morton County, N.D., Sheriff’s Department, a group of people began building a wood pedestrian bridge across a creek north of the main protest camp early Wednesday morning. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers owns the land and had asked law enforcement to remove any protesters who try to reach it. 
Officers in boats pulled the makeshift bridge apart and warned protesters they would be arrested if they continued to trespass. After a several-hour standoff with police, protesters dispersed and returned to their main camp. 
During the standoff, a few protesters watched from across the nearby Cannonball River. They waded into the water — some chest-deep — to shout support for colleagues closer to officers. 
“I decided to get into the river and just be a presence there,” says Stephanie Jasper of Tampa Bay, Fla. She watched as law enforcement pushed protesters back toward the main camp, and says she saw officers use pepper spray. She says it was a chaotic sight as a police helicopter hovered overhead. 
Several protesters standing in the river held mirrors directed at law enforcement officers lined up on the other side and at police on the river in boats. 
“Everybody was just sharing love to these officers and explaining why it is we’re here and questioning why they were,” says Jasper. 
One law enforcement official had a very different view of the protest. “In my 27 years in law enforcement, I have never seen such an absolute disregard for the law or other people’s rights because of someone else’s ideology,” said Cass County, N.D., Sheriff Paul Laney. 
The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe says the Dakota Access Pipeline construction route crosses land that is sacred to its members. And the tribe worries a pipeline spill could pollute local water. The tribe wants the federal government to stop work on the pipeline and conduct a full environmental impact study of the pipeline. 
The Morton County Sheriff’s Department says one person was arrested for “conspiracy to commit obstruction of a government function.” In a press release, the agency says the protester was buying canoes and kayaks for others to cross the creek.",0
19160,Bill Clinton`s long-time lover reveals how he called ruthless Hillary `The Warden’,"By wmw_admin on October 28, 2016 Alana Goodman — Daily Mail.com Oct 27, 2016 
Bill Clinton is a sex-addicted ‘monster’ who mocked Hillary Clinton by calling her ‘The Warden’ in front of friends and privately boasted about his high notch count, according to his long-time mistress and childhood friend Dolly Kyle. Dolly Kyle. Click to enlarge 
Kyle, now 68, says she had a decades-long affair with the former president before and during his marriage and had a front-row seat to Bill’s salacious double-life in the 1970s and ’80s. 
Their on-again, off-again relationship ended abruptly in the 1990s, after Bill Clinton allegedly threatened to ‘destroy’ Kyle if she spoke to the media about their relationship. 
Kyle’s decades of observations, shared in an interview with the DailyMail.com as well as in her 2016 book The Other Woman, provide a unique perspective on the Clintons’ marriage and the couple’s treatment of the women who have accused the former president of infidelity or sexual assault over the years. 
Kyle, an Arkansas native who has since befriended several of Bill Clinton’s sexual assault accusers, said she was determined to come forward with her story after hearing Hillary Clinton say on the campaign trail that women who have been sexually assaulted have the ‘right to be believed’. 
‘When [Hillary Clinton] said women who claim they are raped or sexually assaulted should be believed, we should support them, I thought “You lying dog hypocrite”,’ said Kyle. 
She said the Clintons’ attacks on her reputation – and alleged attacks on other women who had relationships with or were assaulted by Bill Clinton – show that Hillary Clinton is not a supporter of women or victims of sexual violence. 
Kyle said Bill Clinton threatened her over the phone in the early 1990s after she alerted him that a reporter had been asking her questions about their relationship. 
‘When I warned him about this story, which I had no intention of cooperating with, his threat to me was, “If you cooperate with the media, we will destroy you”,’ said Kyle. ‘Bam. I slammed the phone down. It rang immediately. Kept ringing, I didn’t answer it again.’ 
Kyle first met Clinton at a country club in Hot Springs, Arkansas, when she was 11 and he was just shy of his 13th birthday. She described it as a ‘thunderbolt’ of immediate attraction even then. 
The two became good friends and dated casually throughout high school, and later began a sexual affair in 1974 after Kyle and her first husband divorced. 
Their relationship spanned three decades, continuing through Bill Clinton’s marriage to Hillary and Kyle’s remarriage, and culminating in a dramatic confrontation at the lovers’ 35th high school reunion. Hillary Clinton admires Christine Aguilera’s breasts. Clinton is rumoured to be an active bisexual. Click to enlarge 
During this time, Kyle said Clinton often indicated that he was unhappy in his marriage – calling Hillary Clinton ‘The Warden’, admitting that he was a sex addict, and complaining to Kyle that his sex life was ‘over’ after he moved in with Hillary at Yale. 
During one secret rendezvous in 1979, Kyle said then-Governor Clinton confided to her that he was desperate to have a baby for political reasons. 
Kyle initially thought Bill wanted to have a baby with her, until he clarified that he wanted to have one with Hillary – hinting that he was concerned about political rumors that Hillary was a lesbian. 
‘I said, “Why do you want to have a baby? You don’t even have time, you’re so busy”,’ said Kyle. ‘He said [Hillary and I] have to have a baby so that we will look like a normal couple, and we need to take attention away from The Warden’s “lifestyle”.’ 
‘Now, he did not say Hillary is a lesbian,’ she added. ‘Billy didn’t have to spell out what that meant… Everybody in Little Rock knew the same rumors about Hillary being a lesbian as they did about Billy being a lech.’ 
One night in 1972 when Bill was visiting with Kyle in Arkansas, he told her he had moved in with a girl named Hillary and sadly added that he thought this would be the end of his sex life. 
`It was in 1972, before Billy and I were having our adult relationship, when he had moved in with Hillary,’ said Kyle. ‘He said, “I think my sex life is over”.’ 
Kyle said she first met Hillary Clinton two years later, when Bill brought his future wife to Hot Springs for his unsuccessful congressional race, and asked Kyle – who he was also dating at the time – to pick them up at the airport. 
Kyle said she was ‘shocked’ by Hillary’s unkempt appearance, poor hygiene and matronly clothes, and didn’t believe it was the same girl Bill had moved in with. 
‘I picked Billy up at the airport and he had this dowdy-looking middle-aged woman with him…this woman was Hillary,’ she said. ‘Hillary, I thought was a Hillary impersonator. Because she looked so bad and she smelled so bad I just didn’t believe this was Hillary. 
‘Seriously, I thought this was some kind of a joke Billy was playing on me.’ 
Hillary’s eyes, glared at her from behind ‘coke-bottle-thick lenses with an air of real hostility. Her thick eyebrows melded together stretching across her forehead. 
Finally the introduction: ‘Dolly, this is Hillary. Hillary, Dolly.’ 
‘I was stunned,’ Kyle recalled, thinking it was ‘some kind of a sick joke’– a woman in a hideous disguise. 
Kyle extended her hand but Hillary only glared and nodded. 
‘I couldn’t imagine why Billy would haul such a person in the plane with him in public. She was wearing a misshapen, brown, dress-like thing that must have been intended to hide her lumpy body. The garment was long, but stopped too soon to hide her fat ankles and her thick calves covered with black hair,’ Kyle said. 
But was Hillary’s smell that Kyle says she remembers most. 
‘In that moment I noticed that the woman emitted an overpowering odor of perspiration and greasy hair. I hoped that I wouldn’t gag when she got in my car,’ she said. ‘The sandal-shod woman with lank, smelly hair stood off to the side and glared at everyone.` 
`I vowed to myself not to drive off without the other woman, no matter how bad she smelled.’ 
After the meeting, Kyle said Hillary Clinton sent her father and her brother to Arkansas to ostensibly help with Bill’s campaign but also to keep tabs on his womanizing. 
At the time, Kyle said Bill was also dating a University of Arkansas co-ed named Marla Crider – and Hillary Clinton allegedly threw a fit when she found evidence of the fling. 
‘Hillary came swooping in from Washington to Fayetteville, went through Billy’s things, found little cards and notes, you know, the cutesy kind of things you do when you’re dating someone,’ said Kyle. ‘She shredded them. She shredded those documents…these were notes to him from Marla, these were things from Marla.’ 
Kyle said Hillary also ‘started calling [Marla] in the middle of the night, threatening her’. 
She speculated that part of the reason Hillary was so enraged was that Bill’s affair with Marla Crider undermined the public story about the Clintons’ early romance. 
‘They had this story about their romance at Yale law school. Billy even repeated it at the Democratic National Convention. Well what if people knew about Dolly Kyle and Gennifer Flowers and Marla Crider? It kind of ruins Hillary’s story,’ said Kyle. 
According to Kyle, Bill Clinton often used a derogatory nickname for Hillary when he was talking to his mistress or the security guards at the governor’s mansion. 
‘After the day Billy introduced me to Hillary…he never used her name again. He always called her ‘The Warden,’ said Kyle. ‘She was the person who was trying to keep control of him who was in charge of what he was doing.’ 
Kyle said this nickname fit with Hillary’s reputation in Arkansas, where she was often portrayed as a coarse northerner who disdained the traditional role of an Arkansas first lady. 
According to Kyle, there were constant stories about Hillary’s alleged temper. On the night Bill Clinton lost his congressional race in 1974, Hillary was allegedly overheard lashing out at a Jewish campaign staffer with an anti-Semitic slur. 
‘Apparently that night when Billy was losing, she went on one of her tirades to a guy named Paul,’ said Kyle. ‘People in the other room heard her call him an “f***ing Jew bastard”.’ 
In another incident from Bill Clinton’s term as governor, Hillary Clinton was tasked with hosting an annual Easter egg hunt at the governor’s mansion for special needs children. But, according to Kyle, Hillary allegedly became irritated by the slow pace of the event. Bill and Hillary Clinton at Yale in 1973 
‘Some of [the kids] were physically impaired some of them were mentally impaired. But [the governor’s staff] hid the eggs in plain sight and made it easier for these kids to find these eggs,’ said Kyle, whose close friend was involved in organizing the event. 
‘So during this hunt it was getting warm in Arkansas. Well, Hillary was getting tired of it, and the kids were moving slowly, so she goes stomping onto the veranda. She said ‘When are they gonna get those f-ing retards out of here?’ said Kyle. ‘Thankfully, and blessedly, the children were oblivious to it. Their parents were appalled.’ 
Kyle, who says she suffered from sex addiction for many years after she was raped as a teenager, recalled one candid conversation she had with Bill Clinton after she entered therapy. She said Clinton told her he was also a sex addict. 
‘I talked to Billy about that, and I went through the 25 questions we use to ask “Am I a sex addict?” It’s a self-diagnosed thing, like [Alcoholics Anonymous],’ said Kyle. ‘Billy and I went through the questions, and he said, “Oh my god. I’m a sex addict”.’ 
‘I don’t know if Hillary had the cognitive awareness that he was a sex addict. This is a problem that can be dealt with,’ Kyle added. 
At some point in the evening, I felt a hand on my arm and it was Billy. He says “How are you?” Condescending, patronizing, despicable. “How are you?” And I just turned around, and I just said “You are such an anatomical part, I can’t believe you’d bother to ask”,’ said Kyle. 
She said after a brief, heated exchange – during which a Secret Service agent tried to separate them – she finally agreed to sit down and talk to Bill Clinton in a quiet corner of the event. 
She told Clinton that she had no plans to talk to the press, but was going to put out a novel that alluded to their affair. 
She also told Clinton about a legal aid non-profit she had started in Dallas. The president told her to ‘come to Washington’, and allegedly promised to turn the organization into a project of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Kyle said she declined the offer. 
Clinton later denied having a sexual relationship with Kyle during a deposition for the Paula Jones sexual assault case 
Kyle said she was shocked to hear this, calling it ‘lie after lie’. She said just a short while before Bill’s testimony, his attorneys had tried to prevent her from testifying in the Paula Jones case by arguing that the two of them had a consensual sexual relationship and her testimony would not be relevant. 
‘What he did was perjury,’ said Kyle, who ended up testifying during the Jones case about Clinton’s alleged sex addiction. 
Although Kyle said she was appalled to hear the sexual assault allegations against Clinton, she said she absolutely believed them – even though Clinton was never violent to her during their relationship. 
‘Knowing he was a sex addict, it was easy for me to believe that. Easy for me intellectually to believe it. Very difficult emotionally,’ she said. ‘And that’s when I started realizing, the Billy Clinton I knew was not this monster he became.’ 
Kyle claimed she sees a double standard in how the media covers sexual assault allegations against Donald Trump and Bill Clinton. 
‘I’m sorry, I’m not saying [Trump] didn’t leer at some girl. I’m not saying he didn’t pat one on the fanny. I don’t know. I don’t know what all of those charges are,’ said Kyle. ‘But the media is focusing on that every single day while Billy Clinton raped a woman, and sexually assaulted god knows how many women.’ 
She said that since publishing her book earlier this year, she has been contacted by multiple women who have also had sexual run-ins with Clinton but do not want to go public. 
‘When I say, please come out and talk about this, they’re afraid,’ she said. ‘Because they know that the mainstream media if they get on this story, is just going to trash them. 
‘Some of them say, “I was 17 at the time, I was 18 or 19 years old”, or, “I haven’t told my husband about this”, or, “my children would be appalled”, or, “my grandchildren would be embarrassed”. So they don’t say anything.’",0
19161,"A Parable Of The Thanksgiving Turkey: He Never Saw It Coming: “A High-Impact, Hard-To-Predict Event”","
The Black Swan Theory is used by Nassim Nicholas Taleb to explain the existence and occurrence of high-impact, hard-to-predict, and rare events that are beyond the realm of normal expectations. One example often put forth by Taleb is the life and times of the Thanksgiving Turkey.
The turkey spends the majority of its life enjoying daily feedings from a caring farmer. Weeks go by, and it’s the same thing day-in-day-out for the Turkey. Free food. Open range grazing. Good times all around.
The thinking turkey may even surmise that the farmer has a vested interest in keeping the turkey alive. For the turkey, it is a symbiotic relationship. “The farmer feeds me and keeps me happy, and I keep the farmer happy,” says the turkey. “The farmer needs me, otherwise, why would he be taking care of me?”
This goes on for a 1,000 days.
Then, two days before Thanksgiving on Day 1,001, the farmer shows up again.
But this time he doesn’t come bearing food, but rather, he’s wielding an ax.
This is a black swan event — for the turkey.
By definition, it is a high-impact, hard-to-predict, and rare event for the turkey, who not only never saw it coming, but never even contemplated the possibility that it could occur.
For the farmer, on the other hand, this was not a black swan event. The farmer knew all along why he was feeding the turkey, and what the end result would be.
The very nature of black swan events make them almost impossible to predict. The point of this parable is to put forth the idea that sometimes we are the Thanksgiving turkey and understanding this may make it easier to begin to, at the very least, contemplate the possibility of far-from-equilibrium events.
This year, when you enjoy that drumstick or Turkey breast, give thanks to the latest victim of the black swan for being non-contemplative, otherwise, he may have bugged-out long ago and you’d be eating a chicken instead.

19162,Celebrities Line Up Hoping to Be Pardoned by Obama Before He Leaves Office,"Monday, 14 November 2016 Obama thinking about where he will live if Trump deports him. 
Washington, DC It has long been a tradition for U.S. Presidents leaving office to pardon people. President Clinton pardoned 140 in the last days of his office. 
Some of the celebrities requesting meetings with Obama, besides the obvious like O.J. Simpson and Phil Spector, are Jared Fogle, Sirhan Sirhan, Charles Manson, and Bernie Madoff. 
Probably the most bizarre was Bill Cosby. Legal staff members for Obama informed Cosby that Obama couldn't pardon Cosby because he hadn't been found guilty of anything yet. 
""What if I bibbly bob say I boo-hoosy DID put my doggone White Owly cigar in her Jello Pudding Popsy? Can I get a bipsy pipsy pardonski then?"" asked Cosby. 
Obama has not made any pardons yet because he has been gathering evidence he was born in the U.S. so he won't get deported once Trump is President. Make Al N.'s day - give this story five thumbs-up (there's no need to register , the thumbs are just down there!)",0
19163,Congressman Tells BBC: Charlotte Protesters ‘Hate White People’ - The New York Times,"A United States representative from North Carolina said in a television interview on Thursday that protesters in Charlotte “hate white people because white people are successful and they’re not,” and then hours later recanted and apologized. The representative, Robert Pittenger, a Republican whose district includes parts of Charlotte, was interviewed on a British Broadcasting Corporation show, BBC Newsnight, when he made the comment. In response to an interviewer’s question about the demonstrators’ grievance, Mr. Pittenger said: “The grievance in their mind is the animus, the anger. They hate white people because white people are successful and they’re not. I mean, yes, it is, it is a welfare state. We have spent trillions of dollars on welfare, and we’ve put people in bondage so they can’t be all that they are capable of being. ” The comment drew criticism on social media. Grier Martin, a Democrat who is a member of the North Carolina House of Representatives, on Twitter called the comment “one of the most ignorant statements I have ever heard. ” Within hours, Mr. Pittenger, 68, apologized and tried to explain himself in a series of posts on Twitter. He said his “anguish” about what was happening in Charlotte prompted him to respond to a question “in a way that I regret. ” He apologized and said he hoped “we can bring peace and calm to Charlotte. ” He added that he was trying to discuss a lack of economic mobility for   “because of failed policies. ” Mr. Pittenger appeared on CNN on Thursday night to defuse the criticism, but not all were convinced it was effective.",0
19164,Airbnb Adopts Rules to Fight Discrimination by Its Hosts - The New York Times,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   For much of this year, Airbnb has been under fire over the ease with which its hosts can reject potential renters based on race, age, gender or other factors. The barrage of criticism began with a Harvard University study, snowballed with firsthand accounts of discrimination from Airbnb guests and has prompted a lawsuit. Airbnb, the   rental website, has moved quickly to tamp down the controversy. It embarked on a    review of how discrimination might creep into the site. It hired prominent advisers, including former United States Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to help formulate   policies. And Brian Chesky, Airbnb’s chief executive, has repeatedly said that the company needed to do better in dealing with the issue. On Thursday, Airbnb took its most forceful actions yet to combat discrimination. It told its rental hosts that they needed to agree to a “community commitment” starting on Nov. 1 and that they must hew to a new nondiscrimination policy. The company also said that it would try to reduce the prominence of user photographs, which indicate race and gender, and that it would accelerate the use of instant bookings, which lets renters book places immediately without host approval. The moves were outlined in a   report that serves as a blueprint for how Airbnb plans to fight discrimination on the site. Among the other changes is a new     team of engineers, data scientists and researchers, whose job includes discerning patterns of host behavior. “Bias and discrimination have no place on Airbnb, and we have zero tolerance for them,” Mr. Chesky wrote in a message to Airbnb users and hosts that accompanied the report. “Unfortunately, we have been slow to address these problems, and for this I am sorry. ” Airbnb’s response is designed to quiet the questions over discrimination that have threatened to cloud growth of the company, which is based in San Francisco. Founded in 2008, Airbnb has spread to more than 34, 000 cities and 191 countries, where people increasingly use the service as a replacement for hotels. The continued expansion of the privately held   which is valued at $25 billion, depends partly on the idea that Airbnb can be a global company, providing a broad range of people with places to stay when they travel. That reputation was stained in December, when Harvard University researchers released a working paper that concluded it was harder for guests with    names to rent rooms through the site. Several Airbnb users have since shared stories on social media saying they were denied a rental because of their race. In May, an   Airbnb user filed a suit against the company, seeking   status, saying he had been denied a place to stay because of his race. “There have been too many unacceptable instances of people being discriminated against on the Airbnb platform because of who they are or what they look like,” wrote Laura W. Murphy, a former director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Washington legislative office who was hired by Airbnb to compile its report. Diversity advocates said Airbnb’s actions were a notable first step, but wondered how some of the changes could be enforced and whether the moves went far enough. The biases of hosts can be cloaked  —   for example, one Airbnb listing in Washington states “we cannot accept guests arriving in D. C. by bus or motor coach,” without mentioning race, class or ethnicity  —   and may be difficult to eradicate. “The company isn’t saying that it will consistently ban hosts for discrimination, so it’s unclear whether this policy will be enough to deter bad behavior,” said Jamila   an associate professor of law at the University of Missouri, Kansas City. “I want more information on how the technology works and how the company will act when they identify discriminatory behavior. ” Professor   said she was also concerned about potential unintended consequences of Airbnb’s new policies. If mainly minorities feel comfortable in using instant bookings to reserve rentals on Airbnb, for instance, that could end up creating a   reservations system, she said. Airbnb was short on details about how some of the changes might work. Though the company said it planned to experiment with reducing the prominence of user photographs to fight discrimination, it does not intend to eliminate the photos. It did not provide specifics on what a user profile with a   picture might look like. “Photos are an invitation to discriminate,” said Kristen Clarke, the president of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, an organization that advised Airbnb on best   practices. Wade Henderson, president and chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, which also advised Airbnb on the report, said the company did not accept all of its recommendations on promoting diversity. But he called the report “an important first step that shows an openness to considering   solutions to reducing discrimination on the Airbnb platform. ” To help with enforcement against discrimination, Airbnb said it was developing new tools to route discrimination concerns to a group of trained specialists, who will handle the complaints. The company also plans to begin training to address unconscious biases and is pushing for more diversity within its own work force. In the report, Ms. Murphy acknowledged that there were many difficulties to eliminating discrimination from Airbnb. “There is no one product change, policy or modification that can eliminate bias and discrimination,” she wrote. “Tackling these challenges requires a sustained and multifaceted approach. ” Ms. Murphy did not blame Mr. Chesky or his two   Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk, for how the discrimination problems have mushroomed. When the three men, who are white, started Airbnb as a tiny enterprise eight years ago, they began “with the best of intentions,” she wrote. The founders “were not fully conscious of racial bias. ”",0
19165,"Donald Trump, Russia, Rodrigo Duterte: Your Thursday Briefing - The New York Times","Good morning.  We’re trying something new for our readers in Asia and Australia: a morning briefing to   your day.  What do you like? What do you want to see here? Email us with your feedback at asiabriefing@nytimes. com. Here’s what you need to know: • The surprise election of Donald J. Trump, a real estate    television star with no government experience, upended the political order in the United States and around the world. Global markets stabilized after an initial plunge. But uncertainty over Mr. Trump’s agenda, his embrace of the kind of white populism rising in Europe, and his distrust of trade pacts and climate change, raised international concerns. _____ • Mr. Trump marshaled   white and   voters disaffected by globalization and multiculturalism, waging a campaign that traded in derision and attacked the legitimacy of the political process. Both Hillary Clinton and President Obama were stung by the voters’ repudiation, but reinforced the importance of a peaceful, orderly transition of power. Mrs. Clinton, who said the loss was “painful, and it will be for a long time,” also insisted that the nation owed Mr. Trump “an open mind and a chance to lead. ” _____ • One party, the Republicans, will now control the White House and both houses of Congress, setting the stage for sweeping policy changes. The stunning outcome was unforeseen, undercutting the credibility of much of the American news media. Like the “Brexit” referendum, much of the polling, analysis and prominent coverage failed to capture the level of popular fury or foresee the coming revolt against the interests of what the British politician Nigel Farage derided as “big business and big politics. ” _____ • Both Russia and China have portrayed the tumultuous American election as a validation of their own authoritarian approaches. Vladimir V. Putin expressed hope for a “constructive dialogue” with Mr. Trump, whose lack of foreign policy experience and friendly positions toward Russia could play into the Kremlin’s hands. Asia greeted the election cautiously. China sent a short congratulatory note, but made no mention of Mr. Trump’s campaign promises to confront it on trade and currency issues. Shinzo Abe, Japan’s prime minister, could meet with the   as early as next week. • Newspapers across the globe scrambled to create front pages that conveyed the stunning upset. [The New York Times] • If Mr. Trump scraps the   Trade Partnership, a proper counterweight to China’s expansion may never emerge. [The Straits Times] • Asian analysts fear that Mr. Trump will overhaul bilateral defense pacts with Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Australia. [Nikkei Asian Review] • Mr. Trump has said he will “end forever” the use of the   visa that is employed by American companies to hire skilled workers from India and other countries. [Times of India] • Weeks before the election, President Rodrigo Duterte named Mr. Trump’s business partner in Manila as a special envoy to the United States. [The New York Times] • Silicon Valley’s reaction to Mr. Trump’s victory was beyond grim. “We didn’t do enough,” said one tech leader. [The New York Times] •  California and Massachusetts legalized recreational marijuana use, reflecting a national shift in attitudes toward the drug. [The New York Times] • The one American institution that predicted Mr. Trump’s presidency: “The Simpsons. ” [Entertainment Weekly] • The markets have recovered from a wild ride, with stocks trading higher in the U. S. and in early trading in Asia. Gold pared earlier gains. Here’s a snapshot of global markets. • The Mexican peso took a beating, dropping more than 12 percent against the dollar before recovering to 8 percent. • In other news, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India arrives in Japan today for a   visit during which the two countries may complete negotiations on a nuclear energy deal. • Disney reports quarterly results today, which could offer a look into the performance of the massive new resort it opened in Shanghai this year. • In Hong Kong, highly competitive “cramming centers” for exam preparations are turning their tutors into celebrities, plastering their faces on buses and billboards. • Sharbat Gula, the   Afghan who appeared as a girl on a National Geographic cover, was welcomed home by Afghanistan’s president after Pakistan deported her. She has come to symbolize the plight of hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees and migrants being forced to return. • President Xi Jinping’s attitudes toward law and sovereignty were apparent in China’s decision to target two   politicians in Hong Kong who used the term “ ” in taking their oaths of office. • At least seven people died and dozens were injured when a tram derailed south of London. The cause was unclear, but the driver was arrested. • Roughly 50, 000 years ago, the Neanderthals and modern humans encountered one another and interbred. So why didn’t a   hybrid prevail? Two new studies focus on this question and find that a principle of population genetics applies: In small populations, natural selection is less effective. We recently told you how autumn  —   or is it fall?  —   got its identity crisis. But what about summer, spring and winter? Where do their names come from? Etymologists link “winter” to the    word wed, meaning “water. ” That gave way to the old German wintar, or “the wet season. ” Water also leads us to the source of spring’s name. In this case, the word was a verb before it was a noun. In the Middle Ages, “sprinc” was German for “leap” and it came to mean “source of water. ” Eventually “springing time” replaced the Old English “lent,” which had signified the entire spring season, not just the period from Ash Wednesday to Easter. It shrank down to “springtime,” then “spring. ” And while autumn now has two names, summer may originally have had none at all. Thousands of years ago, early   cultures are thought to have divided the year into just three seasons. At some point, the Sanskrit “sáma,” or “season,” appears to have traveled north from the Indian subcontinent  —   a place that knows a thing or two about sweltering months  —   and became summer. P. S.: The storied firearm we told you about in our Back Story on Wednesday  —   an 18th century musket made for the Qianlong emperor  —   was sold by the Sotheby’s auction house to a private collector for more than $2. 4 million.

19167,FBI Director Comey’s October Surprise,"Dispatches from STEPHEN LENDMAN I t doesn’t matter. The Clintons are untouchable. Despite clear evidence of war crimes, racketeering, perjury, and Hillary’s email scandal, along with suspicion of murder, and who knows what else, they’re heading back to the White House in January. Electoral rigging virtually assures it. FBI director James Comey’s announced revisiting of Hillary’s use of her private email server to maintain and send classified information won’t derail her presidential bid. .. Last July, Comey whitewashed her criminality – serious enough to send ordinary people to prison. At the time, Trump was right, saying she “compromised the safety of the American people by storing highly classified information on a private email server with no security.” .. “Our adversaries almost certainly have a blackmail file on (her), and this fact alone disqualified her from service.” She was caught red-handed lying to the FBI and Congress – claiming she didn’t use her home server to maintain or send classified information. Comey confirmed over 100 emails were classified when sent, including top secret ones – maybe hundreds more we haven’t heard about or not yet discovered. .. Deleting thousands of emails compounded her criminality. Yet her road to the White House remains on track. Still, Comey’s Friday announcement was astonishing, less than two weeks before November’s election, an unprecedented act Trump will try using to his advantage – though likely no more successfully than earlier. .. Comey’s letter was disturbingly vague, suggesting having absolved Hillary’s criminality once, he’ll do it again. Announced “investigative steps” take time – likely concluding next year after November’s election and January’s inauguration. Here’s his letter to FBI employees explaining his action: .. “This morning I sent a letter to Congress in connection with the Secretary Clinton email investigation. Yesterday, the investigative team briefed me on their recommendation with respect to seeking access to emails that have recently been found in an unrelated case.” .. “Because those emails appear to be pertinent to our investigation, I agreed that we should take appropriate steps to obtain and review them.” .. “Of course, we don’t ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed. I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record.” .. “At the same time, however, given that we don’t know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails, I don’t want to create a misleading impression.” .. “In trying to strike that balance, in a brief letter and in the middle of an election season, there is significant risk of being misunderstood, but I wanted you to hear directly from me about it.” Judicial Watch (JW) has done important work, trying to have Hillary held accountable for her scandalous email practices – criminality without punishment so far, unlikely to change ahead, especially if she’s anointed in November to succeed Obama, a near-certainty as things now stand. .. In response to Comey’s announcement, JW president Tom Fitton issued the following statement: .. “ The FBI’s seeming decision to reopen the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s mishandling of classified information is astonishing. Once again, we suspect our Freedom of Information Act and other investigations have spurred the FBI to act. This decision highlights the corruption, favoritism, and incompetence in the FBI/Justice Department investigation of Hillary Clinton.” .. Her “email misconduct and lies, aided and abetted by the Obama administration, have created a national crisis. The FBI needs to disclose more information about what it found and when – the American voters deserve answers now.” .. “Judicial Watch helped break open the Clinton email scandal and, no matter what the FBI does, will independently continue its historic litigation and investigation.” U S voters go to the polls in 10 days. Millions already voted in advance. Things were likely rigged way ahead of November 8. Hillary is the establishment choice. Power brokers running America picked her last year to succeed Obama. Trump surprisingly emerged last man standing among a deplorable array of GOP aspirants, resembling a police lineup – or an FBI most wanted list. .. Bill and Hillary Clinton belong in prison, not high office for a third co-presidential term. Given everything publicly known, they remain irreparably tainted, a disturbing indictment of a political process too debauched to fix. Voters have no say over who leads them. Powerful interests decide everything. Democracy in America is pure fantasy, not the real thing. .. The only solution is grassroots revolution. Nothing else can work.

19168,"Meteor Puts on a Light Show Over Midwest, and for the Cameras - The New York Times","A fiery meteor streaked across the Midwest sky early Monday morning, seen as far west as Nebraska and as far east as New York. Unfortunately for scientists who would like to study where it came from and how it got here (although perhaps fortunately for people living in the vicinity) all of the surviving bits of rock plopped into Lake Michigan. The American Meteor Society has received more than 350 reports from witnesses of the green fireball, which occurred around 1:25 a. m. local time. William B. Cook, a NASA meteor expert, reported in a email to NASA headquarters that the fireball originated about 60 miles above West Bend, Wis. moving about 38, 000 miles an hour toward the northeast before disintegrating about 21 miles above Lake Michigan. As the meteor fell apart, it emitted   sounds that were recorded in the Canadian province of Manitoba, about 600 miles away. The blast released energy that was equal to at least 10 tons of TNT, Dr. Cook said, suggesting that the object that entered the atmosphere was at least 600 pounds and two feet in diameter. Most of the reports came from Wisconsin and Illinois. Michael Hankey of the American Meteor Society said such fireballs happen every day somewhere, but only rarely  —   perhaps four a year  —   do they occur over populated areas of the United States where the light show can be captured by dashboard cameras, security cameras and night owls carrying cellphones. “There were just a ton of videos,” Mr. Hankey said. “That was unique. ” Marc D. Fries, another NASA scientist, said that weather radar captured the shower of meteorites and that he was analyzing the data to estimate the masses of the meteorites and where they fell. From the multitude of reports, scientists should be able to calculate the trajectory of the object, which most likely originated in the asteroid belt. (An asteroid is a rock orbiting in the inner solar system, usually between Mars and Jupiter. A meteor is the streak of light as an asteroid enters the atmosphere. A meteorite is an asteroid remnant that makes it to the ground.) Philipp R. Heck, a scientist at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, said the fireball seemed comparable to one that fell over a southern suburb of Chicago in 2003. Meteorites as heavy as several pounds hit the ground, some damaging homes. With the asteroid remnants, scientists could study the mineralogy in detail, even estimating how many million years it took for the asteroid to cross paths with Earth. But it is unlikely that anyone will find pieces of Monday’s meteor. Mr. Hankey said the biggest meteorites were probably the size of baseballs, sunk in the sediments at the bottom of Lake Michigan. “Good luck finding that,” he said.",0
19169,"Hvordan stemme nei til kjernefysiske våpen?, av Manlio Dinucci","Hvordan stemme nei til kjernefysiske våpen? av Manlio Dinucci USA har nettopp forkastet et forslag fra sine allierte i FNs Generalforsamlings første komite som arbeider for å fullstendig fjerne kjernefysiske våpen. Imidlertid kan de statene som huser USAs atombomber kreve at disse fjernes fra sitt territorium ved å vise til artikkel 2 i ikke-sprednings avtalen.
Voltaire Network | Roma (Italia) | 7 novembre 2016 français italiano English Español Türkçe «Mange takk, president Obama. Italia vil med stor besluttsomhet forfølge sin tilslutning til kjernefysisk sikkerhet», skrev statsminister Renzi i en historisk twitter. Seks måneder seinere, i FN, stemte Renzi JA til kjernefysiske våpen. Ved sin tilknytning til USA stilte den italienske regjeringen opp sammen med USA mot resolusjonen som ble støttet av det store flertallet i FNs generalforsamlings første komité. Den sa at det skulle innkalles til en FN-konferanse i 2017 for å «forhandle frem et lovlig bindende instrument for å forby kjernefysiske våpen og føre frem mot en fullstendig eliminering av disse.
Dermed gikk den italienske regjeringen tilbake på det den hadde lovet to år tidligere under Wien-konvensjonen, da den støttet anti-atomvåpen bevegelsen i og med at den forsikret at den var villig til å arbeide for kjernefysisk nedrustning ved å innta rollen som tålmodig mellommann og ved hjelp av diplomati». Dermed blir appellen hul og uten innhold: «Vi krever total kjernefysisk nedrustning», noe som krevet at regjeringen sørget for «en sammenhengende oppfølging av engasjementet og kampen for å fjerne kjernefysiske våpen», i en «humanitær og legal reise mot kjernefysisk nedrustning» hvor Italia kunne spille «en mer aktiv rolle, «muligens (til og med) en ledende rolle.»
Det parlamentariske forlaget med den samme hensikten faller også som en konsekvens. Det er enkelt nok å bruke generelle vendinger i kravet om kjernefysisk nedrustning: Vi trenger bare å forholde oss til det faktum at USAs president har satt i gang en kjernefysisk gjenopprustning til en prislapp på 1000 milliarder dollar til tross for at han har fått Nobels fredspris for «sin visjon om en verden fri for kjernefysisk våpen».
Den spesielle måten Italia kan bidra til å nå målet om kjernefysisk nedrustning, forkynt i en FN-resolusjon, er å fjerne USAs kjernefysiske våpen fra landet vårt. For å klare dette, trenger vi ikke å appellere til regjeringen, men ( ganske enkelt) å be om at Ikke-spredning-avtale (NPT) respekteres, undertegnet og ratifisert av Italia, hvor det i artikkel 2 heter følgende:
«Hver stat som militært er ikke-kjernefysisk og som deltar i denne avtalen, går med på å ikke motta fra noen kjernefysiske våpen og eksplosive anretninger, direkte eller indirekte.»
Vi må be om at Italia ikke overtrer NPT og må krevet at USA umiddelbart fjerner alle sine kjernefysiske våpen fra vårt territorium og ikke installerer de i de nye B61-12 bombene, som er et springrett for for USA/NATOs kjernefysiske eskalering overfor Russland, og heller ingen andre kjernefysiske våpen. Vi må kreve at treningen av italienske piloter i bruk av kjernefysiske våpen under USA-kommando, opphører.
Dette er målet til kampanjen som er satt ut i livet av Komiteen « Ikke krig - Nei til NATO » og andre organisasjoner. Kampanjen oppnådde sitt første viktige mål den 26. oktober i regional-rådet i Toskana, hvor det ble vedtatt en uttalelse som «ber regjeringen å respektere ikke-spredningsavtalen for kjernefysiske våpen og for å sørge for at USA øyeblikkelig fjerner alle kjernefysiske våpen fra Italias territorium og avstår fra å installere (på italiensk jord) de nye B61-12 bombene og andre kjernefysiske våpen.»
Gjennom dette og andre initiativ kan vi skape en omfattende front som med sterk mobilisering tvinger regjeringen til å respektere ikke-sprednings avtalen.
For seks måneder siden ble det gjort henvendelser på sidene til Il Manifesto , på basis av NPT, om noen i Parlamentet kunne reise forslag om at USAs kjernefysiske våpen øyeblikkelig måtte fjernes fra Italia. Vi venter fortsatt på en reaksjon.

19170,How a Secretive Branch of ISIS Built a Global Network of Killers - The New York Times,"BREMEN, Germany  —   Believing he was answering a holy call, Harry Sarfo left his home in the   city of Bremen last year and drove for four straight days to reach the territory controlled by the Islamic State in Syria. He barely had time to settle in before members of the Islamic State’s secret service, wearing masks over their faces, came to inform him and his German friend that they no longer wanted Europeans to come to Syria. Where they were really needed was back home, to help carry out the group’s plan of waging terrorism across the globe. “He was speaking openly about the situation, saying that they have loads of people living in European countries and waiting for commands to attack the European people,” Mr. Sarfo recounted on Monday, in an interview with The New York Times conducted in English inside the   prison near Bremen. “And that was before the Brussels attacks, before the Paris attacks. ” The masked man explained that, although the group was well set up in some European countries, it needed more attackers in Germany and Britain, in particular. “They said, ‘Would you mind to go back to Germany, because that’s what we need at the moment,’” Mr. Sarfo recalled. “And they always said they wanted to have something that is occurring in the same time: They want to have loads of attacks at the same time in England and Germany and France. ” The operatives belonged to an intelligence unit of the Islamic State known in Arabic as the Emni, which has become a combination of an internal police force and an external operations branch, dedicated to exporting terror abroad, according to thousands of pages of French, Belgian, German and Austrian intelligence and interrogation documents obtained by The Times. The Islamic State’s attacks in Paris on Nov. 13 brought global attention to the group’s external terrorism network, which began sending fighters abroad two years ago. Now, Mr. Sarfo’s account, along with those of other captured recruits, has further pulled back the curtain on the group’s machinery for projecting violence beyond its borders. What they describe is a multilevel secret service under the overall command of the Islamic State’s most senior Syrian operative, spokesman and propaganda chief, Abu Muhammad  . Below him is a tier of lieutenants empowered to plan attacks in different regions of the world, including a “secret service for European affairs,” a “secret service for Asian affairs” and a “secret service for Arab affairs,” according to Mr. Sarfo. Reinforcing the idea that the Emni is a core part of the Islamic State’s operations, the interviews and documents indicate that the unit has carte blanche to recruit and reroute operatives from all parts of the organization  —   from new arrivals to seasoned battlefield fighters, and from the group’s special forces and its elite commando units. Taken together, the interrogation records show that operatives are selected by nationality and grouped by language into small, discrete units whose members sometimes only meet one another on the eve of their departure abroad. And through the coordinating role played by Mr. Adnani, terror planning has gone    with the group’s extensive propaganda operations  —   including, Mr. Sarfo claimed, monthly meetings in which Mr. Adnani chose which grisly videos to promote based on battlefield events. Based on the accounts of operatives arrested so far, the Emni has become the crucial cog in the group’s terrorism machinery, and its trainees led the Paris attacks and built the suitcase bombs used in a Brussels airport terminal and subway station. Investigation records show that its foot soldiers have also been sent to Austria, Germany, Spain, Lebanon, Tunisia, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Malaysia. With European officials stretched by a string of assaults by seemingly unconnected attackers who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, Mr. Sarfo suggested that there may be more of a link than the authorities yet know. He said he was told that undercover operatives in Europe used new converts as   or “clean men,” who help link up people interested in carrying out attacks with operatives who can pass on instructions on everything from how to make a suicide vest to how to credit their violence to the Islamic State. The group has sent “hundreds of operatives” back to the European Union, with “hundreds more in Turkey alone,” according to a senior United States intelligence official and a senior American defense official, both of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence. Mr. Sarfo, who was recently moved out of solitary confinement at his German prison because he is no longer considered violent, agrees with that assessment. “Many of them have returned,” he said. “Hundreds, definitely. ” The first port of call for new arrivals to the Islamic State is a network of dormitories in Syria, just across the border from Turkey. There, recruits are interviewed and inventoried. Mr. Sarfo was fingerprinted, and a doctor came to draw a blood sample and perform a physical examination. A man with a laptop conducted an intake interview. “He was asking normal questions like: ‘What’s your name? What’s your second name? Who’s your mom? Where’s your mom originally from? What did you study? What degree do you have? What’s your ambition? What do you want to become? ’” Mr. Sarfo said. His background was also of interest. He was a regular at a radical mosque in Bremen that had already sent about 20 members to Syria, at least four of whom were killed in battle, according to Daniel Heinke, the German Interior Ministry’s counterterrorism coordinator for the area. And he had served a   prison sentence for breaking into a supermarket safe and stealing 23, 000 euros. Even though the punishment for theft in areas under Islamic State control is amputation, a criminal past can be a valued asset, Mr. Sarfo said, “especially if they know you have ties to organized crime and they know you can get fake IDs, or they know you have contact men in Europe who can smuggle you into the European Union. ” The bureaucratic nature of the intake procedure was recently confirmed by American officials after USB drives were recovered in the recently liberated Syrian city of Manbij, one of the hubs for processing foreign fighters. Mr. Sarfo checked all the necessary boxes, and on the third day after his arrival, the members of the Emni came to ask for him. He wanted to fight in Syria and Iraq, but the masked operatives explained that they had a vexing problem. “They told me that there aren’t many people in Germany who are willing to do the job,” Mr. Sarfo said soon after his arrest last year, according to the transcript of his interrogation by German officials, which runs more than 500 pages. “They said they had some in the beginning. But one after another, you could say, they chickened out, because they got scared  —   cold feet. Same in England. ” By contrast, the group had more than enough volunteers for France. “My friend asked them about France,” Mr. Sarfo said. “And they started laughing. But really serious laughing, with tears in their eyes. They said, ‘Don’t worry about France.’ ‘Mafi mushkilah’  —   in Arabic, it means ‘no problem. ’” That conversation took place in April 2015, seven months before the coordinated killings in Paris in November, the worst terrorist attack in Europe in over a decade. While some details of Mr. Sarfo’s account cannot be verified, his statements track with what other recruits related in their interrogations. And both prison officials and the German intelligence agents who debriefed Mr. Sarfo after his arrest said they found him credible. Since the rise of the Islamic State over two years ago, intelligence agencies have been collecting nuggets on the Emni. Originally, the unit was tasked with policing the Islamic State’s members, including conducting interrogations and ferreting out spies, according to interrogation records and analysts. But French members arrested in 2014 and 2015 explained that the Emni had taken on a new portfolio: projecting terror abroad. “It’s the Emni that ensures the internal security inside Dawla”  —   the Arabic word for state  —   “and oversees external security by sending abroad people they recruited, or else sending individuals to carry out violent acts, like what happened in Tunisia inside the museum in Tunis, or else the aborted plot in Belgium,” said Nicolas Moreau, 32, a French citizen who was arrested last year after leaving the Islamic State in Syria, according to his statement to France’s domestic intelligence agency. Mr. Moreau explained that he had run a restaurant in Raqqa, Syria, the de facto capital of the group’s territory, where he had served meals to key members of the Emni  —   including Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the    commander of the Paris attacks, who was killed in a standoff with the police days later. Other interrogations, as well as Mr. Sarfo’s account, have led investigators to conclude that the Emni also trained and dispatched the gunman who opened fire on a beach in Sousse, Tunisia, in June, and the man who prepared the Brussels airport bombs. Records from French, Austrian and Belgian intelligence agencies show that at least 28 operatives recruited by the Emni succeeded in deploying to countries outside of the Islamic State’s core territory, mounting both successful attacks and plots that were foiled. Officials say that dozens of other operatives have slipped through and formed sleeper cells. In his own interactions with the Emni, Mr. Sarfo realized that they were preparing a global portfolio of terrorists and looking to fill holes in their international network, he said. He described what he had been told about the group’s work to build an infrastructure in Bangladesh. There, a siege by a team of Islamic State gunmen left at least 20 hostages dead at a cafe last month, almost all of them foreigners. Mr. Sarfo said that for Asian recruits, the group was looking specifically for militants who had emerged from Al Qaeda’s network in the region. “People especially from Bangladesh, Malaysia and Indonesia  —   they have people who used to work for Al Qaeda, and once they joined the Islamic State, they are asking them questions about their experiences and if they have contacts,” he said. In his briefings with the German authorities, and again in the interview this week, Mr. Sarfo raised the possibility that some of the recent attackers in Europe who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State’s leader during their assaults might have a more direct link to the group than officials believe. Mr. Sarfo explained that the Emni keeps many of its operatives underground in Europe. They act as nodes that can remotely activate potential suicide attackers who have been drawn in by propaganda. Linking them are what Mr. Sarfo called “clean men,” new converts to Islam with no established ties to radical groups. “These people are not in direct contact with these guys who are doing the attacks, because they know if these people start talking, they will get caught,” he said of the underground operatives. “They mostly use people who are new Muslims, who are converts,” he said. Those “clean” converts “get in contact with the people, and they give them the message. ” And in the case of some videotaped pledges of allegiance, the   can then send the video on to the handler in Europe, who uploads it for use by the Islamic State’s propaganda channels. The intelligence documents and Mr. Sarfo agree that the Islamic State has made the most of its recruits’ nationalities by sending them back to plot attacks at home. Yet one important region where the Emni is not thought to have succeeded in sending trained attackers is North America, Mr. Sarfo said, recalling what the members of the branch told him. Though dozens of Americans have become members of the Islamic State, and some have been recruited into the external operations wing, “they know it’s hard for them to get Americans into America” once they have traveled to Syria, he said. “For America and Canada, it’s much easier for them to get them over the social network, because they say the Americans are dumb  —   they have open gun policies,” he said. “They say we can radicalize them easily, and if they have no prior record, they can buy guns, so we don’t need to have no contact man who has to provide guns for them. ” Since late 2014, the Islamic State has instructed foreigners joining the group to make their trip look like a holiday in southern Turkey, including booking a return flight and paying for an   vacation at a beach resort, from which smugglers arrange their transport into Syria, according to intelligence documents and Mr. Sarfo’s account. That cover story creates pressure to keep things moving quickly during the recruits’ training in Syria, and most get a bare minimum  —   just a few days of basic weapons practice, in some instances. “When they go back to France or in Germany, they can say, ‘I was only on holidays in Turkey,’” Mr. Sarfo said. “The longer they stay in the Islamic State, the more suspicious the secret service in the West gets, and that’s why they try to do the training as quickly as possible. ” Mr. Sarfo’s facility in both German and English  —   he studied construction at Newham College in East London  —   made him attractive as a potential attacker. Though the Emni approached him several times to ask him to return to Germany, he demurred, he said. Eventually, Mr. Sarfo, perhaps because of his burly build  —      and around 286 pounds when he arrived in Syria, though he has lost weight since then  —   was drafted into the Islamic State’s quwat khas, Arabic for special forces. The unit only admitted single men who agreed not to marry during the duration of their training. In addition to providing the offensive force to infiltrate cities during battles, it was one of several elite units that became recruiting pools for the external operations branch, Mr. Sarfo said. Along with his German friend, he was driven to the desert outside Raqqa. “They dropped us off in the middle of nowhere and told us, ‘We are here,’” he said, according to the transcript of one of his interrogation sessions. “So we’re standing in the desert and thought to ourselves, ‘What’s going on? ’” When the two Germans looked more closely, they realized there were cavelike dwellings around them. Everything above ground was painted with mud so as to be invisible to drones. “Showering was prohibited. Eating was prohibited, too, unless they gave it to you,” Mr. Sarfo said, adding that he had shared a cave with five or six others. Even drinking water was harshly rationed. “Each dwelling received two cups of water a day, put on the doorstep,” he said. “And the purpose of this was to test us, see who really wants it, who’s firm. ” The grueling training began: hours of running, jumping,   parallel bars, crawling. The recruits began fainting. By the second week, they were each given a Kalashnikov assault rifle and told to sleep with it between their legs until it became “like a third arm,” he said, according to his interrogation transcript. The punishment for failing to keep up was harsh. “There was one boy who refused to get up, because he was just too exhausted,” Mr. Sarfo told the authorities. “So they tied him to a pole with his legs and his arms and left him there. ” He learned that the special forces program involved 10 levels of training. After he graduated to Level 2, he was moved to an island on a river in Tabqa, Syria. The recruits’ sleeping spots now consisted of holes in the ground, covered by sticks and twigs. They practiced swimming, scuba diving and navigating by the stars. Throughout his training, Mr. Sarfo rubbed shoulders with an international cadre of recruits. When he first arrived at the desert campus, he ran laps alongside Moroccans, Egyptians, at least one Indonesian, a Canadian and a Belgian. And out on the island, he learned of similar special units, including one called Jaysh   or the Army of the Caliphate. A   criminal complaint indicates that the Islamic State tried to recruit at least one American into that unit, but he declined to enroll. The man, Mohamad Jamal Khweis, a    from Alexandria, Va. traveled to Syria in December, only to be captured by Kurdish troops in Iraq in March. In his debriefing with the F. B. I. he explained that early on, he was approached by members of the unit. “During his stay at this safe house, representatives from Jaysh Khalifa, a group described by the defendant as an ‘offensive group,’ visited the new ISIL recruits,” the complaint says. “The representatives explained that their group was responsible for accepting volunteers from foreign countries who would be trained and sent back to their countries to conduct operations and execute attacks on behalf of ISIL. The group’s requirements, among other things, were that recruits had to be single, would train in remote locations, must be free of any injuries and had to stay reclusive when returning to their home countries. ” As he progressed through the special forces training, Mr. Sarfo became closer with the emir of the camp, a Moroccan, who began to divulge details about how the Islamic State’s external operations effort was structured, he said. Mr. Sarfo learned that there was one outsize figure behind the group’s strategies and ambitions. “The big man behind everything is Abu Muhammad ” he said. “He is the head of the Emni, and he is the head of the special forces as well,” Mr. Sarfo added. “Everything goes back to him. ” Born in the town of Binnish in northern Syria, Mr. Adnani is said to be 39, and is the subject of a $5 million bounty from the State Department’s Rewards for Justice program. But details about his life remain a mystery. There are very few available photos of him, and the one used on the State Department’s website is years old. Mr. Sarfo explained that when recruits to the special forces finished all 10 levels of training, they were blindfolded and driven to meet Mr. Adnani, where they pledged allegiance to him directly. Mr. Sarfo was told that the blindfolds stayed on the whole time, so that even Mr. Adnani’s   fighters never know what he looks like. To the world, Mr. Adnani is better known as the official spokesman of the Islamic State, and the man who put out a global call this year for Muslims to attack unbelievers wherever they were, however they could. “Adnani is much more than just the mouthpiece of this group,” said Thomas Joscelyn, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington who tracks the group’s leadership. “He is heavily involved in external operations. He is sort of the administrative ‘yea’ or ‘nay’ at the top of the pyramid,” who signs off on attack plans, the details of which are handled by his subordinates. During his time in Syria, Mr. Sarfo was contacted by other German fighters who wanted him to be an actor in a propaganda film aimed at German speakers. They drove to Palmyra, and Mr. Sarfo was told to hold the group’s black flag and to walk again and again in front of the camera as they filmed repeated takes. Syrian captives were forced to kneel, and the other German fighters shot them, showing an interest only in the cinematic effect. One turned to Mr. Sarfo immediately after killing a victim and asked: “How did I look like? Did I look good, the way I executed?” Mr. Sarfo said he had learned that videos like the one he acted in were vetted by Mr. Adnani himself in a monthly meeting of senior operatives. “There’s a vetting procedure,” he said. “Once a month they have a shura  —   which is a sitting, a meeting  —   where all the videos and everything that is important, they start speaking about it. And Abu Muhammad   is the head of the shura. ” Mr. Sarfo said he had started doubting his allegiance to ISIS during his training, after seeing how cruelly they treated those who could not keep up. Making the propaganda video provided his final disillusionment when he saw how many times they recorded each scene in the   film. Back in Germany, when he had been inspired by similar videos, he had always assumed they were real, not staged. He began plotting his escape, which took weeks and involved sprinting and crawling in a field of mud before crossing into Turkey. He was arrested at Bremen Airport, where he landed on July 20, 2015, and he voluntarily confessed. He is now serving a   term on terrorism charges. Among the Islamic State’s innovations is the role of foreigners, especially Europeans, in the planning of attacks. Mr. Sarfo’s account agrees with investigation documents and the assessments of terrorism experts, who say that French and Belgian citizens like Mr. Abaaoud are more than just operatives and have been given managing roles. “It’s a creative and interesting operational road map, to be able to lean on someone like Abaaoud, who has his own network abroad,” said   Brisard, chairman of the Center for the Analysis of Terrorism in Paris. “They gave him the autonomy regarding tactics and strategy, even if the operation as a whole still needs a green light from the Islamic State’s leadership. ” Looking at the current leaders of the Emni, investigators have homed in on two in particular. They go by the aliases Abu Souleymane, a French citizen, and Abu Ahmad, described as Syrian. Both are considered top lieutenants of Mr. Adnani, according to the senior American defense official and senior intelligence official. The two men play a direct role in identifying fighters to be sent overseas, in choosing targets and in organizing logistics for operatives, including paying for smugglers to get them to Europe and, in at least one case, sending Western Union transfers, according to European intelligence documents. A glimpse into the possible role of Abu Souleymane came from one of the hostages held by suicide bombers inside the Bataclan concert hall in Paris in November. After gunning down dozens of concertgoers, two of the suicide bombers retreated into a hallway with a group of hostages, forcing them to sit against the windows as human shields, said the hostage, David   24. In the      standoff that ensued, Mr. Fritz heard one of the bombers ask the other, “Should we call Souleymane?” The second operative appeared annoyed that the first had asked the question in French, and ordered him to switch to Arabic. “I immediately understood that, yes, this was the individual, maybe not the individual who had organized the attack, but who held a place in the hierarchy above them,” Mr. Fritz said in a telephone interview. His testimony is also included in a detailed,   report by France’s antiterrorism police. “They were absolutely, like soldiers,” awaiting orders, he said. Souleymane, whose full nom de guerre is Abu Souleymane   or Abu Souleymane the Frenchman, is believed to be a French national in his 30s who is of either Moroccan or Tunisian ancestry, according to Ludovico Carlino, a senior analyst with IHS Conflict Monitor in London. Mr. Carlino says he believes that Souleymane was promoted to be the top terrorism planner for Europe after Mr. Abaaoud’s death. A snapshot of the other senior leader, Abu Ahmad, appears in the account of a man who investigators have concluded was supposed to be part of the team of Paris attackers: an Algerian named Adel Haddadi. Mr. Haddadi said he and another member of the team, a former    member from Pakistan named Muhammad Usman, were separated from two other attackers after they reached Greece by boat. Mr. Haddadi, 28, and Mr. Usman, 22, were eventually arrested in a migrant camp in Salzburg, Austria. The two men sent alongside them became the first suicide bombers to detonate their vests outside the Stade de France during the November attacks. After arriving in Syria and being routed to the international dormitory there in February 2015, Mr. Haddadi worked as a cook in Raqqa for months before a member of the Emni came to see him, according to French and Austrian investigation documents. “One day, a Syrian came into the kitchen to see me and said that someone called Abu Ahmad wanted to see me,” Mr. Haddadi was quoted as saying in the Austrian record of his interrogation. He was driven to a   building, where another Syrian holding a walkie talkie radioed Abu Ahmad. They waited for hours before the Syrian got orders to drive the recruit to the next location. In the street, a Saudi man wearing all white was waiting, and asked Mr. Haddadi to go on a walk. After 300 yards, they reached an empty apartment building and sat down. “I was scared, I wanted to leave, but he talked the whole time,” Mr. Haddadi told the authorities. “He said only positive things about me, that Daesh trusted me and that I now needed to prove myself worthy of that trust. He said that Daesh was going to send me to France,” Mr. Haddadi added, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. “The details, he said, I would get them once I arrived in France. ” Sometime after that, Abu Ahmad arrived. Mr. Haddadi described him as a Syrian man between 38 and 42 years old, slim with a long, black beard, and dressed all in black. He was, Mr. Haddadi said, “the giver of orders. ” Abu Ahmad brought Mr. Haddadi together with three other potential attackers, with the last man, Mr. Usman, being introduced just a day before they all set out for Europe. Mr. Haddadi and two of the other men were native Arabic speakers, and Mr. Usman spoke enough Arabic to communicate with them, the interrogation documents said. The day of their departure, Abu Ahmad came and gave them his Turkish cellphone number, instructing them to store it in their phone as “FF,” to avoid registering a name. He gave Mr. Haddadi $2, 000 in $100 bills, and they were driven to the Turkish border. A man met them in Turkey to take their photographs, and returned with Syrian passports. Another smuggler arranged their Oct. 3 boat trip to Leros, Greece. All of these logistical steps, as well as Western Union money transfers, were organized by Abu Ahmad, one of the senior lieutenants running the Islamic State’s efforts to export terror. Until his arrest in December, Mr. Haddadi remained in touch with Abu Ahmad through messages on Telegram and via text messages to his Turkish number, according to the investigation record. Abu Ahmad’s Turkish number was found somewhere else, too: written on a slip of paper in the pants pocket of the severed leg of one of the suicide bombers at the Stade de France.",0
19172,Supreme Court Nominee Calls Trump’s Attacks on Judiciary ‘Demoralizing’ - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, President Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court, privately expressed dismay on Wednesday over Mr. Trump’s increasingly aggressive attacks on the judiciary, calling the president’s criticism of independent judges “demoralizing” and “disheartening. ” The remarks by Judge Gorsuch,  chosen  by Mr. Trump last week to serve on the nation’s highest court, came as the president lashed out at the federal appellate judges who are considering a challenge to his executive order banning travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The president called their judicial proceedings “disgraceful” and described the courts as “so political. ” Those remarks followed Mr. Trump’s weekend Twitter outburst in which he derided a Seattle district court judge who blocked his travel ban as a “  judge” whose “ridiculous” ruling would be overturned. Judge Gorsuch expressed his disappointment with Mr. Trump’s comments about the judiciary in a private conversation with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, as he paid courtesy calls on Capitol Hill to build support for his confirmation. An account of the discussion was confirmed by a White House adviser working to advance the Gorsuch confirmation, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment. The spectacle of a Supreme Court nominee breaking so starkly with the president who named him underscored the unusual nature of Mr. Trump’s public feud with the judiciary. Speaking to a group of sheriffs and police chiefs on Wednesday, the president said the appellate judges had failed to grasp concepts even “a bad high school student would understand. ” “This is highly unusual,” said Michael W. McConnell, a former federal judge who directs the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford University. “Mr. Trump is shredding longstanding norms of etiquette and interbranch comity. ” Presidents have traditionally tried to refrain from even appearing to intervene in court cases that concern them or their policies, or from impugning the motives and qualifications of jurists charged with deciding them, according to judges and legal experts from across the political spectrum. The tradition is important to preserving the separation of powers that is a pillar of American democracy, establishing an independent judiciary to serve as a check on the executive branch, they argued. Mr. Trump’s rhetorical battle with the judiciary may also end up harming his cause in a case that may end up before the Supreme Court, by potentially stiffening the resolve of judges who feel their independence is under attack. Mr. McConnell called Mr. Trump’s comments “extremely   and  ” because of their potential to sway judges to rule against Mr. Trump. “Judges who hear criticism of this sort are not going to be inclined to knuckle under it’s going to stiffen their spines to be even more independent,” said Mr. McConnell, who was nominated to his judgeship by President George W. Bush. Jeffrey Rosen, the president of the National Constitution Center, a nonprofit organization in Philadelphia devoted to explaining the Constitution, said there was a rich history of presidents strongly criticizing judges on matters of law. “But those criticisms were based on constitutional disagreements about the rulings, and it’s hard to think of a president who has challenged the motives of specific judges by name repeatedly, especially before a case is decided, or used the same kind of invective as Mr. Trump has toward the court,” Mr. Rosen said. “Judicial independence is a fragile and crucial achievement of American constitutionalism,” he added, “and it depends on the public seeing the judiciary as something more than politicians in robes. ” Yet Mr. Trump, who as president has the power to nominate members of the federal judiciary, appears bent instead on portraying independent judges who hold the fate of his travel ban in their hands as partisans who refuse to give him the power to which he is entitled to protect the nation. “I don’t ever want to call a court biased, so I won’t call it biased,” Mr. Trump said on Wednesday. “But courts seem to be so political, and it would be so great for our justice system if they would be able to read a statement and do what’s right. ” Mr. Trump, who opened his remarks to law enforcement officers reciting the passage of the United States code that gives the president the power to restrict immigration whenever he deems the influx of foreigners detrimental to the country, said he had watched “in amazement” Tuesday night as a   federal appeals panel heard arguments on his executive order and the limits of presidential power in cases of national security. “I listened to a bunch of stuff last night on television that was disgraceful,” Mr. Trump said. “I think it’s sad. I think it’s a sad day. I think our security is at risk today. ” His comments came the morning after a lively, roughly hourlong hearing  —   the audio of which was carried live on national television  —   during which three judges on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit expressed skepticism about the arguments of a Justice Department lawyer defending Mr. Trump’s order. Judge James L. Robart of the Federal District Court in Seattle blocked the travel ban on Friday, and the appeals court is considering whether to uphold that action, with a ruling expected as early as Thursday. Mr. Trump took aim at one of the judges without specifying which, saying, “I will not comment on the statements made by, certainly one judge. ” The panel was made up of Judge William C. Canby Jr. appointed by President Jimmy Carter Judge Richard R. Clifton, named by Mr. Bush and Judge Michelle T. Friedland, nominated by President Barack Obama. “If these judges wanted to, in my opinion, help the court in terms of respect for the court, they’d do what they should be doing,” Mr. Trump said. “It’s so sad. ” By contrast, he lavished praise on Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton, a federal district judge in Boston who last week ruled that the travel ban could stay in place. “Right on  —   they were perfect,” Mr. Trump said of Judge Gorton’s comments. Mr. Trump is hardly the first president to criticize or seek to apply pressure to the courts Mr. Obama admonished Supreme Court justices as they sat before him in the House chamber during his 2010 State of the Union address for their ruling in the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission case that allowed corporations to spend freely to influence elections. John Yoo, a former counsel to Mr. Bush, argued that Mr. Trump was using a potent weapon that has been used throughout history  —   the presidential prerogative to provoke a constitutional crisis when a vital issue is at stake  —   on an insignificant matter. “I hate to see a president waste that kind of authority, which should only be deployed for our most important questions, on this immigration order, which the president could easily withdraw, fix and resubmit,” said Mr. Yoo, now a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley. “President Trump is pressing the accelerator down to 120 miles per hour on every single issue. He will exhaust himself and exhaust his presidency. ” Peter Wallison, a former White House counsel to Ronald Reagan, said the president often wished to weigh in on legal matters concerning personal friends or issues important to his administration, and Mr. Wallison always advised against it, both to protect the tradition of judicial independence and avoid undercutting the courts’ legitimacy. “It’s not illegal, it’s not a violation of the law to say these things, but it’s bad policy because it raises questions about the independence of the courts, and it raises questions about the judicial system as a whole when the president says this,” Mr. Wallison said. Mr. Reagan did not always take his advice, he added, and in those instances, “I always cringed. ” Mr. Trump defended the process that yielded the executive order, saying he had initially wanted to wait a week or even a month before issuing the travel ban. But he said he was told by law enforcement officials that doing so would prompt a flood of people, including some with “very evil intentions,” to rush into the United States before the restrictions took effect. That account appears to be at odds with the one given by several senior officials, who have said they were not fully briefed on the details of Mr. Trump’s order until the day the president signed it at the Pentagon. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump told the law enforcement officers that he was acting solely out of a concern about terrorism, a threat he said had deepened since he took office and gained access to information about the risks facing Americans. “Believe me, I’ve learned a lot in the last two weeks, and terrorism is a far greater threat than the people of our country understand,” Mr. Trump said. “But we’re going to take care of it. We’re going to win. ”",0
19173,Judge warns of dangers of appointed judiciary,"Judge warns of dangers of appointed judiciary 'Unelected and unaccountable' ... rule on 'their empathetic feelings' Published: 5 mins ago Bob Unruh About | | Archive Bob Unruh joined WND in 2006 after nearly three decades with the Associated Press, as well as several Upper Midwest newspapers, where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists.

A member of the increasingly divided and disputatious Alabama Supreme Court is warning that judges need to be elected and thus accountable to the voters or their decisions end up being based on “their empathetic feelings” instead of the law. 
“Alabama’s judges are elected and accountable,” wrote Justice Tom Parker this week. “Federal judges, as recently noted by Chief Justice Roberts in his dissent in Obergefell v. Hodges … a case in which ‘five lawyers’ on the United States Supreme Court announced a fundamental right to same-sex marriage, are ‘unaccountable and unelected.’ 
He pointed out that three of the four dissenting U.S. Supreme Court justices in Obergefell “noted on eight different occasions that the ‘five lawyers’ who decided Obergefell were unelected. Chief Justice Roberts said on two occasions that those unelected ‘five lawyers’ were, consequently, unaccountable.” 
Parker previously commented that the “five lawyers” failed to “base their decision ‘on legal reasoning, history, tradition, the court’s own rules, or the rule of law, but upon the[ir] empathetic feelings.'” 
“Obergefell is the product of unelected and unaccountable judges,” he said. 
He was arguing over a decision by the state court on its next move in a case brought by Chief Justice Roy Moore, who was suspended for his actions regarding a marriage-based case that the court was reviewing when the Obergefell case, which created same-sex “marriage” nationwide, was announced. 
Moore, who is challenging the punishment, insisted that the state court justices who previously were involved in his case recuse themselves. They did, with the exception of the acting chief justice who was allowed to work with the governor to pick a panel of retired judges to hear Moore’s arguments. 
Parker said active judges should have been included in the panel, because retired judges, too, are “unelected and unaccountable.” 
“Unelected and unaccountable judges are empowered to impose their agenda, instead of faithfully applying the rule of law,” Parker warned. “Obergefell is not the first case concerning same-sex marriage to prove this principle true. Before the United States Supreme Court decided Obergefell, the constitutionality of state laws defining marriage as between one man and one woman had been litigated before numerous courts throughout the United States. 
Don’t miss Phyllis Schlafly’s book, now available autographed at the WND Superstore: “Who Killed The American Family?” 
“Before Obergefell, 40 states passed laws affirming traditional marriage. In 37 of those states, the traditional marriage laws were challenged in the courts as unconstitutional. Of the 37 state laws affirming traditional marriage that were challenged in the courts, 24 of those laws were struck down by the judiciary as unconstitutional. Each of the 24 courts that struck down the traditional marriage laws as unconstitutional was composed of judges who were unelected and thus unacountable.” 
He explained what happens when activist judges are held to account, citing the situation that developed in Iowa. 
“The Supreme Court of Iowa was one of the unelected courts that struck down Iowa’s traditional marriage law as unconstitutional. The judges of the Supreme Court of Iowa are appointed by the governor of Iowa. However, although the judges are initially appointed, they must stand for retention elections once their initial term expires.” 
He explained that after the Iowa Legislature adopted one-man-one-woman marriage as law, in April 2009, in “a decision largely viewed as judicial activism, the Supreme Court of Iowa unanimously overruled the democratic will of the people of Iowa and held [the law] unconstitutional.” 
“The very next year, three of the judges … who had concurred in Varnum had to stand for a retention election; all three were removed from office by vote of the people of Iowa. This was the first time since Iowa adopted its retention-election system that any judge had ever failed to be retained. The people of Iowa held accountable those judges who failed to uphold the rule of law.” 
Mathew Staver, chairman of of Liberty Counsel, which is representing Moore, said huge questions remain of impropriety regarding the judicial system’s handling of Moore’s case. 
“Chief Justice Moore is merely asking for the same thing any citizen is entitled to receive – equal justice under the law. He wants his case to be heard by an objective and fair panel of judges who will adhere to the rule of law,” he said. 
“The people of Alabama have increasingly called upon their judges to be accountable. At every turn, this case presents new twists and turns that have never occurred in the history of Alabama. Never has there been a requirement that replacement judges all be retired. We hope this case moves quickly to a final and just resolution. The Court of the Judiciary violated the law when it suspended Chief Justice Moore for life even though it lacked the 9-0 vote. Never before under the unanimity requirement of COJ Rule 16 has any judge ever been suspended for the rest of the term. A sexting judge gets six months and a judge who writes a four-page order that is not unethical or unlawful gets suspended for life. This is not right.” 
Supporters of Moore also have filed an ethics complaint against Lyn Stuart, who has been acting as Alabama’s chief justice. 
She is accused of “violating multiple cannons of ethics in her mishandling of the cases surrounding Chief Justice Roy Moore.” 
The complaint comes from the Sanctity of Marriage Alabama organization. 
“If the Judicial Inquiry commission really cares about ethics, fairness and upholding the integrity and impartiality of the Alabama judiciary, they will no doubt take our complaint seriously, as will organizations which filed ethics complaints on Chief Justice Moore,” said Tom Ford, a spokesman for the group. 
The complaints, the group said, outline “how acting Chief Justice Lyn Stuart has repeatedly failed to avoid impropriety or the appearance of impropriety, failed to perform the duties of her office impartially, failed to avoid conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute, and failed to conduct herself at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.” 
Parker was not the first to cite the dangers of the judiciary. 
Daniel Horowitz , senior editor at Conservative Review, told WND that the nation is going through a “social transformation without representation.” 
“It is the unelected branches of government that are deciding our most important issues, whether it’s the bureaucrats, whether it’s the courts, and as it relates to even religious liberty, even property rights, immigration, our voting rights, who gets to vote,” he said. 
Horowitz tackles the topic of “social transformation without representation” in his book “Stolen Sovereignty: How to Stop Unelected Judges From Transforming America.” 
“How did we get here?” Horowitz asked rhetorically. “And the sad reality is nobody ever voted for this. This was all foisted upon the people by unelected judges, the legal profession, and unelected bureaucrats. That is social transformation without representation, which, as Scalia warned, is something much worse than even taxation without representation that served as the impetus for our first American Revolution.” 
Same-sex marriage was mandated for the nation in 2015 by the bare 5-4 majority made up of Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and the late Antonin Scalia opposed it. 
The majority found in the Constitution a right to same-sex marriage, overturning millennia of established legal precedent regarding marriage as well as the will of tens of millions of voters in dozens of states. 
It elicited remarkably harsh criticism of the five justices in the U.S. Supreme Court majority. 
For one, two of the justices in the majority, Kagan and Ginsburg, were asked to recuse themselves from the case because they had openly advocated for same-sex marriage, apparently violating standards to preserve judicial impartiality. Without their votes, the case would have gone the other way. 
They refused. 
Then there was the U.S. Supreme Court’s own opinion just two years earlier, in the Defense of Marriage Act case, in which the court said states have exclusive power over marriage. 
And there also are those who point out that the Constitution doesn’t mention marriage but does dictate that everything not mentioned in the document is left to the states and the people. 
As WND reported , Ginsburg, who voted in favor of same-sex marriage, has performed same-sex wedding ceremonies and made supportive public statements. Justice Elena Kagan also has performed same-sex weddings and promoted “gay” rights at Harvard’s law school while she was at its helm. 
Critics contend the two justice appear to be violating judicial ethics rules that require recusal from a case in which there is even the appearance of a conflict of interest. 
The Foundation for Moral Law asked the justices to excuse themselves from the case, but they refused to acknowledge the request. The Foundation explained that Canon 3A(6) of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges provides: “A judge should not make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court.” 28 U.S.C. sec 455(a) mandates that a justice “shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.” 
Rabbi Jonathan Cahn, author of the New York Times bestseller “The Harbinger” and the inspiration behind the “Isaiah 9:10 Judgment” movie, has criticized the Supreme Court’s assumption that it has the authority to redefine marriage. 
At a prayer event in Washington, he said: “The justices of the Supreme Court took up their seats [in a hearing] on whether they should strike down the biblical and historic definition of marriage. That the event should even take place is a sign this is America of [George] Washington’s warning … a nation at war against its own foundation.” 
Washington warned the smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation “that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven itself hath ordained.” 
“Justices, can you judge the ways of God? There is another court and there is another judge, where all men and all judges will give account,” he warned. 
“If a nation’s high court should pass judgment on the Almighty, should you then be surprised God will pass judgment on the court and that nation? We are doing that which Israel did on the altars of Baal,” he said. 
See Jonathan’s Cahn’s message at Washington: Man of Prayer event at the Capitol. 
The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops is calling “same-sex marriage” an “intrinsic evil.” 
And officials from several counties in Tennessee have adopted statements opposing the Supreme Court. 
WND also reported when dozens of top legal scholars from the likes of Washington & Lee, Boston College, Kansas State, Notre Dame, University of Texas, Villanova, Vanderbilt, Hillsdale, University of Nebraska, Catholic University and Regent University issued a statement encouraging all state and federal officials to treat the Supreme Court’s recent creation of “same-sex marriage” as “anti-constitutional and illegitimate.” 
“It cannot … be taken to have settled the law of the United States,” said the statement from the American Principles Project . 
“We call on all federal and state officeholders: To refuse to accept Obergefell as binding precedent for all but the specific plaintiffs in that case. To recognize the authority of states to define marriage, and the right of federal and state officeholders to act in accordance with those definitions. To pledge full and mutual legal and political assistance to anyone who refuses to follow Obergefell for constitutionally protected reasons. To open forthwith a broad and honest conversation on the means by which Americans may constitutionally resist and overturn the judicial usurpations evidence in Obergefell.”",0

19175,CONFIRMED: Russia deploys Kuznetsov aircraft carrier to defend Syrian coast,"ALEXANDER MERCOURIS | THE DURAN R ussia’s use of its aircraft carrier in the Syrian conflict is principally intended to learn lessons for the design of more potent such warships in the future, rather than to change the situation in Syria itself. The Russian navy’s deployment of   aircraft carrier to the eastern Mediterranean has provoked a very confused response in the Western media. 
On the one hand it is described as a major escalation, as if   was a US style super carrier. On the other hand there has been a great of deal of derision , with the ship called an obsolete rust bucket dangerous mainly to its crew. Where does the truth lie? The Admiral Kuznetsov is the first and only Russian aircraft carrier capable of launching fighter aircraft conventionally. The preceding Kiev class carriers were smaller ships, which could only launch a small number of aircraft vertically. Contrary to what reports say, Admiral Kuznetsov is by the standards of navy carriers a relatively new ship. She was launched in 1985, commissioned in the then Soviet navy in 1990, but only became operational after prolonged trials in 1995. The US navy currently operates 10 Nimitz class supercarriers. If the age of a ship is determined by its date of launch; then three of the US navy’s Nimitz class supercarriers are older than Kuznetsov; if by date of commission, then five are; if by entry into service then six are. The Russian navy had no previous experience of operating carriers, so the lengthy time scale of her sea trials between commission and entry into service is not surprising. In addition what undoubtedly extended this period before her full entry into service was the political and economic crisis Russia experienced during the 1990s. Given the severity of this crisis, it is a wonder a ship as large and complicated as Kuznetsov was brought into service at all. Either way talk of Kuznetsov as some sort of archaic ship from a bygone era is exaggerated, whilst jokes about Kuznetsov being “….practically old enough to have been deployed in the 1905 Russo-Japanese war….” are simply silly. The Admiral Kuznetsov is expected to deploy off Syria, carrying 15 warplanes, including new MiG-29K/KUB fighters and the Su-33a, shown here. Aircraft carriers as it happens tend to be long-lived ships. Coral Sea, a US Medway class carrier, served in the US Navy from 1947 to 1990. By the standards of aircraft carriers Kuznetsov is not an old ship. What is true about Kuznetsov is that because she was the first of a type of ship of which the Russians had no previous experience, and because of the fraught period during which she was commissioned and brought into service – which made it impossible to sort out her teething problems properly – Kuznetsov suffers by comparison with US navy carriers from design flaws and from engine problems. The ship’s engines are unreliable, because they are insufficiently powerful for a ship of this size. The Russians when they built Kuznetsov lacked suitable nuclear reactors for this type of ship (they were designed for the intended follow-on Ulyanovsk carrier, which because of the 1990s crisis was however never built). They also lacked conventional engines large enough for a ship of this size, which was roughly twice as heavy as the largest other ship the Russian or Soviet navy had commissioned before. The Russians accordingly came up with a complicated solution of using multiple steam turbines and turbo-pressurised boilers to make up for the lack of power of the individual engines. Like all complicated arrangements, this arrangement is unreliable and prone to breakdown, with the engines experiencing stress especially in heavy seas. To compound the trouble with the engines, they were built by a plant in what is now independent Ukraine. As political relations between Russia and Ukraine deteriorated, servicing of the engines by this plant became increasingly erratic, and has now stopped completely. It is these problems with the engines that account for the practice of accompanying Kuznetsov on long range deployments with a tug. The tug in question – the Nikolai Chiker – is the most powerful tug in the world. This same tug played a key role in successfully hauling Kuznetsov’s uncompleted sister ship Varyag from Ukraine to China in 2005, where she has now become the Chinese carrier Liaoning. The fact Kuznetsov is accompanied by a tug on long range deployments has provoked some derision. However it is common practice in any navy to accompany large surface warships with service ships, and accompanying Kuznetsov with a tug ensures in Kuznetsov’s case that the carrier will get to where the Russian naval staff are sending it. The engine problems will not affect Kuznetsov’s Mediterranean deployment when the carrier finally reaches its position. Kuznetsov suffers from other problems, which are unsurprising given that Kuznetsov is so much bigger and so different to any other ship the Russian navy has ever previously commissioned, and the unhappy times when it was launched. The arduous deployment of the Russian flotilla. Everything is harder for the Russians. (BBC) There are for example known to be problems with Kuznetsov’s water pipes, which have a history of breakdowns and of freezing up in Arctic weather. These problems too however will not affect Kuznetsov’s capabilities as a warship when the carrier finally reaches the eastern Mediterranean, and the close proximity of Russian bases in Sevastopol and Tartus means they can be dealt with quickly if they arise. Once this deployment is ended Kuznetsov will go through a lengthy refit, which unlike previous refits is intended to be practically a rebuild. With Russia developing a new range of much larger and more powerful engines, Kuznetsov’s current unsatisfactory engines will finally be replaced, and the other teething problems like the problem with the water pipes will finally be addressed. Ultimately this is a potent warship, bigger than any other carrier other than those operated by the US navy, and once the refit is done it will be a powerful asset. In the meantime the ship already provides the Russian fleet with a carrier capability matched by no other navy apart from that of the US. 
The Russian carrier passing through the English Channel. In saying this it is important to stress however that the US navy carrier force – with its 10 nuclear powered supercarriers – dwarfs the capability of any other navy, including Russia’s, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Neither the Kuznetsov, nor any other carrier the Russians might build, nor any other navy, can match or rival it. A more pertinent criticism of Kuznetsov is that though Kuznetsov is a large ship (at 55,000 tonnes standard weight and with a 305 metre length Kuznetsov is midway between a US Medway class carrier and a US Forrestal class supercarrier) the air group it carries at 40-50 aircraft is relatively small (by comparison a smaller US Medway class carrier carried an air group of 75-80 aircraft in the 1980s). This suggests that Kuznetsov is inefficient in its use of its spaces, a fact which again reflects Russian inexperience designing this sort of ship when Kuznetsov was built. However it also partly reflects differences in Kuznetsov’s intended role. At the time Kuznetsov was built the Russians did not envisage using their carriers for the sort of long range carrier type operations carried out by the US navy. Unlike US navy supercarriers Kuznetsov prioritises air defence of the fleet rather than long range strikes. That explains why Kuznetsov’s fighter aircraft take off from the carrier using a ski jump rather than steam catapults. Ski jump takeoffs put less stress on the pilots and shorten takeoff times, enabling more aircraft to take off from the carrier more quickly, which can be important in an air defence situation. The penalty is that aircraft are limited in the loads they can carry by comparison with aircraft launched by steam catapults. For air defence – the purpose for which Kuznetsov was designed – this is unimportant since fighter aircraft carrying out air defence missions only carry light air to air missiles rather than heavy air to ground missiles and bombs. However it does significantly reduce the air group’s capability to carry out long range strikes. Combined with the relatively small size of the air group, this means that Kuznetsov’s ability to carry out long range ground strikes is fractional compared to that of a US navy supercarrier. If Kuznetsov is not really designed to carry out long range ground strikes, why are the Russians deploying Kuznetsov off the coast of Syria? The plan to deploy Kuznetsov to the eastern Mediterranean was made many months ago, long before the recent collapse in relations with the US over Syria. The decision therefore can have nothing to do with deterring the US from declaring a no fly zone over Syria, as some people are suggesting. Most likely the intention is to gain experience operating aircraft against ground targets from an offshore carrier. This is not something the Russians have ever done before. Even if Kuznetsov’s capability to do it by comparison with a US navy supercarrier is marginal, the fighting in Syria does at least give the Russians an opportunity to try it out to find out how it is done and what it involves. That way they can learn lessons that will help them with the design of the far more powerful ships that are to come (see here and here ). In other words the deployment of the Kuznetsov to the eastern Mediterranean is essentially a training exercise. It does not merit either the derision or the hype that has been created around it.",0

19177,’Alternative Facts’: The Media Finds a Meme for the ’Resistance’,"The political left and the mainstream media (but I repeat myself) still reeling from the results of the November election, found traction this weekend in the debate over crowd sizes with the new Trump administration. [For their purposes, it matters less what the Trump said, and even less what the crowd sizes were (or why) and more that they were able to create a common filter through which they will interpret subsequent events as they muster an opposition (pretentiously called “resistance”).  First, the facts. The crowd on Inauguration Day was massive, and from the front sections  —   where this reporter was lucky enough to have seats  —   it looked like the entire mall was full. Trump  —   and anyone else seeing the event from that vantage point  —   could be forgiven for thinking the crowd was at least a million strong, or more. Taking him to task for speculating about that was simply petty. Press Secretary Sean Spicer was correct: the media were trying to undermine the new president. At the same time, the crowd did not feel overwhelming. And that was partly by design. The left did its best to scare Trump supporters away by threatening violence. Furthermore, the timing (on a Friday) and the high price of traveling to, and staying in, Washington over a weekend kept many Trump fans at home. A good portion of the   protesters who came in from out of town had probably already booked their travel plans in anticipation of a Hillary Clinton win, driving prices up. The size of the crowds at the respective events was not an issue until the media made it one. In his combative statement to the press on Saturday, Spicer correctly noted that there were some media reports of crowd size that were clearly manipulative. The presence of additional security  —   again, required because of   threats  —   did slow entry onto the Capitol lawn and the Mall. (How easy the left often has it: threaten Republicans, then mock them in the media for taking you seriously!) Most Trump fans were probably happy to see Spicer take the media to task  —   especially over the false report that President Trump had removed a bust of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. from the Oval Office. That bogus story was undoubtedly motivated by the media’s continued quest to find evidence of racism in the Trump camp. It was classic fake news, a clean bust (no pun intended). So, naturally, media critics focused on the more dubious claim that Trump’s crowds had rivaled Obama’s. To make his case, Spicer presented what Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway later called “alternative facts”  —   a harmless, and accurate, term in a legal setting, where each side of a dispute will lay out its own version of the facts for the court to decide. In the heated debate, however, the term quickly became a   meme as a euphemism for “lying”  —   in much the way that a Bush aide inadvertently gave the mainstream media a badge of honor when he used the phrase “  community. ” Trump was not lying  —   nor were Spicer, or Conway. They were merely giving their version of events. But CNN and the New York Times explicitly said that Trump had made “false” claims, whether about crowd size or the media, even when his claims were clearly supportable opinion. It was not enough for journalists to find, and report, the facts independently, and let their readers or viewers decide. They decided to be argumentative  —   and laid down a marker, “Trump lied,” on Day One (or Two). In some ways, that was simply the media reverting to what they had done under the Bush administration, the last time they had to cover a Republican in power. We are likely to hear a lot more about “alternative facts” in the future, stripped of its original (benign) context and used as the foundation for an alternative reality. There is nothing even Trump can do to stop that. But the new administration could choose its battles more carefully, and perhaps learn to deliver rebukes with a smile. Joel B.

19178,Britain No Longer a Sovereign Democracy,"Home | World | Britain No Longer a Sovereign Democracy Britain No Longer a Sovereign Democracy By Anzu Legion 03/11/2016 13:41:13 
LONDON – England – Britain is no longer a sovereign democratic nation when 17.5 million people who voted for Brexit can be swept aside with illegal injunctions. 


When Britain is being ruled by those who wish harm upon these shores from foreign nations, and pander to other nations to invade, then there is no reason to believe that we are living in a democratic sovereign nation. 
This is the case when 17.5 million people voted on June 23 to leave the European Union, only to be overstepped by a few treasonous vipers who misled the High Court possibly due to corruption at the highest levels of the system. 
The EU referendum was a legally bound vote with promises from the political establishment that the result would be respected. 
To have the wrath of 17.5 million people on you will not be a nice thing, it will not be pleasant because the people never forget, and the coming election will result in some major changes. 
We are currently embroiled within a constitutional crisis, where the will of the people is being superseded by a few litigational scum bags who do not realise the enormity of their decision to thwart the will of the people. 
Boycott 
You have condemned all members of parliament who supported Remain to unemployment. You will never be voted in again, including Theresa May who shoehorned herself into the role of prime minister. 
Guyanese Gina Miller, who was instrumental in this decision is not even British, she is some investment banker cunt with no mandate to thwart the EU referendum. 
As for the judges involved, you have no right to undermine the will of the people. It is most certainly a question of corruption at the highest levels where these supposed upholders of law, are working against the law and undermining democracy and Britain’s sovereign rights. 
17.5 million people voted for Brexit and 17.5 million people will have their say in 2020 when the right people will be put in charge.

19179,The Passion of Martin Scorsese - The New York Times,"A’u2009man was on a train in Japan, reading a novel set in Japan. The train slid past the mountains, bound for Kyoto, where the man, bearded,   was headed. The year was 1989. The train was a bullet train. The man on the train was in a quandary, and the man in the novel he was reading was in a quandary and as he read the novel, it emerged that his quandary and the one in the novel were essentially the same. The man in the novel was Sebastian Rodrigues, a Portuguese Jesuit priest sent to Japan in the 17th century. He was there to minister to Japanese Catholics suffering under a brutal regime and also to find out what had happened to his mentor, a priest rumored to have renounced the faith under torture. The man on the train was Martin Scorsese. He was in Japan to play the part of Vincent van Gogh in a movie by Akira Kurosawa, another master filmmaker. He was also there to move past a brutal battle in America’s culture wars over a picture of his, “The Last Temptation of Christ. ” The film had been pilloried by conservative Christians for a dream sequence in which Christ has sex with Mary Magdalene. In depicting Christ’s life as a   struggle between his human and divine natures, Scorsese had intended to make a film that was at once an act of doubt and an act of faith. In the novel he was reading, the priest was shown profaning an image of Christ, and yet the act was an act of faith. The train slid past the mountains. Scorsese turned the pages. This novel spoke to him. All at once he saw it as a picture he would like to make. The novel was “Silence,” by Shusaku Endo, a Japanese convert steeped in European literature and the history of Catholicism in Japan. Published in Japan in 1966, “Silence” sold 800, 000 copies, a huge number in that country. Endo was called “the Japanese Graham Greene” and was considered for the Nobel Prize. Greene referred to “Silence” as “one of the finest novels of our time. ” The Jesuit missionary Francis Xavier brought Catholicism to Japan in 1549. In the next century, it was suppressed through the torture of missionaries and their followers, who were forced to apostatize by stepping on the fumie  —   a piece of copper impressed with an image of Christ. In “Silence,” Endo took the missionaries’ point of view, casting much of the novel in the form of letters by Rodrigues reporting back to his superior. He goes to Japan with another young priest, Francisco Garrpe, vowing to seek the truth about their mentor, Father Cristóvão Ferreira, but they are captured and shown the   reality of human suffering under torture. The shogunate invites the Japanese converts to avoid torture by stepping on the fumie. Many do some are tortured anyway. Rodrigues sees converts crucified, burned alive, drowned. A magistrate fluent in Christianity makes a grim proposal: Rodrigues can save the lives of the converts under torture if only he will step on the fumie and apostatize. When Scorsese returned from Japan, he procured the film rights to “Silence. ” As the years passed, hardly a day went by without his mentioning the project to the people around him: actors, friends and even his old parish priest, Father Principe. As he made “The Aviator” and “The Departed,” “Shutter Island” and “Hugo,” he insisted that “Silence” was the picture he really wanted to make. A Jesuit was elected pope Islamic terrorists began targeting Christians in the Middle East. In 2014, with “The Wolf of Wall Street” a hit, Scorsese declared that “Silence” would be his next picture: He wouldn’t commit to another until it was finished.   years in, filming began. What led this great American artist to make a story of missionaries in Japan his ultimate passion project? He is known for his gangster pictures he is a grandmaster of the profane. From the beginning, he has revealed himself to be an artist of intensely Catholic preoccupations, and the poisoned arrow of religious conflict runs straight through his career. “Taxi Driver”: a Vietnam vet as a spiritual avenger, bent on cleansing the city of filth through violence. “Cape Fear”: a tattooed fundamentalist determined to exact God’s justice. “Kundun”: a young man raised to be a spiritual master, thrust up against   communism. Even “Living in the Material World,” Scorsese’s documentary about George Harrison, takes as its theme the conflict between flesh and spirit, between Beatle and seeker. “Silence” is a novel for our time: It locates, in the missionary past, so many of the religious matters that vex us in the postsecular present  —   the claims to universal truths in diverse societies, the conflict between a profession of faith and the expression of it, and the seeming silence of God while believers are drawn into violence on his behalf. As material for Scorsese, then, “Silence” is apt, and yet Scorsese’s commitment to it has been extraordinary, even by his exacting standards. To understand that commitment, I spoke with the filmmaker, with members of the cast and the production team and with others who know the novel well  —   trying to grasp just what kind of an act of faith this film is. “I don’t know if there’s redemption, but there is such a thing as trying to get it right,” Scorsese said to me, in the ungentrified New York voice familiar from the cameos in his movies. “But how do you do it? The right way to live has to do with selflessness. I believe that. But how does one act that out? I don’t think you practice it consciously. It has to be something that develops in you  —   maybe through a lot of mistakes. ” He had invited me to his East Side townhouse at 9 p. m. having spent a full day editing “Silence” in Midtown. The living room,     is decorated with a vintage movie camera,   posters for Jean Renoir’s “The Grand Illusion” and photographs of his wife and daughter. He is 74, compact and gray, with tremendous life in his eyes and a youthful ardor that seems to have its source in reverence for his elders  —   like the Polish filmmaker Andrzej Wajda, who had signed a storyboard that Scorsese unhooked from the wall to show me. We took seats, and he began to talk. As the hours passed, the room, already dark, seemed to diminish around us, until it resembled a screening room, or a chapel, a place where questions of how to live are posed through stories and images. “It goes back to what Father Principe was telling me the last time I saw him, a couple of years ago,” he said. “Failing, doing something that is morally reprehensible, that is a great sin  —   well, many people will never come back from that. But the Christian way would be to get up and try again. Maybe not consciously, but you get yourself into a situation where you can make another choice. And that’s the situation Rodrigues is in”  —   he can choose to save the lives of others by renouncing his faith, the act he considers most reprehensible of all. “Silence,” no less than Scorsese’s informal New York trilogy  —   “Mean Streets,” “Taxi Driver,” “Raging Bull”  —   is rooted in his childhood. As a boy in Little Italy, he wanted to be a missionary. His parents were not religious, in part because their parents had felt the church’s heavy hand in Sicily, but for him the church  —   a malign force in so many    stories  —   was a portal to the world beyond family and neighborhood. “I trusted the church, because it made sense, what they preached, what they taught,” he said. “I understood that there’s another way to think, outside the closed, hidden, frightened, tough world I grew up in. ” The movies, likewise, pointed to the wider world. His father, a presser in the garment district, didn’t make much but always had enough money to take him to the movies. A local TV station broadcast Italian films on Friday nights. He grew up watching the crucial works of Italian neorealism, many of them with a strong Catholic dimension  —   like Roberto Rossellini’s “Rome, Open City,” in which a priest is executed for cooperating with the Resistance. The   Catholicism of the area was centered on street processions devoted to saints brought over from the old country: San Gandolfo for the Sicilians on Elizabeth Street, San Gennaro for the Neapolitans on Mulberry Street. “When I was there, it was already dying out,” Scorsese told me. It hooked him even so. The vast, vaulted interior of St. Patrick’s Old Cathedral on Mott Street was a sharp contrast to the family’s small apartment, the Latin Mass a formal counterpoint to their mealtime banter. “I think fast, I move fast, and I think it has something to do with the medication I was given for asthma,” Scorsese said. “It affected the way I breathe, the way I think. I needed to pull back. Film did that for me, and so did the church. They slowed me down. They allowed me to meditate. They gave me a different sense of time. ” Francis Principe, a young priest assigned to the neighborhood, brought faith and film together. “He was the one who opened up things for us,” Scorsese recalled. “Who said: ‘You don’t have to live this way. You don’t have to follow in this cultural cycle. You don’t have to get married at 21. ’’u2009” Scorsese had become an altar boy, and each year Principe would take the altar boys to a movie uptown  —   “Around the World in 80 Days,” “The Bridge on the River Kwai”  —   and sit talking about it with them afterward on the steps of the rectory on Mulberry Street. They went to the Roxy near Times Square to see the Gospel drama “The Robe” and then heard him put it down. “Father Principe detested Christian sentimentality or   religious aspects,” Scorsese said. “’u2009‘Oh, it’s so cliché,’ he said, meaning the thunder when Judas mentions his name  —   ‘My name is Judas,’ and there’s the thunder in stereophonic sound. To this day I haven’t heard thunder as good as that. ” And yet  —   at age 11  —   he conceived of the wish to do it differently, “to take the biblical epic to another place. ” Faith and film offset the asthma that kept him out of sports and off the streets. Indoors, he drew movie storyboards, including some, a few years later, for a life of Christ. “I set it right in the neighborhood,” he told me, “with the crucifixion taking place on the West Side piers and the N. Y. P. D. involved. Can you see it?” Indoors, he had a   seat for adult matters, especially his father’s dealings with a spendthrift uncle who seemed to take money from his father freely and with impunity to pay the loan shark. It was a pattern he knew from the Scripture passages read in church. “My brother’s keeper  —   it’s my brother’s keeper!” he said, chortling with recognition. “And it goes beyond your brother. Are we responsible for other people? What is our obligation, when somebody does something that is so upsetting? . .. Do you really have to do it because they’re a brother, or you’re related, or you made vows of marriage? What is the right thing to do for the other person, and for yourself? All of this carried through. I would see it acted out one way in reality, and I would hear it another way from Father Principe and a couple of priests at Cardinal Hayes. ” Cardinal Hayes is a high school in the Bronx, and after a year of minor seminary  —   a tryout for the priesthood once a regular stop for bright Catholic boys of limited means  —   Scorsese went there. (Don DeLillo, the novelist, was a few years ahead.) Rejected by Fordham University because of poor grades, Scorsese enrolled at N. Y. U. ’s Washington Square College and its film program. From there, he plunged into the ’60s: a concertgoer at the Fillmore East, an expatriate in England and Holland, an assistant director at Woodstock (he became an editor on the concert film) and then a maker of his own movies  —   “Who’s That Knocking at My Door,” about a young man in the suddenly liberated ’60s whose Catholic principles keep him out of bed with his girlfriend, and “Boxcar Bertha,” a film about a female   “free’er than most. ” When he returned to Little Italy in 1972 to make “Mean Streets,” some of the young men in his generation were stepping into the underworld roles their fathers had occupied. Early in the picture, Charlie, an   mobster played by Harvey Keitel, talks about going to confession in the old cathedral. He wishes he could choose his own penance instead of having one assigned by the priest. He gets his wish, in a way: It falls to him to look out for Johnny Boy, played by Robert De Niro  —   the lost boy of the neighborhood, a reckless gambler who puts them both in danger. Charlie becomes his brother’s keeper  —   and Charlie, eager to rise in the mob, lets his friend dangle without reaching out to the powerful uncle who could save him. Pauline Kael, in The New Yorker, struck a biblical note: “Charlie talks a lot to Johnny Boy about friendship and does nothing. He’s Judas the betrayer. ” It is striking to see the brother’  pattern show up at the other end of Scorsese’s career, in “Silence. ” As the two Jesuits set out for Japan, they find a translator named Kichijiro in a seedy neighborhood and drag him into their mission. He resists. He drinks himself sick. He lies. He bemoans his fate. A convert, he apostatized and was allowed to live, while the shogunate killed his brothers and sisters. Rodrigues decides that he is Kichijiro’s keeper and grimly bears up as Kichijiro apostatizes again and again and finally betrays him to the shogunate. But as Rodrigues is racked by doubts, the peasant becomes the priest’s keeper, a man whose faith is rooted in his recognition of his own weakness. Who is more Christlike: the person who is strong in faith or the one who is weak, who is humiliated? “Humiliation: That’s the key,” Scorsese told me. “As Kichijiro says in the movie: ‘Where is the place for a weak person in the world we’re in? Why wasn’t I born when there wasn’t any persecution? I would have been a great Christian. ’’u2009” For half a century, Scorsese has been a missionary for the cinema: making his own movies, promoting the work of great international directors, consolidating the history of the medium in a brilliant group of documentaries and advocating for the preservation of classics. Over time, this picture of his about a missionary adventure became a mission in its own right, and the act of getting it made became an act of faith. “I knew he had this script and was terribly disappointed that he couldn’t get it made,” Irwin Winkler, who produced “Raging Bull” and “Goodfellas,” told me. “And I thought, What a sad state Hollywood is in when Martin Scorsese, with all his success, with all the honors he’s gotten, can’t get a movie made. ” There began an intense collective effort guided by Emma Tillinger Koskoff, the film’s producer, to make the project materialize. Winkler worked through dozens of legal disputes attached to the project. Randall Emmett, a producer, secured new funding, and in 2013 Scorsese and some associates went to Cannes and returned with $21 million in distribution commitments. “I don’t think he’d ever done that before,” Koskoff told me, “but for this picture he has done a lot of things he hadn’t done before. ” He would direct the picture without a fee. All the principal actors  —   Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver, Liam Neeson  —   have   pedigrees but would work for Screen Actors Guild “scale” or for greatly reduced fees (“a pittance,” Neeson called it, uncomplainingly). Paramount Pictures signed on as the U. S. distributor in 2014. Koskoff and the production designer Dante Ferretti scouted locations in Vancouver, Montreal, the Pacific Northwest and New Zealand. After four trips to Taiwan, they decided that Taiwan it would be  —   for eight months. In all, 750 people, cast and crew and production team, would put their faith in Scorsese’s act of faith. “Silence” is a novel about “the necessity of belief fighting the voice of experience,” as Scorsese has put it. To get the Jesuits’ beliefs right, he engaged the Rev. James Martin, an author and editor at large of the Jesuit weekly America. Filmmaker and priest had several colloquies at Scorsese’s home, and Martin worked intensively with Garfield and Driver. Just as De Niro learned to box for “Raging Bull,” they familiarized themselves with the rites and disciplines of the Jesuit priesthood to bring authenticity to their performances. Garfield, known for his role in two “ ” movies, prepared to play Father Rodrigues by entering fully into the process that Jesuits call “spiritual direction. ” Raised outside London, with a secular Jewish father, Garfield developed his character by undergoing the “Spiritual Exercises” of St. Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Jesuit order. The exercises, devised in the 1520s, invite the “exercitant” to use his imagination to place himself in the company of Jesus, at the foot of the cross, among tormented souls in hell. Garfield met with Martin for spiritual direction, and they swapped reflections via email and Skype. Then he set out for St. Beuno’s, a Jesuit house in Wales, to undertake a   silent retreat. “If I’d had 10 years, it wouldn’t have been enough to prepare for this role,” Garfield told me. “I got totally swept up in all things Jesuit and very taken with Jesuit spirituality. The preparation went on for nearly a year, and by the time we got to Taiwan, it was bursting out of me. ” It’s not unusual for performers to allude vaguely to their spirituality. But Garfield describes the process with guileless specificity. “On retreat, you enter into your imagination to accompany Jesus through his life from his conception to his crucifixion and resurrection. You are walking, talking, praying with Jesus, suffering with him. And it’s devastating to see someone who has been your friend, whom you love, be so brutalized. ” Before Garfield left for Taiwan, Martin gave him a cross he had received as a gift while a Jesuit novice. “Andrew got to the point where he could   a Jesuit,” Martin told me. “There were places in the script where he would stop and say, ‘A Jesuit wouldn’t say that,’ and we would come up with something else. ” “I don’t think I am called to be a priest,” Garfield said to me resolutely, as if making this film had spurred him to consider the prospect. “But I had the feeling that I was being called to something: called to work with one of the great directors, and called to this role as something I had to pursue for my spiritual development. ” Driver has played the unreliable boyfriend in “Girls” and the villainous Kylo Ren in “Star Wars: The Force Awakens. ” To play Francisco Garrupe (Garrpe in the novel) Rodrigues’s slightly more skeptical companion, Driver, who was raised a Baptist in Indiana, worked by analogy. “This movie is the story of a crisis of faith,” he said, and explained that he tried to apply the ideas of faith and doubt generally. “It could be faith in your work, in the project or in a marriage it could be doubts about the work or the project or the marriage. When you think about it that way, it’s very relatable. ” So he related to faith and doubt  —   and he lost nearly a third of his weight for the role. “  pounds,” he told me over black coffee. “It’s about control, and as an actor you want to have control. But it’s also about suffering: It gives you information you can use in the role. ” He lost the weight over four and a half months, supervised by a nutrition coach. Early on, he spent a week at St. Beuno’s. Garfield was already two days into his retreat when Driver arrived at the place, a Victorian Gothic pile where the Jesuit poet Gerard Manley Hopkins was once in residence. Pledged to silence, the two actors waved when they spied each other in the refectory. Liam Neeson, raised Catholic in Ireland, brought to “Silence” the insights he gained during “The Mission,” Roland Joffé’s 1986 film about Jesuit adventures in South America. Daniel Berrigan, the Jesuit poet and pacifist, was an adviser to that picture and celebrated Mass with the actors  —   Neeson, De Niro, Jeremy Irons  —   on location in Colombia. Neeson told me: “I remember Father Dan saying, ‘Do you know that Stanislavski based his “Exercises” for actors on the “Spiritual Exercises” of St. Ignatius?’ I’d come all this way to hear that! That had a real effect on me. ” This time, in Taiwan to play Father Ferreira  —   the older Jesuit who apostatized after being tortured  —   Neeson underwent a simulacrum of the torture, suspended upside down by ropes over a pit of excreta. The Japanese actor Yoshi Oida, determined to do his best to play a character crucified in the sea, hung on a cross as a wave machine pushed rising tides of water over him. Oida was 82. By the time Driver filmed his final scene  —   in which Garrupe, long unseen, staggers into view, starved by his captors  —   he was hallucinating from hunger. “I did the scene and hopped on a plane to New York to do a table reading for ‘Girls,’’u2009” he told me, and then began a regimen of triple breakfasts at a diner in Brooklyn. A. O. Scott, now a chief film critic for The New York Times, once wrote that Scorsese approaches filmmaking as “a priestly avocation, a set of spiritual exercises embedded in technical problems. ” So it was with “Silence. ” “Marty insists on having silence on the set,” Garfield told me. “The silence says: ‘Something is happening here. ’’u2009” Scorsese arranged the shooting script chronologically, so the cast could feel the characters’ emotions in sequence. Finally Garfield reached the scene in which Rodrigues steps on the fumie, profaning the God he believes in and renouncing the faith he has come halfway across the world to preach. Actor and director prepared the shot: a bare foot pressed to a piece of copper, the face of Christ worn smooth by the feet of countless apostates before him. “It’s something we had both waited for,” Garfield said, “but Marty had waited much longer  —   he had waited decades to film that scene. ” The director was ready the priest stepped  —   and then there was a technical difficulty. “I almost lost my mind, and I think Marty did, too,” Garfield recalled. “He wanted it to be done in one take. ” There was a second take, and the priest profaned the image of Christ once and for all. Step by step, “Silence” got made. The picture Scorsese saw in his head on the bullet train took 27 years and $46. 5 million to realize. “All in God’s good time,” he said to me philosophically as we sat together in his house in the near dark. It was one o’clock in the morning. “We don’t know why, but this is how this picture got made. It had to be this way. ” Scorsese could speak philosophically, because he had been through all this before. A passion project, religious in nature, based on a novel delays, funding difficulties and reluctance among studio executives: Such was “The Last Temptation of Christ,” his adaptation of the novel by Nikos Kazantzakis. When the novel was published in Athens in 1955, its conceit  —   that Jesus felt a temptation to climb down from the cross and live an earthly life with Mary Magdalene  —   was seen as a challenge to conservative Christianity, represented by the Greek Orthodox Church. By the time it reached the United States in English translation, the ’60s were on, and the novel was taken up by the counterculture as a template for religious illumination through carnal knowledge. Scorsese read the novel in the ’70s after it was given to him by Barbara Hershey and David Carradine, the two stars of “Boxcar Bertha. ” By the time he set to making a movie adaptation, it was the Reagan era, and the novel was again seen as a challenge to conservative Christianity, then at full volume. Scorsese’s stated aims for the picture were straightforward. He wanted to give the Gospel story a contemporary accent, the way great artists like Caravaggio had done. And he wanted to fulfill his childhood vision and take the biblical epic to a different place. But the project soon turned complicated beyond belief. After committing to the picture in 1983, Paramount Pictures began to have doubts. Scorsese shrank the shooting schedule (planned for Israel) and the budget, agreeing to forgo his fee. As fundamentalist Christian leaders got wind of the project, they organized a hostile   campaign against Paramount’s parent company, Gulf and Western. Salah Hassanein, the head of United Artists, then the     chain, declared that U. A. wouldn’t show the picture on its screens, citing trouble with “The Life of Brian” and other   films, as well as with a film called “Mohammed: Messenger of God” that had prompted bomb threats. In an agonizing meeting with Scorsese and studio executives, Paramount’s chief, Barry Diller, canceled the picture. By now Scorsese’s intentions for it were a good deal more complicated. “I told him that God can’t be only in the hands of the churches,” he later said, recalling the meeting with Hassanein. “There are so many obstacles in between us and the spirit. In a sense, to make this film was to try to make God accessible to people in the audience who feel alienated from the churches. I said: ‘I have had three divorces. Does this mean I can’t speak to God because the church says I can’t? No, no! I can talk for myself because I’m me. ’’u2009” Angry and restive, he took on two projects initiated by others: “After Hours,” set in Lower Manhattan, and “The Color of Money,” a   drama starring Paul Newman and Tom Cruise. “The Color of Money” grossed $52 million: the biggest hit he’d ever had. Emboldened, he switched agents  —   to Newman’s agent, Michael Ovitz, the head of Creative Artists Agency. “Mike said: ‘What is it you want to get done? What is the film you really want to get made?’ I said, ‘The Last Temptation of Christ.’ And he said, ‘O. K.’ And I said, ‘I’ve heard that before. ’’u2009” Ovitz swiftly got “Last Temptation” greenlighted at Universal. Scorsese filmed in Morocco with Willem Dafoe as Jesus, Harvey Keitel as Judas, David Bowie as Pontius Pilate and Barbara Hershey as Mary Magdalene. What happened next still stands as a central episode in the culture wars. As Scorsese worked round the clock to edit the picture, the religious right moved against it. Donald Wildmon, a   instigator and head of the American Family Association, organized a picketing campaign at Universal Pictures in Los Angeles. The Rev. R. L. Hymers Jr. of the Baptist Tabernacle of Los Angeles did the same outside the home of Lew Wasserman, the chairman of MCA, which owned Universal. The leader of the Campus Crusade for Christ, Bill Bright, offered to buy the film from Universal in order to destroy it. Universal moved up the film’s release date and took out   newspaper ads in its support. In an interview with reporters in Rome, the Italian director Franco Zeffirelli, who hadn’t seen the movie, called it “truly horrible and completely deranged. ” Reports attributed to him a remark that the movie was the product of Hollywood’s “Jewish scum. ” Zeffirelli denied this, but the notion took root that the movie was the sinister work of a cabal of Jewish movie executives conspiring against the Christian faith. The day the film had its premiere at the Ziegfeld  —   Aug. 12, 1988  —   hundreds of picketers were there. So were several television news crews. “After the premiere,” Scorsese recalled to me, “a group of us went to dinner at the Regency hotel. ” The group included Universal executives the celebrated director Michael Powell Scorsese’s longtime editor and collaborator, Thelma Schoonmaker and prominent Christians who had supported the movie. Paul Moore, the Episcopal bishop of New York, had written a letter to The New York Times declaring that the movie dramatized the core church teaching that Jesus is both fully human and fully divine. At the Regency, Moore told Scorsese about a book he should read. The next day he had it sent over: “Silence,” by Shusaku Endo. In Egypt, Syria, Pakistan, China, and elsewhere, the persecution of Christians  —   often to the point of martyrdom  —   is real and continuing. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, the word “martyr” has taken on awful new connotations. “Silence,” then, is inadvertently topical. Like the novel, the picture interrogates the very idea of Christian martyrdom, by proposing that there are instances when martyrdom  —   the believer holding fast to Christ to the bitter end  —   is not holy or even right. It makes in the way of art the arguments made in defense of “Last Temptation”: that an act can’t be fully understood if the intentions behind it aren’t taken into account, and that a seeming act of profanation can be an act of devotion if done out of an underlying faith. At a dramatic moment in the novel, Rodrigues hears the cries of Christians who are being tortured outside his cell. He has been told that he can save their lives if he will step on the fumie. He agonizes. He prays. He feels the offer as a temptation. Weary, hungry, surrounded by suffering and death, he hears a voice he takes to be Jesus: “Trample! It was to be trampled on by men that I was born into this world. ” “The novel poses a very profound theological question,” Peter C. Phan, a Catholic theologian at Georgetown who was born in Vietnam, told me. “The question is this: Are we allowed to do an essentially evil act to obtain a good result? If it is done to save himself, then the answer is no. But the novel is so complex because he does it for his followers, for the good end of saving his flock. He will go to hell  —   but he will go to hell for their sake. ” Rodrigues tramples on the fumie. Because his intention is right  —   to save the lives of others  —   the act seems right. And because it entails the sacrifice of his exalted sense of himself, it seems a Christian act, a loss of self for others’ sake. The novel doesn’t work through theological questions so scholastically. Rather, it enfolds them within other questions: whether missionary activity is ipso facto a form of imperialism, and whether the content of a religious faith is lost in translation when it is promulgated in a new language in a new land. Should the church adapt to particular cultures, or should it maintain an approach distinctively its own? In Christian theology, that is a question of “inculturation. ” Since the Council of Jerusalem  —   when the apostles, Jews by birth, clashed over whether new Christians should be held to Jewish law  —   the history of Christianity has turned on questions of inculturation. The brilliance of “Silence” is that it shows how these questions increase and multiply. The young Jesuits seem to favor inculturation, adopting peasant dress, taking the sacraments directly to the people and calling their hut “the monastery. ” A magistrate  —   a figure akin to Dostoyevsky’s Grand Inquisitor  —   tells Rodrigues that Christianity cannot take root in the “swamp” that is Japan. When Rodrigues finally meets him, Ferreira concurs. The converts? They are breakaway Buddhists, the apostate priest says they worship the “Sun of God,” not the Son of God. Those martyrs, dying upside down in the pit? They didn’t die for Christ, he tells Rodrigues, they died for you. For all that, “Silence” is itself a complex act of inculturation  —   a novel, featuring a European priest’s point of view, that could not have been written by anyone but a Japanese. The fumie, too, is an expression of inculturation, a point developed in a new book by the artist Makoto Fujimura. It is an image of God devised by the shogunate for the purpose of abuse, but over the course of the novel, it becomes an authentic image of Christ. Under threat, the converts abuse it. They renounce their faith. But that doesn’t mean they stop believing. They keep “hidden faith” in mysterious ways. Scorsese’s own body of work is a strong argument for inculturation, in that he instinctively finds religious patterns and images in modern, urban, vulgar, dispirited society. His “Silence” is an act of cultural adaptation (some would call it appropriation) to the third degree: Here an   Catholic adapts a Japanese Catholic’s novel about Portuguese Catholics for a Hollywood movie  —   arguably American culture’s most distinctive art form. And yet Scorsese’s “Silence” suggests that inculturation of the usual kind is impossible. Instead, it makes vivid the idea that the act called apostasy can be a shrewd adaptation of religious faith to a hostile culture, and that faith maintained in spite of a believer’s outward acts of apostasy is faith nonetheless. The question the novel comes down to, then, is this: “Are you a Christian?” This question, posed by Garrpe to the peasant Kichijiro, is one that Rodrigues must answer for himself before he approaches the fumie, and long after he tramples on it. It is a question that cannot be answered for the   believer by the church, or a mentor, or society. The novel is not about a missionary’s struggle with a hostile culture. When the magistrate says as much, Rodrigues denies it: “’u2009‘No, no . . . ’ Unconsciously the priest raised his voice as he spoke. ‘My struggle was with Christianity in my own heart. ’’u2009” Before it opens in New York and Los Angeles in December, “Silence” will be screened in Rome for several hundred Jesuits and for cinephiles at the Vatican. It’s no stretch to suppose that Pope Francis, a Jesuit himself, will find a way to be there. Scorsese assuredly will be there, and it’s striking to envision him sitting in the dark with the pope as his new picture plays. Their boyhoods were a lot alike: Six years older, Jorge Mario Bergoglio was brought up in Buenos Aires in a family of Italian immigrants who took him to the movies often, and he grew up cherishing Italian cinema, especially Fellini’s “La Strada”  —   “a film about the possibility of sainthood,” Scorsese calls it. I asked Scorsese how he would describe his work to Pope Francis. He paused, then replied, “I would say that I’ve tried, in my work, to find out how to live life  —   tried to explore what our existence really is and the meaning of it. ” One day not long ago, Scorsese stepped out of a black car in front of the old cathedral. He had on an overcoat, a scarf and a   hat. He tightened the scarf, pulled the hat low and stood near the graveyard adjoining the cathedral. “We used to play    right here,” he said. “You could hide behind the gravestones. You knew which ones were the right size for you. ” Little Italy today is largely symbolic territory, like the Vatican within Italy. The old Ravenite Social Club  —   a headquarters for the Gambino crime syndicate  —   is now a Cydwoq “ . ” Chinatown, once south of Canal Street, extends most of the way up Mott Street. At the Catholic churches, Mass is offered in Vietnamese and Cantonese. Scorsese looked up Mott Street toward Houston Street. “Where the Korean restaurant is, that used to be a   house. Past it was a funeral home. The funeral procession would come out and bear the coffin along the sidewalk here and into the cathedral. I remember two kids from the neighborhood, 16 or 17  —   they died of cancer, and the families had to be carried from the funeral home to the church, they were so devastated. It was terrible. I’ll never forget it. ” Inside the old cathedral, it became clear how literally Scorsese has never forgotten  —   not the splendor of the church, nor the presence of suffering and death, sin and redemption, nearby. The pastor pointed out the details of a renovation: the saints retouched in their original colors, the marble and brass altar fixtures restored to the way they were before a 1970 modernizing effort. Scorsese, who left the neighborhood in 1965, didn’t need a guide. He knew every inch of the place. “Picture an    boy standing right here in a white cassock, reciting a prayer in Latin,” he mused aloud. “That’s me. ” The closing scenes of his “Silence” follow Rodrigues through the decades after he apostatizes. A priest no more, Rodrigues represents the shogunate in its dealings with traders from Europe. What is his inner life? What does he believe? Working from the imagination rather than from the text of the novel, Scorsese found a final image, subtle but not cryptic, for the character’s position  —   and it’s an image that suggests the nature of Scorsese’s own engagement with matters of faith. I asked him to draw a connection between “Silence” and what he was seeing in the old cathedral. He tapped his forehead with two fingers. “The connection is that it has never been interrupted. It’s continuous. I never left. In my mind, I am here every day. ”",0
19180,Police Depts. Paid AT&T Millions To Scrutinize Our Texts & Chats: EFF,"  Edmondo Burr in News , US // 0 Comments Adam Schwartz, a senior lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). explains how the government spies on people using a powerful phone surveillance tool built by AT&T called Hemisphere. 
Every day AT&T stores billions of call records and sells the information to Sheriff’s and police departments around the country who each pay upward of $1 million a year for the communications metadata. 
In his article AT&T Requires Police to Hide Hemisphere Phone Spying Schwartz says law enforcement officials kept Hemisphere “ under the radar ” for many years—hidden from courts, legislators, and the general public—until the New York Times exposed the program in 2013. 
Democracy Now interviews Adam Schwartz: 
New details are emerging about how AT&T has been spying on Americans for profit with a secret plan called Project Hemisphere. 
The Daily Beast reports AT&T is keeping private call records and selling the information to authorities investigating everything from the war on drugs to Medicaid fraud. 
AT&T reportedly has been retaining every call, text message, Skype chat or other communication that has passed through its infrastructure. Some of the records date back to 1987. 
Sheriff’s and police departments each pay upward of $1 million a year for access to the call records. 
No warrants are needed, and AT&T requires governmental agencies to keep secret the source of the information. 
JUAN GONZÁLEZ : Well, all of this comes as new details are emerging about how AT&T has been spying on Americans for profit. The secret plan is called Project Hemisphere. The Daily Beast reports AT&T is keeping private call records and selling the information to authorities investigating everything from the war on drugs to Medicaid fraud. AT&T reportedly has been retaining every call, text message, Skype chat or other communications that passed through its infrastructure. Some of the records date back to 1987. Sheriff and police departments across the country each pay upwards of a million dollars a year for access to the call records. No warrants are needed, and AT&T requires governmental agencies to keep secret the source of information. 
AMY GOODMAN : A 2014 statement of work from AT&T to the city of Atlanta published by The Daily Beast outlines the secrecy AT&T demanded. It reads, quote, “[T]he Government agency agrees not to use the data as evidence in any judicial or administrative proceedings unless there is no other available and admissible probative evidence. The Government Agency shall make every effort to insure that information provided by the Contractor is non-attributable to AT&T if the data is provided to a third-party.” 
Well, for more, we want to bring in Adam Schwartz to this conversation, senior lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. His latest article , “AT&T requires police to hide Hemisphere phone spying.” 
So, explain. What is this Project Hemisphere? 
ADAM SCHWARTZ : [inaudible] the largest known, possibly the biggest, database of telephone metadata that the government is using to spy on us. Every day, the database grows by literally 4 billion records. As you said, it has records going back to the 1980s. And police are using powerful algorithms to scrutinize this database of everyone that we are having telephone and other digital communications with, to discover our personal relationships, whether we’re talking to a psychiatrist or a criminal defense lawyer or a union organizer on the telephone. We view this as a menace to our privacy. And one of the most disturbing features of it is how it has been kept a secret, so that the public and the courts and Congress cannot scrutinize this program and decide whether we even want it. 
JUAN GONZÁLEZ : Well, and how are they able to do this? Why are they not—why are the law enforcement agencies not required to have court-ordered subpoenas to obtain these records? 
ADAM SCHWARTZ : Well, that’s a great question. Under federal statutes that protect our privacy, ordinarily, the police do have to go to a judge and get some kind of approval before they get this metadata of who we’re talking to. What AT&T has required the police to do, through the provision of the contract that you just read, is what the police call “parallel construction” and what the EFF calls “evidence laundering.” And what this means is, after the police find evidence against someone in the Hemisphere database, they “wall it off,” quote-unquote from their training manual, and then they use a traditional subpoena to recreate the exact same evidence trail. And when it comes time to put the person on trial, they present the second set of cleaner evidence, and no one is the wiser that they were using this massive, disturbing digital database to spy on all Americans, including the criminal suspect. 
JUAN GONZÁLEZ : But wouldn’t there be a requirement for the company to at least notify their consumers that they’re participating in something like this? 
ADAM SCHWARTZ : Yeah, unfortunately, there isn’t. You know, AT&T, in its public comments about Hemisphere, has suggested they are merely responding to government requests for information, the same way that all kinds of providers of consumer services have to respond. In fact, as we see through the contract that AT&T wrote, which came to light earlier this week in The Daily Beast, it is AT&T who was demanding of government that the program be kept a secret. We don’t know what AT&T’s motive is to demand the secrecy. Perhaps it’s because AT&T is literally making millions of dollars a year from government agencies in exchange for providing this unique database of telephone records to the police for their scrutiny. 
AMY GOODMAN : So the police might pay up to—one police department somewhere might pay like a million dollars to get this information? 
ADAM SCHWARTZ : Yeah, just to be clear, there is a task force of federal, state and local officials called the HIDTAs, the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas, and it is funded by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. And the HIDTAs have three regional centers across the country, where AT&T employees are posted along with DEA agents and other law enforcement. And that is the entry point for law enforcement to the AT&T Hemisphere database. And the funding is a little bit shadowy, but it is clear that at one of these three HIDTA centers, White House funds, to the tune of a million dollars a year, are going to the HIDTA, in turn, going to AT&T. So it’s not a million dollars from each agency, but it is millions of dollars in total. 
JUAN GONZÁLEZ : And, Adam Schwartz, am I correct on this, that AT&T is not—does not only provide information on their own customers, but on other carriers who possibly may be going through the AT&T infrastructure, as well? 
ADAM SCHWARTZ : That’s exactly correct. Any consumer, whether they are not—whether or not they are with AT&T, when a call goes through an AT&T switch, it goes into the Hemisphere database. So, for example, if you’re using roaming, away from your own carrier’s network, and you’re using AT&T’s network, then your call goes into the Hemisphere database—again, 4 billion records per day from American consumers and for international calls into the Hemisphere database. 
AMY GOODMAN : And the significance of broadband internet providers having to ask permission if they want to sell customers’ private data to third parties, the ruling that was just adopted Thursday by the FCC? 
ADAM SCHWARTZ : You know, I think that the critical principle here is that consumers should have control over their data, and corporations should not be diverting that data for their own profit reasons. We think that a program like— 
AMY GOODMAN : That they could sell it to other companies, you’re saying. They could—not only to police agencies, but to corporations, they could sell your—you know, our texts to each other. 
ADAM SCHWARTZ : Right. The ruling yesterday from the FCC, which the Electronic Frontier Foundation was strongly in support of and lobbied for, says that they have to get each individual consumer’s permission before they divert their private information to anything other than providing the standard broadband service. So there’s a parallel between that issue and the Hemisphere issue, which is that, you know, consumers have a right to privacy. And AT&T should not be undermining that privacy, in the case of Hemisphere, by creating the world’s biggest, if—or one of the world’s biggest databases to allow the government to scrutinize our private relationships based on who we are having digital correspondence with. 
JUAN GONZÁLEZ : And, Craig Aaron of Free Press, your sense of how this information on the Hemisphere program—whether this is going to become now part of the overall discussions on AT&T’s increased market power if it has this merger? 
CRAIG AARON : I think it has to be. You know, this is just yet another example of why we can’t trust AT&T and its promises. And, you know, I think it’s very concerning that AT&T is literally, you know, putting employees right alongside sitting law enforcement to willingly mine their data, to help them out and then sell it. So they’re taking their own customers’ private information, selling it back to the government for a hefty profit, while violating their privacy. So, this is the kind of company AT&T is. You know, EFF has exposed for years and years and years, through their legal work, everything AT&T has been up to supporting the DEA, the NSA, etc. I think this is something to be concerned about, when a company gets even bigger and when a company is about to take over a major news network. Who’s going to hold AT&T accountable when these kind of stories are out there? Are we going to even hear about them? 
AMY GOODMAN : We want to thank you both for being with us, Craig Aaron, president and CEO of Free Press, and Adam Schwartz of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Of course, we’ll continue to follow this. The decision is not finally made. In fact, Craig Aaron, just what’s the timetable on this? 
CRAIG AARON : I think this merger, we’re probably talking about a year, which means this is a decision that’s going to be made by the next presidential administration, by the Justice Department, which gives us time to organize, but it’s very, very important that we get started now, because this is going to be a fight that will be going well into next year. 
AMY GOODMAN : Well, thanks so much to both of you. This is Democracy Now! When we come back, we head to North Dakota to the standoff at Standing Rock. Well over a hundred people were once again arrested yesterday, as Native Americans and their allies faced off against a heavy—a heavily militarized police department. Stay with us.",0
19181,‘Jason Bourne’ Is the Top Movie in North America Over the Weekend - The New York Times,"LOS ANGELES  —   “Jason Bourne” easily won the latest box office race, but the posse in “Bad Moms” more than held its own. It was the first Bourne movie in nine years to star Matt Damon, and his   return helped “Jason Bourne” collect a stout $60 million over the weekend at North American theaters  —   roughly 50 percent more than initial results for “The Bourne Legacy,” which was released in 2012 and starred Jeremy Renner. Nonetheless, turnout for “Jason Bourne” (Universal) was lighter than for Mr. Damon’s previous two outings in the lead role. “The Bourne Ultimatum” arrived to about $80 million in ticket sales in 2007, after accounting for inflation. “The Bourne Supremacy” had about $67 million in 2004. Overseas, “Jason Bourne,” which cost about $120 million to make, collected an additional $50. 1 million, a strong result. “Star Trek Beyond” (Paramount) was second at the domestic box office, taking in an estimated $24 million, for a   total of $105. 7 million, according to comScore, which compiles ticketing data. The raunchy comedy “Bad Moms,” which cost STX Entertainment and its financing partners about $20 million to make, arrived to $23. 4 million in ticket sales. Starring Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn (in what many critics described as a breakout performance) “Bad Moms” received an A grade in CinemaScore exit polls, the first   comedy to achieve that result since “The Hangover” in 2009. Coincidentally  —   or not  —   “Bad Moms” and “The Hangover” were both written by the screenwriting duo of Jon Lucas and Scott Moore. “Bad Moms” attracted an audience that was overwhelmingly female (82 percent) STX said on Sunday. If positive word of mouth can persuade men to attend in the coming weeks, as STX hopes, “Bad Moms” could well become a sleeper hit.",0

The Al-Mayadeen satellite TV channel reported, that extremists applied projectiles rigged with chemical agents. The region of Al-Hamdaniya was struck. A military academy which is under control of the government forces is situated there. Both civilians and military men got poisoned. Later, Zahir al-Hajw, head of the Aleppo province forensic medicine, noted that symptoms of those injured evidence the use of chlorine. '41 people were delivered to hospitals after the attack. Among the symptoms are watery eyes, frothing at the mouth, vomit, nausea. There are mild and moderate severity categories. For the moment no one has been discharged from the hospital,' he said. The UN Envoy to Syria Staffan de Mistura had already expressed his indignation at the acts of the so-called opposition.

19183,Illegitimate Stock Markets Back Hillary,"Illegitimate Stock Markets Back Hillary By Daily Bell Staff - November 01, 2016 
The Stock Market Has a Favorite in the Election … On the evening of Sept. 26, two interesting things happened. First, Hillary Clinton won a decisive debate victory over Donald Trump in the first presidential debate, as judged by prediction markets (and later, by polls). Second, financial markets abruptly experienced large, abnormal swings. Economists Justin Wolfers and Eric Zitzewitz have documented this extraordinary convergence in a new paper, titled “What do financial markets think of the 2016 election?” – Bloomberg 
This Bloomberg article actually questions conclusions regarding stock market support for Hillary, but adds: “So Wolfers and Zitzewitz make a strong case.” 
Indeed the study has attracted a lot of attention, though one of the reasons is obviously because it is a pro-Hillary study and apt to be picked up by the mainstream media. 
The larger question, of course, is why equity markets would find an anti-freedom, pro-war candidate attractive. 
More: 
The most likely explanation is that financial markets think a Clinton victory would be good for the economy …. 
We saw some of the opposite happen when stock markets plunged on Friday, immediately after an announcement by FBI Director James Comey that the agency was reviewing new evidence in a probe related to its investigation of Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server while she was secretary of state. 
Why would markets not like Trump? Well, it’s pretty obvious. Trump’s mercurial temperament, unconventional ideas and lack of governing experience would create large doubts about the direction of all sorts of government policy — just the sort of thing that makes investors uneasy. 
This really doesn’t make much sense. On almost every front, Bill and Hillary Clinton’s actions over decades have been inimical to freedom. If investing and trade thrive in free-market environments, then markets should not reflect a pro-Clinton bias. 
The reason that markets are pro-Clinton is probably because markets – especially stock markets – are not expressions of free markets. That sounds strange because stock markets, especially, are seen as expressions of capitalism. 
Of course “capitalism” is not necessarily an appropriate nomenclature but that’s an article for another day. 
The point is that corporations and the stocks that offer investment opportunities are not necessarily any more legitimate than central banks. Neither corporations nor central banks are “normal” expressions of a free-market system. 
Central banks fix the price and value of “money” via interest rate manipulation. This price fixing has the force of law. If you don’t obey – or agree – you can end up in prison. 
Corporations are artificial entities that the founders of the US greatly feared. (See here and here ). Before the Civil War corporations were almost non-existent. 
Corporations are also the outcome of government force. They are in existence because of intellectual property laws, corporate personhood, monopoly central banking and regulations that prop them up. 
Without significant government support, modern corporations would not exist and neither would their “stocks.” 
The titanic nature of modern corporations is the outcome of government manipulation. The “investment” opportunities presented by such quasi-government monopolies would not be viable in a normal free-market environment. 
People simply don’t realize how distorted modern economies are. They are entirely artificial creations, dependent on state-enforced central banking and industrial monopolies. 
And this is why “stock markets” prefer the Clintons in this election cycle. It’s because large industries depend on government to sustain their artificial competitive advantages. 
One can certainly speculate what a real free-market would look like within the context of stock markets. Probably such markets would be a good deal smaller and oriented toward a select clientele rather than a mass audience of “investors.” 
Most people would make their living in the trades or in others ways that were directly in demand. Societies would probably be more agrarian-based – as they used to be. Savings would gradually appreciate in value as technology brought down the price of goods and services on a regular basis. 
The stampeding of savers into stock markets is surely an unnatural occurrence. It has been promoted because those who control stock markets and their corporations want people to feel that their net worth is tied up in the current system. 
Ironically, this system does not provide much wealth to the average individual. Most people in the West are relatively impoverished and times are growing more difficult not less so. Middle classes seem to be shrinking rather than expanding. 
Conclusion: Many people in the West and certainly in the US would be glad to see real entrepreneurism flourish in the context of companies aligned with a fully competitive marketplace. Stocks and stock markets would still exist of course, but they would reflect a bias toward freedom rather than fascism.",0
19184,"Even on NBC, Rio’s Colors Can’t Be Airbrushed Out - The New York Times","Brazil’s signature contribution to world culture is its popular music, and the characteristic mood of that music is the melancholy yearning called saudade. That is not the mood NBC wants you in while you’re watching its coverage of the 2016 Rio Olympics, however. In its broadcast of the Games’ opening ceremony on Friday night  —   meant to set the tone for more than 6, 500 hours of television and digital coverage over the next   weeks  —   the network was intent on getting the party started. During NBC’s long introduction to the ceremony, the emphasis was on the physical beauty of the Brazilian landscape and its often scantily clad Brazilian bodies, and on the many styles of dancing abandon the country’s music inspires. Despite the controversies and fears that have dogged the Rio Games, the city was ready to throw “a massive party,” said Meredith Vieira, one of three “Today” hosts recruited to narrate the ceremony, along with Matt Lauer and Hoda Kotb. Ms. Kotb, the designated fun one, squealed, “Did somebody say party?” When the canned intro ended, more than an hour after the ceremony had actually started, a nearly subliminal string of words on screen painted the clichéd picture of (sanitized) hedonism that NBC wants as a background for its broadcast: music, color, flavor, passion, beaches, samba, carnival, futbol. The hosts did not ignore the scandals  —   economic, political, health and doping  —   that have dominated the   to the Games, but their references were predictably few and faint. About the absence of the Brazilian president, Dilma Rousseff, who faces an impeachment trial, “It’s complicated” was as direct as it got. But NBC couldn’t airbrush out the parts of the ceremony itself that took on larger concerns. Less visually and choreographically impressive than Zhang Yimou’s spectacular show in Beijing in 2008, and less   than London in 2012, the production Friday night had a winning earnestness. A long, powerful section represented Brazil’s history of slavery, and the culmination of the ceremony was a bald warning of the dangers of global warming to coastal cities like Rio de Janeiro. NBC’s   decision to   the broadcast of the ceremony by an hour  —   starting at 8 p. m. Eastern  —   probably had little or no effect on what we saw. There did not appear to be any significant disturbances or glitches at the stadium that needed to be smoothed over. What the network really gained by delaying the ceremony was more viewers for its nakedly promotional introductory  . NBC featured the American athletes it is counting on for story lines, like the swimmer Michael Phelps and the sprinter Allyson Felix and an intrusive, embarrassing promo touted NBC’s most prominent announcers. The nadir of the evening was a   segment, positioned just before the start of the opening ceremony, that was ostensibly about Olympic golf but was really a plug for the   Golf Channel. The ceremony, when it arrived, was firmly in the approved international style that combines elements of Cirque du Soleil, “The Lion King,” American football halftime shows, political conventions,   film (particularly the director Terrence Malick) and the fireworks of the artist Cai  . An irregularly shaped section of the floor of the Maracanã stadium served as stage and screen. Watching theatrical effects that are scaled for a large stadium in the confines of a television screen is always problematic  —   you’re too close to the action and at the same time you’re missing the immersive effects of lights and sound. The opening act, a countdown to the ceremony involving lots of mylar, looked like hundreds of giant bags of Jiffy Pop popcorn getting ready to burst. During a tribute to the Brazilian aviation pioneer Alberto   in which white boxes were tossed from hand to hand, the cameras were too close to capture the cascading effect. But other segments, like the sprouting of a rainforest from the stadium floor, and the slave march  —   for which dancers wore large blocks, like parking boots, on their feet  —   probably came across better on the screen, communicating some of the wonder that the stadium spectators must have felt. The ceremony’s most striking moment, however, involved a lone figure on a bare stage: the Brazilian model Gisele Bündchen, taking the longest catwalk ever, along the length of the Maracanã floor. Then there were the parts that were completely inexplicable without a program, like a wild number with masses of dancers in a multicolored,   mosh pit. NBC thoughtfully cut in a prerecorded interview with Daniela Thomas, one of the ceremony’s creative directors, explaining that it was a representation of Brazil’s divides of class and race, as well as a celebration of diversity. Eventually, NBC’s cameras found and kept returning to Ms. Bundchen dancing in the stands, an image they clearly preferred. The strange fate of Olympic opening ceremonies is that they inevitably segue into the visually monotonous parade of nations, two hours of waves, hideous national costumes and rampant selfie taking. Rio tried to put its stamp on the parade by having the teams led into the stadium by bicycle carts of the kind that ferry supplies around big beach resorts. The parade requires more of the announcers, and the “Today” crew, unusually subdued during the ceremony, nimbly recited demographic and historical facts. These skewed toward American interests: “Roots” opens in Gambia. Alexander Hamilton was born in St. Kitts and Nevis. As long and featureless as the parade may be, it is also inspiring and heartwarming, the loud cheers for a new team representing refugees (and for the very well muscled and oiled Tongan flag bearer) balancing the occasional cuts to American team members chanting “U. S. A. !” Conveniently for NBC, the home nation danced in last, a   samba line bouncing along to the best   music any nation has offered. With her mind on those 6, 500 hours of actual athletics still to come, the rights to which cost NBC north of $1 billion, Ms. Vieira cautioned: “This is not the party. You haven’t seen anything yet. ”",0
19185,"In Istanbul, Optimism Fades to a Familiar Melancholy - The New York Times","ISTANBUL  —   When the army cut off traffic in Istanbul on Friday night by shutting two bridges in the opening moments of a coup, the municipality ordered ferries to work overtime. City trucks blocked roads near army barracks. Buses and subways operated free of charge, and local officials and mosque preachers helped mobilize government supporters to the streets. And when President Recep Tayyip Erdogan finally emerged in public, after uncertain hours in which he narrowly missed being seized at a seaside hotel by soldiers trying to topple his government, he flew, not to the capital, Ankara, but to Istanbul, where he remained throughout the weekend and on Monday. Ankara may be the seat of Turkey’s government, but it was Mr. Erdogan’s grip on Istanbul, a city he once governed as mayor, that was crucial in putting down the coup. In the failed coup’s aftermath, it was in the streets, mosques and public squares in Istanbul that his Islamist supporters raucously celebrated, and where Mr. Erdogan consolidated his hold on power. The two cities, in many ways, represent Turkey’s deep divisions: Istanbul owns the hearts of the Islamists and is Turkey’s showcase to the world, while Ankara is a special place for secular Turks. “Istanbul’s becoming almost the second capital of the country has been very instrumental in preventing the coup,” said Yusuf Muftuoglu, who was an adviser to the former president, Abdullah Gul, and briefly for Mr. Erdogan. The drama of the failed coup mostly played out across two urban spaces and the skies overhead  —   Istanbul, the sprawling megacity that symbolizes the country’s past as the seat of Islamic empire, and Ankara, the utilitarian capital, a onetime Anatolian backwater built up by modern Turkey’s secular founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. Much of the violence occurred in Ankara, where different factions of the armed forces battled over government buildings. But the events in Istanbul proved crucial in fending off the coup. It was there that two private news channels broadcast   coverage and gave a platform to elected leaders, including Mr. Erdogan. During his time in power, Mr. Erdogan has spent far more time in Istanbul than previous presidents and has overseen the construction of Turkey’s largest mosque in the city. He has also built up the police force, much of which is based in Istanbul. By stocking the force with loyalists and purging suspected enemies, he created a counterweight to the military, which has a history of carrying out coups against civilian governments. And it was largely the police special forces that defended the government over the weekend, confronting the renegade military factions. In the days before the attempted coup, a palpable sense of melancholy could be felt when walking through the city, whose singularity is measured in numbers: seven hills, two continents, the capital of three former empires. Turks call it “huzun,” a rich,   word that means melancholy and a lot more: loss, sadness, spiritual anguish. Turkey’s most famous novelist, Orhan Pamuk, used it to describe Istanbul in the dreary years after the fall of the Ottoman Empire. The word is back in the city’s lexicon now, as years of optimism about Turkey’s growing power on the world stage give way to anxiety over terrorism and internal conflicts. After the coup was decisively put down, and Mr. Erdogan’s supporters flooded the streets and city squares over the weekend to celebrate, a sense of buoyancy returned to the streets, but the joy masked a deep unease that has enveloped the city. Istanbul, where ancient mosques and churches jostle with gleaming skyscrapers and   shopping malls to define an evolving cityscape, was reshaped by Mr. Erdogan’s Islamist government, which created a glistening image of the city that is now threatened by instability. The government embraced Turkey’s Ottoman and Islamic past as a mythical time of harmony and reimagined Istanbul as Turkey’s true capital, investing heavily in public works projects, new shopping malls and office buildings. Ankara took a back seat. “I think the city was presented as this perfect dream without its problems,” said Kaya Genc, a novelist and essayist who wrote about “huzun” after the recent  attack on Istanbul’s main airport, which left dozens of people dead. “Maybe it was a lie, but we miss it. ” Now, he said, “is the return of the real Istanbul. ” By that he meant a city whose mood is more in sync with its unstable past of military coups, political violence and economic crisis. In recent years, the government built an image of Istanbul as an urban wonderland of fascinating history and great architecture and cuisine, and tourism boomed. Mr. Genc said that like many other liberals and intellectuals he bought in to the vision. “A past was reinvented, and repackaged as this great, multicultural history where there are no conflicts,” he said. Even before the failed military coup, all that was clouded by spillover from the Syrian civil war  —   terrorism and a flood of refugees, hundreds of thousands in Istanbul alone  —   that set the city on edge. “Everything is being Arabized,” said Karaca Borar, who owns an antiques shop on one of the crooked, cobbled streets in European Istanbul, and supplied many of the items that fill a nearby museum owned by Mr. Pamuk that is based on his novel “Museum of Innocence. ” He said he was tired of hearing the Arabic greeting of “salaam aleikum” on the streets, and tired of so many Syrians in general. (It is a widely shared sentiment: When Mr. Erdogan recently said Turkey should offer citizenship to Syrians, a   secular newspaper called Syrians “vermin” in a   headline.) Asked about the mood of the city, which before the coup attempt had faced several devastating terrorist attacks for which the Islamic State was blamed, Mr. Borar said, “Terrible, terrible, terrible. ” “We’re not happy,” he said. “I’m not at ease. ” He continued: “We were the only secular, decent country in a bad region. Now, we are like one of those Arab states. ” With so many threats, even the weather can set off panic, a clap of thunder sending people scampering for cover. People walking the streets are scrutinized for what they are wearing and what they are carrying. A backpack could be a bomb. A sweater or jacket in summertime could conceal a vest of explosives. Nowadays, it seems, all of Turkey’s old conflicts  —   most prominently the divide between religious and secular Turks  —   and many new ones, are coming to the fore. The most dramatic was the long night of uncertainty as fighter jets buzzed the sky, gunfire echoed across the city, and protesters mobilized as the military tried to secure the city. But even before that, Turkey’s traumas were playing out across Istanbul, in bitter conversations about politics, in painful decisions to move away or in to gated communities, in smatterings of protests quickly put down by the police, and in new debates over the use of public spaces. Three years ago, protesters in Gezi Park, in Taksim Square in European Istanbul where Mr. Erdogan’s supporters rallied over the weekend, rose up to oppose plans to convert the park into a shopping mall. The protests became a widespread challenge to his rule, which is growing increasingly autocratic. It produced no lasting political changes, but it did save the park. But maybe not for long. In recent comments that seemed designed to provoke his enemies, Mr. Erdogan said he could revive the plan. On a recent afternoon, Ali Erdogan, a retired military man in his late 60s who is not related to the president, sat on a bench in Gezi Park, where the city has planted new trees, blossoming with pink flowers, and told how his life had improved since Mr. Erdogan came to power more than a decade ago. He pulled out his card for retirees for free rides on Istanbul’s subway, which has been modernized in recent years, as has Turkey’s health care system. “Everything is new and shiny,” he said. More important, he said, he can freely express his religion, something he was unable to do when Turkey’s secular elite ruled the country for decades. He said when he was in the military, the guardian of secularism, he had to conceal his religiosity. “I had to lie that I prayed five times a day,” he said. “I had to find a secret corner to pray. ” The city’s most conservative district is Fatih, in the old city, across the Golden Horn waterway that divides European Istanbul. There, Mr. Erdogan spoke at a funeral on Sunday, and rallied his supporters to keep gathering in the city’s public squares. It is also where three suicide attackers who carried out the airport bombings lived in an orange apartment building. But the area is far from homogeneous. In one gentrifying enclave of Fatih, in a neighborhood called Balat,   cafes and quirky antique shops have sprouted on the narrow streets, raising tensions and testing the limits of social diversity. “Istanbul used to be like a village,” said Hikmet Bardok, 63, a longtime resident. “I don’t recognize it anymore. A lot of people who live here are poor. And these rich people are coming in an looking for places to park their Ferrari. ” Mr. Bardok said he quit drinking in 1994 when he turned to religion, and blamed secular Turks for the country’s polarization because they are “arrogant and disrespectful. ” Now that they are moving in to his neighborhood, he is worried that “in five to 10 years this place is going to turn into Amsterdam. ” Mr. Genc, meanwhile, has been thinking of writing a book on what he calls the “New Istanbul,” a chronicle of the “artificial, distant new neighborhoods” that have built up in the city’s outer reaches during Mr. Erdogan’s tenure. Mr. Erdogan once enjoyed the support of many of Istanbul’s intellectuals and elites, some of whom now call him a dictator, even though they opposed a coup. They once thought him capable of healing the country’s divides, and basked in the optimism that flowed through Istanbul. Now, in the aftermath of the coup attempt, they are left to wonder if Mr. Erdogan will turn more autocratic or, perhaps, seize the time to patch up relations with segments of the society he has alienated. That will become clearer in the days and weeks ahead. For now, Turks are simply trying to make sense of their dizzying weekend. The morning after the coup attempt, Mr. Genc woke early, and went for a walk along the Bosporus. “In the background was the waterway,” he wrote in an essay for The New York Times, “a burning sun and two bridges that span two continents, where just hours before tanks had been firing shots. ”",0
19186,Al Gore offers to work with Trump on climate change,"November 11, 2016 Al Gore offers to work with Trump on climate change 
Former vice president and longtime environmental activist Al Gore campaigned hard against Donald Trump, saying his election “would take us toward a climate catastrophe.” 
But now that Trump will soon be occupying the Oval Office, Gore is extending an olive branch, saying in an online posting this week that he will do everything he can to work with the incoming administration to ensure that the United States remains a leader in combating the harmful effects of global warming. 
“President-elect Trump said he wanted to be a president for all Americans,” Gore wrote on the website of the Climate Reality Project, the advocacy group he founded with a mission of helping accelerate the shift from dirty fossil fuels to renewable energy. “In that spirit, I hope that he will work with the overwhelming majority of us who believe that the climate crisis is the greatest threat we face as a nation.”",0
19187,The Senate Takes Up Health Care Reform - Breitbart,"The Senate will take up health care reform after a revised version of the American Health Care Act (AHCA) passed through the House last Thursday. [Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( ) said Saturday that the Senate does not expect help from Democrats as it works to repeal and replace Obamacare.  “We don’t anticipate any Democratic help at all so that it will be a simple majority vote situation,” McConnell told the Associated Press. Several senators expressed concern over the House decision to vote without a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) score. Senator Roy Blunt ( ) a member of Senate leadership, said that the Senate will wait for a new CBO score before preceding to a vote. Senate Republicans already plan to change the House version of the AHCA. Mick Mulvaney, head of the Office of Management and Budget, said, “The bill that passed out of the House is most likely not going to be the bill that is put in front of the president. ” White House chief of staff Reince Priebus spoke with a dozen members of a Senate working to make “improvements” to the bill, necessary to win at least 50 votes to pass through the Senate. Members of the working group include Sens. Mitch McConnell, Bob Portman ( ) John Corynyn ( ) John Thune ( ) Mike Enzi ( ) Orrin Hatch ( ) Lamar Alexander ( ) Tom Cotton ( ) Cory Gardner ( ) Ted Cruz ( ) John Barrasso ( ) and Pat Toomey ( ). “Everyone is committed to getting this thing done and getting it done as soon as possible. I don’t think everyone is going to be beating down this group of 12 I think we’re going to want to let them do their work,” Priebus told Fox News. The Senate working group does not feature two of the bill’s biggest critics, Senators Susan Collins ( ) and Bill Cassidy ( ). The two senators joined a separate group of Republicans studying potential health care solutions including Sens. Shelley Moore Capito ( ) Johnny Isakson ( ) and Mike Rounds ( ). Senators Cassidy and Collins released a separate Obamacare repeal bill, The Patient Freedom Act. The bill would repeal the individual and employer mandate for health insurance, retain protections for   conditions, and allow young adults to stay on their parents’ health plan until age 26. States have three options under the   plan: Congressman Mark Meadows ( ) chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, told Breitbart News that he will work with Senate colleagues to push for a more conservative version. “I am having conversations with my colleagues in the Senate,” he explained, “where we can push for even more conservative solutions because it was more difficult to push amendments procedurally in the House. ” Senators Rand Paul ( ) Mike Lee ( ) and Ted Cruz ( ) were the strongest opponents of the American Health Care Act.

19189,Hillary’s Criminal Plan for the Internet,"Hillary’s Criminal Plan for the Internet Hillary’s Criminal Plan for the Internet By 0 57 
You’re probably appalled at the American media’s shameless whoring for Hillary Clinton, asking yourself why they would so thoroughly debase their much-touted journalistic ethics. President Obama has answered that question. 
As reported by Agence France Presse, during a recent speech in Pittsburgh he postulated: 
“We are going to have to rebuild within this wild-wild-west-of-information flow some sort of curating function that people agree to. 
“There has to be, I think, some sort of way in which we can sort through information that passes some basic truthiness tests and those that we have to discard, because they just don’t have any basis in anything that’s actually happening in the world.” 
Set aside the outrageous, un-American gall in proposing that any central authority should “curate” information put out to the public, and walk with me for a minute down a meandering path of speculation. 
It is, or course, the World Wide Web in which Obama’s informational “wild-wild west” exists. This is the realm of Breitbart, Cybercast News Service, the Drudge Report , World Net Daily , American Thinker , and other non-establishment outlets that persist in making the president uncomfortable. 
Current Prices on popular forms of Silver Bullion 
And what has happened recently to affect the World Wide Web? The U.S. government has handed over control to ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), the nonprofit agency that assigns website domain names. 
Is it in the president’s mind that ICANN might someday assume the “curating function” he sees as necessary to insure “truthiness” in web-based news reporting? 
Well, according to ICANN Board Chair Stephen D. Crocker, diverse membership in the organization makes such a thing unthinkable. Quoted by the tech site C/NET, Crocker said: 
“This community validated the multistakeholder model of internet governance. It has shown that a governance model defined by the inclusion of all voices, including business, academics, technical experts, civil society, governments and many others is the best way to assure that the internet of tomorrow remains as free, open and accessible as the internet of today.” 
His confidence is echoed by the Internet Governance Coalition, a group of technology firms that includes Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Verizon, among others. They issued a statement that lauds ICANN’s “strong accountability measures” and upholds “the bottom-up approach that embodies the very nature of the open internet we experience today.…” 
Pardon the skepticism to which I’ve become increasingly prone, but this sounds very much like the “collaborative” concept of governance that prevails in the academic world. 
If you’ve ever applied for a position at a college or university, you know that what a search committee wants most urgently to know about you is whether you have a “collaborative style” of working. 
What exactly is a “collaborative style,” as understood in today’s academic world? It means that you won’t do anything to contradict the orthodoxy in thought and procedure reigning on campus — in other words, that you are “politically correct” in your outlook.",0

In the letter former President Bush left former President Obama, Bush told Obama that he will face “trying moments” during his presidency. He also warned Obama that “critics will rage” and said your “‘friends’ will disappoint you. ” “But, you will have an Almighty God to comfort you, a family who loves you, and a country that is pulling for you, including me,” Bush wrote. “No matter what comes, you will be inspired by the character and compassion of the people you now lead. ” In the letter former President Clinton wrote to his successor Bush, Clinton wished Bush “success” and “happiness” and told him that being president is “the greatest honor that can come to an American citizen. ” “The burdens you now shoulder are great but often exaggerated.

19191,Alec Baldwin Preparing to Retire Trump Impersonation,"Alec Baldwin says his days of playing a parody version of President Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live are numbered. [While he didn’t set a specific end date to hang up the wig and tie, the    actor told Extra’s Mario Lopez that he wouldn’t be doing his most famous impersonation “much longer. ”  “Trump just overwhelmingly lacks any sportsmanship, he remains, bitter, and angry, and you just want to look at him and go, ‘You won! ’” Baldwin told Extra, saying he’d hoped the president would change once in office. “His policies aside, which you can hate, I thought he would have just relaxed. ” “The maliciousness of this White House has people worried,” he added. “That’s why I’m not going to do it much longer, the impersonation, I don’t know how much more people can take it. ” Baldwin debuted as Trump during the   NBC show’s 42nd season, before the presidential election, and continued to return to the role following Trump’s inauguration in January. The show’s skits have mocked Trump’s penchant for tweeting and skewered his confrontation with the 9th Circuit Court over the halt on his executive order on immigration last month. Offscreen, Baldwin has been a fierce critic of the president. He spoke at an   rally outside Manhattan’s Trump Tower alongside Michael Moore and Mark Ruffalo before the inauguration, and has trolled the president on Twitter. While Saturday Night Live enjoyed some of its highest ratings in years this season, a recent survey found that viewers have grown weary of the show’s constant assaults on Trump. A Morning Consult poll released in February found that more viewers than not would like the show to focus its attention elsewhere. Though he may not play the president on SNL much longer, Baldwin is reportedly working on a satirical book about his time playing Trump.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum",0
19192,"‘Bake shaming’ now a hate crime, say police","October 27, 2016 
Incidents of “bake shaming” have increased by 600% since Wednesday evening’s Bake Off final, say police. 
Bake shaming, legally classified as abuse aimed at “those who haven’t seen, or don’t really care about, The Great British Bake Off” has become more of a problem since the announcement that the programme will be crossing channels next year. 
One victim, Kevin Dunsford, who has lived his whole life in this country was “bake shamed” at his local bus stop. He told our reporter: I was standing with my wife and we were talking about the weather and a woman walked up, looked at us in disbelief and said, “Why aren’t you talking about Bake Off?” She then started ranting on about British Values and called us an “unwelcome minority”. 
Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, said she was appalled by this situation and condemned these acts as “despicable”. She added, “Our cake crime laws are among the best in the world.” Share this story...

19193,"After Mike Pence’s Debate Showing, Donald Trump Takes Credit - The New York Times","Donald J. Trump hailed Mike Pence’s steady debate performance as a credit to his own judgment on Wednesday in a renewed attempt to allay voters’ concerns about his temperament and readiness for the presidency. Calling Mr. Pence the “first hire” of his administration, Mr. Trump said his running mate was an advertisement for government à la Trump. He pronounced himself “very, very proud of Gov. Mike Pence. ” “Last night, America also got to look firsthand at my judgment  —   and that was judgment,” Mr. Trump said in Nevada. “You know you need judgment for people, for deals. ” With a swift and    effort to link Mr. Pence’s debate outing back to the top of the ticket, Mr. Trump and his advisers tried once again to move on from one of the worst stretches of his campaign. After a widely panned performance in his debate last week with Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump faces a steeper climb than ever as he works to persuade voters that he is fit for the presidency. Mr. Trump’s advisers fanned out on television Wednesday to make the most of Mr. Pence’s moment Kellyanne Conway, his campaign manager, called the debate proof of Mr. Trump’s “great judgment and leadership. ” It is doubtful that Mr. Pence’s performance in his debate with Senator Tim Kaine, Mrs. Clinton’s running mate, will do much to move voters toward Mr. Trump. Mr. Kaine mounted an insistent and prodding attack on Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence at the   debate, frequently interrupting Mr. Pence to demand that he defend Mr. Trump’s divisive statements. Mr. Pence remained unruffled as he sidestepped those demands, but on Wednesday he faced intense scrutiny  —   and a battery of attacks from Democrats  —   for evading questions about Mr. Trump’s record. Yet with Mr. Trump’s temperament and readiness for the presidency lingering as central concerns for voters, the hope among Trump allies is that Mr. Pence may have essentially reassured Americans, by proxy, that Mr. Trump is calm enough for the job. Democrats dismissed that possibility on Wednesday morning. And they assailed Mr. Pence for having misrepresented the positioning and past comments of his running mate the Clinton campaign released a video showing Mr. Pence’s denials alongside clips of Mr. Trump’s remarks. The video concludes with a dig at both men: “It’s O. K. Mike. We’d have a hard time defending him, too. ” Rallying supporters at a Philadelphia union hall on Wednesday evening, Mr. Kaine kept swinging at Mr. Trump and his running mate. “He’s pretty smooth,” Mr. Kaine said of Mr. Pence. “But there is one thing he can’t do, and that is defend Donald Trump on anything  —   on anything. ” Mr. Kaine allowed that he had been “dinged a little bit, even by my wife, for, like, interrupting too much. ” But Democrats said Mr. Kaine had successfully trained his fire on Mr. Trump and exposed Mr. Pence as incapable of defending his running mate on the merits. On the stump in Ohio, Bill Clinton described Mr. Pence as having tried to “shimmy out of a discussion” on basic economic issues like the minimum wage and equal pay for women. And at a   event in Washington, Mrs. Clinton poked fun at Mr. Pence for having “bobbed and weaved” his way through the debate. “Pence refused to defend the statements because they are indefensible,” she said. “So when your own running mate won’t defend the top of the ticket, I think that tells you everything you need to know. ” Mr. Pence repeatedly disputed quotations from Mr. Trump that were, in fact, accurate: He claimed in one instance that Mr. Trump had not indicated he might allow more nations to acquire nuclear weapons, though Mr. Trump had done just that. At one point, Mr. Pence appeared to break openly with Mr. Trump in his views about Russia, calling Mr. Putin a “small and bullying leader,” though Mr. Trump had consistently said the opposite. Still, Mr. Trump’s campaign treated the aftermath of the debate as a kind of respite from a turbulent week and a half during which Mr. Trump made a series of intemperate attacks on subjects including a former Miss Universe’s physique and Mrs. Clinton’s marriage. Mr. Pence took something of a victory lap at a campaign stop in Harrisonburg, Va. where Ed Gillespie, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, introduced him as “one heck of a debater. ” Mr. Pence said Mr. Trump had called to congratulate him, and declared the night a victory for the top of the ticket. “From where I sat, Donald Trump won the debate,” Mr. Pence said. “Donald Trump’s vision to make America great again won the debate. ” He repeated his accusation from the debate that Mr. Kaine and Mrs. Clinton have been throwing “an avalanche of insults” in the campaign. There is scant polling information on how most voters reacted to the debate, and it is unclear that an encounter between comparatively   running mates might reshape a race dominated by two outsize presidential candidates. And any lingering fallout from the candidates’ performances will almost certainly be swallowed up by a debate between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton on Sunday  —   a far more consequential event, and one much likelier to shift voter attitudes. Ms. Conway, the Trump campaign manager, expressed confidence Wednesday morning that he would offer a “powerful performance” in the second presidential debate, a town   discussion at Washington University in St. Louis. She likened the format to Mr. Trump’s rallies, though he rarely takes questions from members of his audience or engages in traditional retail politics. Mr. Trump is seen as needing a drastic recovery in Sunday’s debate after a dismal performance against Mrs. Clinton on Sept. 26. He has slipped markedly in the polls over the past week and appears to have sacrificed much of the ground he captured in September. A Monmouth University poll released on Wednesday showed Mrs. Clinton with a   edge over Mr. Trump in Ohio, where he had been running strong Monmouth surveys this week have also shown Mrs. Clinton leading by double digits in Colorado and Pennsylvania. Visiting a barbecue restaurant in Harrisonburg, Mr. Pence told an antsy supporter of the Republican ticket that Mr. Trump would be well prepared for his next confrontation with Mrs. Clinton. “We’ve got to get Trump to hammer Sunday night,” the woman told Mr. Pence. “He’s got to bring it all out. ” “He’ll be ready,” Mr. Pence reassured her. “He’ll be ready. ”",0
19194,Latest WikiLeaks Vault 7 Release Claims CIA Can Attribute Cyber Attacks to Other Countries - Breitbart,"WikiLeaks’ latest release from the Vault 7 leaks, titled “Marble,” claims that the CIA can use string obfuscating algorithms to attribute cyber attacks to other countries. [WikiLeaks released the “Marble Framework” leak today on their website, describing Marble as a tool used to “hamper forensic investigators and   companies from attributing viruses, trojans and hacking attacks to the CIA. ”  “Marble does this by hiding (‘obfuscating’) text fragments used in CIA malware from visual inspection,” WikiLeaks claims. “This is the digital equivalent of a specialized CIA tool to place covers over the english language text on U. S. produced weapons systems before giving them to insurgents secretly backed by the CIA. ” Marble is reportedly an obfuscation tool that is not used as a cyber attack itself but to hide and cover up previous attacks. WikiLeaks claims it is part of the CIA’s   approach and the CIA’s core library of cyber attacks and viruses, “Designed to allow for flexible and    obfuscation” as “string obfuscation algorithms (especially those that are unique) are often used to link malware to a specific developer or development shop. ” The source code also reportedly contains a deobfuscator used to reverse CIA text obfuscation. WikiLeaks believes that with the framework now made public, forensic investigators should be able to notice patterns and signatures which can be followed to attribute previous cyber attacks and viruses to the CIA. WikiLeaks also believes that Marble could be used to attribute cyber attacks to multiple countries due to evidence of Marble test examples in English, Chinese, Russian, Korean, Arabic, and Farsi. WikiLeaks states, “This would permit a forensic attribution double game, for example by pretending that the spoken language of the malware creator was not American English, but Chinese, but then showing attempts to conceal the use of Chinese, drawing forensic investigators even more strongly to the wrong conclusion,  —   but there are other possibilities, such as hiding fake error messages. ” Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

A poker-fixated teenager, who was “enamored with ISIS” and charged in connection with a “viable device” found on the London Underground, has appeared in court. 
Damon Smith, 19, of South East London, has been accused of unlawfully and maliciously making or possessing an explosive substance with intent to endanger life or cause serious danger to property, the Metropolitan Police said. BREAKING – 19 year old Damon Smith charged with possessing or constructing explosives after device left on London tube train last Thursday pic.twitter.com/b0BekmI1aw 
— Mark White (@skymarkwhite) October 26, 2016 
He did not enter a plea in relation to the charge during his hearing at the Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Thursday. 
Defence counsel Simon Eastwood, however, indicated that his client, who has a form of autism, would be pleading not guilty on the grounds it was a prank, according to Sky News. 
The device was found last Thursday on a tube carriage on the Jubilee Line at North Greenwich station, near the O2 Arena. It had been left inside an abandoned black Adidas rucksack and was found by two members of the public.

The station was evacuated for several hours, and counter-terrorism police destroyed the item in a controlled explosion. 
The prosecution told the court that experts carried out a forensic examination of the package and deemed it to be a “viable improvised explosive device” which would have caused injury had it detonated. 
The bomb was a “pressure” type device and contained grey powder, ball bearings, and a clock-type detonator, the court was told. 
Four properties have been searched in connection with the investigation. 
On Saturday, another device was discovered at an address in Newton Abbot by police investigating the North Greenwich incident. The item was later declared not viable. 
Smith had just moved to London from Newton Abbot, Devon, to study IT at the London Metropolitan University. 
He has been described as a “mummy’s boy” and a “loner,” with an interest in martial arts and online poker. 
Friends of Smith have also claimed he was “enamored” with Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL), Sky reports. 
“He had a Koran and knew several phrases and he wore a black headscarf. Damon had replica guns and air rifles and even posted a video of himself shooting a replica Glock on YouTube,” a former friend told the Sun. 
Smith has been remanded back into custody and will next appear at the Old Bailey on November 17.

19197,What Is a ‘Personal Benefit’ From Insider Trading? Justices Hear Arguments - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Supreme Court justices offered hope to both prosecutors and traders on Wednesday during arguments in the first insider trading case to come before the nation’s high court in two decades. A ruling by the court could clarify one of the most hotly debated issues on Wall Street: what prosecutors must prove to secure insider trading convictions based on confidential tips. In their questioning, the justices grappled with where to draw the line. Even as they appeared sympathetic to the government’s interpretation of the high court’s past insider trading decisions, the justices were wary of radically expanding the government’s power and affording prosecutors too much of a free hand in these cases. The case now before the court, Salman v. United States, No.   comes from California and centers on the insider trading conviction of Bassam Salman in 2013. According to prosecutors, Mr. Salman placed profitable stock trades based on confidential information leaked by his future    Maher Kara, who had advance knowledge of corporate mergers because of his job in Citigroup’s health care investment banking group. For decades, courts have held that it is not inherently illegal to trade stocks based on material, nonpublic information like a merger or acquisition. For an insider to be guilty of sharing inside information, his leak must breach a duty to keep the information confidential and he must receive a personal benefit in exchange for the leak. By extension, the person who receives the information must generally know of that breach and benefit. The Salman case presents a question that has vexed federal appeals courts and left prosecutors and traders alike seeking clarity: What exactly amounts to a “personal benefit”? Prosecutors hope the court will afford them leeway in defining the benefit, arguing that if an insider provides a gift of information, that should count as a benefit. In the Salman case, Maher Kara did not receive any financial benefit, but arguably leaked the information as a gift. Mr. Salman’s lawyer, Alexandra Shapiro, argued on Wednesday that the benefit must be more “tangible”  —   like cash or something that eventually can be monetized. Several of the justices, citing one of the court’s seminal insider trading decisions from three decades ago, seemed skeptical of her argument and poised to uphold Mr. Salman’s conviction. After all, as Justice Stephen Breyer noted, “to help a close family member is like helping yourself. ” Yet the court, often skeptical of prosecutors in   crime cases, also questioned the government’s lawyer, Michael Dreeben, about where to draw the line. The justices seemed hesitant to afford prosecutors broad authority to apply the   gift test to situations in which the insider and recipient are not family or close friends. The issue gained prominence after a 2014 decision from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan, United States v. Newman, that upended the Justice Department’s sweeping crackdown on insider trading. Mr. Salman’s argument for overturning his conviction hinges on the Newman decision, which tightened the standard for what constitutes a personal benefit by requiring prosecutors to show a tangible benefit rather than mere friendship between the tipper and recipient. The Second Circuit, in that 2014 decision, overturned the insider trading convictions of the hedge fund managers Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson, who were at the end of a long chain of information being passed along. In the aftermath, federal prosecutors in New York tossed out the convictions of nearly a dozen other traders and industry consultants. Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, whose office secured insider trading convictions against dozens of people in the nearly $3 trillion hedge fund industry, has been an outspoken critic of the Second Circuit ruling. Mr. Bharara, who attended Wednesday’s argument, has argued that the Second Circuit’s decision could create “a potential bonanza for friends and family of rich people with material nonpublic information. ” The Supreme Court denied the Justice Department’s request that it review that ruling, though the justices could indirectly rebuke it in deciding Mr. Salman’s case. In Mr. Salman’s case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco took a different approach. The Ninth Circuit upheld Mr. Salman’s conviction and adopted the view that giving inside information to a family member qualified as a benefit, creating what some legal observers saw as a split that only the Supreme Court could reconcile. Both the Newman and Salman appeals court decisions hinged on a    Supreme Court case, Dirks v. Securities and Exchange Commission, that has long been the cornerstone of insider trading law. That decision directed courts to focus on “whether the insider receives a direct or indirect personal benefit from the disclosure, such as a pecuniary gain or a reputational benefit that will translate into future earnings. ” In overturning Mr. Newman’s conviction, the Second Circuit seized on that financial element. But when the Ninth Circuit upheld Mr. Salman’s conviction, it focused on another passage in the Dirks decision that allowed liability “when an insider makes a gift of confidential information to a trading relative or friend. ” That excerpt strikes at the heart of Mr. Salman’s case. Maher Kara passed the inside information, arguably as a gift, to his brother, Michael Kara, who in turn shared it with Mr. Salman. The two families were close Maher Kara was engaged to Mr. Salman’s sister. (While Maher Kara struck a plea deal and was sentenced to three months of home confinement, Mr. Salman was sentenced to three years in prison.) Some of the justices, appearing skeptical of Mr. Salman’s argument, highlighted the passage within the Dirks ruling that references gifts to family members. “You’re asking us to cut back significantly from something that we said several decades ago,” Justice Elena Kagan told Ms. Shapiro, adding that “the integrity of the markets are a very important thing for this country. And you’re asking us essentially to change the rules in a way that threatens that integrity. ” But a decision that just upholds Mr. Salman’s conviction  —   and reaffirms the Dirks decision with some clarity  —   would disappoint some prosecutors who argue that the current unsettled nature of the law has had a chilling effect on cases. The Justice Department’s ideal ruling would uphold the conviction of Mr. Salman and then take the Ninth Circuit’s ruling further so that the gift rule would not be limited to just family and close friends. Mr. Dreeben mentioned the case of a barber who could slip through the cracks. He also proposed an even looser standard that would allow charges whenever information is shared for a noncorporate purpose and the insider knows that the recipient will place trades based on the leak. The justices appeared to balk at that extension of prosecutorial power. “It doesn’t seem to me that your argument is much more consistent with Dirks than Ms. Shapiro’s,” Justice Samuel Alito told Mr. Dreeben. Justice Alito then proposed a hypothetical: “Now suppose someone, the insider is walking down the street and sees someone who has a really unhappy look on his face and says, I want to do something to make this person’s day. And so he provides the inside information” and allows the recipient to trade. Mr. Dreeben replied that such a case was indeed a violation. Later in the argument, however, as other justices expressed skepticism about the Justice Department’s position, Mr. Dreeben conceded that “if the court feels more comfortable given the facts of this case of reaffirming Dirks and saying that was the law in 1983, it remains the law today, that is completely fine with the government. ” Daniel Richman, a former federal prosecutor and now a professor at Columbia Law School, predicted that because insider trading law was almost entirely   rather than set by Congress, the Supreme Court might be reluctant to radically revisit its Dirks ruling from three decades ago. It would be simpler to draw distinctions between cases involving family members and business associates. “If you were going to be a minimalist, this little bit of family relationship could be elaborated on without wholesale redevelopment,” he said. One of the most prominent critics of judges determining what constitutes insider trading was Justice Antonin Scalia, whose death earlier this year created the vacancy on the bench. Justice Scalia argued that only Congress  —   rather than agencies, prosecutors or judges  —   may define what conduct amounts to insider trading. Although Ms. Shapiro made a similar argument, the remaining eight justices seemed to be unswayed. They also seemed skeptical of her argument that Maher Kara turned over the information to Michael Kara for “the scant benefit of getting his brother off his back. ” Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, for whom Ms. Shapiro was once a law clerk, remarked: “He’s no longer being pestered. Isn’t that a benefit?”",0
19198,Airbus has a secret flying-car project called Vahana,"The French aerospace giant Airbus recently unveiled its secret flying-car project dubbed Vahana — a single-manned, autonomously piloted aircraft that can take off and land vertically. Cue the Jetsons references! The concept drawing of Vahana should look familiar to anyone who follows the tiny-but-passionate flying car movement. The aircraft has eight rotors on two sets of wings, both of which tilt depending on whether the car’s flying vertically or horizontally. There’s room for a single passenger under a canopy that retracts like a visor. The aircraft will be deployed like a taxi, making it the air-taxi version of Uber, according to CNN Money . The project launched in early 2016 as one of the first pursuits of A³ (pronounced A-cubed), the Silicon Valley arm of Airbus, according to the startup’s CEO Rodin Lyasoff. Vahana is a Sanskrit word that refers to the vehicle or mount of a god, but Lyasoff says his feet are firmly rooted in reality when it comes to the project.

“Beyond developing the vehicle itself,” Lyasoff wrote in a Medium post quietly published last month, “we’re seeking to move key technology categories forward, foster development of the regulatory regime for the certification and operation of automated aircraft, and to otherwise nurture an ecosystem that will help enable the vertical cities of the future.”
Airbus, which competes with the US-based Boeing, is best known for large jetliners like the double-decker A380. However, the flying car project shows that the French company is not above dabbling in some high-concept, and perhaps unrealistic, aviation ideas.
Lyasoff says his team of engineers, designers, and robotics experts are aiming to fly a full-size prototype before the end of 2017, and to have a “productizable demonstrator” by 2020.
Flying cars have lurked in collective imaginations for decades, but the idea of personal, roadable aircraft took on renewed emphasis this summer when it was revealed that Google co-founder Larry Page was funding a pair of flying car startups, Kitty Hawk and Zee.Aero. Dozens of other companies are working on their own prototypes, though some probably don’t qualify as flying cars. Some are just tiny personal aircrafts, while others look like drones on steroids.
There are many things about flying cars that make them impractical The fact that flying cars act as a stand-in for some distant, unattainable future isn’t a mistake. There are many things about flying cars that make them impractical, unworkable, and even wrongheaded. Airspace in North America and Europe is tightly regulated, making it extremely difficult for any company to gain permission for commercial flight, especially in dense urban environments. And the idea of autonomous aircraft would probably strike most passengers as a recipe for disaster.
Lyasoff insists that pilotless flying cars are an attainable dream, if only because the rules governing the skies are bound to change in the future. Plus robot aircraft are cheaper to produce. “Full automation also enables us to make our aircraft as small and light as possible, and will significantly reduce manufacturing costs,” Lyasoff says.
And if something goes wrong, the Vahana will come equipped with “a ballistic parachute that works even at low altitudes.” Because what commute is complete without a little unexpected sky-diving thrown in the mix?

19200,Anjem Choudary Is Sentenced to Prison for Promoting ISIS - The New York Times,"LONDON  —   Anjem Choudary, one of Britain’s best known Islamist activists, was sentenced on Tuesday to five years and six months in prison after having been convicted in July of encouraging support for the Islamic State. Mr. Choudary, 49, had been found guilty of promoting the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, in speeches and messages posted online, which is a crime under Britain’s antiterrorism laws. Mohammed Mizanur Rahman, 33, an associate of Mr. Choudary’s, received the same sentence. Along with Mr. Choudary, Mr. Rahman was convicted on July 28 of having violated British laws after a   trial at the Old Bailey, London’s central criminal court. The verdict was not announced until   for legal reasons. Mr. Choudary’s supporters shouted the Arabic phrase “Allahu akbar,” or “God is great,” as he was sent to jail in London. Long regarded as one of the country’s most prominent radical preachers, Mr. Choudary had praised those who attacked the United States on Sept. 11, 2001, and he refused to condemn the London subway and bus bombings of 2005. Mr. Choudary was arrested two years ago after his name appeared on an oath that circulated online declaring the legitimacy of the “proclaimed Islamic Caliphate State. ” Mr. Choudary denied encouraging his followers to support the Islamic State and said his name had appeared on the online oath without his knowledge. But evidence was presented during the trial that Mr. Choudary had posted speeches online that provided his rationale for recognizing Abu Bakr   as the leader of the Islamic State. In a statement issued on Tuesday, the police said that, in the course of their investigation, they had considered material spanning two decades and had assessed evidence from more than 333 electronic devices. “These men have stayed just within the law for many years, and there has been frustration for both law enforcement agencies and communities as they spread hate,” said Cmdr. Dean Haydon, who leads the Metropolitan Police Service’s Counter Terrorism Command, in the statement. “We have watched Choudary developing a media career as spokesman for the extremists, saying the most distasteful of comments, but without crossing the criminal threshold. ” “Their recent speeches and the oath of allegiance,” he added, “were a turning point for the police  —   at last, we had the evidence that they had stepped over the line and we could prove they were actively encouraging support of ISIS. ”",0

19202,How Putin Derailed the West,"Here's something interesting from The Unz Review... Recipient Name Recipient Email => 
“Nation state as a fundamental unit of man’s organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force: International banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation-state.” 
— Zbigniew Brzezinski, “Between Two Ages: The Technetronic Era”, 1971 
“I’m going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria….not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians.” 
— Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Third Presidential Debate 
Why is Hillary Clinton so eager to intensify US involvement in Syria when US interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya have all gone so terribly wrong? 
The answer to this question is simple. It’s because Clinton doesn’t think that these interventions went wrong. And neither do any of the other members of the US foreign policy establishment. (aka–The Borg). In fact, in their eyes these wars have been a rousing success. Sure, a few have been critical of the public relations backlash from the nonexistent WMD in Iraq, (or the logistical errors, like disbanding the Iraqi Army) but–for the most part– the foreign policy establishment is satisfied with its efforts to destabilize the region and remove leaders that refuse to follow Washington’s diktats. 
This is hard for ordinary people to understand. They can’t grasp why elite powerbrokers would want to transform functioning, stable countries into uninhabitable wastelands overrun by armed extremists, sectarian death squads and foreign-born terrorists. Nor can they understand what has been gained by Washington’s 15 year-long rampage across the Middle East and Central Asia that has turned a vast swathe of strategic territory into a terrorist breeding grounds? What is the purpose of all this? 
First, we have to acknowledge that the decimation and de facto balkanization of these countries is part of a plan. If it wasn’t part of a plan, than the decision-makers would change the policy. But they haven’t changed the policy. The policy is the same. The fact that the US is using foreign-born jihadists to pursue regime change in Syria as opposed to US troops in Iraq, is not a fundamental change in the policy. The ultimate goal is still the decimation of the state and the elimination of the existing government. This same rule applies to Libya and Afghanistan both of which have been plunged into chaos by Washington’s actions. 
But why? What is gained by destroying these countries and generating so much suffering and death? 
Here’s what I think: I think Washington is involved in a grand project to remake the world in a way that better meets the needs of its elite constituents, the international banks and multinational corporations. Brzezinski not only refers to this in the opening quote, he also explains what is taking place: The nation-state is being jettisoned as the foundation upon which the global order rests. Instead, Washington is erasing borders, liquidating states, and removing strong, secular leaders that can mount resistance to its machinations in order to impose an entirely new model on the region, a new world order. The people who run these elite institutions want to create an interconnected-global free trade zone overseen by the proconsuls of Big Capital, in other words, a global Eurozone that precludes the required state institutions (like a centralized treasury, mutual debt, federal transfers) that would allow the borderless entity to function properly. 
Deep state powerbrokers who set policy behind the smokescreen of our bought-and-paid-for congress think that one world government is an achievable goal provided they control the world’s energy supplies, the world’s reserve currency and become the dominant player in this century’s most populous and prosperous region, Asia. This is essentially what Hillary’s “pivot” to Asia is all about. 
The basic problem with Washington’s NWO plan is that a growing number of powerful countries are still attached to the old world order and are now prepared to defend it. This is what’s really going on in Syria, the improbable alliance of Russia, Syria, Iran and Hezbollah have stopped the US military juggernaut dead in its tracks. The unstoppable force has hit the immovable object and the immovable object has prevailed…so far. 
Naturally, the foreign policy establishment is upset about these new developments, and for good reason. The US has run the world for quite a while now, so the rolling back of US policy in Syria is as much a surprise as it is a threat. The Russian Airforce deployed to Syria a full year ago in September, but only recently has Washington shown that it’s prepared to respond by increasing its support of its jihadists agents on the ground and by mounting an attack on ISIS in the eastern part of the country, Raqqa. But the real escalation is expected to take place when Hillary Clinton becomes president in 2017. That’s when the US will directly engage Russia militarily, assuming that their tit-for-tat encounters will be contained within Syria’s borders. It’s a risky plan, but it’s the next logical step in this bloody fiasco. Neither party wants a nuclear war, but Washington believes that doing nothing is tantamount to backing down, therefore, Hillary and her neocon advisors can be counted on to up the ante. “No-fly zone”, anyone? 
The assumption is that eventually, and with enough pressure, Putin will throw in the towel. But this is another miscalculation. Putin is not in Syria because he wants to be nor is he there because he values his friendship with Syrian President Bashar al Assad. That’s not it at all. Putin is in Syria because he has no choice. Russia’s national security is at stake. If Washington’s strategy of deploying terrorists to topple Assad succeeds, then the same ploy will be attempted in Iran and Russia. Putin knows this, just like he knows that the scourge of foreign-backed terrorism can decimate entire regions like Chechnya. He knows that it’s better for him to kill these extremists in Aleppo than it will be in Moscow. So he can’t back down, that’s not an option. ORDER IT NOW 
But, by the same token, he can compromise, in other words, his goals and the goals of Assad do not perfectly coincide. For example, he could very well make territorial concessions to the US for the sake of peace that Assad might not support. 
But why would he do that? Why wouldn’t he continue to fight until every inch of Syria’s sovereign territory is recovered? 
Because it’s not in Russia’s national interest to do so, that’s why. Putin has never tried to conceal the fact that he’s in Syria to protect Russia’s national security. That’s his main objective. But he’s not an idealist, he’s a pragmatist who’ll do whatever he has to to end the war ASAP. That means compromise. 
This doesn’t matter to the Washington warlords….yet. But it will eventually. Eventually there will be an accommodation of some sort. No one is going to get everything they want, that much is certain. For example, it’s impossible to imagine that Putin would launch a war on Turkey to recover the territory that Turkish troops now occupy in N Syria. In fact, Putin may have already conceded as much to Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan in their recent meetings. But that doesn’t mean that Putin doesn’t have his red lines. He does. Aleppo is a red line. Turkish troops will not be allowed to enter Aleppo. 
The western corridor, the industrial and population centers are all red lines. On these, there will be no compromise. Putin will help Assad remain in power and keep the country largely intact. But will Turkey control sections in the north, and will the US control sections in the east? 
Probably. This will have to be worked out in negotiations, but its unlikely that the country’s borders will be the same as they were before the war broke out. Putin will undoubtedly settle for a halfloaf provided the fighting ends and security is restored. In any event, he’s not going to hang around until the last dog is hung. 
Unfortunately, we’re a long way from any settlement in Syria, mainly because Washington is nowhere near accepting the fact that its project to rule the world has been derailed. That’s the crux of the matter, isn’t it? The bigshots who run the country are still in denial. It hasn’t sunk in yet that the war is lost and that their nutty jihadist-militia plan has failed. 
It’s going to take a long time before Washington gets the message that the world is no longer its oyster. The sooner they figure it out, the better it’ll be for everyone.

19203,The Latest on the Ryan Lochte Case - The New York Times,"RIO DE JANEIRO  —   The American swimmers Ryan Lochte, Jimmy Feigen, Jack Conger and Gunnar Bentz left a lavish Olympics party hosted by the French authorities early Sunday morning. They got into a taxi for the ride across Rio de Janeiro to their lodgings in the athletes’ village. What happened next has been the subject of intense police scrutiny, diplomatic debate and widespread criticism  —   first for Rio’s crime problems, and then for the behavior of the four American athletes. What’s the latest? Mr. Conger and Mr. Bentz were allowed to fly back to the United States on Thursday night. (The night before, they were pulled off their flight and detained for questioning.) Mr. Feigen agreed to donate $11, 000 to a Brazilian charity in an effort to receive permission to leave the country, according to news reports Friday morning. Mr. Lochte returned to the United States earlier in the week and apologized Friday for his role in the episode (see below). What happened? The taxi stopped at a gas station and the swimmers got out to use the restroom. The police say that after one or more of them vandalized the restroom, a security guard brandished a gun to keep them under control until the police arrived. The chief of police said Thursday that the swimmers paid for the damages  —   about $50  —   and left before the police arrived. In his original account, Mr. Lochte said the car had been pulled over by armed men, one of whom put a gun against his head before taking the cash from his wallet. He subsequently altered his version of events. What aspects of the incident remain unclear? Many. There is little doubt that one or more of the American athletes damaged the gas station restroom. What happened after that is less clear: Who brandished a gun? Did any of the athletes grow combative? Did the athletes understand that they were being asked to pay for the restroom damages, or did they believe they were being extorted? How did United States officials respond when the reports first emerged? What are the possible legal consequences for the athletes? The judge who oversees the special court handling the case said the crime the athletes have been accused of  —   making false statements about a crime  —   “is not that serious. ” He said it would not result in any time in prison if they were found guilty. Why did the swimmers describe the incident inaccurately? We don’t know yet. The police chief speculated that the accounts were fabricated to disguise that the swimmers had remained at the party until almost sunrise. He said one of the first leads in the investigation had come from a taxi driver who gave a ride to two Brazilian women who had left the same party and discussed having romantic encounters with the swimmers. “At least one of the athletes may have had a motive for telling a story that wasn’t true,” he said. Have the swimmers apologized? On Friday, Mr. Lochte apologized, in a statement on Twitter, “for not being more careful and candid in how I described the events of that early morning and for my role in taking the focus away from the many athletes fulfilling their dreams of participating in the Olympics. ” Many Brazilians have said they wanted to see contrition from the swimmers because, they say, the false claims portrayed Rio grossly on an international stage. Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the Rio Olympics, had said an apology was not necessary. Nevertheless, on Friday, he said, “We accept and appreciate his apology,” according to The Associated Press. Scott Blackmun, the chief executive of the United States Olympic Committee, issued an apology in a statement Thursday night. “The behavior of these athletes is not acceptable, nor does it represent the values of Team USA or the conduct of the vast majority of its members,” the statement said. “On behalf of the United States Olympic Committee, we apologize to our hosts in Rio and the people of Brazil for this distracting ordeal in the midst of what should rightly be a celebration of excellence. ”",0
19204,Italians Rejoice as Soros Ally Mayor Awarded UN Prize for Welcoming Migrants Kicked Out of Office,"Italians this week cheered the electoral defeat of a mayor who signed a deal with George Soros to turn the tiny island of Lampedusa into a gateway to Europe for migrants travelling from Africa. [“Thank you, you have eradicated the Lampedusa cancer,” read graffiti sprayed across walls on several streets of the small island with just 6, 000 residents after voters ousted Mayor Giusi Nicolini.  The Lampedusa native was kicked into third place at local elections Sunday, locals electing businessman Salvatore “Totò” Martello, who said during the campaign that he “cannot stand seeing migrants swarming everywhere”. Since taking office in 2012 the outgoing mayor transformed the island into a gateway to Europe, streamlining migrant processing to enable Lampedusa’s reception centre to process and give shelter to 700 asylum seekers at a time,  moving most of them on to Sicily or the Italian mainland. Nicolini, who has used her status as a public figure to repeatedly promote open borders and acceptance of mass migration to Europe, was two months ago awarded the UNESCO Peace Prize for her “boundless humanity and unwavering commitment to refugee crisis management and integration”. And in October last year, the decorated mayor attended dinner with Barack Obama at the White House, brought along by Italy’s   Minister, the unelected technocrat Matteo Renzi, as one of the people who represented the best of Italy. Following Nicolini’s defeat, “conservative activists joyfully posted altered images representing the former mayor as an illegal immigrant expelled from the country and memes claiming she is an agent of George Soros,” according to the Washington Post, which described the Hungarian billionaire as “the liberal tycoon whom conspiracy theorists accuse of being behind the wave of African immigration to Europe. ” The outgoing mayor rushed to destroy and delete “files, documents, private correspondence and entire folders” from computers in her office upon her electoral defeat, telling the media: “No, I do not have time to respond to Martello, my priorities lie elsewhere. ” Questioning her haste in clearing the mayoral office, several Italian websites pointed to documents that emerged in 2014 which showed Nicolini signed a “memorandum of understanding” with Open Society Initiative for Europe (OSIFE) in which the   agreed to let Soros’ international funding network “help strengthen Lampedusa’s capacity [to take migrants] and promote the island’s population and its guests. ” Noting how, with so many African migrants arriving on boats, Lampedusa “operates in a state of chronic emergency” the OSIFE document asserts the island “will require manpower and expertise to complement its current workforce. ” Under the terms of the agreement, the funding body sent personnel to Lampedusa who set up “humanitarian” and “cultural” projects on the island,. “The agreement does not provide direct financing,” the document states, explaining that “OSIFE will provide the service via a person on the island with skills suitable for the purpose, and adding that funds allocated to Lampedusa will be sent to “specific bank accounts” which must be used specifically for projects promoting mass migration. Last year, leaked OSIFE documents revealed Soros proclaimed that mass migration to Europe should be accepted as a “new normal” carrying with it “new opportunities” for the billionaire’s cash to influence immigration policies on a global scale.",0

19206,Four Simple Reasons Why the Global Elite Hate Russia - globalintelhub,"In our previous article The Secret Truth about Russia Exposed, we elaborated on how Russia is a convenient enemy for politicians and specifically the Democratic party, to create an enemy that really , well - doesn't exist to distract and confuse voters. But like with any 'enemy' if you bomb a village, you may have some pissed off villagers. As we explain in our best selling book Splitting Pennies - the world doesn't work the way you see on TV - in fact, it works more closely as seen on Zero Hedge. 
Although Russia simply is just a country in the wrong place at the wrong time (which, throughout Russian history, seems to be a theme for them) - there really is a reason the Elite hate Russia. It's not because they're Xenophobic, although there's that too - it's because of several key factors that make Russia a unique power in the world, compared to similar countries. 
1. Russia is an independent country. It's not possible to manipulate Russia via external remote control, like it is most countries. The Elite don't like that! Russia kicked out Soros ""Open Society"": Russia has banned a pro-democracy charity founded by hedge fund billionaire George Soros, saying the organization posed a threat to both state security and the Russian constitution. In a statement released Monday morning, Russia's General Prosecutor's Office said two branches of Soros' charity network — the Open Society Foundations (OSF) and the Open Society Institute (OSI) — would be placed on a ""stop list"" of foreign non-governmental organizations whose activities have been deemed ""undesirable"" by the Russian state. 
2. Russia is not easy to cripple via clandestine means, whether it be CIA, MI6, or outright military conflict. Some other BRICs however, that's not the case. Say what you will about Russia's military - it's on par and in many cases, advanced, compared to the US military. And that's not AN opinion, that's in the opinion of top US military commanders: Late in September, we brought you “ US Readies Battle Plans For Baltic War With Russia ” in which we described a series of thought experiments undertaken by The Pentagon in an effort to determine what the likely outcome would be should something go horribly “wrong” on the way to landing the US in a shooting war with Russia in the Balkans. 
The results of those thought experiments were not encouraging. As a reminder, here’s how Foreign Policy summed up the exercises: 
3. Russian culture, and language, is too complex for the average ""Elite"" who pretends to be internationally well versed because they had a few semesters of French. For example, when the diplomat Clinton was Secretary of State, she presented a reset button translating the opposite meaning... ooops. ""I would like to present you with a little gift that represents what President Obama and Vice President Biden and I have been saying and that is: 'We want to reset our relationship, and so we will do it together.' ... 
""We worked hard to get the right Russian word. Do you think we got it?"" she asked Lavrov, laughing. “You got it wrong,"" said Lavrov, as both diplomats laughed. 
“It should be “perezagruzka” [the Russian word for reset],"" said Lavrov.""This says ‘peregruzka,’ which means ‘overcharged.’” 
Yes, it's almost a certainty that if Clinton by some horrible fate is President there will be Nuclear war. Wars have been started over much more subtle mistakes. One would think, that Clinton would have had an advisor CHECK THIS before presenting it in a public ceremony, in front of reporters? How much more blatantly unprofessional can one be? If politicians worked in the private sector, they wouldn't last a day! How do these people advance so far in politics? 
4. Plain and simple, the Elite do not control Russia. While there are backchannels of Russian oligarchs that work directly with Western Rothschild interests, for example, they simply don't have the same level of control as they do European countries, like Germany for instance. Or another good example is China, there's this fanatical talk that China can dump US Treasuries blah blah blah the fact is that China is completely dependent on USA and US Dollars, and will be for the rest of our lives. Maybe in 1000 years in the Dong Dynasty still to come they will rule the world but it's not going to happen anytime soon. 
Russia is one of the most highly misunderstood cultures in the West. Which is strange, because Russia is more like America than any European country: Both Russia and America share huge landmasses with large undeveloped territory Both Russia and America are predominantly white christian majorities (although in last decades, America tries to be more of a melting pot whereas Russia favors ethnic cleansing) Both Russia and America fought against Hitler and the Nazis during World War 2, the defining event of the last 60 years 
There have been numerous interesting situations where Russia helped America and America helped Russia on a number of levels, to learn more about it checkout the following books: 
Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution . Armand Hammer: The Untold Story 
Most interestingly, during the Nixon administration Kissinger was prodding Nixon to partner with Russia that would, in Kissinger's view would create an unstoppable alliance, that no one could compete with such a superpower axis. But, it didn't happen, as there were 'neo-cons' who were against it, mostly Polish Catholics who have some deep genetic fear of any culture using the Cyrillic alphabet. 
Nixon instead chose China (what a mistake!) and created Forex. But the point being that, through a small slip of fate, ""China"" may have been in this alternative Kissinger reality the 'Great Evil Enemy' hacking our elections, as we drive across the Alaskan-Siberian highway without any speed limit, oil would be ten cents a gallon, and we wouldn't need to war with the Middle East.

19208,A Greek Donbass? Cyprus between Russia and NATO,"November 4, 2016 -  Aris Petasis, Katehon - c.e. by J. Arnoldski 


The Cyprus problem is a Russian problem as well. The current purblind negotiations, ostensibly between the two Cypriot communities (82% Greek and 18% Turkish), are strictly directed by NATO under the watchful eye of 40,000 Turkish occupation troops that hold 37% of Cyprus’s land and 54% of its shores. At every major juncture in Cyprus’ recent history, one finds an obsession with Russia by Britain and its successor in the Eastern Mediterranean (EM), America.  
The Russia factor featured strongly in 1878 and, of course, before. In that year, the Ottomans ceded Cyprus to Britain in exchange for the United Kingdom's military support to the Ottomans (read: Turkish) should Russia attempt to take possession of Ottoman territories in Asia. Here we see the people of Cyprus treated as a commodity and Turkey and Britain acting as traders treating Russia as collateral.  
With the start of WWI, Cyprus was put under British military occupation (1914-1925) and then became a colony of the British crown (1925-1960.) During WWI, when the Turks joined the losing side, Britain promised to cede Cyprus to Greece just as it did in 1864 with some Greek-populated islands. But Britain reneged on its promise perfidiously because of its obsession with keeping Russia in check in the EM. The Treaty of Lausanne of 1923 established the new Turkish state, which in turn formally recognized Britain's sovereignty over Cyprus (Article 20). 
The British distrusted the Greeks because of favorable Greek sentiment towards Russia. Beyond the cultural links between Greeks and Russians, Russia deservedly earned the appreciation of the Greeks. In 1770, at Catherine the Great’s behest, the Orlov brothers attempted, although unsuccessfully, to free the Greeks from Turkish bondage. The Greek General Alexander Ypsilanti, who fought against Napoleon as an officer of the Russian Cavalry, led the Greek war of independence against the Turks. The Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ioannis Kapodistrias, was the first Governor of liberated Greece. The battle of Navarino of 1827, that saw the crushing of the Turkish navy, was initiated by Russia (with Rear-Admiral Lodewijk Heyden of the Imperial Russian Navy) and only then, so as not to be left out, did France and Britain (with philhellene Vice-Admiral Edward Codrington) joined the fray. This led to independence in 1829 for some Greek territory.  
Just after WWII, when the issue of Cyprus was raised again, the British toyed with the idea of ceding Cyprus to Greece. The project was stopped when the British (and Americans) cunningly brought up the imaginary danger of Greece falling under communism and ultimately siding with the Soviet Union (read: Russia). Of course, the Yalta agreement prevented such an eventuality (Greece went to the West by 90%) whilst the massive military support the British and Americans gave the anti-communists (many of whom were shadowy characters and collaborators) sealed the communists’ fate. 
Here again, the legitimate ambitions of the Greeks of Cyprus were thwarted largely on account of the West’s obsession with stopping Russia. 
Years later, after Cyprus was given fettered independence by the British in 1960, NATO accused Cyprus’ president of close relations with Cypriot “communists.” In response, NATO started to work tirelessly towards the dissolution of the Republic of Cyprus (RofCy) out of fear that Russia would use the “communists” as a wedge to gain entry into Cyprus. All of this was, of course, nonsense.  
So, the British set their sights on replacing the RofCy with a new amalgam to be run 50-50 by the 18% Turks and the 82% Greeks, thereby ushering in minority tyranny and government paralysis. This was meant to meet NATO’s two objectives in Cyprus: a.) to set up a regime that would be paralyzed by the Turkish minority’s vetoes so that the Greeks would never be able to side with fraternal Russia, and b.) to establish in Cyprus a second NATO (Turkish) presence in addition to Britain’s.  
The Americans want - in this order - Cyprus, Crete, and Greece as military staging posts against anyone that dares to refuse to succumb to the American line. In the last twenty years, NATO and co. have used the British military bases in Cyprus regularly to bomb a multitude of countries. Now, NATO is just a step away from meeting both objectives. The first objective has already been met in that the Greek nomenklatura of the last 8 years accepted the dissolution of the RofCy and its replacement by a 50-50 “Frankenstein state.”  
As regards the additional NATO military base on Cyprus, all guns are now trained on the already browbeaten Greek representatives. NATO remains optimistic. In this way, NATO hopes to seal Russia’s and Greece’s fate in Cyprus - but what has been agreed upon to date will still need to be put to referendum. If the plan goes through, the Greeks will be put on the path to emigration. Uncertainty will reign, conflict will rule, and violence and intimidation against the Greeks will probably be organized from Turkey. In the absence of a serious central government, mass colonization by Turkey will immediately follow, since any mechanisms of control will all but disappear. 
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova was right when she recently accused the West of persistent attempts to speed up negotiations and push for a solution at all costs. She warned of a repeat of the 2004 fiasco when the disastrous NATO-initiated Anan plan (masquerading as a UN plan) was massively rejected by the people of Cyprus and is blatantly supported by those in power now. The same sources continue to support the current NATO plan. Fortunately, there is a huge chasm separating some among the political elite of Cyprus and those who consider the people’s desire for a democratic rather than a NATO solution. 
Incidentally, the current administration in Cyprus has repeatedly called on NATO to accept Cyprus in its ranks, forgetting that NATO’s primary objective is the encirclement of Russia.  

Russia now needs to stand firm on the side of a democratic solution. Using its vast diplomatic weight, Russia can thwart the current NATO plan before it goes to referendum. A strong Russian position will give courage to the people of Cyprus. If the Greeks surrender, NATO will become the choreographer of Cyprus’ political life from now on. Since Greece is merely a sorry bystander, only Russia can save Cyprus. If the NATO plan for Cyprus succeeds, Russia will end up suffering geostrategic casualties and the Greeks of Cyprus will be left as collateral damage.

19209,Awakened Humanity Awaits Fully Scripted Ending to the Election,"Waking Times 
No event in American history (if you ask me) has been more engineered, more anticipated and more built up than the upcoming November 8, 2016 presidential election. Face it. This presidential election season made the truth movement mainstream. Evil and corruption was brought into the light. We’ve observed what a George Soros-like engineered regime breakdown looks and feels like from the inside, our side this time. We had heard and read about all those foreign governments that the US overthrew with their “democracy” tactics using “special forces,” NGOs, paid-for revolutionaries, activists and in some cases flat-out murderous fighters (ISIS, moderate rebels). This time the engineered chaos was happening here in the US. 
This 2016 election season has been packed with outright exposed corruption, lies, propaganda, murders, stolen primaries, fabricated accusations, distractions, staged debates and much more. We have seen a criminally accused presidential candidate get away with crimes in broad daylight while suspected of suffering from Parkinson’s disease, passing out, having seizures and even being followed around by a creepy doctor with a seizure medication injector. This is the stuff Hollywood films are made of. The list of the insanity goes on and on, right? We’ve witnessed plenty of lies, propaganda and Jerry Springer Show -like attacks by the candidates to create just the perfect smokescreen so that Americans are not looking into the events in Aleppo or Mosul much less the Hillary-DNC- mainstream media corruption scandals and revelations. 
Instead of keeping a close eye on the doings of the US criminal empire, the elite relied on a very in-your-face and increasingly arrogant, defiant and now very busted and discredited mainstream media to push the desired paradigm and reinforce it every which way they can. Actually, this understates the situation. What really happened was that the mainstream media joined forces with the chosen candidate of the ruling oligarchs (Hillary) and together their campaign (the DNC-Hillary-Soros-Moveon.org-Michael Moore-Hollywood-mainstream media complex) has brought us to the ending that truth seekers are now looking ahead to with great anxiety and anticipation. Actually, I’m understating the situation again. All or most Americans (awakened or not) are anticipating and anxiously awaiting the end results of the US presidential elections. 
The question we should all be asking then is, how did we get here? Oh, and perhaps more importantly, where are we going? To answer this, one must realize that the ruling elite have plans. They have a lot of money and they have players willing to go along with their plans. Not sure of this? Then please research Sandy Hook or Boston bombing events. Or research many of the crisis actor events of the past few years. 
That’s right. While they were staging one event after another, too many Americans were too busy and too afraid to call these fake events for what they were. Too many Americans fell for the trick that we were supposed to believe mainstream media “stories” and narratives unless we could “prove” that the account didn’t happen the way mainstream media said it did. In other words, many Americans were tricked into believing that, unless proven otherwise, we should BELIEVE mainstream media. Well here we are in October of 2016 and finally (though it has been common knowledge to many of us for a long while) the illegitimacy of the mainstream media is carved in stone. No longer can it be considered a “conspiracy” by anyone, that mainstream media is corrupt and acts as a tool of psychological terrorism against the public on behalf of the ruling elite. 
That said, now it is time to confront the fully engineered and long-planned ending of this 2016 US presidential election. Will staged “ political terrorism, ” a term just introduced a couple of weeks ago into the American psyche, be staged as Mike Adams at Natural News is writing about ? Will this “terrorism” or planned “event” mark the beginning of the end of America? If so, what will happen? How will it all go down? Many are now wondering how deep is this web of corruption and how far will the traitors identified before us be willing to go to destroy America? 
The one thing everyone should accept is that this ending has been planned just like so many “events” of the past several years have been scripted and planned. So today I invite readers to acknowledge this very important singular factor in today’s events. The fact that they are planned. The notion of organic and spontaneous results is something the ruling elite hate. They hate anything that is organic, spontaneous, unpredictable, people-powered, natural and real. They need everything to be controlled, scripted, planned, orchestrated, engineered. Do you see a pattern here? One consciousness longs for freedom, naturalness and spontaneity, the other longs to control, orchestrate, engineer and dictate the ending, like a master would want to control his slave. 
Understanding this fundamental contrast between the control-freak consciousness (think ruling elite) and the free-spirited consciousness, will allow you to see what’s coming this November 8th 2016. What’s coming is a long-awaited day for which the ruling elite have paid a lot of money and hired many people to manipulate and control the ending of. So the real question is, will their operation succeed? Looking at the election day ending from a bird’s-eye view and seeing how the ruling elite think and operate it is not difficult to see that they, too, are waiting for that day so that they can implement whatever plan they’ll need based on the materializing reality at that moment. In this (what I’ll call) wait-and-see plan whose execution will either be entirely controlled from the beginning or be an adjusting reaction-based plan to be determined by the emerging reality, we can be sure that at no point will the ruling elite accept an ending that ruins their plan. In other words, they will adjust their plan as often and as desperately as possible and necessary to engineer an ending to their liking. 
This ultimately is all we need to know to plan our (truth seekers and freedom lovers) next move. And our next move should look something like this if you ask me: 
1- Have a plan including options for self-sustaining yourself and your loved ones (food, water, shelter and other personal needs). 
2- Expect corruption but continue fighting and exposing the perpetrators. Let’s not let one of these traitors (including crisis actors and operatives working for the State) get away with what they have done. 
3- Don’t rely ONLY on the Internet to keep track of developing events. You might want to write down current event information, or better yet print out key articles and documents (proof). Also download important videos; don’t assume these videos will always be available on YouTube or the Internet. Remember we are entering a much more volatile and intense information war age. The main point is we need to archive the evidence against those criminals who have betrayed America and humanity. 
4- Beware of layered psychological operations. Question everything you hear and don’t discount that some “news” is designed for you to hear it (get it?). Unfortunately the controllers have indeed upped the ante when it comes to the information war. In deceptive times like these, grabbing on to the principles you believe in become much more important than agreeing with someone on every little nuance about a particular event. Stay oriented and remember who the bad guys are, especially as we see the Hillary-mainstream media complex laughably blaming Russian president Vladimir Putin for all the now-revealed corruption and criminality of the Clintons, the mainstream media, the DNC and many others. 
Now is the time to confront the very real and very relevant inherent concepts of truth versus lies, lightness versus darkness, freedom versus slavery and knowledge versus hidden knowledge (the occult); because this, my friends, is what we are dealing with. We (truth seekers) are all in this together. We didn’t ask to be put in this show, it sort of came to us. Perhaps we (awakened humanity) are fulfilling a role that we cannot fully understand. This species we call humans needs some members of its kind to save the rest of the species, and if you are reading this then you are probably a chosen vessel in this battle for humanity. 
There is nothing to fear, for the ending has surely been scripted. We (like them) will also respond in real-time in the most effective way possible. What we need to do more than anything else is …. (pay attention) … think ahead just like they do. 
And so today I’m thinking ahead. I have plans for both scenarios (Trump or Hillary declared victory). I have plans for no “political terrorism” and political terrorism, shock or no shock, chaos or no chaos. In my world the problem remains the same until we hold these corrupt ruling elite, their politicians and players all responsible for their criminality and corruption. Plain and simple, the ruling elite must be identified, stopped and held accountable for their crimes against humanity and the US Constitution. This is more important than any presidential election. Will a Trump victory make this accountability more possible? Many are hopeful of this, but ultimately we must find a way to impose our will on the future and not rely on a politician to do this for us. 
Finally, I’m reminded of the very last line of the film The American Dream when the villain asks, “What do you think this is?” and the answer: “This is AMERICA!!” Likewise, let’s remember, this IS America, the politically hijacked land that guarantees each and every individual inherent rights which are clearly and indisputably outlined in the US Constitution. Will an opportunity present itself for the rule of law to be restored or will the ruling elite have their way? That question will very likely be answered at a time not necessarily coinciding with election night. This is a reminder to all that the battle we face for humanity and truth is continuous and very long term, not about one isolated moment or day. About the Author

19210,Cook these six vegetables for even greater health benefits,"Cook these six vegetables for even greater health benefits 
  raw food , cooking , vegetables (NaturalNews) ""To cook or not to cook?"" has been a topic of heated debate among some health food advocates. Raw food junkies claim that eating foods in their most natural state is the answer to all our issues and diseases, cancer included. They believe that cooking destroys essential vitamins, live enzymes and antioxidants vital to our health.While nobody will dispute the fact that adding more raw, organic fruits and vegetables to our diet is essential for overall health and well-being, going raw all the way isn't always the best option either. A study published in the British Journal of Nutrition found that people who followed a strictly raw food diet had normal levels of vitamin A and beta-carotene, but low levels of the antioxidant lycopene. As reported by Scientific American , high lycopene levels have been associated with a lower risk of cancer and heart attacks. According to Rui Hai Liu, an associate professor of food science at Cornell University, lycopene may be an even more potent antioxidant than vitamin C .It seems that some vegetables need a little heat to release their plant goodness. Most plants have a tough cellular structure. Lightly cooking these food makes it easier for the body to break down the plant's thick cell walls, making nutrients more available for absorption .Read on to discover six foods that are healthier cooked. 1. Asparagus Lightly cooking asparagus spears makes it easier for the body to absorb cancer-fighting vitamins such as vitamin A, C and E, as well as folate. Furthermore, higher levels of antioxidants, ferulic acid in particular, have been reported when this vegetable is cooked. 2. Carrots Beta-carotene is the compound that gives carrots their vibrant orange color. The body converts beta-carotene to vitamin A, which is vital for vision, reproduction, bone growth and immune health.Carrots, however, are sturdy vegetables and don't give up their nutrients that quickly. To get the most out of your carrots, Researchers at the University of Arkansas advise that higher levels of beta-carotene are obtained when carrots are cooked. 3. Mushrooms According to Andrew Weil, M.D., mushrooms are indigestible when they are uncooked. He said that thoroughly heating them releases the nutrients they contain, including B vitamins, proteins and minerals, as well as compounds not found in other foods. 4. Pumpkin and other winter squash Not many people will eat raw pumpkin, unless it is put through a juicer , and that is just fine, since cooked pumpkin has been shown to be more nutritious. Just like carrots, pumpkins need a little heat to break down tougher cell walls and release their plant goodness. 5. Spinach Folate, vitamin C, niacin, riboflavin and potassium are more available in raw spinach. However, slightly cooking spinach increases the levels of vitamin A and E, fiber, zinc, thiamin, calcium, iron and protein – as well as essential carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin. 6. Tomatoes While cooking tomatoes reduces vitamin C levels, it also makes lycopene more available to the body. As mentioned earlier, lycopene has been linked to a lower risk of cancer and heart attacks. Vitamin C is an abundant vitamin, so it is well worth the loss.As you can see, raw isn't necessarily always best. However, if you love tomato or spinach salads and can't stand them cooked, that doesn't mean you should stop eating them raw. Whether you enjoy your veggies raw or cooked, the most important thing is that you are eating them in the first place.  ",0

19212,Poll: Majority of Voters Do Not Want Chelsea Clinton to Seek Political Office - Breitbart,"Chelsea Clinton is not getting much support to run for office from American voters, according to a new poll. [Only 27 percent of registered voters say they would support Clinton if she ran for political office, while 48 percent said they would rather not see her run, according to a Morning   poll.  The remaining quarter of voters said they had no opinion or were unsure. Along party lines, Clinton, 37, did not have a lot of support from her own party, with only 48 percent of Democrats saying they would support her in a future run for office. An overwhelming 74 percent of Republicans said they would oppose her candidacy. Clinton performed poorly in the polls among independents as well, with only 20 percent of independents supporting her and 48 percent opposing her. Younger voters, women, and Democrats were more likely to support a possible Clinton run, while men, Republicans, and older voters were more likely not to support a potential Clinton candidacy. Clinton’s popularity is split, with 39 percent saying she is viewed favorably while 38 percent say she is not viewed in a favorable light. Clinton has stoked a lot of speculation about her entrance into the political arena, with many in Democratic circles saying she should run for a House or Senate seat. Clinton has denied that this speculation is true while leaving the door open for a future run. “I really am constantly surprised by the stories of me running for, fill in the blank —  Congress, Senate, City Council, the presidency,” Clinton told Variety in an interview. “I really find this all rather hysterical, because I’ve been asked this question a lot throughout my life, and the answer has never changed. ” “I clearly do not support the president and certainly hope that he is defeated in the next election, but I don’t think I’m the best person for that job,” she added.",0
19213,"He Had 8 Convictions for Driving Drunk. On His 9th, He Got Life. - The New York Times","The first eight convictions for driving while intoxicated didn’t stop Donald Middleton of Houston from sliding behind the wheel and getting his ninth conviction. This time, the judge had had enough. When Mr. Middleton, 56, faced Judge Kathleen Hamilton of the 359th District Court in Texas on Tuesday, she sentenced him to life in prison. He won’t be eligible for parole for 30 years. Such a harsh sentence is uncommon for   convictions, which often lead to temporary license suspensions and prison stays that allow repeat offenders to return to the road. In Mr. Middleton’s case, he still had a valid driver’s license, despite the eight convictions. Mr. Middleton’s case raises the question: How many times does someone have to be caught driving drunk before he or she can no longer legally drive? He was arrested in May 2015 after he turned into the wrong lane and collided   with a vehicle driven by a    who was on the way home from work at a grocery store. Mr. Middleton ran into a nearby convenience store and repeatedly asked a clerk to hide him, prosecutors said. He had a   level of 0. 184, more than twice the legal limit, 0. 08, according to Justin Fowles, a Montgomery County assistant district attorney. Mr. Middleton pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated last May and has been in jail since. The teenager, Joshua Hayden, was not injured, but his father, Rowdy Hayden, said in a telephone interview that he appreciated the judge’s harsh sentence. “It angers me, as a father, that this individual skirted the justice system eight times and was still out here endangering our citizens on the roadway by drinking and driving,” said Mr. Hayden, who is a police constable in Montgomery County. “His proven track record showed he was going to continue to drink and drive. And who knows, the next time he may have killed someone. ” Mr. Middleton had four previous stints in prison for driving while intoxicated. His eighth conviction, in 2008, involved   a car with several people inside they sustained minor injuries. Mr. Middleton fell out of the car and was unable to stand, Mr. Fowles said. The conviction from that episode led to a   prison sentence, of which he served four years. After the most recent conviction, he was classified as a habitual offender, which enabled the longer sentence. “He had proven to us that he can’t be trusted with his own freedom, that he’s a danger to our community and that the best thing for everyone else’s safety on the roadways is for him to never be able to drive again,” Mr. Fowles said in a telephone interview. Rules for stopping habitual drunken drivers vary wildly by state, but repeat offenders tend to get multiple extra chances. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that one in three people arrested on   charges are repeat offenders. In Minnesota, a    man was released from prison last year after a   stay for his 27th conviction related to drunken driving. In Pennsylvania, one man was arrested five times in less than a year, but never lost his driver’s license or served more than 10 days in jail. Punishments also vary by state. In New York, a third aggravated charge of driving while intoxicated can bring a $10, 000 fine and seven years in prison, although penalties can increase for multiple violations within 25 years. In Arkansas, drivers permanently lose their licenses on their fourth   offense within five years, in addition to criminal penalties. J. T. Griffin, the chief government affairs officer for Mothers Against Drunk Driving, said the organization had focused on promoting ignition interlock devices, which require anyone convicted of drunken driving to pass a breathalyzer test before starting a car.   states have laws requiring them, including New York, he said. Suspending licenses can be ineffective when many people continue to drive without a valid license, he said. “We believe in going after D. U. I. the first time, not waiting for the second or third or fourth offense,” Mr. Griffin said. “The first time is unacceptable. And nine times is just ridiculous. ”",0
19214,"Roused by Trump, First-Time Female Candidates Eye Local Seats - The New York Times","NEW BRUNSWICK, N. J.  —   Four years of increasing activism and growing political awareness recently brought Lacey Rzeszowski to Rutgers University here, to a packed room of nearly 280 women, each on the cusp of launching a bid for public office for the first time. Spurred by the 2012 shooting rampage in Newtown, Conn. she had pressured local and federal lawmakers on gun control legislation, first on the backs of postcards and then in live confrontations in town halls and congressional offices. Her advocacy led to calls for her to run for office, but Ms. Rzeszowsk had repeatedly declined. Now, seeking solace and inspiration following the 2016 presidential election and the Women’s March on Washington, Ms. Rzeszowski, 42, is squaring off in a tough race against a local Republican for a seat in the New Jersey Assembly. Political activism of all persuasions, ignited largely in response to President Trump, has swelled in the wake of the 2016 election. A monsoon of marchers swept through Washington following the inauguration, letters and phone calls flooded the White House and Congress, and protests erupted at congressional town hall meetings across the nation. But in the social media age, where protest movements often remain relegated to cable news screens and hashtags, some have wondered whether the fervor and energy would be reflected in local, state and federal ballots. The answer seems to be a resounding yes. A surge in demand for programs around the country like the one at Rutgers, along with a significant spike in   small dollar   for local races, suggests that the protest movement is producing a flood of   led predominantly by new female candidates, on local ballots, from school boards to town councils to state legislatures. Emily’s List, the national organization dedicated to advancing Democratic women in politics, has been contacted by more than 10, 000 women saying they were going to run for local and state office in the four months since Election Day. In the two years leading up to the 2016 election, when the presidential election cycle was at its apex, the group said it had received fewer than 1, 000 contacts. Emily’s List has tripled the resources devoted to state and local races to help meet the demand. “What we’re seeing is not just in New Jersey but it’s happening all around the country,” said Debbie Walsh, the director at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers. “Women are looking for a way to have a voice. They’re feeling that in ways that we haven’t seen the general public experience, the real understanding that elections have consequences. ” This is especially true in states like New Jersey that hold major local and statewide elections this year the deadline to file for primary elections in New Jersey is April 3. “It was the ride down on the New Jersey Turnpike, on a bus, watching all the buses heading to D. C.,” Ms. Rzeszowski said, describing the moment she decided to run as a Democrat, and try to unseat her former party, which she felt had moved too far to the right. She recalled her joy at seeing not just the streets of Washington, but the highways of her home state, flooded with protesters that finally pushed her into a declaration for office. Here at the “Ready to Run” program at Rutgers University  —   an annual event that features classes, conferences and training for women who want to run for office but are unsure of the next steps  —   attendance has climbed by nearly 300 percent compared with past averages, according to the event organizers. Since Ready to Run, a national, nonpartisan training program, was founded 18 years ago, sister programs have popped up around the country, from The Ohio State University to Oklahoma University to Chatham University in Pittsburgh. And at each event this year, attendance is soaring past previous records, often selling out for the first time in its history. New programs have popped up this year in Delaware, Mississippi and Connecticut. “I’ve had a few women email me and invite me just to come into their living rooms and say, ‘Teach us how to do this,’” said Gayle Ann Alberda, a former Republican strategist now teaching politics at Fairfield University in Connecticut and anchoring the effort to bring “Ready to Run” to the school. “They say ‘Hey, I’ll pay you, just come teach us how to run.’ And I’ve never seen this before. ” ActBlue, the Democratic   software, has seen its users, who can be local or state or federal candidates and groups, raise $76 million in     since the election. In the same time frame in 2015, its users took in $16 million. The interest, and the intent to actually take the big step and run for office, is so overwhelming that new groups are popping up across the country with the sole purpose of getting   candidates ready. Run for Something, a national group started after the election to recruit and train Democratic candidates, initially expected 100 or so to show interest. More than 7, 500 have since put a hand up. The swell in interest certainly leans Democratic, and much of the protest and activism following the election of President Trump has come from those more aligned with liberal policies, but the surge is bipartisan in some states. In red Mississippi, a program similar to that at Rutgers is starting at the Stennis Center for Public Service Leadership, a federally funded center that promotes civic engagement. And in the small town of Starkville, Miss. more female candidates are running for municipal office than ever before, including six candidates for mayor. In Utah, another reliably Republican state, the Y. W. C. A.’s Real Women Run program saw more than 200 come out to one of the training sessions. “It’s only March, but it’s my interpretation that it’s more of a democratic surge in Utah because women don’t feel represented,” said Sheryl Allen, 73, a former   Republican legislator from Bountiful, Utah, who helps run the Real Women Run program. She pointed to candidates like Kathryn Allen, a physician who is planning on challenging Representative Jason E. Chaffetz in the state’s 3rd Congressional District in 2018, as one of many examples. A lot of the women here at the Rutgers event seemed to share the energy of Ms. Rzeszowski, and pointed to the Women’s March as the inspiration for their planned runs. Lindsay Brown, a    product manager who is lining up to challenge Representative Leonard Lance in New Jersey’s Seventh Congressional District, cited the march’s “big outpouring of anger, sadness and hope that really inspired me. ” Christine Chen, a    businesswoman from Bridgewater, first felt the push to run the day after the election, when she looked up local legislators to support in the face of her disappointment at the election, only to find her local representatives just as   to her as the new administration. “It was very visceral, like my way of life was under threat,” she recalled, describing the months since November. She has formed a ticket of    candidates in Legislative District 23, with Isaac Hadzovic and Laura Shaw running for State Assembly seats, and Ms. Chen for the State Senate. Some have found inspiration from the election of Mr. Trump himself, though not because they agreed with the president. While she often found his comments during the campaign caustic and controversial, Lucille Lo Sapio, 65, said his irreverence was the liberating force she needed to push her own name onto the ballot. “The fact that he could get up there and literally say anything, most of it untrue, but say it in such an inflammatory way, told me now I’m free to do that,” said Ms. Sapio, a      “irreverent to very irreverent” political blogger aiming to be the first Democratic freeholder elected in Monmouth County, N. J. since 2008. “That’s the way I am, I don’t pull punches,” she said, admitting that she might yet push the envelope further. “The hardest thing for me is going to be not using any profanity. ”",0
19215,ATF Associate Deputy Director: ’Assault Weapons’ Import Ban Nonsensical,"In a “white paper” published by the Washington Post, ATF Associate Deputy Director Ronald Turk shows that a continued ban on the importation of numerous “assault weapons” is nonsensical. [The reasons behind his assessment include the growing use of   and similar rifles for hunting and shooting sports.  Turk wrote, “Since the sunset of the Assault Weapons ban in 2004, the use of     and similar rifles now commonly referred to as ‘modern sporting rifles’  has increased exponentially in sport shooting. These firearm types are now standard for hunting activities. ” Because of his paradigm shift regarding the view and usage of “assault weapons,” Turk suggests the ATF review and update its “almost    study” on such firearms. He then made clear that another reason for lifting importation limitations is the fact that American manufacturers currently make and sell rifles that are identical or similar to many of the firearms that are banned from import. Because of this, “restriction on imports serves questionable public safety interests. ” Turk also noted that a characteristic of importation bans in this area has been modifications to   rifles modifications that allow them to survive the import restrictions and enter the U. S. under different classifications. The various classifications mean more unnecessary work for importers and more paperwork for the ATF. He also addressed suppressors, highlighting their broad use in hunting and shooting sports and suggesting it is “archaic” to continue to regulate them via the National Firearms Act. Turk touched on M1 Garands,   1911s, and other U. S.   firearms that are in holding overseas, awaiting clearance to be shipped back to the U. S. and sold to citizens. He wrote: There is no clear public safety reason why     CR defense articles should be denied   to the American public, while many  . S.  origin CR items are approved. Additionally, these items do not represent any discernable public safety concern, as demand lies with collectors of vintage military firearms. Importation and sale through licensed dealers would effectively regulate the lawful transfer of these firearms through a licensee and a background check.

19216,"In Havana, Castro’s Death Lays Bare a Generation Gap - The New York Times","HAVANA  —   At the Salon Rojo, one of Havana’s most popular nightspots, where the reggaeton usually blares into the early hours, the music stopped abruptly. An announcement was made: Fidel Castro had died. The police waved along young women in miniskirts and young men with gelled mohawks as they spilled into the streets. No one was weeping. No one was chanting. Some said the country would be better off, freer now, though they said it quietly, wary that someone might overhear such hopes. A hearse, repurposed as a taxi, happened to drive by. “Take him with you,” one of the young men shouted with a smile as a friend cheered him on. The young women with them looked embarrassed, but not angry. A few feet away from a crowd of partygoers, three neighbors, each in their 50s and consoling one another, stood in their apartment building’s doorway facing the iconic Hotel Nacional. Concepcion Garcia, 55, looked at the young people around her with disappointment. “What a rich experience we have had, to live the two periods of Cuba  —   capitalism and socialism,” she said. “Imagine how we Cubans feel. The most precious thing we have just died. ” With the departure of Cuba’s epic revolutionary in green fatigues, at the age of 90, the residents of Havana have not erupted so much as moved into their own emotional corners. All over this city on Saturday, indifference and relief stood side by side with sorrow and surprise as the conflicts that characterized Fidel Castro in life continued to reverberate after his death. “He was the only leader I ever knew,” Graciela Martinez, 51, said as she mopped the floors of a cafe near the American Embassy on Saturday morning. She paused, then began to weep, thinking of her father, who fought for the revolution  —   and of her relatives who had fled to the United States. “For those who loved him, he was the greatest,” she said of Mr. Castro. “For those who hated him, there was no one worse. ” Cuba, a verdant, struggling country of 11 million people that has been moving slowly toward   changes, finds itself again at an international crossroads. Mr. Castro died as Venezuela has pulled back financial support, facing its own political and economic crisis, and the détente engineered under President Obama threatens to be rolled back by   Donald J. Trump. While Mr. Obama issued condolences to the Castro family and offered “a hand of friendship to the Cuban people,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, “Fidel Castro is dead!” and later issued a statement calling him a “brutal dictator. ” Cuban officials have long maintained that the island has diversified its international ties enough to withstand financial or political storms. But after decades of unfulfilled promises about economic growth, the passing of Mr. Castro may open rifts both inside and outside Cuba over how to proceed. Elaine Díaz, an independent blogger in Cuba, said she expected Mr. Castro’s death to lead to more diversity of opinion within the leadership. The Cuban government likes to portray itself as a monolith, even though some factions are more conservative than others, she said. “This is going to bring that out in public,” she said. Other divides may also become more visible, especially between generations. Mr. Castro molded the country and governed it for so long that many older Cubans can hardly think of the nation apart from his legacy. But he has also been out of the national spotlight for so long (after handing power to his brother Raúl Castro in stages, beginning in 2006) that many young Cubans have had little exposure to him and do not seem to identify with him. Theirs is a generation that has, in many ways, already become    —   seeing politics as useless and intractable, craving technology and, in many cases, much more eager to leave Cuba than to defend the Communist slogans that are as faded as the billboards still displaying them on the nation’s highways and roads. “In my parents’ generation, there is also still a lot of loyalty. In my generation, you’ll see more differences,” said Ms. Diaz, 31. “In a large portion of the young people, what you will see is apathy. ” On Friday night, for example, many young people did not respond with any visible emotion when they were told of Mr. Castro’s death. On Saturday, many went about their day as usual, arguing that little would change because of Mr. Castro’s demise. “The country will continue on the path that it’s on,” said Abraham Jimenez Enoa, 27, a   of an independent blog called “el estornudo,” or “the sneeze. ” “I don’t really see changes in the near future. ” The response could not have been more different from that of the government or its strongest supporters. Their grief began with a brief televised speech by Raúl Castro announcing that “El Comandante” had died. He did not emphasize that the man was also his brother  —   his passing was a loss for the nation. By sunrise, flags all over Havana had been lowered to  . Young and old gathered in small groups, and where there might have normally been laughter or yelling, whispers filled the void. Much of Havana seemed uncertain about exactly how to feel, or at least how to talk about it. “It is a very strange feeling,” said Francisco Rodríguez Cruz, a prominent blogger and gay activist who supports the revolution. He was one of many who said losing Mr. Castro was like losing a parent. “With this death, you feel that your own life is spread before you,” Mr. Cruz, 46, said. Many others looked back to what they had gained in Fidel’s Cuba. Ms. Garcia removed her glasses and pointed at her eyes. “I have the revolution and Fidel to thank for this cataract surgery,” she said, adding that she would not have been able to afford the procedure without Cuba’s socialized medical care. It did not cost her a cent, she said. “He put Cuba on the map,” Ms. Garcia added, “and the world has recognized that. ” Her neighbor Josue Carmon Arramo, 57, chimed in, “His life may be over, but his work will live on. ” “This story will not die, because we are followers of his ideas of nationalism and solidarity of the Cuban people,” he said. “That’s who we are. ” The official state apparatus seemed ready for the news. A night watchman working near the Malecon  —   the seaside boulevard where so many young people gather that Cubans often call it the city’s longest sofa  —   said he had seen busloads of soldiers pass by before Mr. Castro’s death was widely known. Cuban national television interrupted its regular schedule in favor of historic video clips of Mr. Castro and scenes of the reunion of Elián González with his family in Cuba after the boy was returned from Florida in 2000. Near the American Embassy on Saturday morning, the police circled in patrol cars while men in plain clothes who refused to answer questions about Mr. Castro seemed determined to keep an eye on those nearby. Long after the sun soared over Havana harbor, the Malecon, usually bustling at all hours, was devoid of all but jogging tourists and a few cars. But the news for Cuba’s memorial plans moved through the streets quickly. He was to be cremated Saturday. There would be a period of public mourning in Havana on Monday and Tuesday, and then a procession over the course of the week, with the revolutionary’s ashes moving across the country from Havana to the city known as the cradle of the revolution, Santiago de Cuba, where he would be put to rest on Sunday, Dec. 4. The details, at least, were easier to talk about in public than his legacy. They could not be argued about, or get you in trouble if overheard in conversation. In Miami, by contrast, celebratory crowds gathered at Versailles, a Cuban restaurant in the Little Havana neighborhood that has become a focal point of the Cuban exile community in the United States. Revelers posted videos on social media of popping champagne bottles. Still, in Havana, expectations were limited and often more narrowly focused, on economic survival, and on how little would really change when the mourning was done. “It closes one chapter and starts another,” Miguel Fernandez, 56, said as he walked his dog Saturday near the Malecon. “But it won’t bring about anything substantial. He’s been out of the picture for a while. ”",0
19217,Lightning Strike in Poughkeepsie Kills One and Injures 4 - The New York Times,"A lightning bolt that struck during a   storm killed one person and injured four, two critically, at a park in the center of Poughkeepsie, N. Y. on Friday afternoon, the police and the mayor of the Hudson Valley city said. The most severly injured of the three unresponsive victims who had been taken to the trauma center at Vassar Brothers Medical Center in Poughkeepsie died Saturday around 1 a. m. a hospital spokesman, Tim Massie said. The man, who was not immedietely identified, was 50 years old, Mr. Massie said. The two others remained in the hospital’s intensive care unit. All three were men in their late 40s to early 50s who had been sitting together on the same park bench, he said. The other victims were taken to MidHudson Regional Hospital in Poughkeepsie. Their conditions were not immediately available. The lightning hit at 4:06 p. m. at Mansion Square Park, a popular gathering spot, Mayor Rob Rolison said. The victims were struck on the north side of the park, the police said. The mayor said that there were scorch marks on a nearby tree and that wooden slats on the bench had been knocked off, an indication of where the lightning had struck. Leading up to the episode, the skies darkened quickly in the area over the park and there were several loud thunderclaps, the mayor said. Two witnesses reported seeing a bolt of lightning strike near the group, then smoke and fire, the police said. So far this year, there have been 25 lightning deaths nationally, according to the National Weather Service, not including the death in Poughkeepsie. That number includes Richard Garlock, 34, and Jenea Macleod, 32, who were killed on Wednesday at a cemetery in Batavia, N. Y. according to the service. Based on reported deaths and injuries, the service estimated the odds of any one person being struck by lightning in a given year at 1 in 1. 2 million.",0
19218,"Vladimir Putin Exits Nuclear Security Pact, Citing ‘Hostile Actions’ by U.S. - The New York Times","MOSCOW  —   Saying relations with the United States have deteriorated in a “radically changed environment,” President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia withdrew Monday from a landmark nuclear security agreement, in a troubling sign that the countries’ cooperation in a range of nuclear areas could be threatened. The treaty, on the disposal of plutonium, the material used in some nuclear weapons, was concluded in 2000 as one of the framework disarmament deals of the early   War period. It required Russia and the United States to destroy military stockpiles of plutonium, a deal that represented another encouraging step away from nuclear doomsday and an insurance policy against the materials falling into the hands of terrorists or rogue states. The deal has no bearing on the numbers of nuclear weapons deployed by Russia or the United States. Instead, it concerns 34 tons of plutonium in storage in each country that might go into a future arsenal, none of which has yet undergone verifiable disposal. Still, the abrogation signals that the nuclear agreements that accompanied the breakup of the Soviet Union and were to lead the world back from the   brink of atomic conflict could be open to revision, as Russia’s relations with the West sour on a range of disputes today, including Syria and Ukraine and the Kremlin’s interference in the domestic politics of Western democracies. The Kremlin had signaled previously that it planned to cut back on mutual efforts with the United States to secure nuclear material on Russian territory. Times have changed, Mr. Putin wrote in the decree signed on Monday. “The threat to strategic stability posed by the hostile actions of the U. S. against Russia, and the inability of the U. S. to deliver on the obligation to dispose of excessive weapons plutonium under international treaties” forced Russia’s hand, he wrote. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said the administration was disappointed by the Russian decision since “both leaders in Russia and the United States have made nonproliferation a priority. ” “We’ve also been quite disappointed by a range of Russian decisions both in Syria and inside of Ukraine,” Mr. Earnest said, adding that the decision on the plutonium deal was part of a problematic pattern. Russia will withdraw from the original pact and subsequent amendments, the decree says, meaning that the country will no longer be   to destroy its plutonium stockpiles. But the decree also offers an assurance, backed by no bilateral agreement, that the plutonium will not be used for military purposes. “These agreements were designed to limit and circumscribe the future chances of getting back into a competition over nuclear arms,” James Collins, an associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said in a telephone interview. “It was an important step in defusing the strategic nuclear arms race. ” Mr. Collins, who was the United States’ ambassador to Russia when the agreement was signed, called the abrogation a “strange move,” given the extraordinary danger, not least to Russians, should plutonium fall into terrorist hands. He added that it was “in my understanding the first time they have withdrawn from a specific nuclear agreement,” highlighting the slide in relations lately. Russia and the United States had reaffirmed the plutonium disposal agreement in 2009, as President Obama pursued the “reset” policy with Dmitri A. Medvedev, then the Russian president. Russia had viewed the agreement as rendering disarmament irreversible by destroying the fissile materials accumulated during the Cold War. In this light, the Russians had interpreted the treaty as requiring that the plutonium be irreversibly transformed into nonexplosive materials by using it in civilian nuclear power plants as a type of fuel, called mixed oxide fuel, or mox. Russia is pressing ahead with that. But glitches and cost overruns in the mox plant at Savannah River, S. C. delayed the American program. This year, Mr. Obama proposed canceling the program in the 2017 budget and instead sending the plutonium for   storage at a nuclear waste site in Carlsbad, N. M. The State Department has said the move complies with the treaty, but the Russians have said it does not, as Mr. Putin reaffirmed on Monday. As ties with the West have frayed under Mr. Putin, analysts in Moscow have floated the prospect of a Russian pullback from an array of disarmament agreements dating from a period of greater friendliness. Two years ago, for example, the Obama administration accused Russia of violating another bedrock security agreement by testing a prohibited   cruise missile. In Mr. Putin’s second term in office, Russia pulled out of a treaty governing conventional forces in Europe in retaliation for the Bush administration’s abrogation of the antiballistic missile treaty that prohibited missile defense systems. Russia and the United States last signed a nuclear disarmament accord in 2009, when both sides agreed to a new limit on delivery vehicles such as bombers or cruise missiles of 500 to 1, 100, and a limit on deployed warheads as low as 1, 500. In the chaos surrounding the end of the Cold War, the United States embarked on a sweeping program to secure the former Soviet Union’s nuclear arsenal and fissile materials by returning them to Russia from former Soviet states and upgrading security at storage areas. The Soviet nuclear program was so entwined with the economy and society that slowing the Cold War military machine took years and cost United States taxpayers billions of dollars. In several cities, specialized nuclear reactors, for example, continued to pump out plutonium because they were also used to heat water for residential use in showers and space heating in nearby towns. A 1993 agreement allowed Russia to sell   uranium bomb cores to American utilities for use as fuel rods in civilian power plants, in a    program called Megatons to Megawatts. This program generated about 10 percent of all electricity in the United States for 20 years, until 2013. The plutonium program, while smaller, held the potential to also yield energy for civilian electrical networks. It seems unlikely that the two countries will resume cooperation on plutonium soon. The Kremlin first wants the removal of all economic sanctions and compensation for the damage they have caused the repeal of the Magnitsky Act, which allows Americans to freeze the assets of Russian officials thought to have been involved with human rights violations and reductions in the American military presence in countries that joined NATO after Sept. 1, 2000.",0
19219,Queen Elizabeth II owns every dolphin in Britain and doesn't need a driving licence and doesn't pay tax — here are the incredible powers you didn't know the monarchy has,"Email 
Queen Elizabeth II is not like you and me. 
Did you know she is immune from prosecution? That she has her own personal poet, paid in Sherry wine? Or that she holds dominion over British swans and can fire the entire Australian government? 
It's true that her role as the British head of state is largely ceremonial, and the Monarch no longer holds any serious power from day to day. The historic ""prerogative powers"" of the Sovereign have been devolved largely to government ministers. But this still means that when the British government declares war, or regulates the civil service, or signs a treaty, it is doing so only on her authority. 
And she still wields some of these prerogative powers herself — as well as numerous other unique powers, ranging from the surprising to the utterly bizarre. 
Most famously, she owns all swans in the River Thames. 
Technically, all unmarked swans in open water belong to the Queen, though the Crown ""exercises her ownership"" only ""on certain stretches of the Thames and its surrounding tributaries,"" according to the official website of the Royal Family. 
Today this tradition is observed during the annual ""Swan Upping,"" in which swans in the River Thames are caught, ringed, and set free again as part of census of the swan population. 
It's a highly ceremonial affair, taking place over five days. ""Swan uppers"" wear traditional uniforms and row upriver in six skiffs accompanied by the Queen's Swan Marker. 
""The swans are also given a health check and ringed with individual identification numbers by The Queen's Swan Warden, a Professor of Ornithology at the University of Oxford's Department of Zoology,"" according to the Royal Family website. 
""Rule, Britannia, Britannia rules the waves,"" goes a classic British song — and this rule extends beneath the waves, too. The sovereign has dominion over a variety of aquatic animals in British waters. 
The Queen still technically owns all the sturgeons, whales, and dolphins in the waters around England and Wales, in a rule that dates back to a statute from 1324, during the reign of King Edward II, according to Time. 
According to the article: ""This statute is still valid today, and sturgeons, porpoises, whales, and dolphins are recognised as 'fishes royal': when they are captured within 3 miles (about 5 km) of UK shores or wash ashore, they may be claimed on behalf of the Crown. Generally, when brought into port, a sturgeon is sold in the usual way, and the purchaser, as a gesture of loyalty, requests the honour of its being accepted by Elizabeth."" 
The law is still observed: In 2004, a Welsh fisherman was investigated by the police after catching a 10-foot sturgeon, the BBC reported at the time. The Scottish government also issued guidance on the law in 2007, writing that ""the right to claim Royal Fish in Scotland allows the Scottish Government (on behalf of the Crown) to claim stranded whales which are too large to be drawn to land by a 'wain pulled by six oxen.'"" 
The Queen can drive without a licence. 
Driving licenses are issued in the Queen's name, yet she is the only person in the United Kingdom who doesn't legally need a license to drive or a number plate on her cars, according to Time. 
Despite not being required to have a license, the Queen is comfortable behind the wheel, having learned to drive during World War II when she operated a first-aid truck for the Women's Auxillary Territorial Service. (As a result of the Queen's training, she can also change a spark plug, Time notes). 
Queen Elizabeth II isn't afraid to show off her driving skills, either. In 1998, she surprised King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia (then still a prince) by driving him around in her country seat of Balmoral. 
Former British Ambassador Sherard Cowper-Coles recounted the meeting in the Sunday Times: ""As instructed, the crown prince climbed into the front seat of the front Land Rover, with his interpreter in the seat behind. To his surprise, the Queen climbed into the driving seat, turned the ignition and drove off. Women are not — yet — allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia, and Abdullah was not used to being driven by a woman, let alone a queen."" 
Cowper-Coles continued: ""His nervousness only increased as the Queen, an army driver in wartime, accelerated the Land Rover along the narrow Scottish estate roads, talking all the time. Through his interpreter, the crown prince implored the Queen to slow down and concentrate on the road ahead."" 
Unlike other members of the Royal family, the Queen does not require a passport, as they are issued in her name. Despite this lack of travel documents, she has been abroad many times. 
She has two birthdays. 
When you're the British head of state, one birthday just isn't enough. The Queen's official birthday is celebrated on a Saturday in June, though her actual birthday is on April 21. 
""Official celebrations to mark a sovereign's birthday have often been held on a day other than the actual birthday, particularly when the actual birthday has not been in the summer,"" according to the Royal Mint. 
Both birthdays are celebrated in suitable style, too. Her actual birthday ""is marked publicly by gun salutes in central London at midday,"" according to the official website of the British Monarchy. This includes ""a 41-gun salute in Hyde Park, a 21-gun salute in Windsor Great Park, and a 62-gun salute at the Tower of London. In 2006, Her Majesty celebrated her 80th Birthday in 2006 with a walkabout in the streets outside of Windsor Castle to meet well-wishers."" 
For her ""official"" birthday celebrations, meanwhile, she ""is joined by other members of the Royal Family at the spectacular Trooping the Colour parade, which moves between Buckingham Palace, The Mall, and Horseguards' Parade."" 
She has her own private cash machine. 
Less a ""power"" and more a perk of the job, a private cash machine for use by the royal family is installed in the basement of Buckingham Palace. It's provided by Coutts, one of Britain's most prestigious — and exclusive — banks. 
The Queen has her own personal poet. 
The poet laureate is an honorary position in British society appointed by the Monarch to a poet ""whose work is of national significance,"" according to the official website of the British Monarchy. When first the role was introduced, the appointee was paid £200 per year plus a butt of canary wine. Today the poet laureate is given a barrel of Sherry. 
Carol Ann Duffy will hold the position until 2019. 
She has to sign laws. 
The Queen's consent is necessary to turn any bill into an actual law. Once a proposed law has passed both houses of Parliament, it makes its way to the Palace for approval, which is called ""Royal Assent."" The most recent British Monarch to refuse to provide Royal Assent was Queen Anne, back in 1708. 
Royal Assent is different than ""Queen's consent,"" in which the Queen must consent to any law being debated in Parliament that affects the Monarchy's interests (such as reforming the prerogative or tax laws that might affect the Duchy of Cornwall, for example). Without consent, the bill cannot be debated in Parliament. 
Queen's consent is exercised only on the advice of ministers, but its existence provides the government with a tool for blocking debate on certain subjects if bills are tabled by backbench rebels or the opposition. 
It has been exercised at least 39 times, according to documents released under the Freedom of Information act, including ""one instance [in which] the Queen completely vetoed the Military Actions Against Iraq Bill in 1999, a private member's bill that sought to transfer the power to authorise military strikes against Iraq from the monarch to parliament,"" The Guardian reported in 2013. 
She can create Lords. 
The Queen has the power to appoint Lords, who can then sit in Parliament, the upper house in Britain's legislative system. Like many other powers, this is exercised only ""on the advice of"" elected government ministers. 
She doesn't have to pay tax (but she does anyway). 
The Queen does not have to pay tax, but she has been voluntarily paying income tax and capital gains tax since 1992. 
The Queen has the power to form governments. 
Unlike the Queen, Prime Minister David Cameron doesn't literally sit on a throne. Rob Stothard/Getty Images/HBO/BI 
The Queen previously wielded the power to dissolve Parliament and call a general election, but the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act put an end to that in 2011. Now a two-thirds vote in the commons is required to dissolve Parliament before a five-year fixed-term is up. 
She does still play a part after an election, however, when she calls on the MP most able to form a government to do so. 
This caused some worry ahead of this year's General Election. It once looked as if the Conservatives might not have a majority (but would be the largest party) and would try to form a government. Meanwhile, it was feasible that Labour could form a majority, despite having fewer seats, by entering into a coalition with multiple other parties. 
In this situation, the Queen would have been stuck between a rock and a hard place. Every year, she opens Parliament with the Queen's speech, which lays out the government's plans. But to give David Cameron's speech would arguably be to tacitly endorse his government — while staying away would send the opposite message. 
At one point, The Times was told by sources that she planned to ""stay away"" if Cameron failed to secure enough MPs, but the Palace later had an about-face. ""Royal sources confirmed she would lead proceedings, even if there was a risk the speech would be overthrown the following week because the Tories had failed to muster enough backing from smaller parties,"" The Times subsequently reported. 
She has knights.​ 
Sure, they no longer ride around on horseback wooing maidens with their tales of valour, but Britain still retains knights. Like Lords, they are appointed by the Queen — and she knights them personally. 
Knighthoods are typically given to figures who have made a particular contribution to British society — whether in business, the arts, the military, or elsewhere. After Terry Pratchett was knighted, the legendary fantasy author forged himself a special sword using pieces of a meteorite. 
The individuals knighted are decided by ministers, the BBC reports, ""who present her with a list of nominees each year for her approval."" 
She is exempt from Freedom Of Information requests. 
All information about the royal family is exempt from Freedom of Information requests. The exemption was made after a legal battle between The Guardian and the government to have letters from Prince Charles sent to Whitehall ministers made public. The so-called black spider memos were recently released, but the change means the same can't happen in the future. 
She can ignore or overrule ministerial advice in ""grave constitutional crisis."" 
While the overwhelming majority of the Queen's prerogative powers are devolved to her ministers, there is one exception that allows her to wield power herself. Only ""in grave constitutional crisis,"" the Sovereign can ""act contrary to or without Ministerial advice."" With no precedent in modern times, it's not clear what would actually constitute this, but the possibility remains. 
The Queen holds the ability to fire the entire Australian government. 
As the head of state in Australia, the Queen has certain powers over the government. In 1975, for example, the Queen's representative in the country at the time, Gov. Gen. Sir John Kerr, fired the prime minister in response to a government shutdown. 
""[Kerr] appointed a replacement, who immediately passed the spending bill to fund the government, Max Fisher wrote in The Washington Post. ""Three hours later, Kerr dismissed the rest of Parliament. Then Australia held elections to restart from scratch. And they haven't had another shutdown since."" 
In addition to the UK and Australia, the Queen is also the head of state in Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu. 
All the above are Commonwealth Realms, or former British colonies. The British sovereign retains the position she holds in the United Kingdom, that of head of state. As in Britain, this is largely a ceremonial role from day to day. 
She's the head of a religion. 
Queen Elizabeth II is the head of the Church of England, Britain's state religion first established after King Henry VIII split away from the Catholic Church in Rome in the 16th century. 
Her formal title is defender of the faith and supreme governor of the Church of England, and she also has the power to appoint Bishops and Archbishops. As with many of her other powers, however, this is exercised only on the advice of the prime minister, who himself takes advice from a Church Commission. 
An interesting side effect of this is that the Sovereign must be a confirmed member of Church of England. Catholics and those of other religions may not ascend to the British throne. If Prince Charles converted to Islam, for example, he would be unable to become king after Queen Elizabeth II dies. 
She gets to give away special money to the elderly. 
Maundy money is a special kind of silver coin the Queen gives away to pensioners every year at a UK cathedral every Easter in a special ceremony. The number of recipients corresponds with the Sovereign's age. This year, for example, she will be 89 when Easter rolls around, so she will give maundy money away to 89 pensioners. 
The coins are technically legal tender, despite coming in unconventional 3-pence and 4-pence denominations. But given the coins' rare status, they tend not to enter general circulation. 
She's also immune from prosecution. 
All prosecutions are carried out in the name of the Sovereign, and she is both immune from prosecution and cannot be compelled to give evidence in court. 
In theory, the Sovereign ""is incapable of thinking or doing wrong,"" legal scholar John Kirkhope told Business Insider. However, barrister Baroness Helena Kennedy QC told the BBC in 2002 that ""nowadays, that immunity is questionable."" 
""Although civil and criminal proceedings cannot be taken against the Sovereign as a person under UK law, the Queen is careful to ensure that all her activities in her personal capacity are carried out in strict accordance with the law,"" according to official site of the Monarchy. 
If the monarch did commit a grievance offence, he or she would almost certainly be forced to abdicate. There is at least one precedent of the Courts' prosecuting the Sovereign. In the 17th Century, King Charles I was tried for treason following the English Civil War. He said ""no earthly power can justly call me (who am your King) in question as a delinquent."" The Court disagreed and had him executed. 
The Queen has the right to be consulted, to encourage, and to warn her ministers. 
Assuming no ""grave constitutional crisis,"" the Queen's input into the legislative process is supposed to be limited in real terms to the right ""to be consulted, to encourage, and to warn"" her ministers — advice delivered via meetings with the prime minister. 
The Queen also has certain historic rights and privileges. John Kirkhope, a lawyer who successfully campaigned to have details of ""Queen's consent"" made public, provided Business Insider with a list of some of the stranger rights the Queen still holds. 
Hungerford has to present a red rose to the Sovereign in exchange for its fishing and grazing rights.The Duke of Atholl must pay by way of a rose whenever the Sovereign calls. This most recently happened during the reign of Queen Victoria, so it's unclear whether the rose has to be any particular colour.If the Sovereign passes near Kidwelly Castle in Wales, the tenant has to provide a bodyguard in full armour. This is complicated slightly by the fact the castle is a ruin.The Marquis of Ailesbury owns Savernake Forest and is required to produce a blast on a hunting horn should the Sovereign pass through the Forest. This last happened in 1943.Similarly, the owner of Dunlambert Castle in Northern Ireland has to produce a blast on an ancient bugle.And lastly, many landowners must also pay a ""quit-rent"" — a kind of tax on their property paid to the Monarch. Some are pretty unusual. 
The owner of Sauchlemuir Castle must set out three glasses of port on New Year's Eve for the grandmother of James IV of Scotland. (For reference, James IV served from 1474 to 1513.)The owner of Fowlis must deliver — when required — a snowball in mid-summer.The City of Gloucester pays for its holdings of Crown Lands by providing an enormous eel pie.Great Yarmouth must provide a hundred herrings baked in 24 pasties to the Sheriff, who then sends them to the Lord of the Manor — who then sends them to the Sovereign.The Duke of Marlborough has to present a small satin flag with a Fleur de Lys on August 13, the anniversary of the Battle of Blenheim.The Duke of Wellington has to present a French Tricolour flag before noon on June 19 — the anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo.",0
19220,Explosion and Gunfire Erupt at American University in Kabul - The New York Times,"KABUL, Afghanistan  —   The American University of Afghanistan in Kabul came under attack by bomb and gunfire on Wednesday night, in a siege that lasted for hours as pockets of people trapped on campus tried to escape. The Afghan Health Ministry said that a security guard was killed in the attack and that at least 26 people had been wounded. Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for the Ministry of Interior, said early Thursday that police operations at the university were completed about 10 hours after the attack began, though officers remained on campus. “Two terrorists who attacked the university are killed the operation ended almost after 10 hours as there were hundreds of students and all of them were evacuated,” Mr. Sediqqi said. He said that the police could not yet provide casualty figures. Later on Thursday, Fraidoon Obaidi, chief of the Kabul police Criminal Investigation Department, told Reuters that 12 people had been killed, including seven students, three police officers and two security guards, and another 44 people were wounded. Afghan security forces massed around the campus, a guarded compound in the western part of the capital, after initial reports of an explosion and gunfire. From within, trapped people began taking to social media to ask for help and report what was going on around them. The university opened for enrollment in 2006 to both men and women, and quickly became a prestigious education choice for some of Afghanistan’s elites, offering undergraduate and graduate degrees taught in English. It was praised by senior American officials as a sign of Afghanistan’s bright future, and as such was an obvious symbol of Western ambitions for the country  —   and exactly the kind of symbol the Taliban and other militants have come to pursue as targets. One after another, such places  —     hotels, restaurants frequented by foreigners, even cultural centers where young Afghans performed arts  —   have come under attack, limiting the movement of expatriates in Kabul and keeping the local population in constant fear of unpredictable violence. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, which was the second directed at the university this month. On Aug. 7, two professors  —   an American and an Australian, both men  —   were abducted from a vehicle near the campus. Officials said they were investigating the case, but there was no public word on who was behind the kidnapping or the condition of the two professors. Officials say that most kidnappings in Kabul are conducted by criminal gangs. As the assault on Wednesday unfolded, several people who were able to escape, along with other witnesses, gave accounts of people being wounded by gunfire or being injured while trying to flee. One man who managed to escape the compound, a    who would give only his first name, Fahim, said that the sound of gunfire sent many students running for emergency exits. Almost immediately, they heard a loud explosion. Fahim said two of his friends were hospitalized after getting free: One had broken a leg as he jumped from a   window, and the other had been shot in the back. With electricity cut off by the security forces to restrict the movement of the attackers, dozens of family members anxiously awaited news of their loved ones outside the security cordon. Qudratullah Waziri said his brother, a student, was still unaccounted for. The last Mr. Waziri heard from him was a phone call in which he said he was surrounded by wounded people. “I saw the police just rescue 12 female students in the back of their truck,” Mr. Waziri said. An operator at the Kabul police emergency line said calls had come in from panicking people inside the university who said attackers had infiltrated after an initial explosion. But at checkpoints outside the campus, security officials insisted that the attackers had not infiltrated the perimeter of the university. Ahmad Jawad, a police officer at the site of the attack, said a car bomb had exploded in front of a school for the blind that is next to the American University. He said that the attackers had entered that school, and were firing at the university from there.",0
19221,"Michael Flynn, Anti-Islamist Ex-General, Offered Security Post, Trump Aide Says - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —     Donald J. Trump has offered the post of national security adviser to Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, potentially putting a retired intelligence officer who believes Islamist militancy poses an existential threat in one of the most powerful roles in shaping military and foreign policy, according to a top official on Mr. Trump’s transition team. General Flynn, 57, a registered Democrat, was Mr. Trump’s main national security adviser during his campaign. If he accepts Mr. Trump’s offer, as expected, he will be a critical gatekeeper for a president with little experience in military or foreign policy issues. Mr. Trump and General Flynn both see themselves as brash outsiders who hustled their way to the big time. They both post on Twitter often about their own successes, and they have both at times crossed the line into outright Islamophobia. They also both exhibit a loose relationship with facts: General Flynn, for instance, has said that Shariah, or Islamic law, is spreading in the United States (it is not). His dubious assertions are so common that when he ran the Defense Intelligence Agency, subordinates came up with a name for the phenomenon: They called them “Flynn facts. ” As an adviser, General Flynn has already proved to be a powerful influence on Mr. Trump, convincing the   that the United States is in a “world war” with Islamist militants and must work with any willing allies in the fight, including President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. During the transition, General Flynn has been present when Mr. Trump has received his daily intelligence briefing. As national security adviser, he would have the last word on how the president should respond to crises such as a showdown with China over the South China Sea or an international health crisis like the Ebola epidemic. But, like Mr. Trump, he would enter the White House with significant baggage. The Flynn Intel Group, a consulting firm he founded after he was fired by President Obama as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, has hazy business ties to Middle Eastern countries and has appeared to lobby for the Turkish government. General Flynn also took a paid speaking engagement last year with Russia Today, a television network funded by the Kremlin, and attended the network’s lavish anniversary party in Moscow, where he sat at Mr. Putin’s elbow. Those potential conflicts of interest had led Mr. Trump’s transition team to worry that General Flynn might have difficulty winning confirmation for any post that, unlike the national security adviser role, requires congressional approval, such as director of the C. I. A. But for Mr. Trump, he has one overriding virtue: He was an early and ardent supporter in a campaign during which most of the Washington national security establishment openly called Mr. Trump unfit to lead. General Flynn did not respond to repeated interview requests. Yet in numerous speeches and interviews before the election, and in a book published in August, he laid out a view of the world that sees the United States as facing a singular, overarching threat that can be described in only one way: “radical Islamic terrorism. ” All else is secondary for General Flynn, and any other description of the threat is “the worst kind of political correctness,” he said in an interview three weeks before the election. Islamist militancy poses an existential threat on a global scale, and the Muslim faith itself is the source of the problem, he said, describing it as a political ideology, not a religion. He has even at times gone so far as to call it a political ideology that has “metastasized” into a “malignant cancer. ” For General Flynn, the election of Mr. Trump represents an astounding career turnaround. Once counted among the most respected military officers of his generation, General Flynn was fired after serving only two years as chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He then   as a vociferous critic of a Washington elite that he contended could not even properly identify the real enemy  —   radical Islam, that is  —   never mind figure out how to defeat it. In Mr. Trump, General Flynn found someone who was more than willing to listen. He readily signed on to the campaign, and quickly emerged as the angry voice of the national security establishment, leading chants of “lock her up” against Hillary Clinton at rallies and the Republican convention. And now, after months of the two men talking to each other, it can be hard to tell where Mr. Trump’s views end and General Flynn’s begin. They both believe that the United States needs to start working with Mr. Putin to defeat Islamist militants and stop worrying about his suppression of critics at home, his attempt to dismember Ukraine or the Russian military’s indiscriminate bombing of Syrian cities. The same goes for President Abdel Fattah   of Egypt, who took power in a coup and who was the first world leader to speak with Mr. Trump after the election. Mr. Trump “looks at people and leaders of countries and says: ‘Can I work with this guy? Do we have a common threat that we can focus on? ’” Mr. Flynn said in the interview before the election. “He knows that when it comes to Russia or any other country, the common enemy that we all have is radical Islam. ” General Flynn and Mr. Trump also agree that the United States needs to sharply curtail immigration from predominantly Muslim countries, and possibly even force American Muslims to register with the government. The similarities run beyond political views. Like the boy from Queens who made it in Manhattan, General Flynn came into the military without a West Point pedigree  —   he graduated from the Army’s Reserve Officer Training Program at the University of Rhode Island  —   and earned a reputation as outspoken and unconventional as he climbed the ranks to the top of military intelligence. Yet General Flynn still nurses the grudge of an outsider, believing he never quite got the respect he deserves. For example, he has attributed his dismissal from the Defense Intelligence Agency to a pair of consummate insiders: James R. Clapper Jr. the director of national intelligence, and Michael Vickers, the undersecretary of defense intelligence. His response, like that of his new boss, has been to buck the establishment. In his view, both the Republican and the Democratic luminaries who have shaped American defense and foreign policy through two presidencies have “gotten us into mess after mess for the wrong reasons. ” “I would argue with that crowd all day long,” he said before the election. Among the   Republicans who now dominate the party, General Flynn has become something of a cult figure for what they see as his brave stand against the Obama administration’s perfidy. General Flynn insists that he was fired from the intelligence agency because he refused to toe the administration’s line that Islamist militants were in retreat. (He was right, in all fairness.) “He’s an analyst who can get deep into the weeds on the issues and a lot of this stuff and then is very good at playing   chess,” said Representative Devin Nunes, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a close confidant to Mr. Flynn. “He was the one who called out the administration for being wrong on Al Qaeda. ” But many of those who worked with General Flynn attribute his firing to management problems, saying his attempts to overhaul the sprawling agency had left it a chaotic, backbiting mess. They also question whether his tactical acumen  —   he was especially good at unraveling militant networks in Afghanistan and Iraq  —   can translate into the kind of strategic thinking needed at the White House. “He is a very talented information gatherer,” said Sarah Chayes of the Carnegie Endowment in Washington, who worked with General Flynn when he ran military intelligence in Afghanistan from 2009 to 2011. “But his thinking process is not sufficiently analytical to test some streams against others and make sense of it, or draw consistent conclusions,” she said. “If you listen to him, in 10 minutes you’ll hear him contradict himself two or three times. ” Take his views on Islam. In the interview before the election, he characterized Islam as intolerant. Then he said that he had many Muslim friends, and that the United States needed to do a better job of understanding Islamic culture and fostering its tolerant side.",0
19222,Hybrid Wars 8. Strategies Against Africa (1A),"Africa , Hybrid Wars By Andrew KORYBKO (USA) 
The introductory text prefaced the general concepts that the author will be extrapolating on further in the research, and now that the basics of the overall analytical foundation and the contours of the reference map are out of the way, it’s time to begin exploring the influence of hegemonic and institutional regionalism on African geopolitics, widely investigating the asymmetrical threats endemic to each area, and start elucidating China’s overall Silk Road vision for the continent. 
African Regions, Their Respective (And Prospective) Leaders, And Interregional Conflict Scenarios 
The author’s preferred method of explaining Africa’s geopolitics is to begin as broadly as possible and then gradually become more specific, with the entire continuum of study eventually leading to the reader’s solid understanding of China’s visionary plans. To start off, it’s necessary to divide Africa into five separate regions and identify the state within each which holds the most influential demographic, economic, and military sway (cumulatively described as leadership) and has the most promising long-term potential (operative word) to become a regional heavyweight if it isn’t one already: 
* Brown – North Africa – Egypt * Orange – Horn And East Africa – Ethiopia * Blue – Central-South Africa – Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) * Red – Southern Cone – South Africa 
Interpretation: 
It should immediately be said that the above map is a conceptualized representation that includes both current and prospective realities (the latter in reference to the DRC), and that the shaded areas are rough estimates of the approximate spread of each region. There are certainly limits to each identified core country’s influence and it’s predicted that there will obviously be competitive coalitions both within its own sphere and outside of it that assemble to challenge the given state’s leadership over the said region. For example, this can currently be seen by the former French colonies of West Africa having their own Paris-controlled currency and collectively viewing Nigeria’s regional ascendency with suspicion, which has been particularly evident when it comes to Chad and its uninvited (but unopposed) anti-terrorist military involvement in northeastern Nigeria. While admittedly imperfect in certain respects, the simplified map does present a relatively accurate snapshot of the broader geopolitical processes that are presently underway in Africa and allows observers to relatively accurately extrapolate on their predicted trajectory. Therefore, the map should only be seen as a basic working model through which the reader can acquire a generalized idea about the continent and a prism of perspective through which they can thus interpret the rest of the unfolding Hybrid War analysis. 
Focal Points Of Overlap: 
The introduction spoke about some of the overlap potential between the earlier-identified regions of Hybrid War study, but seeing as how the most recent map is somewhat different in categorizing the entire continent into geographic blocs, it’s necessary to succinctly touch upon some of the areas of overlap that may not have been addressed previously. 
North-Central Nexus: 
This tinderbox of a locale is defined as the convergence area between Chad, the Central African Republic (CAR), Sudan, and South Sudan, and it’s marked by an array of interlinked involvement between state and non-state actors in each other’s affairs. Chad and Sudan had earlier vied for influence in the latter’s region of Darfur, and N’djamena also exerts influence in the Muslim reaches of Northern CAR. Khartoum is involved in a back-and-forth proxy war with Juba along their shared frontier which sees both sides supporting a mix of non-state rebel actors (some of which are defined by the respective targeted governments as terrorists), and the globally notorious non-state bogeyman of Joseph Kony and his Lord’s Resistance Army operates between CAR and South Sudan. The below map conceptualizes the dangerous interplay between forces in this totally destabilized region and shows how the only missing factors are the ‘geographic diagonal’ involvement of Chad in South Sudan and Sudan in CAR, and a possibly disruptive humanitarian/militant influence emanating from CAR to Chad (which is not unlikely if confessional tensions spike once more): 
Mountain Mayhem: 
The next most conflict-prone area of regional overlap is the mountainous area that straddles the DRC and Uganda, Rwandan, and Burundian borders. After the end of the Second Congo War (“Africa’s World War”), Ugandan and Rwandan pro- and anti-government militia groups ended up controlling this part of the DRC and seizing the profitable mining deposits located here. There’s a lot of legal and illegal cross-border traffic between the two sides, and it’s well known that conflicts from one part of the mountains could easily spill over to the other due to the well-established economic and demographic connections that link them. Burundi figures into the equation because it’s the ‘weak man of East Africa’, a recent civil war state that is now being pushed back to the brink as part of the US’ Hybrid War agenda against China (which will be addressed in full later on at the appropriate section). Destabilization in this country could easily move west and north to DRC and Rwanda, creating a tri-state ethno-regional conflagration that would inevitable come to involve Uganda as well. 
For the time being, though, dominant influence between the two identified African regions is pretty one-sided, with Rwanda and Uganda exerting control over the DRC and not the other way around. This is primarily due to their respective nationals and affiliated militias (both pro- and anti-government ones) creating a sort of ‘strategic depth’ that has profoundly penetrated just about all levels of life in the eastern DRC. However, if the DRC ever got back on track after being spectacularly sidelined by the West’s covert war against it in the early 1960s and further weakened by the First and Second Congo Wars, then it’s foreseeable that the cross-border flow of influence could either be equalized or even reversed if the right demographic factors were leveraged under the proper geopolitical conditions. 
Regardless of the ‘positive’ movement of influence in either direction, if cross-border Hybrid War triggers are activated, then it’s likely that the general destabilization could also involve Tanzania and possibly even Zambia. The last possibility is more likely so if a renewed Katanga separatist or anti-government campaign is ever launched within the region, which might pan out to be the case if popular former governor and “ opposition ” leader Moisi Katumbi stirs the pot of regionalism should President Kabila run for what would at this point be an unconstitutional third term , delays the elections, or is accused (whether rightfully or wrongfully) of committing voter fraud that helps him or a hand-picked political successor win at the polls. 
Sahara Terror: 
The next interregional conflict overlap in Africa deals with terrorist groups in the Sahara, in particular the interplay between transnational militant organizations operating in the broad expanse between Mali, Mauritania, Algeria, Niger, and Libya. The NATO War on Libya destroyed the most prosperous and stable state in Africa and was the catalyst for destabilizing the rest of the aforementioned states ‘downstream’ via the newly opened weapon and militant channel that was created in the former Jamahiriya. This wide space is sparsely populated but is rich in oil, natural gas, and uranium deposits. For this reason, Sahara terrorism directly affects the global commodities trade and the interests of certain Great Powers and their most prominent transnational corporations. 
As a fitting example, France’s nuclear leader Areva controls uranium mines in Niger, and the in-country French military contingent there is also tasked with protecting them, among its other responsibilities. Furthermore, the mixture of destabilization in the region, low energy prices, and rapid LNG industry developments have led to the indefinite shelving of the tentative proposal for a Trans-Saharan gas pipeline from Nigeria to southern Europe via Niger and Algeria, but this idea nonetheless still remains a possibility that might one day be revived . 
Widening the interregional scope of the Libyan-originated destabilization that is now plaguing the Sahara, the terrorist hijacking of the Tuareg’s 2011-2012 “Azawad” self-determination movement in Mali has also led to a spillover effect of Islamic/Salafist violence in Burkina Faso and the Ivory Coast , non-Sahara countries which are part of the greater West African region. Therefore, the two launching pads of inter- and intra-regional destabilization can be identified as Libya and Mali, with the latter becoming totally unbalanced only after the former’s collapse following the US-led NATO war against it. 
Malawi In The Middle: 
Formerly part of the British Empire and administered together with Zambia and Zimbabwe as a member of the “Central African Federation” in the closing days of colonialism, Malawi is categorized as part of the Southern Cone sphere of regional influence because most of its international trade runs through Mozambique. The landlocked country is one of the world’s poorest and least-developed nations, and the state’s dire poverty has created a situation where anti-government sentiment can be easily manipulated. 
While Malawi isn’t directly a part of China’s larger integrated Silk Road network in Africa, the two countries have quickly moved closer to one another economically over the past couple of years after the African state disowned its prior decades-long relationship with Taiwan, thus raising the covert consternation of the US and pushing Washington to order its top diplomat in the country to prepare for a coup and possible Hybrid War attempt. 
Malawi’s geopolitical position is such that any large-scale destabilization within the country’s borders could easily spread to Mozambique, but most important for the research’s focus, it could also just as likely move northwards to Zambia and Tanzania, two pivotal countries that are involved in China’s transcontinental Silk Road projects. Because of the conflict overspill potential that a seemingly tiny and assumedly geopolitically irrelevant state like Malawi can have, it’s accurate to label it a “Second Burundi” in terms of the chances that it could be used to trigger a regional conflagration that could subsequently offset China’s integrative vision for the continent. 
If timed to coincide with a Hybrid War in Burundi, then a prospectively planned one in Malawi would deal double a dose of destabilization to Tanzania and could be used to spark a larger transregional conflict zone between Uganda and Mozambique. 
Furthermore, there exists the potential (which will be discussed at a future point in the research) that this could either trigger the renewed Katanga secessionist crisis or anti-government movement that was mentioned before or be timed to coincide with it in its own right during the elections that are tentatively forecast for late 2016. If this scenario eventuates, then the simultaneously exploding series of latent conflicts would certainly spell the end for all of China’s transcontinental integrative plans, although it might still be possible to salvage the ones dealing only with East African coast (and which will also be described later on in detail). 
The Real African World War: 
The nightmare scenario that could one day transpire in Africa is if the super- and sub-equatorial active and potential conflict zones find a way to interlink with one another and turn the whole continent into a massive Hybrid War battleground. While somewhat far-fetched at the moment and tactically hindered by the DRC’s jungled geographic ‘firewall’, if another ‘African World War’ takes place in the Congo, then the resultant destabilization could be enough to surmount this physical difficulty and summon a Black Hole of Chaos that sparks a real “African World War’ which ends up connecting the Saharan-based terrorists with the Lake Malawi militants. This could most realistically be achieved via an outbreak of large-scale turmoil in the Nigerien-Chadian buffer zone and the Zambia-Tanzania-Katanga Province New Silk Road infrastructural nexus. Non-African Foreign Military Bases 
Keeping with the present security theme, non-African foreign militaries have left a remarkable footprint on the continent. For the most part, it’s primarily the US and France that have spread their units far and wide, although Washington “officially” claims that it only has a single military facility in Djibouti. Despite the technical ‘legalese’ of the Pentagon’s pronouncements, investigative journalist Nick Turse has unearthed piles of evidence proving that drone bases, logistics hubs, and other covert warfare-facilitating outposts are surreptitiously being utilized all across Africa. The reader is strongly encouraged to read this author’s works and become familiar with his findings, as they detail the contours of the shadow war that the US has been waging on Africa ever since 9/11. To summarize the US role in Africa in the most concisely pertinent way, the Pentagon regularly conducts training exercises with almost every single African military in one capacity or another, and it keeps a more lasting presence in the contiguous Sahara-Sahel-jungled area that stretches from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean and has been called “ The New Spice Route ”. As taken from the last hyperlinked source, here’s a map displaying how this network, which has also been nicknamed “the hippo trench”, looks from a continental perspective, but it should be kept in mind that Ethiopia is no longer a formal part of this arrangement after it asked the US to remove its drone base in early 2016 in the months following the original article’s publication: 
The other military power most actively involved in Africa is France, which had earlier colonized a large chunk of the continent in the late-19 th and early-20 th centuries. The most active part of its force is deployed in the Sahel region as part of “ Operation Barkhane ” which stretches across what has been referred to as the “G5 Sahel” countries of Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Chad. In addition to this, Paris also keeps troops in Senegal, Ivory Coast, Gabon, Central African Republic (CAR), and Djibouti. Here’s what France’s military deployments look like when they’re mapped out: 
* Red: G5 Sahel * Pink all others 
Comparing the two maps, it’s possible to observe a military overlap between the US and France in Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad, CAR, and Djibouti: 
While most of the double concentration of foreign military bases lies in Western and Central Africa, the fact that this is also present in Djibouti mustn’t be overlooked. In fact, the miniscule East African nation has a disproportionate military significance in that it concurrently hosts American, French, Japanese , Chinese , and soon even Saudi bases, making it by far a global military anomaly in this regard. With the focus now on East Africa, it’s timely to state that this part of the continent beyond Djibouti is also becoming heavily militarized by foreign forces as well. The UAE is suspected of having a naval base in Eritrea and is purportedly prospecting for facilities in Somalia’s autonomous breakaway region of Somaliland, while Turkey is also building a military base in the civil war-torn country. On top of all of this, Qatar maintains a small amount of “peacekeepers” in both Eritrea and Djibouti ever since 2010 as part of its UN-related responsibility in supposedly “mediating” between the two asides after a tense border dispute in 2008. This strategic concentration of forces has the effect of creating the perception that landlocked yet economically promising Ethiopia is being encircled, especially by the GCC-member states of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE, which will be an important fact that will be returned to later on when the research addresses the Horn of Africa region. 
* Red: Horn of Africa states with foreign military bases * Orange: Ethiopia African Military Blocs 
Although there’s a diversified non-African military presence all throughout the continent, Africa has still been able to assemble a loose network of regional military-security blocs that operate under the nominal aegis of the African Union (AU). The African Standby Forces , as they’re known, are divided according to Regional Economic Communities (RECs) and Regions and given defined areas of responsibility. The economic boundaries of most of these geographic blocs overlap with their military ones and will be described more in the next section, but for the time being, here’s what the AU’s allocation looks like: 
* Brown: North Africa Regional Capability * Yellow: ECOWAS * Purple: Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) * Orange: East African Standby Force (EASF) * Red: Southern African Development Community (SADC) 
NOTE: South Sudan is not yet a full member of the East African Standby Force, while Angola and Burundi are listed as having dual responsibilities within their shared ECCAS and SADC and the EASF, respectively. Additionally, it’s important to point out that the East African Community is divided between South Sudan, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi’s commitment to the EASF, Burundi’s additional responsibilities to the ECCAS, and Tanzania’s incorporation into the SADC zone of responsibility. Also, because Morocco is not part of the AU as per the Western Sahara dispute, it’s not party to the African Standby Forces agreement in any capacity. 
The last thing that’s important to point out about Africa’s military blocs is that Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon, and Chad have aligned their forces to battle the Boko Haram threat that afflicts their shared Lake Chad basin. Documenting this on a map, it superficially looks like a formidable military alliance, but it’s actually a poorly coordinated and internally competing force dominated by mutually suspicious Nigeria and Chad:

19223,Patrice Munsel Dies at 91 Soprano Became a Star at the Met as a Teenager - The New York Times,"Patrice Munsel, a coloratura soprano who as a teenager became one of the Metropolitan Opera’s youngest stars and later crossed over into television and musical theater, died on Aug. 4 at her home in Schroon Lake, N. Y. She was 91. Her death was confirmed on Wednesday by her daughter Heidi Schuler Bright. Ms. Munsel was 17 when, in March 1943, she won a Met contract and $1, 000 after tying for first place in the eighth annual Metropolitan Auditions of the Air, a precursor to the Met’s National Council Auditions, a program to discover promising young opera singers and nurture their careers. (The other   winner was Christine Johnson, who originated the role of Nettie Fowler in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical “Carousel” when it opened on Broadway in 1945.) By November Ms. Munsel had signed a   contract with the impresario Sol Hurok for a guaranteed $120, 000. On Dec. 4, at 18, she made her Met debut as the temptress Philine in Ambroise Thomas’s “Mignon,” wearing a   ring and a crown lent to her by the soprano Lily Pons. The audience gave Ms. Munsel a standing ovation of several minutes. The critics were generally less kind. “For this part her voice is neither sufficiently big, or developed, or brilliant enough,” the critic Olin Downes wrote in The New York Times. “In plain words,” he said, “she was cruelly miscast, in this, one of the most exacting roles in the coloratura soprano’s repertory. ” More than 40 years later, in a Los Angeles Times interview, Ms. Munsel said simply, “I didn’t have a clue as to what the part was about. ” She performed a total of 225 times at the Met, excelling as the maid Adele in Strauss’s “Die Fledermaus” and earning praise from Downes for her “virtuoso singing” and “very amusing acting. ” He declared her born for the role “by personality, wit, temperament. ” Rudolf Bing, the company’s general manager during Ms. Munsel’s tenure, is said to have called her “a superb soubrette. ” But Ms. Munsel had given up touring the moment she became engaged to Robert C. Schuler, an adman turned television producer, whom she married in 1952. Not long after returning from their   European honeymoon, she did a star turn on movie screens as Dame Nellie Melba, the   Australian soprano, in the 1953 biopic “Melba,” produced by the Hollywood legend Sam Spiegel. From there, she strutted her way into the Las Vegas nightclub scene, peeling off a voluminous silk skirt   at the New Frontier in 1955 to reveal a halter and bejeweled pink capris. Two years later, Ms. Munsel embarked on a television career with “The Patrice Munsel Show,” a variety series on ABC, joining guests like Eddie Albert, Andy Williams, Tony Bennett and John Raitt in a mix of light opera and pop, though she admitted to hating “  lyrics. ” It was canceled after one season. Ms. Munsel last performed at the Met in 1958 as Mimi in “La Bohème,” a role she had long coveted. She then focused on motherhood, traveling and musical comedies, performing splits in the 1965 Lincoln Center Theater presentation of “The Merry Widow” and occasionally turning productions of “The Sound of Music” and “The King and I” into family affairs with her four children. Besides her daughter Heidi, two other children survive: another daughter, Nicole Schuler, and a son, Scott Schuler, as well as two grandsons and two  . Her husband, who in 2005 chronicled his   marriage to Ms. Munsel in the book “The Diva  I: My Life with Metropolitan Opera Star Patrice Munsel,” died in 2007. Their son Rhett Carroll Schuler died in 2005. Patrice Beverly Munsil was born on May 14, 1925, in Spokane, Wash. (She later changed the spelling of her surname to Munsel at the Metropolitan Opera’s request.) Her father, Dr. Audley J. Munsil, was a dental surgeon her mother, Eunice Munsil, was a homemaker and an accomplished piano player. Ms. Munsel had a lifelong comedic streak. “I’m sure when I emerged from my mother’s womb, the doctor slapped me, I hit a high C and slapped him back,” she wrote in a biographical sketch on her website. She began studying ballet and tap at 6 and soon, inspired by Walt Disney, decided that she wanted to be a professional whistler. “There were always birds whistling in the background” of films like “Cinderella” and “Snow White,” she explained, “so I decided to whistle my way to Hollywood. ” Her parents, eager to encourage any and all of her artistic aspirations, managed to find her a whistling teacher. But it wasn’t long before listening to Met radio broadcasts convinced her that her true destiny was to become an opera star. By 15 she had moved with her mother to New York, where   voice lessons were supplemented with piano, harmony, theory, French and Italian classes, as well as fencing lessons and gym workouts three times a week. Within two years Ms. Munsel’s vocal coach, Giacomo Spadoni, urged her to audition at the Met, where he was chorus master, and she agreed. “After all, at the age of 17, how long can one wait?” Ms. Munsel wrote. “I stepped on the stage and sang my first aria on the Metropolitan Auditions of the Air without a nerve in my body. I won, and I was on my way to fame and stardom. ”",0
19224,"Obama Helps Cuban Government, Blocks Emigration To U.S. - Breitbart","Outgoing President Barack Obama is using his power over U. S. immigration rules to help Cuba’s dictatorial government shut down emigration from the island’s backward economy. [Late Thursday, Obama cancelled the   “   foot” migration policy, which allowed Cubans to get a U. S. Green Card once they were officially “paroled” into the United States. The policy, which was established by President Bill Clinton in 1995, also forced Cubans caught at sea back to the island dictatorship.  Since 2009, roughly 100, 000 Cuban migrants have used the “dry foot” policy to migrate into the United States, although at enormous cost to taxpayers. Currently, thousands of Cubans are migrating through Central America, heading to the California and Texas borders in the expectation they’ll get asylum and Green Cards. Clinton’s wet    policy narrowed a 1966 law which provided Green Cards to all escapees from Cuba’s   regime. Many Cubans used the policy to migrate into Florida and other states during the 1960s and even in the 1980s, when Cuba’s leaders sent thousands of criminals to Florida, causing a huge drop in wages for unskilled Americans in Miami. A White House statement said Obama’s new ‘ ’ policy will treat migrating Cubans like it treats ordinary migrants from Mexico and many other countries, only a few of whom are allowed to file for asylum.  “By taking this step, we are treating Cuban migrants the same way we treat migrants from other countries,” said a statement from the White House. “The Cuban government has agreed to accept the return of Cuban nationals who have been ordered removed, just as it has been accepting the return of migrants interdicted at sea. ” But Obama’s   policy for Cuban migrants is sharply different from his   policy towards the people of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.  Since 2012, Obama has used his administrative power to permit at least 350, 000 people from these three countries to cross the U. S. border and then quickly file for file for asylum and work permits, even though they are mostly fleeing for economic reasons. The cost to taxpayers of Obama’s help for the unskilled Central American adults, youths, and children will exceed $200 billion over the next 75 years, unless most are sent home, according to multiple estimates. Obama’s statement sought to justify his shutdown of Cuban immigration as a   policy, not as a policy intended to drive up Americans’ wages by reducing economic competition from unskilled migrants. The United States, a land of immigrants, has been enriched by the contributions of   for more than a century.  Since I took office, we have put the   community at the center of our policies. With this change we will continue to welcome Cubans as we welcome immigrants from other nations, consistent with our laws. During my Administration, we worked to improve the lives of the Cuban people  —   inside of Cuba  —   by providing them with greater access to resources, information and connectivity to the wider world. Sustaining that approach is the best way to ensure that Cubans can enjoy prosperity, pursue reforms, and determine their own destiny. As I said in Havana, the future of Cuba should be in the hands of the Cuban people. In 2014, Obama declared the national socialist government of Cuba was a legitimate government, and promised to boost trade with   companies in the tropical island prison.  “I believe that we can do more to support the Cuban people and promote our values through engagement. After all, these 50 years have shown that isolation has not worked.  It’s time for a new approach,” Obama said in December 2014.  To the Cuban people, America extends a hand of friendship.  Some of you have looked to us as a source of hope, and we will continue to shine a light of freedom.  Others have seen us as a former colonizer intent on controlling your future.  José Martí once said, “Liberty is the right of every man to be honest. ”  Today, I am being honest with you.  We can never erase the history between us, but we believe that you should be empowered to live with dignity and  .  Cubans have a saying about daily life:  “No es facil”  —    it’s not easy.  Today, the United States wants to be a partner in making the lives of ordinary Cubans a little bit easier, more free, more prosperous. Obama’s new decision does not kill off a 1995 agreement, under which the U. S. accepts 20, 000   emigrants each year.    advocacy groups praised Obama’s new restrictions on Cubans seeking to escape the dictatorship. “The Obama Administration has taken a positive step toward a more sensible Cuban immigration policy, one that ends preferential treatment for Cubans compared with others who arrive without visas,” said a statement from program director Geoffrey Thale, at the Washington Office on Latin America.  Up until now, U. S. policy has permitted Cubans who arrive at a U. S. border without a visa to be paroled into the country, and put on a path toward citizenship, an advantage that no other Latin Americans enjoy, and one that has seemed particularly unfair when children and families fleeing violence in Central America are subject to deportation. This change ‘normalizes’ our treatment of Cuban immigrants. Cubans have been seeking entry into the United States primarily because of economic stagnation at home. The U. S. embargo is one of many factors that has contributed to that stagnation, and so WOLA and many colleagues have recommended to the Administration that it should both end preferential treatment for Cubans and increase the number of visas available to Cubans who pursue regular immigration routes. The population of Cuba is 11. 2 million.",0
19225,David Bossie Desperately Claims Clinton Enthusiasm Gap is Trump Path to Victory,"By Hrafnkell Haraldsson   8:47 pm ""We're not conceding we're behind. In our enthusiasm, we have closed the gap...dramatically over the last week.""   
Donald Trump’s deputy campaign manager, the Clinton-obsessed Republican operative, David Bossie, told ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos this morning that “there’s an enthusiasm gap” and that this bit of math Republicans do is Trump’s path to victory on November 8. 
This is how the conversation went, per CBS News’ Sopan Deb , as always highlighting the important bits: 
Stephanopoulos was not about to let Bossie get away with the claim about Trump’s tax returns, and hammered him on the issue: ""He's going to release [his tax return] when he is not under audit.""– David Bossie, Trump Deputy Campaign Manager https://t.co/Y9xVg0rJIX 
— Good Morning America (@GMA) November 1, 2016 
Bossie deflected like a pro. You can see why Trump hired him. 
As a corollary to Bossie’s claims, Trump suddenly found himself interested in polls again this morning, tweeting , Wow, now leading in @ABC / @washingtonpost Poll 46 to 45. Gone up 12 points in two weeks, mostly before the Crooked Hillary blow-up! 
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2016 
The Trump campaign has always been about making much out of nothing; elections are not rigged if Trump gets his way, and neither are polls if Trump is leading. Otherwise, it’s all left-wing shenanigans. 
However, even Newt Gingrich isn’t buying the new poll: Washington Post-ABC poll is an absurdity. Trump has not moved up 13 points in the last 8 days.he was NEVER 12 points behind. Ignore polls 
— Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) November 1, 2016 
And what Trump fails to mention is that his lead disappears if Johnson and Stein are taken out of the mix: then Clinton leads by +1 . 
These latest claims are an absolute sham as Clinton leads overwhelmingly in early voting and Comey’s email gambit seems to have failed to sway voters to Trump’s camp. 
Meanwhile, Trump’s own legal problems are beginning to overwhelm the narrative , and if there is any evidence of a Clinton enthusiasm gap it exists only in Bossie’s own head. 
David Bossie is living proof that Clinton’s “vast right-wing conspiracy is real,” and all the hating on Hillary isn’t going to change the fact that it is Trump who is the crooked candidate, not Hillary Clinton.",0
19226,Comment on Senior Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Official Blows Whistle On UFOs by “Shoot First Ask Questions Later” : What Happens To A UFO When Tracked on Military Radar – Mystical Shire,"  The “Anchorage” Incident is a well known UFO event involving a veteran Japanese airline pilot who saw three UFOs following his 747 aircraft carrier for over 400 miles. One of the objects was much larger than the 747, while the other two were smaller. The crewmen of JAL Flight 1628 reported seeing flashing lights trailing their jet to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). FAA officials confirmed the conclusions drawn from the controller who handled Flight 1628 on his radar. His conclusion was that the aircrafts were unidentified. Air Force officials at the Alaska Air Command also said their radar picked up something near the JAL plane. The United States Air Force scrambled a jet to get a closer look at the object. This incident occurred in 1986. It’s now 2013 and high ranking credible witness testimonies as well as officially released government documentation confirm that UFOs are a real phenomenon and should be taken very seriously by people in high power. Three letter agencies have also released previously highly classified documentation. The documents indicate that UFOs are constantly tracked on military radar and jets are often scrambled so pilots can take a closer look. You can see an example of these files by clicking on the number following this sentence -this one is from the National Security Agency (NSA) (1) . The FAA even has protocol for UFO sightings as they are now very common ( 2 ), they even have a data collection centre -Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies ( 3 ). You can browse through our web site, more specifically the science/tech/alternative news sections if you would like more information about the UFO/Extraterrestrial phenomenon. This is retired FA Senior Division Chief, John Callahan. Check out his testimony below given to Dr. Steven Greer. He was directly involved with this incident, it is amazing to hear his story and the events that transpired because of it. The UFO phenomenon is really nothing to fear. Humanity has been progressing in its understanding of other concepts of reality that do not fit the ‘accepted’ framework. We often see a lot of fear mongering when it comes to extraterrestrials and our perception about extraterrestrial life has been largely influenced by entertainment corporations. As we continue to wake up, transform and grow into our adulthood, new possibilities and discoveries are available to us. More people on planet Earth are aware that love, peace, cooperation and understanding is necessary if the human race would like to move forward. The same corporations and people that own the energy, health, money supply and other major industries that govern our every day lives, do not have humanities best interests in mind. They are also responsible for covering up the UFO phenomenon. Anything that has the potential to assist us in growing our understanding about reality, or allowing us to move past our archaic, harmful ways of operating on planet Earth will be concealed.

19228,"As Transition Pace Picks Up, Trump Nears Cabinet Nominations - The New York Times","  Donald J. Trump’s transition team is nearing picks for heavyweight   posts such as the secretaries of state and of the Treasury, attorney general, and ambassador to the United Nations. They were accused by detractors of being bosom buddies, in cahoots over underhanded efforts to rig the American election  —   accusations candidate Trump denied. Now,   Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia have spoken. The Kremlin released a readout Monday of the first call between Mr. Putin and the   since he won the election, saying the men expressed mutual optimism about improving the dire state of relations between the two countries. According to the Kremlin, Mr. Putin said he hoped to work with Mr. Trump in an atmosphere of mutual respect without interfering in each other’s internal affairs. They also talked about fighting international terrorism and settling the crisis in Syria. The Trump transition team reported that “  Trump noted to President Putin that he is very much looking forward to having a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and the people of Russia. ” While Mr. Trump said he hoped to have a constructive relationship with Russia, he insisted during one of his debates with Hillary Clinton that he was “no puppet” of Mr. Putin. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who once called Mr. Trump a “faker” who “has no consistency about him,” said on Monday what she likely wanted to avoid: Mr. Trump will make the Supreme Court whole again. “Most immediately our vacancy will be filled,” she told a meeting of the Jewish Federations of North America at a Washington hotel. “President Trump will fill it. ” She urged the Senate to act promptly on the  ’s nomination to fill the vacancy created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. “Eight is not a good number,” she said. At full strength, the court has nine members. At a news  conference on Monday before an overseas trip, the president struck a diplomatic tone. • On Stephen K. Bannon’s appointment as chief White House strategist, which civil rights groups, Democrats and some Republicans have criticized, President Obama demurred, saying, “It would not be appropriate for me to comment on every appointment that the   starts making. ” • Faced with repeated questions about Mr. Trump’s temperament, Mr. Obama expressed hope that the presidency would be a reality check. “His gifts that obviously allowed him to execute one of the biggest upsets in political history, hopefully he will put to good use,” Mr. Obama said. • On his Democratic Party, Mr. Obama said that a period of reflection was healthy, that new voices were necessary and that the stunning defeat should be a warning. “It takes a while for people to reconcile themselves with that new reality,” he said. “Hopefully it’s a reminder that elections matter. ” • On immigration, Mr. Obama urged Mr. Trump to “think long and hard” about endangering the status of young immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children. He described them as “American kids. ” The F. B. I. reported Monday that attacks against American Muslims rose last year, driving an increase of about 7 percent in hate crimes against all victims. The data, the most comprehensive look at threat crimes nationwide, expanded on previous findings by researchers and outside monitors, who have noted an alarming rise in some types of hate crimes tied to the intense vitriol of the presidential campaign and the aftermath of terror attacks at home and abroad since 2015. A wave of racially charged assaults, graffiti attacks and other episodes has swept the country since Election Day, prompting Mr. Trump to call for a halt to it during a “60 Minutes” interview broadcast on Sunday night. In its report Monday, the F. B. I. cataloged a total of 5, 818 hate crimes in 2015  —   a rise of nearly 340 over the year before  —   including assaults, bombings, threats and property destruction against minorities, women, gays and others. Attacks against Muslim Americans saw the biggest surge: 257 reports of assaults, attacks on mosques and other types hate crimes against Muslims last year, a jump of about 67 percent over the year before. It was the highest total since 2001, when the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks saw more than 480 attacks. Attacks against transgender people also sharply increased, the data showed. Law enforcement officials acknowledge that the statistics give an incomplete picture because many local agencies still have a spotty record of reporting hate crimes, 26 years after Congress directed the Justice Department to begin collecting the data. “We need to do a better job of tracking and reporting hate crime to fully understand what is happening in our communities and how to stop it,” James B. Comey Jr. the F. B. I. director, said Monday. Mr. Trump has spoken with President Xi Jinping of China, the presidential transition team announced on Monday, and the world likely thought, “Interesting. ” According to the announcement, in a call that took place on Monday Beijing time, Mr. Xi congratulated Mr. Trump for “winning a historic election,” and the   thanked the Chinese leader for his well wishes. “During the call, the leaders established a clear sense of mutual respect for one another, and   Trump stated that he believes the two leaders will have one of the strongest relationships for both countries moving forward,” the statement said. No mention of whether Mr. Trump’s repeated campaign threats against Chinese trade practices came up, nor his statement that climate change was a hoax perpetuated by the Chinese, nor his   promises on economic relations moving forward. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who mobilized a movement but not enough votes to win the Democratic presidential nomination, is stepping forward as an alternative to the party’s leadership and a stalwart against racial politics. Taking to his campaign Twitter handle on Monday, he decried the Democrats’ loss of white,   voters to   Trump. He added, “The Democratic Party has to stand with working people, feel their pain and take on the billionaire class, Wall Street and drug companies. But he also said that the new role of Mr. Bannon in the Trump White House as senior counselor and chief strategist should make the country “very nervous. ” The country has battled “discrimination and racism and sexism and homophobia” for hundreds of years, he said in an interview on ABC’s “The View” program on Monday, and the country could not afford to move backward. “We’re going to tell Mr. Bannon and any other advisers that we’re not going to be turning on each other,” Mr. Sanders said. “We’re going to be standing together. ” In concert, liberal activists staged a   in the office of Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the incoming Democratic minority leader, to demand a leadership position in the next Senate for Mr. Sanders. Civil rights groups, Democrats and some Republicans on Monday denounced   Trump’s decision to appoint Mr. Bannon to a top White House position, warning that he represents nationalist and racist views that should be rejected by the incoming president. Read the full story. Alex Jones, an online broadcast host who has accused the government of   conspiracies, says that   Trump personally called him to thank him for his support during the campaign. Mr. Jones made the revelation on a brief clip on his website. “He said, ‘Listen Alex, I just talked to the kings and the queens of the world,’” Mr. Jones recalled, saying that Mr. Trump added, “I want to thank you, your audience. ” He said the incoming president promised to come on his program again in the next few weeks. He celebrated that Mr. Trump had triumphed over “hoaxes” such as Obamacare. Mr. Jones was an early booster of Mr. Trump, who appeared on his program during the end of the primaries. Mr. Jones has charged, among other things, that the Sandy Hook school shooting in Connecticut in December 2012 was a hoax.",0

Pieczenik said that a coup had been formed in the White House through “political cronyism” and that “the Intelligence community and others formally involved have gotten together” and “initiated a counter coup through Julian Assange and Wikileaks.” 
“We have your number,” Pieczenik said, talking about the corrupt Administration. 
“We are going to stop you from making Hillary Clinton the President of the United States,” Pieczenik told the Establishment in a firm tone. 
“[…] we will convict and indict the President of the United States, Loretta Lynch and many other who are involved in the cover-up of the massive corruption that occurred under the Clinton Foundation.” 
“This is probably the first time in the history of any country where a coup was initiated through the Internet and a counter-coup was initiated through the Internet.”

19232,New family in Coronation Street to ‘keep themselves to themselves’,"  Glazebrooks, a family of three who last week moved into a semi-detached house in Coronation Street, say they have little interest in getting involved with the community in their new home in Weatherfield. 
‘We like the quiet life,’ said 48-year-old Barry, an insurance underwriter. ‘We got the place at a knock-down price thanks to that recent thing we read in the local news about a tram crashing into a nightclub and killing four people. I only chose Weatherfield for the easy commute – which hopefully it will be, once the trams are up and running again.’ 
As a near-teetotaller, Barry added that he does not envisage spending much time in the local pub, the Rovers Return Inn. ‘Besides, what with the last four landlords packing it in in acrimonious circumstances, lorries crashing into it and it being burnt to the ground, an attempted murder in the cellar and arguments going on there most nights, it doesn’t sound like my sort of place,’ he added. 
His 17-year-old son Philip, who has now settled in well at the local fee-paying academy Oakhill School, said that he had no plans for romantic entanglements. ‘Don’t get me wrong,’ he told reporters, ‘I’ve seen that Tracey Barlow from down the road and I definitely would, and I’ve heard there’s some lesbian action going on down at the Websters’, but I just have no time for that sort of thing with my A-levels coming up.’ 
Meanwhile, Mary Glazebrook, 45, who decided against seeking work at the local clothing factory because she doesn’t believe it’s healthy to spend all her time closeted in a single small street, is reluctant to mix with her neighbours. 
‘I mean, take that Gail McIntyre,’ she said. ‘She seemed nice enough when she said hello to me, but it turns out she has a long history of feuding with her mother-in-laws, her first husband was murdered, her second one was a serial killer who tried to kill her whole family by driving her car into a canal, her daughter got pregnant at 13, her son is a borderline psychopath, her long-last father came back after 30 years and turned out to be gay, then to top it all she married the debt-ridden father of the son’s girlfriend and ended up in prison accused of his murder when he fell off a boat. Honestly, you couldn’t make it up.’ 
As of today, the Glazebrooks have no plans to have a housewarming. ‘To be honest,’ continued Mary, ‘I don’t think we could fit it in, what with hosting our swingers parties and sacrificing animals to Satan. Besides, I really need to have that conversation with Barry about how he’s not actually Philip’s dad – his brother is.’ Share this story...

19233,Betsy DeVos Confirmed as Education Secretary Pence Breaks Tie - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Betsy DeVos, a wealthy Republican donor with almost no experience in public education, was confirmed by the Senate as the nation’s education secretary on Tuesday, but only with the help of a historic tiebreaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence after weeks of protests and two defections within her own party. The    vote capped an   vigil on the Senate floor, where, one by one, Democrats denounced Ms. DeVos to a mostly empty chamber. But they did not get a third Republican defection that would have stopped Ms. DeVos  —   a billionaire who has devoted much of her life to promoting charter schools and vouchers  —   from becoming the steward of the nation’s nearly 100, 000 public schools. It was the first time a vice president has been summoned to the Capitol to break a tie on a cabinet nomination. Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, demanded before the vote that Republicans explain how they could support Ms. DeVos. “If we cannot set aside party loyalty long enough to perform the essential duty of vetting the president’s nominees, what are we even doing here?” Mr. Franken asked. The two Republicans who voted against the nominee, Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, said Ms. DeVos was unqualified because of a lack of familiarity with public schools and with laws meant to protect students. “I have serious concerns about a nominee to be secretary of education who has been so involved in one side of the equation, so immersed in the push for vouchers, that she may be unaware of what actually is successful within the public schools, and also what is broken and how to fix them,” Ms. Murkowski said last week when the two announced their opposition. Ms. Murkowski also said she had been influenced by thousands of messages she had received urging her to reject the nomination. For many educators, Ms. DeVos’s support for charter schools and vouchers  —   which allow students to use taxpayer dollars to pay tuition at private, religious and   schools  —   reflected a deep disconnect from public schools. Neither Ms. DeVos nor any of her children attended a public school. Most Republicans described Ms. DeVos as committed to what is best for children. In a fiery speech moments before the vote, Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and a former education secretary himself, criticized his Democratic colleagues for opposing Ms. DeVos, he said, simply because she was nominated by a Republican president. “She led the most effective public school reform movement over the last few years,” he said. Mr. Alexander, the chairman of the committee that approved Ms. DeVos’s nomination last week in a   split, said she had been “at the forefront” of education overhaul for decades. By midday Tuesday, as the vote in the Senate deadlocked at 50 to 50, Mr. Pence, a former member of the House, took the gavel and at 12:29 p. m. declared his vote for Ms. DeVos. In a procedural quirk, a confirmation vote on Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama for attorney general was scheduled after that of Ms. DeVos so he could vote “yes” before leaving the Senate, securing Republicans a decisive vote. Raised in a wealthy family, Ms. DeVos, who married into the Amway fortune, has a web of financial investments, has also raised alarm among critics who worried about the many opportunities for conflicts of interest. She was the first of Mr. Trump’s nominees not to complete an ethics review before appearing before a Senate panel. She filed her ethics paperwork on Jan. 19, two days after her confirmation hearing. Teachers’ unions and even some charter organizations had protested Ms. DeVos’s nomination across the country. Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the committee that approved Ms. DeVos  —   and a former educator herself  —   urged disheartened advocates on Tuesday morning before the vote not to think of their efforts as a waste. “It’s made an impact here and made a difference,” she said. “And I think it’s woken each of us up in this country to what we value and what we want. ” Shortly after Ms. DeVos’s confirmation, Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, a union that protested the nomination, said the public would now have to “serve as a check and balance” to her policies and be “fierce fighters on behalf of children. ” “It’s telling that even when Trump had full control of the legislative and executive branches, he could only get DeVos confirmed by an unprecedented tiebreaking vote by his vice president,” Ms. Weingarten said. “That’s because DeVos shows an antipathy for public schools, a   embrace of private,   alternatives and a lack of basic understanding of what children need to succeed in school. ” David E. Kirkland, an education professor at New York University who has studied Ms. DeVos’s impact in Michigan, said he feared she could badly hurt public education and pull resources out of schools in need of federal funding. “Her extensive conflicts of interest and record of diverting money away from vulnerable students and into the pockets of the rich make DeVos completely unfit for the position she was just confirmed to,” he said. Ms. DeVos has focused on expanding parental choice in education and on embracing charter schools and vouchers. Her ideology was a good fit for Mr. Trump’s education platform during the campaign, which called for a $20 billion voucher initiative aimed at   children. But freeing such an enormous sum would most likely require the reallocation of federal education money, as well as a realignment of congressional priorities. Vouchers were not part of a sweeping education overhaul passed in 2015, and lawmakers from rural areas, where schools tend to be farther apart, are particularly wary of such initiatives. The Trump administration could potentially advance a more limited voucher program and seek tax credits for private school tuition or home schooling costs. Ms. DeVos has also indicated that she would dismantle other pieces of the Obama administration’s legacy, potentially including a rule that denies federal student aid money to   colleges whose graduates struggle to get jobs, as well as an aggressive effort to investigate and adjudicate campus sexual assault claims. Ms. DeVos’s critics said they would continue to fight her as she serves. Some vowed to demonstrate at her appearances at forums and schools and to seek candidates friendly to their view to run for local office. Lily Eskelsen García, the president of the National Education Association, said her union would tap into the vast database of advocates it had built during Ms. DeVos’s confirmation process to help keep her in check. “As soon as she does something alarming, it will be known, it will be seen,” she said. “She won’t be able to hide. ” Mr. Trump’s choice of Ms. DeVos, known for her   lobbying efforts to expand charter schools in Michigan  —   an experiment that even charter school supporters now criticize  —   to lead the Education Department presented senators with a multitude of potential pitfalls. Her background as a prolific    who has donated about $200 million over the years to Republican causes and candidates  —   including some senators, as has been the case for previous presidential nominees  —   came under scrutiny. Democrats have also expressed concern about her family’s contributions to groups that support   conversion therapy for gay people and her past statements that government “sucks” and that public schools are a “dead end. ” Opponents have also focused on the poor performance of charter schools in Detroit, which she championed. Senators and education advocates from both sides of the aisle also expressed concern after Ms. DeVos, during her Jan. 17 confirmation hearing, confused core responsibilities of the department. In one notable exchange that spread across the internet, Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, asked Ms. DeVos whether all schools that receive public money should have to follow the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, the landmark 1975 civil rights legislation. Under that federal law, states and school districts are required to provide special education services to children with disabilities. Ms. DeVos said the issue was “best left to the states. ” In a bizarre moment that made her the butt of   TV jokes, Ms. DeVos also suggested that states should decide whether to allow guns in schools, citing in part concerns about protection from grizzly bears in Wyoming. “I think probably there, I would imagine there is probably a gun in a school to protect from potential grizzlies,” she said. Before the vote Tuesday, Mr. Franken said, “It was the most embarrassing confirmation hearing that I have ever seen. ” In a final push that included demonstrations around the country, constituents and advocates swamped Senate offices with calls, so inundating the Capitol switchboard that it disrupted the Senate’s voice mail system.",0
19234,Какие предложения будущей работы могут быть у Обамы | Новое восточное обозрение,"Регион: США в мире В своей новой статье американский журналист Мартин Бергер указывает, что. хотя на днях издание The American Spectator и написало, что «в скором времени Обама и его команда будут выкинуты на свалку истории », тем не менее вопрос о будущем «хромой утки» занимает не только многие СМИ. Отдельные комментаторы, отрабатывая уже вложенные в них Белым домом капиталы, пытаются хоть как-то улучшить имидж уходящего президента США, сильно подпорченный его деятельностью последних лет , в том числе на ниве «борьбы» с расизмом в США, вооруженных интервенций США. Газета New York Times отметила: «В условиях, когда ему осталось пробыть на посту президента менее трех месяцев, Обама готовится к тому, что он будет делать после того, как покинет Белый дом. Весьма вероятно, что он будет тесно связан с Силиконовой долиной». Это направление возможной будущей деятельности Обамы в многочисленных последних комментариях американских СМИ просматривается как одно из основных, тем более учитывая тот «вклад», который он внес в успехи военно-промышленного комплекса США и продвижение его «продукции» в различные страны мира. Нередко в комментариях об Обаме в американских СМИ можно прочитать, что у него весьма широкие музыкальные пристрастия. Поэтому подчас от музыкантов, особенно американских, можно услышать их предложения Обаме с политики переключиться на музыкальную деятельность, вплоть до игры кантри на банджо. Весьма много комментариев в различных СМИ можно встретить о негласной связи Обамы и госпиталей «Врачей без границ», многие из которых поплатились своим существованием и жизнями сотен врачей и пациентов в результате санкционированных Обамой авианалетов в Афганистане, Йемене, Ираке, да и в других регионах мира. Поэтому вряд ли какой госпиталь «Врачей без границ» откажет завтра Обаме в его трудоустройстве туда, особенно если учесть, что опасность их гибели в определенной степени после января 2017 года все же может уменьшиться. Правда, если в Белый дом не придёт Хиллари Клинтон с ее непомерной любовью к войнам и массовым разрушениям. Но главное, считает автор, – это чтобы Барак Обама отошел от политической деятельности, которая увенчалась не только одновременным ведением США пяти войн , но и страданиями миллионов мирных жителей на Ближнем Востоке, в Африке, Азии, потерявших кров и своих близких, вынужденных из-за агрессивной политики Обамы страдать и искать приюта на чужбине. Поэтому выбор американцами более достойного его преемника должен стать превалирующим над активно разыгрываемой сейчас Белым домом поддержки Партии войны и ее кандидата – Хиллари Клинтон.

19235,"Desperate To ‘Preserve His Legacy’, Barack Obama Releases 527 Pages Of New Regulations In ONE Day!","  Desperate To ‘Preserve His Legacy’, Barack Obama Releases 527 Pages Of New Regulations In ONE Day! According to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the Obama administration has just shattered the old record for pages of regulations and rules published by the in-house journal, the Federal Register. At 81,640 total pages for 2016, it ranks first and 235 pages more than all of those published in 2010, the previous record.   17, 2016 President Obama has just set a new record for rules and regulations, his administration spitting out 527 pages worth in just one day, as he races to put his fingerprint on virtually every corner of American life and business. 
According to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the administration has just shattered the old record for pages of regulations and rules published by the in-house journal, the Federal Register . At 81,640 total pages for 2016, it ranks first and 235 pages more than all of those published in 2010, the previous record. The rules, politics of federal regulations under Obama: 
As shocking as this video is , it was made 5 months ago and does not reflect the current race-to-regulate happening right now. What’s more, there are still about 26 working days left in the year. 
“No one knows what the future holds, but at a pace of well over 1,000 pages weekly, the Federal Register could easily top 90,000 pages this year. The simple algebra says that at the current pace we’ll add 11,190 pages over the next 44 days, to end 2016 at around 92,830 pages,” said CEI’s Clyde Wayne Crews. 
“This is astonishing and should be of great concern, and intolerable, to policymakers. It is remarkable enough that the all-time record has been passed before Thanksgiving,” he added. Obama has promised to regulate by executive authority, but the sheer number of pages of regulations being rushed through is astonishing. 
Still, it’s not a big surprise to CEI and other regulation watchdogs. 
The reason, said Crews, Obama owns seven of the 10 highest-ever Federal Register counts. 
He called on President-elect Trump to make good on campaign promises and cut regulations. 
“President-elect Donald Trump could take a page from President Reagan, who brought page counts down from Carter’s 73,258 to as low as 44,812. We don’t need a pen and phone, we need a meat axe,” said Crews. source

19236,The Non-Existent Trump Mandate,"The Non-Existent Trump Mandate November 14, 2016 
Republicans are claiming a mandate to speak for the “silent majority,” but the actual numbers show that not only did Donald Trump fail to win a plurality, his vote total largely matched other recent GOP candidates, notes Nicolas J S Davies. 
By Nicolas J S Davies 
Within days of the U.S. general election, central elements of the result have already entered into American mythology: the revenge of the “white working class voter”; the unprecedented anti-establishment character of the President-elect; the populist revolution that led to Trump’s victory; and the years in the wilderness now facing Democrats and progressives in America. 
But the endless repetition of these themes by the corporate media deserves a great deal more skepticism and scrutiny before they worm their way into all our heads to form the established and accepted narrative of this election. Let’s first review some basic facts about what happened on Nov. 8: Donald Trump at the 2016 Republican National Convention. (Photo credit: Grant Miller/RNC) 
Who Voted Republican? 
Though Donald Trump prevailed in the Electoral College, he failed to secure a plurality of the total ballots cast, getting a bit over 60 million votes to Hillary Clinton’s 61 million votes, according to The Associated Press tally . Meanwhile, only 55.6 percent of 219 million eligible voters, or 50.4 percent of the voting-age population , actually voted, placing the U.S. 33rd out of 35 advanced (OECD) countries in national voter turnout , above only Chile and Switzerland. 
Only 27 percent of eligible voters or 24 percent of the voting-age population voted for Trump. Roughly the same number, about 60 million, voted for both John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012. The result was different because Barack Obama received 69 million votes in 2008 and 66 million in 2012, while Hillary Clinton could only muster only a shade more than Trump, Romney and McCain. 
As Sen. Bernie Sanders repeated in every stump speech during the Democratic primaries, “Let us never forget, Democrats and progressives win when voter turnout is high. Republicans win when people are demoralized and voter turnout is low.” 
So, Trump deserves credit for finding a few new Republican voters to replace those who have died in the past fou4 years, and for a successful strategy to gain votes in the right states to win the Electoral College. But the more decisive difference with 2008 and 2012 was the dramatic failure of the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, to turn out the vote. This was despite, or maybe even because of, unprecedented SuperPAC money and overwhelming support from political, business and media elites. 
Democratic Hopes 
If the Democrats hope to do better in future elections, they must confront this reality. Grassroots Democrats should insist that party leaders finally abandon the long obsolete Reagan/Thatcher-lite Democratic Leadership Council model of politics based on fund-raising, propaganda, corporate welfare and militarism, and welcome the kind of new, progressive leadership that inspired 47 percent of Democratic primary voters to vote for Senator Bernie Sanders. Sen. Bernie Sanders speaking to one of his large crowds of supporters. (Photo credit: Sanders campaign) 
This was all the more significant and impressive in the context of party leaders’ monolithic support for Clinton and their shameful campaign to stage a coronation instead of organizing a free and fair primary election. 
We will find out more about who actually voted for Trump, but the pollster Nate Silver already exposed “The Myth of Trump’s ‘Working Class’ Support” in a fivethirtyeight .com article on May 3. Silver’s article analyzed a survey of the average household income of people who voted in the 23 primaries up to that point. The average Clinton or Sanders primary voter had a household income of $61,000, while the average Trump voter earned $72,000, about the same as Cruz’s supporters but less than Kasich’s. 
The 70 percent of eligible voters who did not vote in either primary had an average household income of $52,000. In broad terms, this tracks the traditional pattern of U.S. politics, with wealthier Americans leaning Republican, the middle-class favoring Democrats and few of the poor African-Americans and immigrants who make up much of the real U.S. working-class voting at all. 
These figures were for primary voters, but they suggest that Trump’s supporters were, well, Republicans, like Romney’s, McCain’s, Bush’s and so on. The Republican Party has continually rebranded itself over the past 50 years, generating great fanfares from deferential or captive corporate media for the Silent Majority, the Reagan Revolution, the Moral Majority, the Christian Right, the Contract With America, the Tea Party and now Trump’s Deplorables, but behind these well-funded P.R. campaigns, Republican voters remain roughly the same people or class of people. Edward Bernays, the father of modern propaganda and advertising, would approve their ever-changing public message! 
What is Trump’s agenda? 
Despite contradictory pronouncements on many issues, Donald Trump’s published plan for his first 100 days in office contained more policy details than Hillary Clinton’s campaign web site, which followed the DLC model of appealing to principles most Americans believe in without pinning the candidate down to anything detailed enough for most voters to disagree with. 
In Clinton’s case, this includes voluminous treatises on a wide array of subjects, but the blizzard of words was short on actual policy details, leaving the formerly presumptive president plenty of room to do whatever she and her corporate and military-industrial colleagues really planned to do after the coronation. As Wikileaks revealed, one of the few things Clinton’s staff and financiers were clear on was the necessarily wide gap between her public and private positions . 
Warmed-Over GOP Fare 
On the other hand, Donald Trump’s plan for his first 100 days in office includes more specifics and is, for the most part, a pretty standard wish-list of policies the Republican Party has backed for decades. That still leaves plenty of room for smoke and mirrors: President Obama in the Oval Office. 
–On Trump’s first day in office, he plans to cancel every “unconstitutional” action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama; to cancel federal funding to cities that provide sanctuary to undocumented immigrants; to begin deporting 2 million undocumented immigrants “with criminal records” (somehow expanding that group from the 178,000 counted in a 2010 Congressional report before Obama’s mass deportations reduced it still further); to stop issuing U.S. visas to people in countries that won’t accept unlimited numbers of U.S. deportees; to suspend immigration from “terror-prone” regions; and to begin work on selecting a new Supreme Court justice. 
–The legislative portion of Trump’s agenda starts with “massive tax reduction,” including an across-the-board 15 percent corporate tax rate, which drops to 10 percent for repatriated offshore earnings to reward the outsourcing he condemned on the campaign trail. This is balanced politically by a vague promise of unspecified new tariffs to penalize future outsourcing. 
–“The American Energy and Infrastructure Act” will declare open season on the environment and the climate, stimulating “energy infrastructure” projects like the Keystone XL pipeline with tax cuts and corporate welfare, and ending U.S. payments to the U.N. climate fund. 
–A national school voucher program will expand the privatization of public education, while Trump also pays lip service to local control, reducing college tuition and ending common core. 
–Trump wants to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a new program based on health savings accounts, along with similar programs for childcare and elder care; states will be allowed to make unprecedented cuts in Medicaid; and he wants the Food and Drug Administration to speed up approvals for 4,000 new drugs. 
–As well as funding Trump’s wall on the Mexican border, new draconian immigration laws will impose mandatory 2- and 5-year federal prison sentences on previously deported immigrants who try to reenter the U.S. 
–New “national security” and “community safety” laws will blast military spending past Obama’s post-World War II record , and throw more money at local police to combat imaginary increases in “crime, drugs and violence” at home. Liberal state marijuana laws may be “trumped” by this new national “stop and frisk” program. 
–Trump wants term limits in Congress to get rid of popular progressive legislators like John Conyers and Patrick Leahy. He also wants a federal civilian hiring freeze and sweeping deregulation under which any new federal regulation must be offset by canceling two existing regulations. 
Controlling the Levers 
The most critical factor in the Republicans’ new-found power is that they now control the White House and both houses of Congress, as they did from 2003 to 2006 and for a shorter spell in 1953-54. This does not usually end well for them. The last time the Republicans held full control of the U.S. government for more than 4 years was in the 1920s, and that ended even worse. President George W. Bush speaks on the phone in the Oval Office, Oct. 7, 2008, with Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the United Kingdom, discussing efforts to solve the spreading global financial crisis. (White House photo by Eric Draper) 
If the Republicans exploit the support of 24 percent of Americans – not even a plurality of those who voted – to ram through their extreme right-wing agenda, they will deserve to be slung out on their ears in 2018 and 2020, as they were in 2006 and 2008. 
If rank-and-file Democrats can force their party’s corrupt leaders to quickly hand over power to new progressive leadership who will represent the other 76 percent of Americans, this should not be a tall order. 
In the meantime, progressives can contain the damage by countering every part of the Republicans’ (and corrupt Democrats’) agenda with clear, intelligent progressive proposals for real solutions to the serious problems facing our country and the world and building a popular movement around them. 
This will all be a real test for the Democrats, but it is one they have brought on themselves, and the radical clean-up required is what progressives have been demanding of the Democratic Party for a long time.

HILLARY THE SPY? - UPDATED INFO! 
Let us start with an historical fact. Treason and betrayal by the highest levels is a common feature of history, whether it is Judas vs Jesus, Brutus vs Julius Caesar, Benedict Arnold, the Rosenbergs, Jonathan Pollard, Aldrich Ames, Robert Hanssen. It is just a fact of life. It does happen. 
Back in 1996, when Bill Clinton was running for re-election, he authorized the transfer of highly sensitive technology to China. This technology had military applications and allowed China to close the gap in missile performance with the United States. The transfers were opposed and severely criticized by the Defense Department. 
At the same time Bill Clinton was transferring this technology to China, huge donations began to pour into his re-election campaign from the US companies allowed to sell the technology to China, and from American citizens of Chinese descent. The fact that they were US citizens allowed them to donate to political campaigns, but it later emerged that they were acting as conduits for cash coming in from Asian sources, including Chinese Intelligence Agencies! The scandal eventually became known as China-gate! 
John Huang 
A close associate of Indonesian industrialist James Riady, Huang initially was appointed deputy secretary of commerce in 1993. By 1995, however, he moved to the Democratic National Committee where he generated hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal contributions from foreign sources. Huang later pleaded guilty to one felony count of campaign finance violations. 
Charlie Trie 
Like John Huang, Trie raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal contributions from foreign sources to Democratic campaign entities. He was a regular White House visitor and arranged meetings of foreign operators with Clinton, including one who was a Chinese arms dealer. His $450,000 contribution to Clinton's legal defense fund was returned after it was found to have been largely funded by Asian interests. Trie was convicted of violating campaign finance laws in 1998. 
One of Trie's main sources of cash was Chinese billionaire Ng Lap Seng, according to a Senate Report. Ng Lap Seng had connections to the Chinese government. Seng was arrested in 2015 over an unrelated bribery case, but this gave investigators the opportunity to question Seng about the Chinagate scandal. Former United Nations General Assembly President John Ashe was also caught in the bribery case and was about to testify to the links between the Clintons and Seng when he was found dead that very morning. Initially reported as having died from a heart attack, John's throat had obviously been crushed. At that point the official story changed to him accidentally dropping a barbell on his own throat. 
Ng Lap Seng with the Clintons. 
Johnny Chung 
Gave more than $366,000 to the Democratic National Committee prior to the 1996 campaign, but it was returned after officials learned it came from illegal foreign sources. Chung later told a special Senate committee investigating 1996 Clinton campaign fund-raising that $35,000 of his contributions came from individuals in Chinese intelligence. Chung pleaded guilty to bank fraud, tax evasion and campaign finance violations. 
Chinagate, documented by Judicial Watch, was uncovered by Judicial Watch founder Larry Klayman. Technology companies allegedly made donations of millions of dollars to various Democratic Party entities, including President Bill Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign, in return for permission to sell high-tech secrets to China. Bernard Schwartz and his Loral Space & Communication Ltd. later allegedly ""helped China to identify the cause of [a rocket failure], thereby advancing China's missile program and threatening U.S. national security, according to records. 
This establishes a history of the Clintons treating US secrets as their own personal property, and selling them to raise money for campaigns! 
Is history repeating itself? It appears so! 
Let us consider a private email server with weak security, at least one known totally open access point, no encryption at all, and outside the control and monitoring systems of the US government, on which are parked many of the nation's most closely guarded secrets (as well as those of the United Nations and other foreign governments)! It is already established that Hillary's email was hacked. One hacker named Guccifer provided copies of emails to Russia Today, which published them.",0
19238,Human Smuggler Crashes Car Fleeing Border Patrol Agents,"A human smuggling suspect crashed his vehicle while attempting to flee Border Patrol agents in southern California. The crash caused the driver to receive severe head trauma, requiring airlift transportation to an area hospital. [Border Patrol agents attempted to stop a vehicle on Highway 78, near State Road 2, early Sunday morning. The driver refused to yield and led the agents on a   chase. While attempting to evade arrest, the suspect lost control of his vehicle and rolled over. The driver received serious head trauma and torso injuries. Agents called an air ambulance that transported him to a Palm Springs medical facility for treatment, according to information obtained by Breitbart Texas from U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials.  The suspected human smuggler had two passengers riding with him. These suspected illegal aliens received minor injuries. Border Patrol agents sent them to an Escondido hospital for evaluation. “The driver of this vehicle is an associate of one of the Indio Border Patrol Station’s top two alien smuggling organizations,” Indio Station Patrol Agent in Charge Scott Garrett said in a written statement. “The driver chose to flee and wound up seriously injuring himself. Fortunately, the two individuals he was smuggling were not seriously injured, otherwise, he would be facing additional felony charges. ” Information provided by CBP officials did not disclose any information about the citizenship, nationality, or immigration status of the driver or the two suspected illegal aliens. This is the second rollover crash involving a human smuggler in the El Centro Sector in recent weeks. Breitbart Texas reported on January 23 about a crash involving a human smuggler attempting to flee from Border Patrol agents from the Yuma and El Centro Sectors. Agents observed the suspected smuggler driving eastbound on the interstate. The driver of the white Acura suddenly took the Greys Well exit and abruptly   under an overpass. One of the agents from the Yuma Sector attempted to stop the Acura. The driver failed to yield and sped off. The driver and his cargo of six illegal aliens, all received minor injuries. The agents from the Yuma Sector and the Calexico Stations eventually lost sight of the suspect’s vehicle. A continued search revealed the suspect had lost control of his car and rolled over. The U. S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals recently reinstated a Texas   law that provides a tool for law enforcement and prosecutors to use in the fight against human smuggling, Breitbart Texas reported last week. The law makes the harboring of an illegal alien a   felony, punishable by a   year prison sentence and a fine of up to 10, 000. It also adds a provision increasing the penalties and imposing a   felony level if the alien is a minor, or if the harboring creates the possibility of serious bodily injury or death, Breitbart Texas reported. It created a   felony crime for a situation where the person suffers sexual assault during the harboring, or the victim experiences serious bodily injury or death.

19241,Bangladesh Police Kill Man Suspected of Planning Dhaka Bakery Attack - The New York Times,"DHAKA, Bangladesh  —   A Canadian man suspected of having planned a July attack on a bakery in Dhaka that left 22 people dead was killed in a shootout with the Bangladeshi police on Saturday, officials said. The man, Tamim Ahmed Chowdhury, a    Canadian citizen of Bangladeshi descent, was one of three militants killed in the raid outside Dhaka, the capital, the officials said. The Bangladeshi authorities have said Mr. Chowdhury planned the July 1 assault on the Holey Artisan Bakery, a restaurant popular with expatriates and   Bangladeshis. Some analysts believe Mr. Chowdhury acted as a coordinator for the Islamic State militant group in Bangladesh and northeastern India. The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for several recent attacks in Bangladesh, including the assault on the bakery. The Bangladeshi police, however, identified Mr. Chowdhury as the leader of a new branch of a domestic terrorist group, the Jama’atul Mujahedeen Bangladesh, and the government initially denied that the bakery attack had been carried out by members of foreign groups. Later, officials acknowledged that the attackers might have had links to such groups, including the Islamic State. The shootout on Saturday morning took place at a   house in the Narayanganj district near Dhaka, after the police received a tip that the militants were hiding there, said A. K. M. Kamrul Ahsan, a spokesman. They were given a chance to surrender but attacked the police with guns and grenades, at which point the police opened fire, said a police official, Inspector General A. K. M. Shahidul Hoque, in televised comments to reporters on Saturday. Both officials said Mr. Chowdhury was among the militants killed. The police had offered cash bounties of about $25, 000 this month for information leading to the arrest of Mr. Chowdhury and for another militant, Syed Mohammad Ziaul Haque, who was suspected of being involved in recent killings of secular writers. Mr. Chowdhury’s name was on a list of 10   suspects released by the Bangladeshi authorities last month after the Holey Artisan Bakery attack, an   siege carried out by five militants who were eventually killed by soldiers. Analysts said Mr. Chowdhury and two other Bangladeshi expatriates on that list could have been acting as links between local and international extremist groups. The bakery siege was the most deadly in a series of violent attacks carried out by Islamist militants in Bangladesh over the past several years. The frequency of those attacks has increased in recent months. Officials said they suspected that Mr. Chowdhury was also behind a July 7 bombing at Bangladesh’s largest prayer gathering for the Eid   holiday, which killed four people: two police officers, a civilian and a militant. Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan said Saturday in televised remarks to reporters that the identities of the two militants killed with Mr. Chowdhury would be released after an investigation, but that one of them appeared to be Mr. Chowdhury’s   man. It was not clear whether either of them was on the list of   suspects released last month. “We think Tamim Chowdhury’s chapter has ended here,” Mr. Khan said. “We will be able to catch the rest of the militants soon. ”",0

“I am sick and tired of people like you using that language. That is inflammatory, that is not true,” Gingrich angrily said after Kelly used the phrase “sexual predator” when talking about the women who have come forward to accuse Trump of sexual assault, but not about Clinton. 
“You are fascinated with sex and you don’t care about public policy,” Gingrich said to Kelly at one point during the show.

19243,US House Seeks Syria-War Escalation,"US House Seeks Syria-War Escalation November 22, 2016 
Moving to trap President-elect Trump into a war escalation in Syria, the House rushed through a resolution promoting a U.S.-imposed “no fly zone” that could spark World War III, reports Rick Sterling. 
By Rick Sterling 
Late in the day, on Nov. 15, one week after the U.S. elections, the lame-duck Congress convened in special session with normal rules suspended so the House could pass House Resolution 5732, the “Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act” calling for intensifying the already harsh sanctions on Syria, assessing the imposition of a “no fly zone” inside Syria (to prevent the Syrian government from flying) and escalating efforts to press criminal charges against Syrian officials. 
HR5732 claims to promote a negotiated settlement in Syria but, as analyzed by Friends Committee for National Legislation, it imposes preconditions which would actually make a peace agreement more difficult. The West Front of the U.S. Capitol 
There was 40 minutes of “debate” with six representatives (Ed Royce, R-California; Eliot Engel, D-New York; Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida; Dan Kildee, D-Michigan; Chris Smith, R-New Jersey; and Carlos Curbelo, R-Florida) all speaking in favor of the resolution. There were few other representatives present, but the House Foreign Affairs Committee stated that the resolution was passed “unanimously” without mentioning these special conditions. 
According to Wikipedia, “ Suspension of the rules is a procedure generally used to quickly pass non-controversial bills in the United States House of Representatives … such as naming Post Offices…” In this case, however, the resolution could lead to a wider war in the Middle East and potentially World War III with nuclear-armed Russia. 
Most strikingly, the resolution calls for evaluating and developing plans for the United States to impose a “no fly zone” inside Syria, a sovereign nation, an act of war that also would violate international law as an act of aggression. It also could put the U.S. military in the position of shooting down Russian aircraft. 
To call this proposal “non-controversial” is absurd, although it may say a great deal about the “group think” of the U.S. Congress that an act of war would be so casually considered. Clearly, this resolution should have been debated under normal rules with a reasonable amount of Congressional presence and debate. 
The motivation for bypassing normal rules and rushing the bill through without meaningful debate was articulated by the bill’s sponsor, Democrat Eliot Engel: “We cannot delay action on Syria any further. … If we don’t get this legislation across the finish line in the next few weeks, we are back to square one.” 
The current urgency may be related to the election results since President-elect Donald Trump has spoken out against “regime change” foreign policy. As much as neoconservatives and their liberal-interventionist allies are critical of President Obama for not doing more in Syria, these Congressional hawks are even more concerned about the prospect of a President who might move toward peace and away from war. 
The Caesar Fraud 
HR5732 is titled the “Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act,” which House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Royce explained was named after “the brave Syrian defector known to the world as Caesar, who testified to us the shocking scale of torture being carried out within the prisons of Syria.” U.S.-backed Syrian “moderate” rebels smile as they prepare to behead a 12-year-old boy (left), whose severed head is held aloft triumphantly in a later part of the video. [Screenshot from the YouTube video] In reality, the Caesar story was a grand deception involving the CIA with funding from Qatar to sabotage the 2014 Geneva peace negotiations. The 55,000 photos which were said to show 11,000 torture victims have never been publicly revealed. Only a tiny number of photos have been publicized. However, in 2015, Human Rights Watch was granted access to view the entire set. They revealed that almost one half the photos show the opposite of what was claimed: instead of victims tortured by the Syrian government, they actually show dead Syrian soldiers and civilian victims of car bombs and other terror attacks. The “Caesar” story, replete with a masked “defector,” was one of the early propaganda hoaxes regarding Syria.
One of the other big lies regarding Syria is that the U.S. has been doing nothing. Royce said, “ The administration has decided not to decide. And that itself, unfortunately, has set a course where here we sit and watch and the violence only worsens. Mr. Speaker, America has been sitting back and watching these atrocities for far too long. Vital U.S. national security interests are at stake.” 
Rep. Engel said, “Four years ago I thought we should have aided the Free Syrian Army. They came to us in Washington and begged us for help. … They were simply looking for weaponry. I really believe if we had given it to them, the situation in Syria would have been different today.” 
That narrative is nonsense. By late 2011, the U.S. was actively coordinating, training and supplying armed opposition groups. When Muammar Gaddafi’s Libyan government was toppled in fall 2011, the CIA oversaw the diversion of Libyan weapons to the Syrian armed opposition, as documented in the Defense Intelligence Agency report of October 2012. 
These weapons transfers were secret. For the public record, it was acknowledged that the U.S. was supplying communications equipment to the armed opposition while U.S. “allies” — Saudi Arabia and Qatar — were supplying the weaponry. This is one reason that Saudi purchases of weapons skyrocketed during this time period; they were buying weapons to replace those being shipped to the armed opposition in Syria. It was very profitable for U.S. arms manufacturers. 
Huge weapons transfers to the armed opposition in Syria have continued to the present, with the U.S. government even more directly involved. This past spring, Janes Defense reported the details of a U.S. delivery of 2.2 million pounds of ammunition, rocket launchers and other weaponry to the armed opposition. 
So, the political claims that the U.S. has been inactive are baseless. In reality, the U.S. has done everything short of a direct attack on Syria. And the U.S. military is starting to cross that line. On Sept. 17, the U.S. air coalition conducted a series of airstrikes on the Syrian Army in Deir Ezzor, killing 80 Syrian soldiers and enabling ISIS to launch an attack on the position. Claims that it was a “mistake” are highly dubious. 
The assertions by Congressional hawks that the U.S. has been “inactive” in the Syrian conflict are part of the false narrative suggesting the U.S. must “do something” which leads to a “no fly zone” and full-scale war. Ironically, these calls for war are masked as “humanitarian” though even proponents, such as Hillary Clinton, privately have acknowledged that large numbers of Syrians, including civilians, would be killed in the U.S. attacks needed to establish the “no fly zone.” 
And, never do the proponents bring up the case of Libya where the U.S. and NATO “did something”: destroyed the government and created chaos. 
Fact-Free House of Propaganda 
With only a handful of representatives present and no dissent, the six Congressional members engaged in unrestrained propaganda and misinformation. Samantha Power, Permanent Representative of the United States to the UN, addresses the Security Council meeting on Syria, Sept. 25, 2016. Power has been an advocate for escalating U.S. military involvement in Syria. (UN Photo) 
Engel, said “We’re going into the New Year 2017, Assad still clings to power, at the expense of killing millions of his citizens.” Even if all the deaths, including Syrian soldiers and civilians killed by anti-government jihadists, were blamed on Assad, this number is way off anyone’s charts. 
Rep. Kildee said “The world has witnessed this terrible tragedy unfold before our eyes. Nearly half a million Syrians killed. Not soldiers – men, women, children killed.” 
The official text of the resolution says, “ It is the sense of Congress that– (1) Bashar al-Assad’s murderous actions against the people of Syria have caused the deaths of more than 400,000 civilians…” 
The above accusations – from “millions of citizens” to “half a million” to “400,000 civilians” – are all preposterous lies. Credible estimates of casualties in the Syrian conflict range from 300,000 to 420,000. The opposition-supporting Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimates the documented 2011-2016 death toll as follows: killed pro-Syrian forces – 108,000; killed anti-government forces – 105,000; killed civilians – 89,000 
In contrast with Congressional and media claims, civilians comprise a minority of the total death count and the heaviest casualties are among those fighting in defense of the Syrian state. In the U.S. political world and the mainstream media, these facts are ignored and never mentioned because they point to the reality versus the propaganda narrative which has allowed the U.S. and its allies to continue funding terrorism and a war of aggression against Syria. 
The Congressional speakers were in full self-righteous mode as they accused the Syrian government of “committing crimes against humanity and war crimes against civilians including murder, torture and rape. No one has been spared from this targeting, even children.” A naive listener would never know that the Syrian government is primarily fighting the Syrian branch of Al Qaeda including thousands of foreign fighters supplied and paid by foreign governments. 
The speakers went on to accuse the Syrian military of “targeting” hospitals, schools and markets. A critical listener might ask why they would do that instead of targeting Al Qaeda terrorists and their allies who launch dozens and sometimes hundreds of hell-cannon missiles into the government-held sections of Aleppo every day. 
The Congressional propaganda fest would not be complete without mention of the “White Helmets.” Royce said “We (previously) heard the testimony of Raed Saleh of the Syrian White Helmets. These are the doctors, nurses and volunteers who actually, when the bombs come, run towards the areas that have been hit in order to try to get the injured civilians medical treatment. … They have lost over 600 doctors and nurses.” 
This is more Congressional nonsense. There are no nurses or doctors associated with the White Helmets. The organization was created by the U.S. and U.K. and heavily promoted by a “ shady PR firm .” The White Helmets operate solely in areas controlled by Al Qaeda’s Nusra Front (recently renamed Syria Conquest Front) and associated terrorist groups. The White Helmets do some rescue work in the conflict zone but their main role is in the information war manipulating public opinion. 
The White Helmets actively promote U.S./NATO intervention through a “no fly zone.” Recently, the White Helmets became a major source of claims about innocent civilian victims in east Aleppo. 
Given the clear propagandistic history of the White Helmets, these claims should be treated with skepticism. We need to ask exactly what is the evidence? 
The same skepticism needs to be applied to video and other reports from the Aleppo Media Center. AMC is a creation of the Syrian Expatriates Organization whose address on K Street in Washington, D.C., indicates it is a U.S. marketing operation. 
What’s Going On? 
The campaign to overthrow the Syrian government is failing and there is possibility of a victory for the Syrian government and its allies. A heart-rending propaganda image designed to justify a major U.S. military operation inside Syria against the Syrian military. 
The earlier flood of international jihadi recruits is drying up. The Syrian Army and allies are gaining ground militarily and negotiating settlements or re-locations with “rebels” who previously terrorized Homs, Darraya (outer Damascus) and elsewhere. In Aleppo, the Syrian army and allies are tightening the noose around the armed opposition in east Aleppo. 
This has caused alarm among neoconservative lawmakers devoted to Israel, Saudi Arabia and U.S. empire. They are desperate to prevent the Syrian government from finally eliminating the terrorist groups which the West and its allies have promoted for the past five-plus years. 
“Pro Israel” groups have been major campaigners for passage of HR5732. The name of Simon Wiesenthal is even invoked in the resolution. Rabbi Lee Bycel wrote, “Where is the Conscience of the World?” as he questioned why the “humanitarian” HR5732 was not passed earlier. 
Israeli interests are one of the primary forces sustaining and promoting the conflict. Syria is officially at war with Israel which continues to occupy the Syrian Golan Heights; Syria has been a key ally of the Lebanese Hezbollah resistance; and Syria has maintained its alliance with Iran. In 2010, Secretary of State Clinton urged Syria to break relations with Hezbollah, reduce relations with Iran and come to settlement with Israel. The Syrian refusal to comply with these Washington demands was instrumental in solidifying Washington’s hostility . 
Congressional proponents of HR5732 make clear the international dimension of the conflict. Royce explains, “It is Russia, it is Hezbollah, that are the primary movers of death and destruction. … It is the IRGC [Revolutionary Guard] fighters from Iran.” 
Engel echoes the same message: “Yes, we want to go after Assad’s partners in violence … Iranian and Hezbollah forces.” 
In words and deeds Israel has made its position on Syria crystal clear. Israeli Ambassador to the United States Michael Oren explained in an interview: “we always wanted [President] Bashar Assad to go, we always preferred the bad guys who weren’t backed by Iran to the bad guys who were backed by Iran … the greatest danger to Israel is by the strategic arc that extends from Tehran, to Damascus to Beirut. And we saw the Assad regime as the keystone in that arc.” 
These statements have been fully backed up by Israeli actions bombing Syrian positions in southern Syria and providing medical treatment for Nusra/Al Qaeda and other armed opposition fighters. 
What Will Happen Now? 
If the Syrian government and its allies continue to advance in Aleppo, Deir Ezzor, outer Damascus and the south, the situation will come to a head. The enemies of Syria – predominately the U.S., Gulf Countries, NATO and Israel – will come to a decision point. Do they intervene directly or do they allow their “regime change” project to collapse? HR5732 is an effort to prepare for direct intervention and aggression. 
One thing is clear from the experience of Libya: Neoconservatives do not care if they leave a country in chaos. The main objective is to destabilize and overthrow a government which is too independent. If the U.S. and its allies cannot dominate the country, then at least they can destroy the contrary authority and leave chaos. 
What is at stake in Syria is whether the U.S. and allies, including Israel and Saudi Arabia, are able to destroy the last secular and independent Arab country in the region and whether the U.S. goal of being the sole superpower in the world prevails. The rushed passage of HR5732 without any meaningful debate is indicative of that. 
Despite Trump’s election and his stated priority of taking on Islamic terrorism – not overthrowing Assad – the “regime change” proponents have not given up their war on Syria. They still seek to escalate U.S. aggression there and hope to box President Trump in. 
It’s also clear that the U.S. Congress has become a venue where blatant lies can be stated with impunity and where violent actions are advanced behind a cynical and amoral veneer of “humanitarianism.”

19244,An Exploration Of Finding Meaning In Life Through Logotherapy,"What motivates you to live? What is the meaning of life?
For centuries, mankind has questioned everything. Mankind’s quest for the answer to what drives us, and what pushes us forward in times of darkness is not exempt from analysis. In fact, it’s been a consistent theme since the dawn of time. Stoicism , although not directly attributed to answering ‘what drives us’, skirts around the topic and creates a general set of principles to help us deal with negative externalities in life.
While many philosophers have pontificated on the subject of mankind’s driving force, and the ‘will to live’, there’s a problem inherent with such an analysis. In order to research such a basic, and instinctual topic, one needs to experience a visceral, cerebral experience that brings him or her to a basic, instinctual level, before having such an epiphany. One needs to examine our animalistic base, and then explore logically from there.
One such analysis is known as Logotherapy, from the Greek word logos(wise) . Logotherapy, developed by Viktor Frankl, is an influential school of psychotherapy, that is founded on the pillars of ‘what motivates mankind’. Before we delve into Logotherapy, however, it’s important that we discuss Viktor Frankl—who he was, and why his unique perspective provides for an incredibly powerful source of credibility and authority.

Viktor Frankl was born in 1905, in what was at that time known as Austria-Hungary. Frankl was a neurologist, and psychiatrist. His early life was relatively unspectacular, but from an early age he displayed an interest in philosophy, as well as psychotherapy. Initially interested in Freud and Adler’s work, he began to see their faults, and eventually diverged from their teachings—becoming particularly interested in depression, as well as suicide.
During 1933-1937, Frankl, in completing his residency in neurology, was responsible for setting up the Selbstmörderpavillon , translated in English to “the suicide pavilion”. It’s estimated that Frankl, along with his staff, treated upwards of 30,000 women who had suicidal tendencies.
In September of 1942, his life was shaken. Frankl, along with his wife and family, were deported to a Nazi concentration camp, known as Theresienstadt ghetto. Whilst there, and during his stay at Auschwitz, Frankl worked as a doctor in the psychiatric care unit, focusing on mental health, helping newcomers deal with shock and grief.

In 1946, after three years in a concentration camp, Frankl released his book entitled Man’s Search for Meaning , which details his experiences as a holocaust survivor, as well as his theory, which became known as Logotherapy. The book is divided into two parts—part one is a detailed account of his experiences, whereas part two discusses Logotherapy.
His time in the numerous concentration camps began to shape his philosophical, and psychiatric theory. While he had read books on the subject of ‘psychological healing’ prior to his imprisonment, he had never experienced it to the degree in which he had become accustomed to. Particularly intrigued as to why some prisoners lived longer than others, Frankl began to organize his thoughts and document how the average prisoner’s life in a concentration camp was reflected in their mind. As a doctor focusing on grief and shock-stricken inmates, he was in a very unique position.
Hundreds, and during some weeks thousands, of helpless inmates were carted in Auschwitz, the most-feared concentration camp, weekly. Between the inmates sleeping next to him, and those seeking treatment, Frankl noted that each prisoner, without exception faced three stages of psychological reactions once entering the concentration camp. These stages were; shock, apathy, and depersonalization.
While seemingly unimportant, the noted documentation of these stages was very important for Frankl. As he began to notice, while every inmate experienced these stages, some experienced them to a less cerebral degree. Some inmates seemed less depressive than others, and featured a happier disposition. These inmates—with some expected variability—outlived the other inmates.
Discovery As he began to poke and prod, Frankl noticed something that separated these individuals from others— hope. There is never not meaning in life. Every moment no matter how painful, dehumanizing or horrendous it is, has meaning. By extension, Frankl suggests, even suffering is meaningful. The inmates that survived the longest—the ones that outlived the rest, had hope. Frankl suggested that he could tell whether or not an inmate would live just by looking at their faces—the face of a dejected, depressed inmate was obvious and clear as day. Without hope, they were doomed.
“Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.”
The next question that Frankl sought to answer was an important one, and the foundational maxim of Logotherapy—why did some men have hope, and others not?
The answer, was love.
“The truth – that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which Man can aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart: The salvation of Man is through love and in love. I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved.”
Frankl, in his book Man’s Search for Meaning recounted several instances where he would be driven into brief stints of depression; after a beating, during a late-night march in bare feet, or watching his friend get treated inhumanely. He’d vacillate from depression by thinking, and longing for his wife. The men whom lasted the longest, invariably had a wife, or a job that they loved. It was this motivator, the unquantifiable love, that pushed men in inhuman circumstances to existentially escape the physical realm, and put mind above body.
What we can get from this To answer this, Frankl codified three ways that he discovered is how we can find meaning in life – A job, love, and how we react to suffering. It’s important to realize that while it’s easy to read this and assume that Frankl is saying we should all suffer in order to find meaning—he’s not. He IS suggesting, however, that should we not have a job/deed, or love that allow us to find meaning in life, we can still find meaning by choosing how to react in a negative situation—our mental freedom is one of the only things that can never be taken from us, theoretically speaking.
The average man will never be faced with such a dire circumstance such as the atrocities that Frankl and so many others dealt with. What we can do, however, is choose how we react to life’s adversities.
A fair assessment of Logotherapy is that it provides a simplistic solution to a complex question (life). Since life is such a complex series of events, Logotherapy offers a solution that may not be representative of life’s true hardships and intricacies. In saying this, my own personal evaluation is that, this criticism in itself may have flaws, by assuming that a complex question must have a complex solution. Even the assumption that life in complex can be debated. It’s a cliched saying that ‘life is hard’, or complex—and even if it is, it’s not out of the realm of possibility that a complex question has a simple solution – sometimes the answer we seek is right in front of us.
Viktor Frankl died in September 1997, and his works are still read today. Several Logotherapy institutes exist today named after him.

19245,"La influencia de Estados Unidos y la OTAN en las relaciones de la Unión Europea con China, por Manlio Dinucci","La influencia de Estados Unidos y la OTAN en las relaciones de la Unión Europea con China por Manlio Dinucci Al intervenir en un foro internacional, el geógrafo italiano Manlio Dinucci sintetiza su análisis sobre el arsenal que Estados Unidos ha venido acumulando para imponer su voluntad al mundo. Este trabajo reviste especial importancia ya que esa voluntad claramente asumida de dominación y esa organización unipolar del mundo son precisamente lo que Siria, Rusia y China cuestionan hoy por la vía de las armas.
Red Voltaire | Roma (Italia) | 27 de octubre de 2016 français Entro de inmediato en el quid de la cuestión. Pienso que no podemos hablar de las relaciones entre la Unión Europea y China sin abordar la influencia que Estados Unidos ejerce sobre la Unión Europea, tanto directamente como a través de la OTAN.
Hoy en día, 22 de los 28 países miembros de la Unión Europea (21 de los 27 después de la salida del Reino Unido) son miembros de la OTAN, reconocida por la Unión Europea como « base fundamental de la defensa colectiva ». Y la OTAN se halla bajo el mando de Estados Unidos: el Comandante Supremo de las fuerzas de la OTAN es siempre un general estadounidense nombrado directamente por el presidente de Estados Unidos y todos los demás mandos de la OTAN también están en manos de militares estadounidenses. La política exterior y militar de la Unión Europea se ve así fundamentalmente subordinada a la estrategia estadounidense, tras la cual se alinean las principales potencias europeas.
Esa estrategia, claramente enunciada en los documentos oficiales, es trazada en el momento histórico en que la situación mundial cambia como resultado de la desintegración de la URSS. En 1991, la Casa Blanca declara en la National Security Strategy of the United States :
«Estados Unidos queda como el único Estado que dispone de una fuerza, de un alcance y de una influencia en todos los aspectos –político, económico y militar– realmente globales. No existe sustituto del liderazgo estadounidense.»
En 1992, en su Defense Planning Guidance , el Pentágono subraya:
«Nuestro primer objetivo es impedir que cualquier otra potencia domine una región cuyos recursos sean suficientes como para engendrar un poderío mundial. Esas regiones incluyen Europa occidental, el Asia oriental, el territorio de la ex Unión Soviética y el Asia sudoccidental.»
En 2001, en el informe Quadrennial Defense Review –publicado una semana antes de la guerra de Estados Unidos y la OTAN contra Afganistán, área de primera importancia geoestratégica en relación con Rusia y China–, el Pentágono anuncia:
«Existe la posibilidad de que surja en la región un rival militar con una formidable base de recursos. Nuestras fuerzas armadas deben conservar la capacidad de imponer la voluntad de Estados Unidos a cualquier adversario, ya sean Estados o entidades no estatales, cambiando el régimen de un Estado adverso o ocupando un territorio extranjero hasta que se alcancen los objetivos estratégicos estadounidenses.»
En base a esa estrategia, la OTAN –bajo el mando de Estados Unidos– ha emprendido su ofensiva en el frente oriental: luego de haber destruido la Federación Yugoslava mediante la guerra, desde 1999 hasta este momento la OTAN ha abarcado todos los Estados del desaparecido Pacto de Varsovia, 3 Estados de la antigua Yugoslavia, 3 de la antigua URSS y dentro de poco abarcará otros (comenzando por Georgia y Ucrania, esta última ya está de hecho en la OTAN), moviendo bases y fuerzas, incluso nucleares, hacia zonas cada vez más cercanas a Rusia. Al mismo tiempo, en el frente sur, estrechamente vinculado al oriental, la OTAN bajo el mando estadounidense destruyó el Estado libio –también recurriendo a una guerra– y también trata de destruir el Estado en Siria.
Estados Unidos y la OTAN hicieron estallar la crisis ucraniana y, acusando a Rusia de « desestabilizar la seguridad europea », arrastraron Europa a una nueva guerra fría, principalmente por voluntad de Washington –y a expensas de las economías europeas, ampliamente afectadas por sanciones y contrasanciones– para destruir las relaciones económicas y politicas entre Rusia y la Unión Europea, [relaciones] nefastas para los intereses estadounidenses. En esa misma estrategia se inscribe el creciente traslado de fuerzas militares estadounidenses hacia la región Asia/Pacífico, con objetivos antichinos. La US Navy anunció que, en 2020, tendrá concentrado en esa región el 60% de sus fuerzas navales y aereas.
La estrategia estadounidense está enfocada hacia el Mar de China Meridional, cuya importancia subraya el almirante Harris, jefe del PaCom (el mando militar estadounidense para el Pacífico): por ahí transitan anualmente 5 000 millardos [ 1 ] de dólares en mercancías por vía marítima, incluyendo un 25% de las ventas mundiales de petróleo y un 50% de las ventas de gas natural.
Estados Unidos quiere controlar esa vía marítima en nombre de lo que el almirante Harris define como una « libertad de navegación fundamental para nuestro modo de vida aquí y en Estados Unidos » y atribuye a China « acciones agresivas en el Mar de China Meridional, similares a las de Rusia en Crimea ». Así que la US Navy « patrulla » el Mar de China Meridional.
Tras Estados Unidos llegan las principales potencias europeas: en julio pasado, Francia pidió a la Unión Europea « coordinar el patrullaje naval en el Mar de China Oriental para garantizar una presencia regular y visible en esas aguas ilegalmente reclamadas por China ». Y mientras Estados Unidos instala en Corea del Sur sistemas « antimisiles » –pero capaces de lanzar también misiles nucleares, como los instalados contra Rusia en Rumania y próximamente en Polonia, además de los que llevan los navíos de guerra desplegados en el Mediterráneo– el secretario general de la OTAN Jens Stoltenberg recibe el 6 de octubre, en Bruselas, al ministro de Exteriores sudcoreano Yun Byung-se para « fortalecer la asociación de la OTAN con Seúl ».
Esos hechos y muchos más demuestran que en Europa y en Asia se está aplicando la misma estrategia. Es el intento desesperado de Estados Unidos y las demás potencias occidentales por conservar la supremacía económica, política y militar en un mundo en plena transición, donde están surgiendo nuevos actores estatales y sociales.
La Organización de Cooperación de Shanghai (OCS), nacida del acercamiento estratégico entre China y Rusia, dispone de recursos y capacidades de trabajo que pueden convertirla en el área de integración económica más grande del mundo. La organización de Shanghai y los países del grupo BRICS (Brasil, Rusia, India, China, Sudáfrica) son capaces, con sus organismos financieros, de tomar en gran parte el lugar que actualmente ocupan el Banco Mundial y el Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI), dos instituciones que durante los últimos 70 años permitieron a Estados Unidos y las principales potencias occidentales dominar la economía mundial mediante préstamos dignos de usureros a los países endeudados y otros instrumentos financieros. Los nuevos organismos pueden concretar a la vez la desdolarización de los intercambios comerciales, con lo cual privarían a Estados Unidos de la posibilidad de transferir a otros países su propia deuda al imprimir el papel moneda utilizado como divisa internacional dominante.
Para mantener su cada vez más tambaleante supremacía, Estados Unidos no sólo utiliza la fuerza militar sino también otras armas a menudo más eficaces que las armas propriamente dichas.
 Primera arma: los llamados « acuerdos de libre comercio », como la « Asociación Transatlántica de Comercio e Inversiones » (TTIP) con la Unión Europea y la « Asociación Transpacífica » (TPP) cuyo objetivo no es solamente económico sino también geopolítico y geoestratégico. Es por eso que Hillary Clinton califica la asociación Estados Unidos-Unión Europea como el « objetivo estratégico más grande de nuestra alianza transatlántica », proyectando una « OTAN económica » que integraría [la OTAN] política y militar.
El proyecto está claro: formar un bloque político, económico y militar Estados Unidos-Unión Europea, también bajo el mando de Estados Unidos, para oponerlo al área euroasiática en ascenso, que a su vez se basa en la cooperación entre China y Rusia; y oponerlo también a los BRICS, a Irán y a cualquier otro país que se sustraiga al control de Occidente.
Como las negociaciones sobre el TTIP encuentran dificultades para avanzar, a causa de las divergencias en materia de intereses y de una amplia oposición en Europa, actualmente tratan de recurrir al « Acuerdo Económico y Comercial Global » (CETA) entre Canadá y la Unión Europea, que no es otra cosa que un TTIP disimulado ya que Canadá es firmante del NAFTA [ 2 ] con Estados Unidos. El CETA será probable firmado por la Unión Europea el próximo 27 de octubre, en ocasión de la visita del primer ministro canadiense a Bruselas.
 Segunda arma: la penetración en los países designados como blancos para desintegrarlos desde adentro.
Se recurre para ello a los puntos débiles que todo país puede presentar: la corrupción, el deseo de ganar dinero, el arribismo político, el secesionismo fomentado por grupos de poder locales, el fanatismo religioso, la vulnerabilidad de las masas ante la demagogia política. Apoyándose también, en ciertos casos, en un descontento popular justificado hacia la conducta del gobierno del país.
Los instrumentos de penetración son las llamadas « organizaciones no gubernamentales » (ONGs) que en realidad obedecen al largo brazo del Departamento de Estado y de la CIA, que con enormes medios financieros han organizado las « revoluciones de colores » en el este de Europa y que también trataron de realizar una operación similar en Hong Kong con la llamada « Revolución de los Paraguas » (« Umbrella Révolution »), tendiente a fomentar movimientos similares en otras zonas de China pobladas por minorías.
Esas mismas organizaciones operan en Latinoamérica, fundamentalmente tratando de subvertir las instituciones democráticas en Brasil [país miembro del grupo BRICS], saboteando así a los BRICS desde adentro.
Otro instrumento de la misma estrategia son los grupos terroristas, como los grupos armados e infiltrados en Libia y en Siria para sembrar el caos, contribuyendo a la destrucción de Estados enteros que son al mismo tiempo agredidos desde el exterior.
 Tercera arma: las « PsyOps » (Operaciones psicológicas) que se realizan a través de los canales mediáticos mundiales, operaciones que el Pentágono define de la siguiente manera:
« Operaciones planificadas para influir a través de determinadads informaciones sobre las emociones y motivaciones, y por tanto en el comportamiento de la opinión pública, de organizaciones y gobiernos extranjeros, con el fin de inducir o fortalecer actitudes favorables a los objetivos predeterminados. »
Mediante esas operaciones, que acondicionan a la opinión pública para que acepte la escalada belicista, se presenta a Rusia como responsable de las tensiones en Europa y a China como responsable de las tensiones en Asia, acusándolas simultáneamente de « violaciones de los derechos humanos ».
Manlio Dinucci y su esposa, Carla, ante la casa natal de Mao Tse Tung, en 1965. Permítanme una última consideración. Por haber trabajado en Pekín en los años 1960, donde contribuimos juntos a la publicación de la primera revista china en italiano, puedo decir que viví una experiencia formativa fundamental en el momento en que China –liberada desde hacía apenas 15 años del control colonial, semicolonial y semifeudal– se hallaba completamente aislada y ni Occidente ni las Naciones Unidas la reconocían como Estado soberano.
De aquel periodo quedaron profundamente grabados en mi recuerdo la capacidad de resistencia y la conciencia de aquel pueblo –por entonces 600 millones de personas– inmerso, bajo la dirección del Partido Comunista, en la construcción de una sociedad con bases económicas y culturales totalmente nuevas. Pienso que aquella capacidad es también necesaria hoy en día para que la China de nuestros tiempos, que está desarrollando su enorme potencial, logre resistir ante los nuevos planes imperiales de dominación, contribuyendo con ello a la lucha decisiva por el porvenir de la Humanidad: la lucha por un mundo sin guerras, donde triunfe la paz indisolublemente vinculada a la justicia social.

19246,Wild Buffalo Appear At Site Of Standing Rock Protest,"Natural Blaze reports: 
After months of similar struggle to protect sacred burial grounds and the Missouri river, opposers of the DAPL were blessed today when a herd of buffalo appeared from nowhere. While mass arrests, macing, and beatings from batons took place, a stampede of bison appeared near the Standing Rock protest camp. Reportedly, a cry of joy erupted from the crowd, as protectors have been praying for help from the American bison (known as Tatanka Oyate) during their standoff with riot police and national guardsmen. 
As UsUncut relays, the Native American culture honors the Tatanka Oyate as a symbol of sacrifice. Its appearance is reportedly being hailed as a gift from the Great Spirit. 
Buffalo are revered as symbols of sacrifice in Native American culture. Indigenous people believe the American bison, which are also known as “Tatanka Oyate” or “Buffalo Nation,” sacrifice themselves in order to supply their meat and their hides for people.",0
19247,Who Shouldn't Eat Soy? | NutritionFacts.org,"Close Transcript Transcript: Who Shouldn’t Eat Soy? 
Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video. 
When the Women’s Health Initiative study found that menopausal women taking hormone replacement therapy suffered “higher rates of breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and overall harm,” a call was made for safer alternatives. Yes, estrogen has positive effects, the Women’s Health Initiative found—such as reducing menopausal symptoms and improving bone health, reducing hip fracture risk; but also negative effects—increasing risk of blood clots in the heart, brain, and lungs, as well as breast cancer. 
So, ideally, to get the best of both worlds, we’d need what’s called a selective estrogen receptor modulator, something that has pro-estrogenic effects in some tissues (like bone), but anti-estrogenic effects in other tissues (like the breast). Drug companies are trying to make them, but phytoestrogens—natural compounds in plants, like genistein in soybeans, that are structurally similar to estrogen—appear to function as natural selective estrogen receptor modulators. How could something that looks like estrogen act as an anti-estrogen? 
The original theory for how soy phytoestrogens control breast cancer growth is that they compete with our own estrogens for binding to the estrogen receptor. As you drip more and more soy compounds on breast cancer cells in a petri dish, less and less actual estrogen is able to bind to them. So, the estrogen-blocking ability of phytoestrogens can help explain their anti -estrogenic effects. But, how do we then explain their pro -estrogenic effects on other tissues, like bone? How can soy have it both ways? 
The mystery was solved when we discovered there are two types of estrogen receptors in the body. And, so, how a target cell responds depends on which type of estrogen receptors they have. This may be “the key to understanding the health-protective potential of soy phytoestrogens”—the existence of this newly discovered estrogen receptor, named estrogen receptor beta, to distinguish it from the classic estrogen receptor alpha. And, unlike our body’s own estrogen, soy phytoestrogens preferentially bind to the beta receptors. 
If you have people eat about a cup of cooked whole soybeans, within about eight hours, genistein levels in the blood reach about 20 to 50 nanomoles—that’s how much is circulating throughout our body, bathing our cells. About half is bound up to proteins in the blood; so, the effective concentration is about half that. So, let’s see what that means for estrogen receptor activation. 
This is the graph that explains the mysterious health benefits of soy foods. Down around the effective levels you’d get eating a cup of soybeans, there’s very little alpha activation—but, lots of beta activation. So, now let’s look at where each of these receptors are located in the human body. 
The way estrogen pills increase the risk of fatal blood clots is by causing the liver to dump out all these extra clotting factors. But, guess what? The human liver only contains alpha estrogen receptors, not beta receptors. And so, maybe, if we ate like 30 cups of soybeans a day, that could be a problem. But, at the kinds of concentrations one would get with just normal soy consumption, no wonder this is a problem with drug estrogens—but not soy phytoestrogens. 
The effects on the uterus appear also to be mediated solely by alpha receptors—which is, presumably, why no negative impact has been seen with soy. So, while estrogen-containing drugs may increase the risk of endometrial cancer up to ten-fold, phytoestrogen-containing foods are associated with significantly less endometrial cancer—in fact, protective effects for these types of gynecological cancers, in general. Women who ate the most soy had 30% less endometrial cancer, and appeared to cut their ovarian cancer risk nearly in half. 
Soy phytoestrogens don’t appear to have any effect on the lining of the uterus, but still can dramatically improve menopausal symptoms. The Kupperman index is like a compilation of all 11 of the most common menopausal symptoms. 
In terms of bone health, human bone cells carry beta estrogen receptors. So, we might expect soy phytoestrogens to be protective. And, indeed, they do seem to significantly increase bone mineral density—consistent with population data suggesting “High consumption of soy products is associated with increased bone mass.” But, can they prevent bone loss over time? 
Soy milk was compared to a transdermal progesterone cream. The control group lost significant bone mineral density in their spine over the two-year study period. But, the progesterone group lost significantly less, and the two glasses of soy milk a day group ended up actually better than when they started. This is probably the most robust study to date, comparing the soy phytoestrogen genistein to a more traditional hormone replacement drug regimen. In the spine, over a year, the placebo group lost bone density, but gained in the phytoestrogen and estrogen groups, and the same with the hip bones. 
The study clearly shows that the soy phytoestrogen prevents bone loss, and enhances new bone formation, in turn producing a net gain of bone mass. But, the only reason we care about bone mass is that we want to prevent fractures. Is soy food consumption associated with lower fracture risk? Yes. A significantly lower risk of bone fracture associated with just a single serving of soy a day—the equivalent of 5 to 7 grams of soy protein, or 20 to 30 milligrams of phytoestrogens. So, that’s just like one cup of soy milk—or, even better, a serving of a whole soy food, like tempeh or edamame, or the beans themselves. 
We don’t have fracture data on soy supplements, though. So, if we seek the types of health benefits we presume Asian populations get from eating whole and traditional soy foods, maybe we should look to eating those, rather than taking unproven protein powders or pills. 
Is there anyone who should avoid soy? Well, some people have soy allergies. A national survey found that only about 1 in 2,000 people report a soy allergy. That’s 40 times less than the most common allergen—dairy milk—and about ten times less than all the other common allergens—like fish, eggs, shellfish, nuts, wheat, or peanuts.

19248,The politics of populism and mudslinging undermines democracy,"The politics of populism and mudslinging undermines democracy By Linda S. Heard Posted on November 8, 2016 by Linda S. Heard 
Our world is on the cusp of a new era. Traditional taboos are being smashed. Respect has become an old-fashioned word. Nothing is too low or too dirty to be ignored, overlooked or even applauded by some. 
The rise of antiestablishment popularism plays to the lowest common denominator and is potentially divisive and corrosive of values held dear for generations. We’ve witnessed how a populist candidate spouting what he imagines the struggling sectors want to hear has not only lowered the tone but has dragged many of his supporters and rivals down to the same level. 
The American political sphere has turned into a swamp of muckraking, hatred of the other and threats of violence to the extent that white supremacist militias are preparing to attack African Americans if their candidate doesn’t make the White House. 
It’s suddenly okay for the son of one to announce the former head of the Ku Klux Klan “desperately needs a bullet in the head.” What happened to judicial process? On the other hand Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton cynically attempted to woo African Americans by appearing on the stage with her new buddies, celebrity black rappers. 
Robert de Niro’s video urging voters not to support Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, adding he would love to punch him in the face went viral. Trump supporters claim they are a ‘movement’ and threaten revolution if he fails to win an election they believe may be ‘rigged.’ Republicans anxious to keep their grip on Congress have threatened to block Clinton’s initiatives at every turn. 
Even the feuding Justice Department and the FBI aren’t exempt from the ire. Both are being hit by accusations of interfering in the political process. The country that’s stood as the greatest example of democracy and the rule of law is gradually embracing the law of the jungle. I’m amazed that most Americans see nothing amiss about their president, his wife and his vice-president spending days stumping for their candidate. Isn’t a US president supposed to represent all Americans? 
There are echoes within the UK where politicians still quarrel over the validity of a referendum over Britain’s exit from the EU. The High Court’s judgment to the effect that the prime minister doesn’t have the authority to take the country out without a parliamentary vote has resulted in media attacks on judges whose reputations were formerly unassailable. I may be wrong but I don’t recall such venom directed at the judiciary throughout my lifetime. 
Tabloid headlines scream “Who do you think you are? “The judges versus the people” and the Daily Mail has gone as far as to post photographs of three judges referring to them as “Enemies of the People,” describing one as being “openly gay.” This is nothing short of an attack on democracy’s checks and balances. 
The High Court has pronounced on a legal point, not on the pros and cons of Brexit. The government has the right to appeal in the Supreme Court but UK Prime Minister Theresa May has indicated she will proceed with triggering Article 50 come what may. 
Charles Falconer writing in The Guardian was right to assert “the judiciary is a vital pillar of our constitution. The government must defend it from these unconscionable attacks—or put all our freedoms at risk.” 
Gina Miller, an activist who lodged the legal challenge is now receiving online death threats! Britons posting on Facebook have called for her “to be shot or hung.” 
Populist leaders tap in to people’s basest instincts. They are not reliant on knowledge of how the world works or of experience but rather on personal charisma and the power of persuasion. They inspire devoted followings blind to their transgressions which gives them a sense of power and infallibility. 
We’ve seen the rise of rank outsiders in the Philippines and Indonesia whose rhetoric and policies defy all norms. 
This ‘anything goes’ trend fuelled by fear and economic grievances is a slippery slope reminiscent of Germany in the early 1930s when Hitler wasn’t viewed as the monster he was but as a saviour from a brutal economic depression resulting in worthless currency and unemployment in the millions. He mesmerised crowds as he vowed to make Germany strong again. Perhaps it’s time that lessons were learnt before there’s no going back.

19249,"‘Rolling Coal’ in Diesel Trucks, to Rebel and Provoke - The New York Times","MONTROSE, Colo.  —   There is a new menace on America’s roads: diesel truck drivers who soup up their engines and remove their emissions controls to “roll coal,” or belch black smoke, at pedestrians, cyclists and unsuspecting Prius drivers. Sgt. Chris Worthington of the Montrose Police Department here is out to stop them. “You can hear those trucks across town, driving like idiots,” he said on a recent Friday evening patrol. He is among the first law enforcement officers in the country to be trained at “smoke school” to pick up the skills to police the coal rollers. He lost sight of one truck cruising in the opposite direction, trailing plumes of smoke. But another, a Ram 3500 fitted with two steel smokestacks, was parked in a Walmart parking lot. The owner, Pryce Hoey, insisted his truck was emissions compliant, but nevertheless agreed to demonstrate its   prowess. “I just wanted something different,” Mr. Hoey said, revving the engine and releasing two black pillars of smoke into the evening air before Sgt. Worthington shut him down. “People who see it giggle. They think it’s funny. ” Depending on whom you ask, rolling coal is a juvenile prank, a health hazard, a stand against rampant environmentalism, a brazen show of American freedom. Coal rollers’ frequent targets: walkers, joggers, cyclists, hybrid and Asian cars and even police officers. A popular bumper sticker reads “Prius Repellent. ” Many document their feats online. Coal rollers also have their own reality TV show. And while official tallies of coal rolling do not exist, there are signs that smoke, whether from intentional belching or not, is a growing public nuisance. In Colorado, complaints over diesel smoke have risen 5 percent over the last two years. In California, complaints about smoking vehicles to the California Air Resources Board have jumped from under 700 a month, on average, two years ago to more than 1, 000 now. State legislatures, as well as local law enforcement agencies, are starting to take action. Last year, New Jersey became the first state to explicitly ban rolling coal, going beyond the federal laws that already prohibit drivers from tinkering with emissions controls. A similar bill is on the table in Illinois, while Colorado and Maryland have defeated proposed bans. New Jersey’s bill, which can impose a fine of up to $5, 000 on drivers caught rolling coal, was proposed by Tim Eustace, a state assemblyman who was engulfed by black smoke from a pickup truck on the New Jersey Turnpike. “Momentarily, you can’t see anything. It’s terrifying,” said Mr. Eustace, who drives an electric vehicle. “It’s exuberant adolescent testosterone. ” But to diesel owners like Corey Blue of Roanoke, Ill. the very efforts to ban coal rolling represent the worst of government overreach and environmental activism. “Your bill will not stop us!” Mr. Blue wrote to Will Guzzardi, a state representative who has proposed a $5, 000 fine on anyone who removes or alters emissions equipment. “Why don’t you go live in Sweden and get the heck out of our country,” Mr. Blue wrote. ” I will continue to roll coal anytime I feel like and fog your stupid  . ” Even in this election year of bombastic rhetoric on political correctness and climate change, rolling coal stands out as an ideological statement. At its core, it also struggles with a basic, somewhat existential question: Should we seek to minimize the human footprint on the earth, or should we flaunt it? Since 2007, activists have drawn attention to the environment with a call to switch off appliances worldwide during an annual Earth Hour. But since 2009, the libertarian Competitive Enterprise Institute has countered with Human Achievement Hour, a call to spend that same hour keeping things on in defense of humankind’s “basic human right to use energy. ” Still, Michelle Minton, a fellow at the institute, draws a line. Coal rollers who use their trucks for harassment, as opposed to celebration, “aren’t being rebellious,” she said, they are just being jerks. Rolling coal has origins in truck pulls, in which pickups compete to pull a heavy sled the farthest. Drivers modify their trucks to pump excessive fuel into the engines, increasing horsepower and torque. Stripped of emissions controls, the trucks also bellow thick, black smoke. At a recent truck pull at the McHenry County Fair in Woodstock, Ill. the fumes were part of the draw. “When the smoke goes black, don’t look back,” read one man’s  . “We pull for bragging rights,” said Scott Vivian, president of the Illini State Pullers league, the event’s organizer. “And smoke’s a big part of it. ” Shane Johnson has named his truck, a Ford   body with a   Duramax engine, Public Enemy. He pulled the sled almost all the way down the dirt track, spewing a column of smoke into the summer sky. “It’s an adrenaline rush,” he said. Still, fans of truck pulling insist  —   and environmental officials largely agree  —   that it is harmless entertainment. When the E. P. A. completed new truck emissions standards this month, it emphasized that it did not intend to go after trucks used in motor sports. There is, in fact, disdain among   enthusiasts toward coal rollers, whom they view as wannabes sullying their sport. “I hate those guys. I used to do it, smoke out friends, but I grew out of it,” Mr. Johnson said. “Gives diesel a bad name. ” Raymond Elick runs the smoke school at the Colorado Health and Environment Department, training police to spot coal rollers. It is more art than science. In Colorado, a bill that would have made rolling coal a misdemeanor died in a G. O. P.  State Senate in April. Still, an obscure Colorado state law, a holdover from the days when diesel was far dirtier, allows officers to cite coal rollers that blow smoke for at least five seconds at more than 40 percent opacity, or thickness. Using a “smoke machine” that burns toluene, Mr. Elick has trained 55 police officers to discern smoke opacity: Zero percent opacity is clear air 100 percent opacity lets no light through. “If it’s smokin’ it’s broken,” Mr. Elick said. “If you see a smoky truck running down the street, that’s probably   percent, and that’s pretty darn smoky,” he said. “If all of the light disappears over that path, if it’s a really bad coal roller, it could be approaching 100 percent. ” A group of Canadian cyclists touring the Vermont countryside in June was on the receiving end of a coal roller’s attention. A white pickup truck accelerated, then belched on the bikers, said John Gelder, a management consultant based in Ottawa. Several minutes later, the truck returned to smoke them out a second time. “What the hell. Can you believe it? ’” Mr. Gelder remembers shouting to his friend Steve Fischer, a Canadian journalist who was touring with him. “It’s like weapons. They think: ‘We’re entitled to our guns, and we’re entitled to our roads,’” Mr. Gelder said. “It’s almost an assault. ” The group alerted the police in Morristown, Vt. who Mr. Gelder said took no action. Andrew Glover of the Morristown Police Department said that officers would probably not pursue the case. “We don’t have a law against whatever they did,” he said. Mr. Fischer later wrote up the group’s ordeal for the Canadian news network CBC. “I gave the driver my middle finger and yelled words I am not allowed to use on the CBC website,” Mr. Fischer reported. “Tuning” passenger vehicles to override emissions controls is relatively easy, with appropriate gear. Online retailers like Amazon and eBay sell aftermarket products that render emissions equipment inoperable. The Volkswagen diesel scandal has helped thrust emissions cheating into the spotlight. The German automaker acknowledged last year that it used a defeat device to evade emissions limits. Up to 11. 5 million of its vehicles worldwide contain the tainted software. The Environmental Protection Agency has also gone after the aftermarket hobbyist market. In 2013, it fined a components manufacturer in Ogden, Utah, $500, 000 for selling devices that let diesel truck owners override emissions controls. Still, it remains easy to modify a truck to bypass pollution controls, said John Voelcker, editor of GreenCarReports. com. “If you have a hacksaw and a cutting torch, and you read the forums, you’re probably halfway there,” he said. Truck owners intent on rolling coal need only to turn to the Discovery Channel reality show “Diesel Brothers” for guidance. The show, which has more than 2. 2 million viewers an episode, follows Heavy D, Diesel Dave and a team of mechanics in Utah who “build the baddest diesel trucks ever seen on the planet. ” Some of the modified trucks are offered for sale with no emissions controls on DieselSellerz. com, a site affiliated with the show. The Diesel Brothers have alarmed health professionals. Even   exposure to diesel smoke can increase the probability of heart attacks, strokes, lung disease and cancer, said Brian Moench, president of the Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment. “You have created a growing business transforming lawful,   vehicles into illegal,  ” trucks, the physicians wrote in a letter to the Diesel Brothers. “To what purpose?” Heavy D, or David Sparks, said through a representative that there was “a misunderstanding on the modification process of trucks on the show. ” The Discovery Channel declined to comment. Anyone who tampers with   equipment violates the Clean Air Act, which prohibits the selling or installing of any component intended to bypass emissions equipment and carries penalties of up to $2, 500. Enforcing that ban on the street is difficult, however. Moves in a handful of states to follow New Jersey’s explicit   prohibition have been opposed by those who argue that a ban would be regulatory overkill. Mr. Guzzardi, the Illinois representative and an avid cyclist, has been pushing a bill that would impose an additional fine of up to $5, 000 for anyone caught coal rolling. “Why should I get a giant blast of smoke in my face from someone who doesn’t approve of my transportation method?” he said. But a bid in Colorado that would have made rolling coal a misdemeanor was defeated in April. “Are we overreaching here?” Mark Scheffel, a Republican state senator, argued in committee. “It’s just kids with too much time and money on their hands. ” Still, some truck lovers say times are changing. Danny Voss drives the Clean Sweep, the only   truck at the McHenry truck pull. His vehicle, a Chevy pickup fitted with a 2012 Duramax engine, is sponsored by Calibrated Power, which makes aftermarket parts that conform with emissions rules. “When a truck like this pulls and you don’t see the smoke, we’re proud of it,” Mr. Voss said. But when Clean Sweep dragged the heavy sled down the track, the crowd was confused. “Where’s the smoke?” one spectator shouted. “The air sucks anyway,” said Ben Poncher, who was drinking a beer next to the track. “Smoke’s pretty. I like seeing it. ”",0

The resolution, the Speaker wrote, “is an assault on history and is deeply offensive to both Christianity and Judaism. The denial of the historicity of the two Jerusalem Temples and the Temple Mount as recounted in both the Old and New Testaments is a terrible indictment of the international community when repeatedly adopted by an important UN body. 
“The outrageous repudiation of the millennia-old bond between Judaism and its holiest shrines in Jerusalem is a blatant attempt to rewrite history,” he added. “The annals of both our religions cannot be erased by raised hands and counted votes.” 
Edelstein said the time has come for the international community to pass a resolution reaffirming Jerusalem as the holy city for the three major monotheistic religions, “a city where the two Temples stood and from which the Word of G-d was first promulgated to humanity by our prophets.”

Last week, the U.S. State Department acknowledged that al-Qaeda-linked terror group Jabhat al-Nusra is not a “priority” for the United States’ efforts in Syria.
One might ask, then: if al-Qaeda in Syria is not a priority for the war on terror, what is?
State Department spokesman John Kirby provided some useful insight into this dilemma, stating:
“The only thing that stands between where we are now and a permanent and enduring ceasefire in Syria is Bashar al-Assad and his supporters . We recognize Al-Nusra as a spoiler, we have concerns about co-mingling, I’ve talked about this ad nauseam.”",0

The Black Is Back Coalition for Social Justice, Peace and Reparations will hold a National Black Political Convention on Self-Determination, November 5 and 6, in Washington, DC. “If you go through history, the fundamental thing that we’ve confronted is the loss of our self-determination as a people,” said Black Is Back chairman Omali Yeshitela . The Coalition has put forward a 19-point position on the need to put self-determination at the center of Black struggles. The 19 points “give us the beginning of some kind of a plan,” said Yeshitela. “It says, specifically, here is our view on self-determination and the subject of reparations, Black women, the question of police invasion and brutality in our community,” and many other issues.

“We are entering a new moment in American history,” said Dr. Anthony Monteiro , the Duboisian scholar and Black Radical Organizing Committee activist. “It is a moment of truth for the ruling class, for the ruling elite. What do they do when they are trumped at home -- forgive the pun -- and trumped internationally?” he asked. “Do they back off of empire, do they readjust, do they become peaceful, or do they up the stakes and attempt to resolve all problems with war abroad and oppression at home?” Dr. Monteiro is one of the planners of a Revolutionary Science for Radical Times conference, in Philadelphia, December 9 and 10.

Despite what the corporate media are telling you, Venezuelans are not starving and the Socialist Party government will not be toppled any time soon.

Corruption, smuggling and money speculation are serious problems, said Caccariello-Maher. However, the strength of the Left lies in the nation’s grassroots organizations and communes. “It would be very difficult for an opposition government to come in and attempt to throw them off their land” or return property to the private sector, he said.

19255,Congress Moves to Overturn Obama-Era Online Privacy Rules - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Congress completed its overturning of the nation’s strongest internet privacy protections for individuals on Tuesday in a victory for telecommunications companies, which can track and sell a customer’s online information with greater ease. In a    vote largely along party lines, House Republicans moved to dismantle rules created by the Federal Communications Commission in October. Those rules, which had been slated to go into effect later this year, had required broadband providers to receive permission before collecting data on a user’s online activities. The action, which follows a similar vote in the Senate last week, will next be brought to President Trump, who is expected to sign the bill into law. A swift repeal may be a prelude to further deregulation of the telecommunications industry. Republicans said President Barack Obama’s appointee to the F. C. C. Tom Wheeler, had created a slew of overbearing rules for broadband providers that would put them at a disadvantage relative to internet companies like Google and Netflix. Those internet companies are not regulated by the F. C. C. but are increasingly in competition with telecom companies for online streaming customers. Lawmakers and Republican regulators at the F. C. C. have said they plan to target the 2015 classification of broadband as a utilitylike service that is strapped with strong regulatory oversight. They are also set to seek the overturning of   net neutrality rules that forbade broadband providers from blocking, slowing down or charging extra for downloads of websites and apps. “What we’ve created is confusion, and this is the way to rein in an agency that was overreaching,” said Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, who introduced the House bill to overturn the privacy rules. She used the Congressional Review Act in a procedure that lets lawmakers scrap regulations recently created by government agencies. Ms. Blackburn said the Federal Trade Commission, which enforces privacy policies created by web companies such as Facebook and Google, was the best agency to oversee broadband privacy. The White House issued a statement just before the House vote expressing support for the overhaul of privacy rules. “The rule departs from the   framework for online privacy administered by the Federal Trade Commission,” the Trump administration said. “This results in rules that apply very different regulatory regimes based on the identity of the online actor. ” Broadband companies immediately celebrated the House vote. They promised they would honor their voluntary privacy policies, noting that violations would be subject to lawsuits. “Today’s vote removing another set of unnecessary regulations is a   for consumers and their privacy,” said Jonathan Spalter, the chief executive of the broadband lobbying group USTelecom. “Online users will continue to have the consistent and strong privacy protections they require and the promise of continued innovation they expect from the internet. ” Democratic lawmakers and regulators protested the vote, saying consumers had few options for   internet service, which meant more government oversight of the companies was needed. Broadband providers have an expansive view into consumers’ online habits, including seeing what sites and apps are visited, which can expose sensitive information. The F. C. C. rules would have given consumers greater power to stop companies from making money off such information, the Democrats said. “The rules gave individuals control over their information when it comes to privacy,” Mignon Clyburn, the sole Democratic F. C. C. commissioner, said in an interview. “The proprietary information these companies have at their disposal should not only be treated with care, but consumers should have a voice. ”",0

19257,Vatican Makes Unprecedented Agreement With Chinese Gov’t,"Vatican Makes Unprecedented Agreement With Chinese Gov’t 11/01/2016 
DAILY CALLER 
The Vatican and Beijing reached an agreement that will elevate the Chinese government above the Church, reports the Wall Street Journal. 
The question of who has the authority to ordain bishops has been at the heart of a decades-old dispute between China and the Vatican. 
The new agreement will give China the power to select bishops with only limited input from the Vatican. Furthermore, the Vatican will stop ordaining bishops for underground churches without the authorization of the Chinese government. While the pope will be acknowledged as the head of the Catholic Church in China, the Chinese government will have the last word on all appointments. The state will be able to pick individuals loyal to Beijing. 
The new deal is likely to help repair ties between the Vatican and the Chinese government, but the full restoration of diplomatic relations is still a long way off. 
The Chinese government and the Vatican have been estranged since the Communist Party of China (CPC) expelled Vatican envoy Antonio Riberi from the country in 1951, banned missionaries, and began oppressing organized religion. Pope Francis has been actively pursuing rapprochement with China. 
China insists on appointing its own bishops, claiming that oversight by the Holy See, the judicial body within the Catholic Church, constitutes unnecessary foreign intervention in Chinese affairs. China also opposes attempts by the Vatican to appoint bishops for underground churches without state authorization. 
In China, all Catholic organizations must register with the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association. The Vatican expressed frustration over the Chinese government’s 2010 appointment of a bishop without Pope Benedict XVI’s approval. The Vatican called the move, one of a number of such occurrences, a “ painful wound ” to the Church. 
The new agreement could thaw relations between Beijing and the Vatican, giving the world’s largest religious organization access to the world’s most populous country. For China, normal interactions with the Vatican could improve its international image, potentially reducing criticisms of China’s human rights record. 
Negotiations for the new agreement reportedly began in April. Having reached an accord, negotiators are waiting for papal approval and a formal decision from the Chinese government. Once the agreement passes, it will mark an unprecedented shift in the Vatican’s interactions with foreign governments. The Vatican would officially accept the appointment of eight bishops, three of which were previously excommunicated. 
Some observers expect members of underground churches in China to protest the accord. 
“If the Vatican should be perceived as abandoning them, it could be seen as a betrayal” and “cause serious divisions in the Chinese Catholic Church,” Richard Madsen, a professor of sociology at the University of California at San Diego, told the WSJ. “The government would probably actually like this. Its action over the years show that it would like to see the church weakened, and a deeper division in the church would help accomplish that,” he added, highlighting his suspicions of Beijing’s intentions. 
China has a documented propensity for dominating and oppressing religion in order to better preserve state power. Christians played an important role in the shift from a dictatorship to a democracy in South Korea, and now there are an estimated 100 million Christians in China. 
Having failed to eradicate religion, the Chinese government, which is officially atheist, set up state-run churches with pastors loyal to China. These churches advocate morality, not scripture, and that the state is superior to religion. 
“We have to remember first of all we are a citizen of this country. We are a citizen of the Kingdom of God, but that comes second,” Pastor Wu Weiqing of the state-owned Haidian Church in Beijing told BBC. He further stated that if Jesus were alive today, he would probably be a member of the Communist Party. While the deal between the Vatican and Beijing could give the Catholic Church greater access to Chinese Christians, it could also give the Chinese government greater control over the Church and organized religion. 
Pope Francis “would not accept any agreement that would harm the integrity of faith of the universal Church,” the Bishop of Hong Kong, Cardinal John Tong argued in July, according to the WSJ. 
The future of the Catholic Church in China remains shrouded in uncertainty. The new agreement between Beijing and the Vatican could be a positive step forward or a dangerous surrender of religious power to political organizations like the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association and the State Administration for Religious Affairs.",0
19258,Hillary Clinton Aide Advised: ‘Dump all those emails’ On Private Server,"Videos Hillary Clinton Aide Advised: ‘Dump all those emails’ On Private Server “Not to sound like Lanny, but we are going to have to dump all those emails so better to do so sooner than later,” says the March 2015 message, labeled as from John Podesta to Cheryl Mills and apparently referencing longtime Clinton confidant Lanny Davis. | November 2, 2016 Be Sociable, Share! 
Hillary Clinton ‘s campaign chairman advised a longtime aide that they were “going to have to dump all those emails” on the day that a report revealed Clinton’s exclusive use of a private email server while secretary of State, according to stolen emails released Tuesday by WikiLeaks. 
“Not to sound like Lanny, but we are going to have to dump all those emails so better to do so sooner than later,” says the March 2015 message, labeled as from John Podesta to Cheryl Mills and apparently referencing longtime Clinton confidant Lanny Davis. “Think you just got your new nick name,” Mills replied. 
Clinton campaign officials have refused to confirm the authenticity of the emails, which are believed to have been stolen from Podesta’s personal account by Russian government hackers. Previously released emails have revealed some advisers were frustrated that Clinton hadn’t made information about the server public sooner. “Why didn’t they get this stuff out like 18 months ago? So crazy,” policy adviser Neera Tanden wrote to Podesta that same evening, March 2, 2015. “Unbelievable,” Podesta replied. Other messages show the Clinton campaign caught unprepared for the New York Times story , published weeks before Clinton launched her bid for the White House. Also on March 2, Podesta asked future campaign manager Robby Mook if he had seen it coming . “Did you have any idea of the depth of this story?” Podesta asked Mook in an email late on the evening. “Nope,” Mook responded after 1 a.m. that night. “We brought up the existence of emails in reserach [sic] this summer but were told that everything was taken care of.” In other messages, Clinton’s aides spent hours debating language for Clinton to use defending and eventually apologizing for her actions.

19260,Ever Meet Someone Who Felt Eerily Familiar? One Man’s Story,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter At one time or another most of us have met someone for the first time and experienced a feeling about that person that’s beyond causal. Somehow, this particular new person generates a reaction within us that sparks our primal instincts beyond the usual associations registered when meeting a new person.   One of the most baffling encounters occurs when meeting a person for the first time and so strongly sensing you’ve known this person before. It’s an uncanny feeling that too often is dismissed as a “past-life connection” or simply being reminded of another person whom you cannot for the life of you recall. It might be an instant dislike or an affinity, even those “love at first sight” moments. Whatever the case, there’s a short-term overwhelm happening while we’re taking their measure, a subconscious reading. Personally, I’ve always been taken aback by these moments, so much so that it can prevent me from being able to react in expected social dialogue. I’m preoccupied, trying to observe what is it that’s so charging me and why. There’s a kind of knowing, a recognition taking place that’s occurring down in the subconscious — or possibly through some astral dimension. Is this experience similar to déjà vu? Cognitive science explains this sensation as a chemical reaction in the brain which floods our senses with a feeling that we’ve lived the moment before. Perhaps something similar is happening upon meeting people who cause this effect? I’m not buying it, however, and here’s why. There have been several times in my life when this sensation occurred, and it was shared mutually with the person whom I had just met. In effect, we’re both having the same feeling that we’ve known each other before, somehow, somewhere. The most vivid example I will share is from a trip to China. I was in a small village in a remote area, walking along a canal with my Chinese hosts. Approaching us was another group, all Chinese, and upon passing each other, this one Chinese gentleman stops and turns; simultaneously, I was doing the exact thing. There we were, facing each other, both of us grinning like school children, with tears forming in our eyes. He spoke no English and I no Mandarin, yet we were both speaking softly to each other. My Chinese guide returned to my side, providing translation: “This man says he knows you. Ask where have you been?” my guide said. Evolve Your Inbox & Stay Conscious Daily Inspiration and all our best content, straight to your inbox. “I feel like I know him too, somehow,” I replied, “Has he ever been to California?” “No, he says he’s never been outside of China,” my guide continued, somewhat perplexed and embarrassed by our exchange. “But I know him,” I protested. “We, we were friends, good friends, but I cannot remember where or when?” “That’s what this fellow just said about you,” my guide lamented, feeling such talk inappropriate. “I know, you didn’t have to translate. I knew what he was saying,” I answered, trying to control my emotions. “This strange person, he says, he says he misses you,” the guide stated, now officially embarrassed. “I miss you too, my old friend,” I said, staring into the man’s eyes. We exchanged business cards, and he bowed to me, and I to him. We shook hands, and then, much to the horror of my guide, this total stranger and I embraced. Somewhere in a cluttered cubbyhole I still have his card, my long lost friend who has slipped back into the ethers. Yet, what I actually want to speak to is something quite different from my warm Chinese anecdote. This is a vastly more unsettling subject — encountering someone who does not read as a human being. By that, I mean there’s something so otherly about the person that, at the visceral level, you can’t ignore your reaction. This might not be a common experience for most people, but among my spiritual colleagues, we’ve spoken of this kind of encounter, so it’s not just me. There are myriad theories as to what’s going on here, the prime one being that these are alien beings from various star systems composed as hybrids of animal, fairy, cyborg, or other essences who live within a human form and have agendas that may be beneficial for or malevolent toward the human race. There’s a plethora of literature on such things readily found in metaphysical bookstores, not to mention online. And the subject matter can range from angels and spirit guides to a complex ontological philosophy that incorporates quantum physics. Yet, the common thread to all of this is the perception that we, meaning us humans, are not alone. And this of course opens the question: What is the agenda of these others — why are they here? This is where the speculation ramps up and the wormholes open. While it can be amusing to think of certain individuals fitting such a description, it’s a serious matter for those who monitor this subject. Movies and books have employed this concept to create various storylines for their plots. I, too, in my books have used this sense that other beings, non-humans, are among us. In Call of the Forbidden Way , an alien threat to colonize our planet is at the core of the drama. But I didn’t come to this idea casually. No, I have always felt an awareness of other beings active on our planet. And I have had my share of encounters with an assortment of folk who, to me, simply didn’t register as authentically human — some far from it. So, while prevailing logic requires me to present such ideas as fiction, I write with much more than a casual what-if attitude on the subject. Perception, be it accurate or not, is how we experience the world. My own perception seems to register that we’re not alone.

19261,Travel: Philip Marsden’s ‘Rising Ground’ and More - The New York Times,"Once there were just nomads, their wanderings no more than necessary for survival. But then came the stockades their successors built and the    settlements in which they huddled  —   and suddenly travel changed, becoming what for most would henceforth be a pursuit more elective than essential. There were many motives for it. Sheer curiosity  —   what’s beyond the fence?  —   came first. Then a need to trade, to inhabit, to conquer, to preach, to take part in a pilgrimage, to migrate and settle anew, to wage a war or to seek refuge. These and any of a thousand other proddings of the sharp stick would send travelers out on the road. Before long, humankind had been whipped into a frenzy of wandering, one that has never let up. And nowadays, with technology and low cost combining to create a perfect storm of wanderlust, we see the results: the vast Lunar New Year crowds at a Chinese railway station, the lethal scrums at the hajj in Mecca, the endless security lines at Heathrow and Kennedy and Sheremetyevo, all vivid testimony to the unanticipated backwash of our pathological desire for ceaseless mobility. And yet just why, fretted Blaise Pascal back in the 17th century, when all of this seemed to get going, why the urge to engage in so much movement? Why all this transnational Brownian motion? Surely all of man’s ills must stem, the philosopher wrote, from his simple inability to remain quiet and alone, serenely in the comfort of his own home. When confronted with this season’s tottering tower of new travel literature, I found it easy to sympathize with poor Pascal. Well over 40 books arrived on my desk, ranging widely in their geographical reach, but most nonetheless possessed of a certain predictability  —   an urgent need to escape here, a frantic need to impress there, a pressing need to inquire and explore and explain what goes on in the faraway. Only a handful could possibly be chosen for a closer look. A small sampling of those that, with profound regret, had to be left by the wayside, may indicate the scale and manic scope of this tarantella of travel writing: A former cult member tries to bicycle around the world. A man with an appetite for fish walks the coast of India, sampling as he goes. A Canadian waitress who swears like a fishwife goes on holiday to Boracay. A man walks, illegally, along the Keystone XL pipeline. Sixteen schoolboys canoe their way from Montreal to the mouth of the Mississippi. An Englishman visits all of the Central Asian “stans”  —   except the most interesting one, Turkmenistan, with its revolving statue of the former president and an ice rink built in the desert. An expatriate Briton writes admiringly about Holland. A Hungarian writes similarly about China. Someone writes a sentence that includes the words “the atopic character of literary space” and supposes it will appeal to a reviewer of travel books. An oenophile goes in search of the finest wines grown in Georgia, not here but in the Caucasus. A Floridian who has visited more than 60 countries tells us about himself. A radio reporter immerses herself in the dubious delights of the Russian city of Chelyabinsk. In the end, I sifted what I thought might be some pearls from the sand. And there’s an irony in my first choice, one Pascal would like, since Philip Marsden’s RISING GROUND: A Search for the Spirit of Place (University of Chicago, $27. 50) doesn’t require the author to venture very far from his home in Cornwall, yielding a travel book that involves little real, physical travel. And yet Marsden’s essays about landscape and history and the habitations and habitants of that mysterious, familiar but deeply unknown fingerlike peninsula at England’s lower   seagirt end are deft and exquisite, filled with the learning of a supremely   man and composed in a lilting, finely chased prose. I immersed myself for hours in the comforting blanket of this book, lulled into fond memories of my own. My very first job as a reporter, based in the gritty   mining northeast of England, once required me to visit Cornwall, but there was no budget and I had to hitchhike and camp out on Bodmin Moor. In a cafe near Liskeard, I met a wandering American student of quite astonishing beauty, and she spent an evening with me under one of the granite tors, a place called the Cheesewring. She cooked for me and played Joni Mitchell songs on her guitar. And then, for fun, she tried to balance a pile of small stones on the grass, intending to echo those that had been piled by nature on the tor. Almost half a century later, Marsden observes a woman at the very same place. She “picked a flattish stone and added it to one of the   cairns, the   that had been put up by recent visitors. The stone kept falling off and she bent down close to position it. Very gently she released her finger and thumb. She held them there for a moment. This time the stone was still. ” If deep and   erudition defines Marsden’s book, learning and assimilated high culture  similarly mark out Andrew Dickson’s wonderfully imaginative WORLDS ELSEWHERE: Journeys Around Shakespeare’s Globe (Holt, $35) which appropriately appears around the 400th anniversary of William Shakespeare’s death. For this, unlike most of the   literary reassessments produced to mark the moment, demands of Dickson many thousands of miles of hard slogging as he seeks to inquire into the playwright’s appeal around the world and to discover the plays being performed with often wild and eccentric enthusiasm in the most improbable places. China is perhaps one of the more predictably bardolatrous countries Dickson visits, where young Chinese (they and their elders raised on the Lambs’ “Tales,” still hugely popular more than a century after they appeared in translation) have become in recent years among the most numerous and raucous fans of the man officially known as Shashibiya. Dickson reminds us that when Wen Jiabao, then China’s premier, came to England in 2011, he flew first to a small airport outside Birmingham and hared off to Stratford to pay homage. He left behind as a gift an edition of “Love’s Labour’s Lost” rendered into putonghua and wrote an elegantly calligraphed paean, “He brings sunshine to your life,’ ’u2009Gives your dreams wings to fly”  —   which, though more Elton John than Li Bai, does suggest a certain fondness. And given that Marx revered Shakespeare, it was for much of China’s recent history an officially approved fondness. So Dickson treks around to experience Shakespeare with Chinese characteristics  —   notably watching an    “Coriolanus” being performed in Beijing, with two local   bands called Suffocated and Miserable Faith playing a noisy continuo. In Shanghai, he meets a once and now again famous Shakespearean actor, Jiao Huang, and watches him weep as he explains why he had not been on the stage for nine years during the 1960s. It was, of course, the time of the Cultural Revolution. “If you were passionate about Western plays, you would be so severely criticized that you couldn’t lift your head. . ’u2008. ’u2008. I lived in a cowshed. I experienced everything. My house was destroyed. ” Such an encounter, which amply repays the price of admission, also transmutes a Shakespeare book (in which Dickson also ventures to Nevada City, Munich, Durban, Kolkata and Gdansk, among other cities) into a true travel book, of the best kind. Of a more traditional kind is WALKING THE NILE (Atlantic Monthly, $26) by Levison Wood. I mean no disrespect for the behatted, bandannaed and   Wood, who was bred by all appearances out of Bear Grylls by Sir Ranulph Fiennes, when I note that, like all too many of the newly empireless British, he has a perverse liking for   epic stunts  —   his other travel book, WALKING THE HIMALAYAS (Little, Brown, $27) comes out almost simultaneously. What elevates this perfectly reasonable   northbound wander through Africa, from the trickle of the river’s source in Rwanda to where it debouches by the grubby gravel of an Egyptian beach, is how Wood deals with the very lowest point of the trip, when one of his party falls desperately ill and dies. He was Matthew Power, a young man from Vermont who had made something of a name for himself as an  adventuresome reporter. Men’s Journal had commissioned him to meet up with Levison Wood (“Captain Wood, I presume?” clearly had to be his first words when they joined forces in the scorching uplands of Uganda) and to walk with him toward South Sudan.   looking yet unused to the extreme heat, Power never made it: “I found Matt hunkered down in the elephant grass,” a plainly frightened Wood writes. “He was sipping from the water pack attached to his rucksack, through a thin tube. There was something almost ghostly about his face: pale, white and flushed red in equal measure. ‘Are you O. K. Matt? ’’u200a” He was dying of hyperthermia. Wood knew the symptoms, had seen them before in Afghanistan. He got out his satellite phone and called  —   for medical advice, for a helicopter, for help. Gunshots were fired in the air. But no one came. One of his companions lit a fire to create a landing zone for a chopper, but lit it in the wrong place, and the   flames swept toward the party and their   charge. They tried to carry him out, but he stopped breathing, his pulse vanished. They took his   body to the top of a hill, wrapped him in a tarp and whispered a prayer. And then, the next day, after the rangers had come and the formalities had been completed in the closest town, Power’s photographer picked up his cellphone and dialed the New York number of Power’s wife. And told her the terrible news about her husband’s death, about what happened to the man who had come out to Africa, as Wood puts it, “so that he could write about me on my indulgent, pointless, selfish trek. ” I was near tears when I read that passage. It cast a shadow over the adventure, from which neither the adventure nor the book’s eventual account ever really recovered. I confess I had an instinctive initial dislike of what seemed to be a truly indulgent, pointless and selfish trek undertaken by a troubled young woman from Texas named Clara Bensen, whose NO BAGGAGE: A Minimalist Tale of Love and Wandering (Running Press, $25) recounts her   adventure traveling from Istanbul to London, quite deliberately baggageless. She had little more than an   cotton sundress, a slim leather purse holding three pairs of underwear, her iPhone and iPad Mini, a pen and notebook and a toothbrush  —   and a    boyfriend named Jeff, whom she had met on the dating site OkCupid and about whom she knew very little, other than that he taught environmental science at a college in Brownsville and had a young daughter, who would stay home with her mother. (Baggage there, of course. Half the point of the book.) Near the start of what turned out to be an absorbing and   tale, Bensen refers to Baudelaire’s admiration for the life of the flâneur, citing the “immense joy” of being able “to be away from home and yet to feel oneself everywhere at home to see the world, to be at the center of the world, and yet to remain hidden from the world. ” And with gusto, courage and a palpable sense of joy, so Bensen goes on to enjoy her brief wander through the southeastern corner of Europe, as far away from Texan certainty as her budget allowed her to go. We learn perhaps a little too much about her feminine plumbing crises en route and the history of her various   mental troubles back home among her evangelically minded family. But she arrives back in Texas with her relationship with Jeff intact and her eyes widened to the wondrous realities of the world. I was happy for her, and I hope she travels once more, returning with another   notebook. Finally, and by deliberate sartorial contrast, there is Rush Loving Jr. ’s THE   HOBO: The Many Wondrous Adventures of a Man Who Loves Trains (Indiana University, $35) which has all too many pictures of the   looking men in business suits who ran, for good or for ill, some of the various railroads with which this former Fortune editor is acquainted. Loving loves trains  —   indeed, some years ago he wrote a book with a title professing just that  —   and he has a stiffly mannered  approach to the delights of   passage, the kind that made E. M. Frimbo so beloved a character of the old New Yorker. His is by no means a good book  —   neither a good bad book nor a bad good book. But for those few of us who are attracted to a sentence that begins, “Then the Golden Arrow took off over the flatlands of the Midwest, highballing for Chicago, passing Crestline at 12:44, Fort Wayne at 2:02 and Valparaiso at 3:54,” it is an essential book. And how much nicer a sentence that is than all that   piffle about the atopic character of literary space, an indigestible confection that deserves to be tossed from one of Loving’s trains, to languish by the wayside forever. But Wait. There’s More. No need for sleuthing.

19264,Russia: No jets have flown over Aleppo for past 9 days,"Russia: No jets have flown over Aleppo for past 9 days By Press TV on October 27, 2016 Russian servicemen prepare a Sukhoi Su-30SM fighter jet before departure on a mission at the Hmeimin military base in Latakia province, western Syria on Dec. 16, 2015. (Photo by AFP) 
Moscow says Russian and Syrian aircraft have not carried out any sorties over Aleppo for nine days in line with their “humanitarian pause.” 
The Russian Defense Ministry responded on Thursday a day after a monitoring group sympathetic to militants claimed that airstrikes had killed at least 26 people in a village in Idlib. 
Russia’s Ambassador to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin challenged the UN and the West to provide evidence of continuing airstrikes in Aleppo. 
Churkin said no aircraft has approached the city at a distance of less than 10 km since a unilateral moratorium was announced by Russia and Syria on October 18 “in response to the UN call, and as a goodwill gesture.” 
“If you have any information that there were any missile and bomb strikes, please provide this information,” Churkin said, adding he expected an “objective analysis” of the current situation. 
Churkin also criticized the UN for failing “to thrash out in a proper way the operation on evacuation of the sick and injured people.” 
“The UN staff members have failed to exert required pressure on patrons of the illegal armed units so that the militants could cooperate with humanitarian workers.” 
The Russian ambassador also hit out at UN aid envoy Stephen O’Brien for bias and arrogance after claiming that Aleppo had become a “kill zone” under Russian and Syrian bombs. 
The US, Britain and France rushed to his defense in one of the stormiest council sessions in weeks after Churkin accused O’Brien of failing to recognize that Russia and Syria had declared a humanitarian pause. 
Churkin criticized the UN official for failing to present the facts objectively while foreign-backed rebels and al-Qaeda-linked terrorists are hampering a UN plan to evacuate the wounded from Aleppo. 
“Please leave this kind of report to a novel that you might write one day,” the Russian ambassador told the UN official. 
In Moscow, Russian Foreign Ministry said Takfiri militants continue to indiscriminately target residential neighborhoods of Aleppo, using makeshift rocket launchers, and preventing civilians from leaving the city’s militant-held east. 
“Aircraft of the Russian aerospace forces and the Syrian air force have not been carrying out any flight closer than the 10-kilometer zone around the city of Aleppo for nine days,” ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. Fighters from the so-called Free Syrian Army fire an anti-aircraft machine gun mounted near the northern Syrian village of Beraan north of Aleppo, Oct. 24, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
Warships won’t join Aleppo campaign 
The Foreign Ministry also dismissed as absurd suggestions from NATO that a new Russian battle group heading to the Mediterranean would join the campaign against terrorists in Aleppo. 
The rebuttal came after NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg warned on Tuesday that the ships could be used to launch more airstrikes. 
Andrei Kelin, a senior Russian Foreign Ministry official, told the RIA news agency that Stoltenberg’s statement was unhelpful. 
“The concerns are not based on anything as our planes have not come near Aleppo for nine days. Our battle group is in the Mediterranean. Our ships have always had a presence there,” said Kelin. 
‘Double standards’ 
Meanwhile, Syria’s Ambassador to the United Nations Bashar al-Ja’afari denounced double standards towards the ongoing conflict in his country. 
Ja’afari lashed out at the US for supporting the so-called moderate militants in eastern Aleppo. He said Takfiri terrorists are now in possession of US-built rockets. Syria’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Bashar al-Ja’afari 
He also slammed Turkey’s aggressive policies toward Syria amid US support, saying it violated the basics of international law. 
Ja’afari said Saudi Arabia – another key ally of the West – is supporting terrorism while Wahhabi muftis are fanning the flames of bloodshed in Syria, Iraq and Yemen through their decrees. 
The entire Syrian population, he said, is suffering from the militancy being sponsored by Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar and Israel. 
Ja’afari called on all members of the UN Security Council to exercise their responsibilities concerning the establishment of security and peace across the globe. 
‘No Russian, Syrian role in fatal Idlib raids’ 
In another development on Thursday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, rejected as “a lie” claims that Russian and Syrian warplanes had conducted fatal air raids in the northwestern province of Idlib. 
She was reacting to reports that 22 children and six teachers were killed in airstrikes that hit a school and nearby areas in Idlib. 
The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group linked to foreign-backed militants in Syria, later claimed “warplanes — either Russian or Syrian — carried out six strikes” in the Idlib village of Hass, where the school is located. 
Zakharova further stressed “the Russian Federation has nothing to do with this terrible tragedy, with this attack,” adding that Moscow has called for an immediate investigation into the incident. 
Commenting on the reports on Idlib airstrikes earlier in the day, Russia’s UN Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said “it’s horrible, horrible. I hope we were not involved.” 
“It’s easy for me to say ‘no’ but I’m a responsible person. I need to see what our Defense Ministry is going to say,” he added.",0
19265,My Canada - The New York Times,"Canada, our No. 1 pick for this year’s 52 Places to Go list, spans millions of square miles. It also contains multitudes, not just of people and locations, but of memories. We asked five Canadian authors to reflect on places that have lodged in their psyches. My mother always kept a bright yellow hard hat in her car, an unexpected accessory for a petite Hong Kong immigrant in her  . She was the senior purchaser for a British Columbia forestry company that, in lean years, laid off everyone in her department except her. (More’s the pity she dreamed of early retirement.) In the meantime, she shuttled between the province’s pulp and paper mills, doing the job of six people, negotiating contracts for hotels, log loaders, harvesters and more. One year, when I was 25, I finally said yes to her persistent invitations to tag along. She wanted me to meet the men and women who earned their living in the mill towns, and who called her by her English name, Matilda. We set out in her car, exploring the    of Vancouver Island, heading for the northern tip, Port Hardy. This would turn out to be the last trip we took together. I remember the wet October chill eagles descending over corridors of evergreens a seemingly endless highway. At twilight, the world took on the shifting depths of an Emily Carr painting. I had to put up with my mother’s terrible driving, and her devotion to Celine Dion. She had to put up with my moods. I was going through a breakup and had decided that, in order to strengthen my moral fiber, I should camp, alone, for three days in the woods. I instructed my mother to drop me off at my campsite, work for a few days in Port Hardy, and then pick me up again. Port Hardy is a microcosm of Canada: a   town with a complex human and environmental history. The archaeological site of the island’s oldest known human habitation (circa 5850 B. C.) the area is the place of origin for the Kwakiutl peoples. The land of the Kwakiutl, whose name translates to “smoke of the world,” was taken into ownership  —   both private and national  —   by gunpoint, dishonored treaties and restrictive and discriminatory laws. The scramble for artifacts and the theft of Kwakiutl art  —   work that was celebrated by Claude   as among the most sophisticated in the world  —   has meant that much of the community’s historical work is housed in museums elsewhere. After 1849, the Kwakiutl population was decimated, but it survives. In 2013, British Columbia was found to have once again breached the Kwakiutl’s 1851 Treaty rights. This is not a history I learned in school. Alone in the woods, I pitched my tent. The dark fell suddenly. I made it five hours before calling my mom, telling her I was afraid, and asking her to come get me. That night, we shared a bed in a small lodging provided by her company. I smelled of the fire I had briefly managed to start. It felt good to lie beside my mother in a place that was complex and old. A little over a year later, my mother died suddenly in a town where she was working, much like this one, on a November night when her heart gave out. It was her   two kind forestry men who, worried about my mother, entered her hotel room in the morning, to find her gone. So peaceful, they told us, as if she were only sleeping. Fourteen years later, I understand better how the smoke of the world is never still. Many of the mills my mother visited have closed, jobs have been lost, and, as of a decade ago, a staggering 75 percent of Vancouver Island’s productive   forest has been logged. It is a place that will tell us much about the balance between jobs and environmental stewardship, about our respect for First Nations treaty rights and our obligations to the land. This is the Canada still to come. Madeleine Thien is the author of “Do Not Say We Have Nothing. ” Grindstone Island is a   dot of green leaves and Victorian gingerbread structures in the middle of Big Rideau Lake, halfway between Kingston and Ottawa.   in the 19th century to make way for its eponymous grindstone quarry, the island later became the summer home of Charles Kingsmill, the first admiral of the Royal Canadian Navy, and served as a genteel hub for Ottawa society life. Kingsmill’s daughter, Diana, who had a lifelong association with pacifist Quakers, took over Grindstone and turned it into a nonviolent resistance education center, staging legendary   games that recreated the infamous Stanford Prison Experiment as a way to train the “prisoners” to fight oppression with noncooperation  —   a practice that ended after a disastrous fake “invasion” by a local biker gang retained for the purpose. I came to Grindstone as a young teenager in the   attending the annual summer camps run by the nonprofit cooperative the Quakers put together to manage the island. The camps’ explicit mission was to train a new generation of activists, another step on the ladder that they had climbed, through trade unionism, farmers’ unions, suffragism and feminism, to antiwar activism. Grindstone was full of kids like me:   babies who attended alternative public schools in Toronto, Kingston and Ottawa, who could rhyme the classic protest chant “   ” with the facility of lifelong practice. Today it sounds hopelessly idealistic. But in the ’80s, Grindstone was a perfect incubator for young activists. With its quiet paths, crisp lake swimming and isolated spots with names like Moonwatcher’s Point, the Grindstone experience was one part lazing around and chatting, one part intense, practical instruction. The Victorian cottages we slept in had once housed the political elites of Ottawa society and their celebrity friends. Now they were ours. I’ve always been an early riser, and it was on Grindstone that I became addicted to sunrises, swimming around the island to catch them on the still lake amid the loon calls, then rushing in a shiver back to my cabin to change for breakfast and morning meeting on the broad, shaded porch of the main lodge. As I graduated out of the summer camps, I became active in the maintenance and management of the island, volunteering in the kitchens and serving on the  ’s board. When the  ’s finances crashed with the   recession, we sold the island to a dentist from Kingston who planned to commute by small pontoon plane. I was devastated. Today, Grindstone is the private home of David Bearman and Jennifer Trant  —   museum technology pioneers who fell in love with the island the first time they saw it, immediately dissolved their successful consultancy and took up residence there, running small conferences for people interested in museums and the web. Five years ago my family and I were their guests. The island felt haunted by the ghosts of the friends I’d made there and the dreams we’d shared. It has been 25 years since I left Grindstone on its final weekend as a social justice education center, and not a week goes by without my yearning for it with a kind of joy and sorrow that is sunk very deep in my heart. I visit it in my dreams, and in the photo feeds from its current owners when I see them at museum conferences, I demand to know all the minutiae of the island’s upkeep, which trees survived the winter storms and what color they’re painting the porch this year. I live in Burbank, Calif. now, and I take my    daughter on hikes in the nearby mountains. Sometimes, when we sit on a trailside boulder and listen to the winds soughing in the trees, I can almost pretend that I’ve brought her back to Grindstone, the place I had always assumed I would raise my own family. Cory Doctorow is the author of the forthcoming novel “Walkaway” and a special adviser to the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The Hawker Siddeley HS 748 is a delightful,   turboprop relic of an airplane, with metal everywhere you expect plastic, made to land on gravel or ice. Nestled in a Hawker, I flew north from Whitehorse, Yukon’s capital city, past 300 miles of moonscape  —   gray craters scarred by the white lines of mining roads that seemed to loop and go nowhere  —   before Dawson City appeared through a hole in the cloud cover. The subarctic town, nicknamed “Paris of the North” during the late   Gold Rush, looked like a strange, solitary incursion on the land. I was there to spend three months living in the childhood home of the Canadian writer Pierre Berton, who had donated the house for this purpose. A volunteer picked me up at the   airport. On the drive through town, we passed a truck with an animal carcass in the bed, antlers poking out past a tarp.   black birds pecked at the exposed edges. “If you leave your moose out, the ravens will get at it,” the volunteer said. The Yukon River divided the town into Dawson proper and West Dawson, a scattered community of   cabins whose inhabitants hauled their own wood, water and propane. I walked down to the river almost every day. It was October, and the black, bottomless water flowed fast toward Alaska. Over the next few weeks, the river changed. First the water took on the faint sheen of an oil slick. Then slivers of ice began to race along the current, catching the light like the heads and bellies of surfacing seals. Then bigger,   chunks of ice formed, audibly colliding and jostling for space until they clustered and   at a bottleneck bend. Finally, one morning in November, I woke to an eerie, noticeable silence. I went down to the river’s beach sheets of ice overlapped where they’d heaved onto the shore, their exposed   resembling massive blocks of turquoise glass. A government employee had drilled into the ice and laid out orange flags indicating where the ice was thick enough to walk safely. I watched a dogsled cross. Because of the snow cover, it wasn’t immediately clear where the ground ended and the river began. As I stepped out, I could hear ice continuing to crack, the sound of trickling water running in open rivulets. Under my feet, I’d been told, ran water deep enough to swallow a truck. This would be a stupid way to die, I thought. Halfway across, I stopped and looked south, toward where the Yukon River met the Klondike River. At this time of year, the sun rose so late and set so early that it circled the horizon in a continuous blaze of orange. Part of the Canadian identity is that we’re a hardy people, thriving in the inhospitable north. It’s one of those myths so ingrained and pervasive that you believe it even if, like me  —   like most  —   you have lived your whole life in cities less than 60 miles north of the American border. For just a moment, my breath clouding around me, icicles forming on my chin, I stood in that mythical Canada. I crossed and hiked triumphantly around West Dawson, which had been inaccessible except by helicopter during the  . The temperature dropped below   degrees Celsius. When I returned to the house, hours later, I peeled off my jeans and saw that my thighs, like my cheeks and nose, were a raw, violent red. Out on the river, I had seen two other people crossing. The first glided past on   skis with a baby strapped to his chest. The second was an acquaintance pulling a sled. “Just picking up my mail!” he called. Kim Fu is the author of the novel “For Today I Am a Boy” and the poetry collection “How Festive the Ambulance. ”  Hans Johann was a capitalist pig farmer, a man who owned the pigs and the farm. His wife was Barbara. They were both German Mennonites. After World War II, both had fled with their families from what was once Prussia to Niagara, which is where, on some acres between the lake and the waterfalls, they stayed and became Mama and Papa, then Oma and Opa. My mother, Linda, was the fourth of Oma and Opa’s seven children, born and christened at such a rate that the family could not afford middle names. Mama made up for this by calling me “Sarah Nicole,” while my father, one of four from the suburbs, has never said anything but “Sarah. ” At home in London, Ontario, I sided with my dad, thinking two names were less smart than one but when we went to the pig farm, my name was turned by thick German tongues into “   . ” This older, extrinsic version of me was the one I liked best. Summers belonged to Niagara. Driving to the farm in a station wagon with no empty seats, we knew we were close when the asphalt turned to dirt and had arrived when the dirt turned to gravel. A long lane,   in birches, led to an ancient Mercedes or two and a big John Deere tractor, a nameless cat curled under the exhaust pipe. In the kitchen, we ate Oma’s bread with havarti cheese and   summer grapes, on which a skim of dust belied a   of gold. What did we need money for? Nothing. Ice cream, maybe, if we wanted it in a cone from Avondale Dairy. Turtles swam with us in the pool, the water cold and unchlorinated under scum, colored the dim vegetative green of fairy tales before they’re Americanized. Oma said her ferns would grow better if we urinated in the soil, and we rolled our eyes but did it, one at a time. I sneaked away to the gully, read my aunt’s ahistorical romance novels. My brother shot a dove with a BB gun. Pigs screamed in the barn. It seemed in those summers impossible that the sun could either burn me or fail to wake me up, that I could ever be sick for more than three days or have an allergy. I was no more friends with nature than I was friends with my kin, yet it seemed that nature and I felt the same way: indifferent to the rules, remote no matter how we were tamed. My grandfather is alive, freshly widowed. Though he no longer capitalizes on much or practices animal husbandry, he lives in the bungalow on the farm and makes and sells peach and grape jam. Everyone thinks they know what peach and grape jam taste like, but I maintain that Opa’s jam can make you forget what a fruit is. Sarah Nicole Prickett is a writer in New York and the founder of Adult Magazine.  A few years ago, I got to pick a small village to stay in for a while and write poetry. I chose the Missisquoi Valley, in the Eastern Townships of Quebec, because I liked what the bay’s First Nations name meant: many aquatic birds. Indeed, I saw birds everywhere: in my dreams, above my head, through the windows. I saw the wind, too, moving across the cornfields. The region also brought me back to my love of New England. When choosing the town I was to stay in, I’d randomly pointed at a little village called Mystic. It was an enticing name. I’d also found a sister city in the United States with the same name, which had a museum with a room dedicated to Herman Melville. When I write, I always let myself be led by coincidence. I quickly started inventing connections between Melville and the Québécois Mystic between me scribbling notes in a rented Cavalier and the trailblazers of real and fictional territory that were the great American writers of the 19th century. I also imagined stories of the devil whirling around in the town’s   barn, and created my own private numerology. I would look for covered bridges on the road, round barns built by utopian Quakers and Victorian houses. I thought about loyalists fleeing north after the Revolutionary War, about Irish Catholics fleeing famine, about all the immigrants who left their mark along the path. I knew that by venturing further, to the shores of the great Lake Memphremagog, I would also think about the Vietnam War deserters who’d found refuge there. I thought about the First Nation Abenakis, how they named the lakes and rivers, and about our ignorance. I began my stay at Pike River, but I understood that this road was one where each stop would lead to another. I walked into the office of tourism in Stanbridge Station, my next stop, and asked a petite historian a thousand questions. She showed me Chemin St.  on the map, which she called the second prettiest road in Quebec. (I never learned where the first was.) I didn’t stay in Mystic. As soon as I caught sight of the old cemetery in Hunter Mills, I became fascinated by the border zone between Quebec and the United States. It represented the state I was in myself: a wandering state of mind, looking for ghosts, mine and others’ looking for my words, my promised land, my house built stone by stone throughout my life. And that is how, having been asked to stay in a small village, I found myself gathering the rosary beads of hamlets strung along the border area. I’m still enamored with the scenery I found there: isolated villages in the shadow of the mountains, whose grandeur lorded over long lakes and rivers farms and cornfields a Mercedes up on four blocks amid the junk strewn in front of an abandoned house old   cemeteries that pop up at every turn leafy trees of maple, walnut, beech, oak, birch a few wayside crosses old churches and train stations and checkpoints and in the morning, at the inn by the river, a little black cat sitting on a tree branch listening to the sound of the falls and the purring coffeepot.

En français: Il y a quelques années, on m’a demandé de séjourner dans un petit village de mon choix afin d’y écrire des poèmes. J’ai choisi la vallée de la Missisquoi dans les cantons de l’est en Québec, parce que j’aimais la signification du nom donné par les Premières Nations à la baie: beaucoup d’oiseaux aquatiques. Déjà, je voyais des oiseaux partout, dans mes rêves, autour de ma tête, derrière les fenêtres. Je voyais aussi le vent bouger à travers les champs de maïs. Cette région me ramenait aussi à mon amour de la  . Afin de choisir le village de mon séjour, j’avais pointé mon doigt sur un petit village appelé Mystic. Ce nom m’attirait. J’avais aussi découvert une ville homonyme aux   où il y avait, dans un musée, une salle dédiée à Melville. Je me laisse toujours guider par les coïncidences pour écrire. J’inventais d’ores et déjà des liens entre Melville et le Mystic québécois entre moi prenant des notes dans une Cavalier louée, et ces défricheurs de territoires réels et fictifs que sont les grands écrivains américains du 19e siècle. J’imaginais aussi des histoires de diable tournant en rond dans la Grange à douze côtés, et créais une numérologie intime à moi. Je chercherais les ponts couverts sur la route, les granges rondes construites par des quakers utopiques, les maisons à façade victorienne je pensais à la fuite des loyalistes vers le nord, aux Irlandais catholiques fuyant la famine, à tous ces immigrants ayant laissé leurs traces sur le chemin. Je savais qu’en m’aventurant plus loin, aux abords du grand lac Memphrémagog, je penserais aussi aux déserteurs de la guerre du Vietnam. Je pensais aux Abénaquis des Premières Nations, qui ont donné les noms aux lacs et aux rivières, à notre ignorance. À   là où mon séjour commençait, j’ai compris cependant que j’étais sur une route où chaque arrêt menait à un autre. Je suis entrée dans le bureau du tourisme, j’ai posé mille questions à une petite historienne de Stanbridge Station. Elle m’a indiqué sur la carte où se trouve Chemin   la deuxième plus belle route du Québec. (Je n’ai pas jamais appris où se situe la première). Et je ne suis pas restée à Mystic: dès que j’ai aperçu le vieux cimetière de Hunter Mills, c’est la zone frontalière entre le Québec et les   qui m’a fascinée. Elle était l’illustration de l’état dans lequel je me trouvais, dans l’esprit de l’errance, à la recherche de fantômes, les miens, ceux des autres à la recherche de mes mots, ma terre promise, ma maison construite pierre après pierre tout au long de ma vie. Et c’est ainsi qu’appelée à séjourner dans un petit village, je me suis retrouvée à ramasser les grains d’un chapelet de hameaux dispersés sur le chemin de la frontière. Le décor que j’y ai trouvé m’enchante toujours: villages enclavés dans l’ombre des montagnes, dont le grandeur veillaient sur les lacs longs et les rivières fermes et champs de maïs une Mercedes sur quatre blocs à travers le débarras devant une maison à l’abandon de vieux cimetières   qui surprennent à chaque détour des arbres feuillus, érables, noyers, êtres, chênes, bouleaux quelques croix de chemin d’anciennes gares et églises, de vieux postes de frontière et le matin, à l’auberge, un petit chat noir perché sur une branche d’arbre écoutant le bruit des chutes et de la cafetière qui ronronne.",0
19266,TPP: Leaked Emails Show Clinton Staff Unsure of Trade Positions In 2015,"Few really believe former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has changed her mind about the virtues of free trade or the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Part of the reason is because, despite Clinton’s rhetoric, some of her closest allies say she is firmly in the corporate camp and a true free trader who supports NAFTA and TPP.
In 2012, Clinton called TPP “ the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.”
On October 8, 2015, Clinton reversed her position and said she no longer supported TPP.
Clinton and her staff pushed back on claims that her reversal was political, but a recently released email from Wikileaks shows Clinton Campaign Manager Robby Mook uncertain about Clinton’s position as recently as March 1, 2015, not even a year before the reversal.
When informed on February 28 by White House Director of the Office of Political Strategy and Outreach David Simas that a bipartisan letter was being drafted by former cabinet officials in support of free trade, Mook responded:
I can’t recall where we landed exactly on trade. Is she going to say she supports it? Regardless of her position, signing a letter feels like poking the bear with labor to me.
Even Clinton’s staff didn’t now what her position was on trade in 2015? How could someone who had been in public life so long not know their own views?
The answer, of course, is that Clinton was likely waiting to see where the polling came out on TPP—a deal that largely resembles the one she helped negotiate as secretary of state. TPP does not poll well, especially among progressive Democrats, whom she was going to have to deal with in the then-future presidential primaries.
The problem for those opposing TPP is not Clinton’s current position, it is whether, as her friends say, she is going to reverse herself again if she becomes president and sign TPP into law.

19267,Comment on 7 Effective Ways To Balance Hormones Naturally by Eat Your Way to Balanced Hormones! - NeilMD.com,"Poor gut health and food allergies: More research is linking gut health to hormone regulation . Obesity Inflammation as a result of poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle Genetic susceptibility Toxicity in the form of exposure to pesticides, toxins, viruses, cigarettes, excessive alcohol, and harmful chemicals Excessive amounts of stress, as well as a lack of rest Natural Treatments For Hormonal Imbalances 1. Consume Healthy Fats Your body requires different types of fats — including saturated fat and cholesterol — to create hormones that help keep inflammation levels low, boost metabolism, and promote weight loss. Coconut oil and avocado are great sources. 2. Incorporate Healing Herbs Adaptogen herbs are a class of healing plants that work to promote hormone balance and fight off various diseases. Research has found that various adapotogens can improve thyroid function , reduce anxiety and depression , support adrenal gland functions , and more. Keep Evolving Your Consciousness Inspiration and all our best content, straight to your inbox. 3. Improve Your Gut Health Taking care of the gut is becoming of increasing concern, especially since it’s been found to cause autoimmune reactions, including arthritis and thyroid disorders . Many things contribute to an unhealthy gut, including: Antibiotics and medications like birth control Diets high in refined carbohydrates, sugar, and processed foods Diets low in fermentable fibers Dietary toxins such as industrial seed oils Chronic stress Chronic infections 4. Avoid Conventional Body Care Products Many commercial products are laden with potentially-harmful chemicals including: DEA, parabens, propylene glycol, and sodium lauryl sulfate. Instead, do your research and find natural products made with essential oils, coconut oil, shea butter, and castor oil. 5. Exercise Regularly (Especially Interval Training) High intensity interval training (HIIT) has been popularized in recent years for its ability to quickly and efficiently get and keep the body in shape, but the University of Notre Dame Medical School in Sydney also discovered that : “HIT is associated with increased patient compliance and improved cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes and is suitable for implementation in both healthy and ‘at risk’ populations.” 6 . Sleep More, Stress Less Seems easier said than done, right? But not getting enough sleep can mess with your hormone schedule. Cortisol, for example, is the primary stress hormone, and is regulated at midnight. If people go to bed late, they never find relief from their sympathetic flight/fight stress response. One report published in the Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism found that : “Stress can lead to changes in the serum level of many hormones including glucocorticoids, catecholamines, growth hormone and prolactin.” 7. Limit Your Caffeine And Alcohol Consumption Caffeine can stay in your system for up to six hours, and the chemical can affect the central nervous system, raising your heart rate, increasing alertness, and altering the way your brain produces hormones. We’ve come to accept synthetic treatments as our first step toward bettering our health, but what’s even more important is understanding your condition, what causes it, and taking holistic approaches before succumbing to anything else.

19268,Elder President George Bush Is Hospitalized in Houston - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Former President George Bush, the 41st president, was in stable condition at a Houston hospital on Wednesday after doctors performed a procedure to clear his airway, his spokesman said. His wife, Barbara Bush, was also admitted to the medical center, Houston Methodist Hospital, on Wednesday morning “as a precaution after experiencing fatigue and coughing,” the spokesman, Jim McGrath, said in a statement. Mr. Bush, 92, was suffering from an acute respiratory problem stemming from pneumonia when he was admitted to the intensive care unit at the hospital. After initial reports of Mr. Bush’s hospitalization, his office said he was expected to return home by the weekend. Mr. Bush, who served as vice president from   and president from   refused to support Donald J. Trump for president in last year’s election and had already declined to attend Friday’s inauguration, citing health concerns. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, daughter of Robert F. Kennedy, said last fall that the former president had told her that he planned to vote for Hillary Clinton. His son, former President George W. Bush, and his wife, Laura, have announced that they plan to attend the inauguration, although former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, who lost the Republican nomination to Mr. Trump, does not intend to be there. Also scheduled to be on hand are Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton, as well as former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn.",0
19269,Online Trail Illuminates Baton Rouge Gunman’s Path to Violence - The New York Times,"BATON ROUGE, La.  —   He joined the Marines, served in Iraq and earned a Good Conduct Medal. He was an entrepreneur, a   author, a nutrition and fitness counselor, a proponent of the American gospel of  . He considered himself a lifestyle coach, even though he had failed in marriage, neglected to pay his taxes and was, at one point, living on $500 per month. He had also embarked on a spiritual quest to find his roots as a black man, traveling around Africa for two years. But Gavin Long’s life also became a web of paranoid ideas, a professed allegiance to an antigovernment “sovereign citizen” group and a belief that bloodshed was a better tool than peaceful protest in the fight against oppression. On Sunday, Mr. Long died in a parking lot just off a commercial street here in a shootout with the police. It was his 29th birthday. He killed three law enforcement officers and wounded three others. On Monday, law enforcement officials said Mr. Long had targeted officers, though his motives otherwise remained murky. Mr. Long had been a resident of Kansas City, Mo. and it is unclear what he was doing in Baton Rouge, though a video that appears to have been posted by him shows him in the Louisiana capital discussing the July 5 fatal police shooting of a fellow   man, Alton B. Sterling, here. Though the police here have released little information about Mr. Long, a deeper portrait is beginning to emerge, based on a large trail left online. Many of these digital bread crumbs  —   web posts, YouTube videos and podcasts  —   are tied to Mr. Long’s given name, or some version of a new name, Cosmo Ausar Setepenra, which he filed court documents in Missouri to adopt in May 2015. (He never petitioned the court, so the name change was not legally binding, officials said.) Some of these posts and videos included biographical and personal information that aligned with the information released by the authorities. In an interview with a podcast host in March, Mr. Long identified himself as a member of the online community of   targeted individuals, people who believe they are being harassed with   weapons and by armies of stalkers. And in one YouTube video, he discusses the killings of   men at the hands of police officers, including the death of Mr. Sterling, and advocates a bloody response instead of the protests that followed the deaths. “One hundred percent of revolutions, of victims fighting their oppressors,” Mr. Long said, “have been successful through fighting back, through bloodshed. Zero have been successful just over simply protesting. ” “You’ve got to stand on your rights, just like George Washington did, just like the other white rebels they celebrate and salute did,” he added. “That’s what Nat Turner did. That’s what Malcolm did. ” In Baton Rouge on Monday, the crime scene along Airline Highway was returning to normal. Bullet holes could be seen in a wall of the Hair Crown Beauty Supply store, where the shooting took place. The city had begun the process of mourning the police officers Mr. Long gunned down  —   including Montrell Jackson, 32, an   and   veteran of the Baton Rouge Police Department, who left behind a wife and son. On a podcast posted on iTunes and dated April, the speaker, who gives his name as Cosmo, gives a sketch of his life story. He says he grew up in Kansas City, and was a   student until about middle school, when he became fat and started getting C’s. As a child, he was something of a hustler who made extra money by making loans and charging interest. “Say if I loaned out money to my family, even to my mother, I would make her pay me back, with interest,” he says. “If I loaned $20, I would make you pay me back $5 on Friday. ” He says he lost significant weight in high school, bought his first car at age 16 and joined the Marines. Mr. Long’s military records show he served from 2005 to 2010, including a   deployment in Iraq. He was a sergeant and a data network specialist who earned several awards, including one for good conduct. He was also assigned to Okinawa, Japan, and several locations in Southern California. He attended Central Texas College at its Marine Corps Air Station Miramar site in San Diego and via distance education, earning an associate of arts degree. In 2011, court records show, he had an uncontested divorce from a woman named Aireyona Osha Hill. They listed that they had no children or assets and that Mr. Long earned $500 a month. Around this time, Mr. Long befriended a Kansas City schoolteacher who wished to remain anonymous because of the heinous nature of the shootings. The teacher said Mr. Long had taken interest in the Occupy Wall Street movement and   culture, and sympathized with the views of the villain Bane, from the 2012 Batman film “The Dark Knight Rises”  —   particularly Bane’s vigilantism against corruption. But the man the teacher knew never spoke about violent solutions to the real world’s problems. “I’m surprised he took it as far as he did,” the teacher said Monday. “It doesn’t surprise me so much as he had an agenda against the government. He’d always talk about how the government was corrupt. ” By 2012, Mr. Long had moved  —   briefly, apparently  —   to Tuscaloosa, Ala. where he spent one semester at the University of Alabama. He majored in business. He made the dean’s list. The University of Alabama police had no interactions with him during his time there. Mike Mansur, a spokesman for the Jackson County prosecutor’s office, which covers most of Kansas City, said his office also had no record of contact with Mr. Long. He also attended Clark Atlanta University during the   school year, and was in good academic standing, a university spokeswoman said. Although he claimed to be on the dean’s list there, he said he had dropped out, sold his two cars, gave away his possessions and traveled to Africa. Mr. Long appeared to be obsessed with the idea of   for himself and for others, and he embraced more esoteric means of achieving those goals. While traveling to Burkina Faso, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, he said, he wrote three books, covering topics like “holistic detoxification for health,   and success” the “ancient esoteric secrets of the Pineal Gland” and the “124 Universal Laws and their use in the Laws of the Cosmos. ” In 2015, Mr. Long filed the petition to change his name. In his statement of intent, he said he was a member of an “indigenous society” called the United Washitaw De Dugdahmoundyah Mu’ur nation. It was apparently a reference to the Empire Washitaw De Dugdahmoundyah. On its website, the group says it is “a multicultural, highly spiritual nation of aboriginal, indigenous Americans. ” The group is largely   and subscribes to a “sovereign citizen” ideology holding that members are “no longer beholden to any form of government,” said Ryan Lenz, a senior writer for the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist groups. On Monday morning, a man who answered a phone number on the website and said he was a leader of the group, Fredrix Joe Washington, said he had never heard of Mr. Long. “We are about peace  —   and especially not about going out and killing some police officers,” said Mr. Washington, 71. This year, court records show, a case was filed against Mr. Long for not paying his local earnings tax. Papers in that case were served on his address last month, and his mother accepted them, according to court records. Six days later, the tax case was dismissed. In many of his podcasts, Mr. Long expounds at length on dating and   tips for men, arguing that they must display the characteristics of an “alpha” male. But a number of his other online offerings discuss the historical oppression of minorities, and America’s current racial problems. In a recent email he sent out to those interested in his ideas, he listed numerous instances of massacres of   people. On July 8, Lance Scurvin, a podcast host in Orlando, Fla. posted a note from Mr. Long on his Facebook page that seemed to suggest that Mr. Long was feeling paranoid about his safety. Mr. Scurvin, who is known for lending a sympathetic ear to   guests, had interviewed Mr. Long in the past. “I just want everyone to know that if anything may happen to me or with me, I am NOT affiliated with anybody, any group, nationality, association, religion, corporation, business, etc. ” the note said. Mr. Long traveled to Dallas after the killing of five police officers at a demonstration there on July 7. Chanattra Long, who is not related to Mr. Long, said he had come into her shop, the His and Hers Barber Shop, two days after that shooting and passed out copies of his book. “He pulled out a wad of money and said: ‘You think this is something? This is nothing,’” she recalled. She said he had spoken of being in Africa and of being able to speak five languages. She was startled at his boldness and assertiveness. She had never seen him before and had no idea why he entered her shop that day. “I could tell he wasn’t right, his demeanor, his aggressiveness,” she said. Still, Mr. Long made no mention of attacking police, she said. One of Mr. Long’s last videos, posted to YouTube but taken down as of Monday, shows him driving around Baton Rouge. He approaches a number of   strangers apparently, and doles out stray nuggets of advice and wisdom, deploying the salty language of the street. He refers to himself as a life coach, a freedom strategist, a real estate entrepreneur, an author, a teacher and a motivational speaker. And he tells them about his book. “I want my people to succeed,” he says at one point. Later, he refers to “Arabs” and “Indians” who do not care about people, ostensibly   except when the latter give them their money. At one point he uses the word “cracker,” apparently in reference to whites. He also makes a passing reference to the shooting of Mr. Sterling. “It’s two parts to freedom, bruh,” he says. “Knowing your rights and standing on your rights. They know we know our rights. ” But how many black people, he asked, stand on their rights? “And if you not standing on your rights then you have no rights. ”",0
19270,Peaceful Protests Follow Minnesota Governor’s Call for Calm - The New York Times,"ST. PAUL  —   Demonstrators angered by the fatal police shooting of a black man during a suburban traffic stop kept vigil outside the governor’s mansion here Friday as officials urged calm and more details emerged about the officer who fired the shots. Officer Jeronimo Yanez, who was placed on administrative leave after the killing on Wednesday night of the driver, Philando Castile, was a member of the St. Anthony police for four years. He had earned a bachelor’s degree in law enforcement in 2010 and was honored by his college as a top student. In the years since graduating, he had posted online about a wedding and the birth of a child and settled into a suburban neighborhood. “He always wanted to dig deeper  —   what if this happened, or that happened,” said Christian Dobratz, one of Officer Yanez’s professors at Minnesota State University, Mankato. “I knew he was very big on wanting to work with others and serving a community,” he added. But even as Officer Yanez’s background became clearer, the specifics of the shooting that left Mr. Castile dead remained murky. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which is investigating, has said little about why Officer Yanez and a colleague pulled Mr. Castile over on a stretch of suburban road near the state fairgrounds, or what led to the shooting. Much of what is known comes from a Facebook Live video by Mr. Castile’s girlfriend showing the emotional, gruesome aftermath. As that footage went viral online, protests have continued almost nonstop in St. Paul and the surrounding area, with activists calling for charges against Officer Yanez and a separate, federal investigation. In Falcon Heights, the suburb where Mr. Castile was shot, a group of university students and employees marched to the shooting scene to pay tribute Friday afternoon. And at the governor’s residence in a residential area of St. Paul, demonstrators continued to mingle outside the gates. The protests have been large, spirited and almost entirely peaceful, though one person was arrested and a police car was damaged early Friday near Gov. Mark Dayton’s home when demonstrations turned tense. So far, Justice Department officials have said they were monitoring the state investigation, but have not announced their own inquiry. John J. Choi, the prosecutor in Ramsey County, said he had urged the state agency investigating to be prompt and thorough, but did not offer a timeline on when a charging decision might be made. Mr. Choi, whose office will decide whether to bring charges, said he was unsure whether he would present the evidence to a grand jury or make the charging decision himself. Mr. Choi historically has used grand juries in police shooting cases and said he saw benefits in doing so, but that he would consider whether that was the right approach for Mr. Castile’s case. “I just need a little time and thought put into it,” Mr. Choi said at a news conference at his downtown office. “I think this is a very extraordinary case. ” If Mr. Choi opts to decide on charges himself, rather than presenting the case to grand jurors, he would be following his colleague in neighboring Hennepin County, which includes Minneapolis. The prosecutor there, who also had long used grand juries for police shootings, changed his policy and decided himself to not charge the Minneapolis officers involved in last year’s fatal shooting of Jamar Clark, another case that prompted widespread protests in this area. Governor Dayton, a Democrat, who angered some in law enforcement Thursday by saying he thought Mr. Castile probably would not have been shot if he were white, said Friday that he was standing by those comments. Mr. Dayton, who has at times mingled with the protesters outside his home, said he appreciated the demonstrators’ peaceful tone. On Friday, he said he planned to meet with   pastors and civic leaders in the coming days, and called for people to “react nonviolently. ” “I make an appeal to everyone in Minnesota for calm, for understanding of this difficult time and the need for calm and nonviolence,” said Mr. Dayton, who also spoke of a shooting in Minneapolis on Friday that left a toddler dead. “We’ll get through this terrible time here in Minnesota if we can all recognize that and not take any actions that are going to exacerbate a very difficult situation. ”",0

by Kevin Barrett , Veterans Today Editor 
Thanks to members of the Social Justice Committee of the Berkeley Fellowship of Unitarian Universalists, a large and enthusiastic crowd turned out for my talk on “Recent False Flags” yesterday. It was a triumph of free speech in the city that gave the world the Free Speech Movement. 
But unlike last year’s talk (watch it here ) this one wasn’t held at BFUU. 
Why not? One member of the BFUU Social Justice Community, a certain Holly Harwood, demanded that my scheduled event be canceled because (she libelously claimed) I am a “Jew hater” and “homophobe.” 
Not one member of the Social Justice Committee supported her. 
So Holly Harwood started inundating the BFUU Board with lies and distortions about me and my books. The Board, which apparently includes some “stealth Zionists” who got themselves elected by concealing their pro-Israel loyalties, went along with her. 
Harwood’s vicious vilification campaign only succeeded in increasing the turnout for my talk, which was held at Redwood Gardens instead of BFUU. But Harwood didn’t get the message. Now she has managed to censor another Berkeley free speech institution: Bonnie Faulkner’s legendary Guns and Butter radio show. 
Today’s broadcast, which goes out on KPFA Berkeley and other Pacifica stations, features most of an interview Bonnie recorded with me last week. Unfortunately, after more mendacious complaints from Holly Harwood, Bonnie was apparently forced to cut the final six minutes of the interview, which features me explaining how and why I was banned at BFUU. Here is the censored “Guns and Butter” segment (please spread it far and wide so the censorship backfires): 
The last place on earth I would ever expect ANY censorship of ANYTHING is Berkeley, California. And the last two places in Berkeley I would EVER expect to be censored are the Unitarian Church and the Guns and Butter radio show!

David Kimball, who runs Sacramento 9/11 Truth, has sponsored and/or helped publicize all of my previous talks in the area. Yet this time he wouldn’t return my repeated phone calls. Finally, weeks after I had started calling him, I got this email:

Hi Kevin. 
I’ve received your phone messages and email, and my apologies for this late response. 
In recent years I’ve continued to research 9/11 more thoroughly, and although you and I are still in agreement that the “official narrative” of 9/11 cannot be true and that the media perpetuates the Big Lie, my views about 9/11 are no longer in agreement with yours. 
Therefore, I cannot in good conscience promote your upcoming speaking event.

19277,MIT Technology Review: Google’s A.I. ’Hate Speech’ Detector ’Erratic’ - Breitbart,"The MIT Technology Review recently published an article demonstrating that Google’s new comment detection system, Perspective, seems to have difficulty differentiating offensive words or controversial subjects from actual hate speech. [Breitbart previously reported on the “hate speech” detection software, designed to help online publications clear their article comment sections of any offensive content that could potentially be applied to other Internet platforms. The MIT Technology Review decided to test the accuracy of the software, which analyzes comments on a scale of   for “toxicity. ” Toxic comments are defined by the program as “a rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comment that is likely to make you leave a discussion. ”  “Trump sucks” scored a colossal 96 percent, yet   codeword “ ” only scored 5 percent. “Few Muslims are a terrorist threat” was 79 percent toxic, while “race war now” scored 24 percent. “Hitler was an  ” scored 70 percent, but “Hitler was not an  ” scored only 53% and “The Holocaust never happened” scored only 21%. And while “gas the joos” scored 29 percent, rephrasing it to “Please gas the joos. Thank you. ” lowered the score to a mere 7 percent. (“Jews are human,” however, scores 72 percent. “Jews are not human”? 64 percent.) The MIT Technology Review believes the system is designed to detect particular words and phrases in a sentence that may be deemed offensive but does not account for the meaning behind these words. In an example, the word “rape” scored a toxicity rating as high as 77 percent when detected by the program, but a statement such as “rape is a horrible crime” actually rated higher at 81 percent. Curse words receive similar treatment: “I fucking love this” was rated at a 94 percent on the toxicity scale, which is supposed to indicate if a comment is “rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable. ” We may say “Trolls are stupid” (toxicity score 96 percent) but the language of toxicity and harassment is often rich in ways that   systems can’t handle. The comment “You should be made into a lamp,” an allusion to claims that skin from concentration camp victims was used for lampshades, has been thrown at a number of journalists and other public figures in recent months. It scores just 4 percent on Perspective. But best not reply by saying “You are a Nazi,” because that’s an 87 percent. Read the full article by MIT Technology Review here.

19279,HALLOWEEN TREAT: How Many Pumpkins Will A 50 BMG Shoot Through?,"0 comments It is meant to be fun, but this video actually reveals quite a bit about 50 BMG ballistics. Surprisingly, the Internet is blowing up about our hero’s political hat, as well. Happy Halloween! The .50 Browning Machine Gun, or 50 BMG, is simply terrifying. The 12/7 X 99 MM NATO cartridge was developed in the late 1910’s, and has been manufactured in a number of variants: regular ball, armor piercing, tracer, incendiary, or even saboted sub-caliber rounds. Some rifles, like the one in this video, use magazines, while machine guns often use metallic links. The round is based on a scaled-up .30-06 cartridge and the ballistics are completely insane! Snipers can fire at long ranges, more than a mile away, and avoid contact with the enemy by changing positions on retreating before they are discovered. Modern 50 BMG rounds can produce between 10,000 and 15,000 foot pounds of energy while suffering from less drift from cross-winds than smaller, lighter projectiles. Originally, John Browning intended for this round to be used in World War I anti-aircraft weapons. Armor-piercing incendiary variants were proven to be effective not only against aircraft, but also structures, concrete bunkers, and some armored vehicles. There are a number of military and law enforcement applications for the 50 BMG round. The US Coast Guard uses it to disable boat engines, often firing from a helicopter. Similarly, police departments use the round to disable vehicles by firing it into the engine block. As mentioned earlier, military snipers have used the round for some time, with Marine Carlos Hathcock recording a successful shot at 2,286 yards! The longest confirmed kill with a 50 BMG has been credited to Canadian Army Corporal Rob Furlong, who shot a combatant in Afghanistan at 2,657 yards in 2002. So, the 50 BMG is effective in a number of ways. Many consider it to be effective at creating massive amounts of fun. No doubt, firing this awesome round through a big pile of pumpkins qualifies. Enjoy, and Happy Halloween!",0
19280,Roman Polanski Extradition Request Rejected by Poland’s Supreme Court - The New York Times,"WARSAW  —   The Polish Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a government request to extradite Roman Polanski, the   filmmaker, to the United States over a   conviction for having sex with a    girl. The decision almost certainly ends the legal battle in Poland over how to deal with Mr. Polanski, although as a practical matter, even a ruling in favor of the government would have had little effect. Mr. Polanski, a dual citizen of France and Poland, lives in France, which does not extradite its citizens. Judge Michal Laskowski ruled that a lower court’s verdict was not a “flagrant violation of the law,” as the request for an appeal had claimed. “The regional court of Krakow considered and verified all evidence exceptionally carefully,” Judge Laskowski said. The legal effort reflects a broader push by the conservative Law and Justice government, which since coming to power a year ago has been calling for a return to Roman Catholic values in Poland, to try to reinforce its reputation as a    party. The ruling on Tuesday came six months after the chief prosecutor and justice minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, asked the court to overrule the earlier verdict as the government sought to extradite Mr. Polanski, whom authorities in the United States have wanted for decades. A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said that Mr. Ziobro “accepts and respects” the Supreme Court’s decision, although he still “takes the position that proceedings concerning sexual abuse of minors should be enforced consistently” regardless of who committed the crime, or when it occurred. Mr. Polanski was arrested in 1977 on charges that included the rape of the teenager at the Los Angeles home of Jack Nicholson, the actor. In 1978, Mr. Polanski left the United States on the eve of sentencing under an agreement by which he was to plead guilty to a count of statutory rape. In October 2015, a judge in Krakow, Poland, ruled that turning over Mr. Polanski would be an “obviously unlawful” deprivation of liberty, saying that the State of California, where he was convicted, was unlikely to conduct a fair trial and provide humane conditions of confinement for the director, who was 82 at the time. The Krakow prosecutor’s office, which had sought Mr. Polanski’s extradition on behalf of Los Angeles County, said a month later that it would abide by the judge’s ruling. But Mr. Ziobro appealed the decision to the Supreme Court at the end of May, calling the trial judge’s ruling “incomprehensible” and a “serious breach” of the extradition agreement between Poland and the United States. Mr. Ziobro said in an interview with Polish state radio in May that Mr. Polanski had received preferential treatment because of his fame. “If he was just a regular guy, a teacher, doctor, plumber, decorator, then I’m confident that he’d have been deported from any country to the U. S. a long time ago,” he said. In his opening statement on Tuesday, Jan Olszewski, a lawyer for Mr. Polanski, recalled how the Swiss authorities had declined in 2010 to extradite Mr. Polanski, who directed “Chinatown,” because of doubts over the conduct of the judge in his original trial. Jerzy Stachowicz, another lawyer for Mr. Polanski, argued in court that his client had not technically fled the United States because he had never been prohibited from leaving. “Mr. Polanski didn’t flee, as it is believed,” Mr. Stachowicz said. “He simply bought a plane ticket, checked in his luggage and boarded a plane. It was not fleeing. ” Referring to Mr. Ziobro’s argument, Mr. Stachowicz said, “If Mr. Polanski were not a celebrity, a famous filmmaker, but he was an average Joe, this case would have been over long ago, and nobody would have ever heard of it. ” The Supreme Court ruling means that Mr. Polanski, now 83, would be free to work in Poland. He has been planning to make a film about Alfred Dreyfus, a French Jew who was wrongly accused of spying and whose case raised a debate in the late 19th century about prosecutorial misconduct. The film, “An Officer and a Spy,” was to be shot in Poland, but it was announced in June that Mr. Polanski had decided to make it in France. That prompted speculation that his legal problems had led him to move production of the film, but Robert Benmussa, the film’s producer, attributed the decision to French tax incentives, according to The Los Angeles Times. Mr. Polanski, who lives with his wife in France, was not in court on Tuesday. “This is just too emotional for him,” Mr. Stachowicz said by telephone on Monday, before the ruling. “This has been going on for such a long time. A ruling against overruling the first verdict would be a great relief for him. ” After the ruling, Mr. Olszewski, the lawyer, said that he had spoken with Mr. Polanski on the phone. “He is currently in France, where he is shooting his new film,” Mr. Olszewski said. “He is beyond happy that this is finally over. At least in Poland. ”",0
19281,It Was the Rise of the Davos Class That Sealed Americas Fate       :," It Was the Rise of the Davos Class That Sealed Americas Fate
Hillary Clintons embrace of neoliberalism was disastrous. The only answer now is to take on the billionaires
By Naomi Klein
November 10, 2016 "" Information Clearing House "" - "" The Guardian "" - They will blame James Comey and the FBI. They will blame voter suppression and racism. They will blame Bernie or bust and misogyny. They will blame third parties and independent candidates. They will blame the corporate media for giving him the platform, social media for being a bullhorn, and WikiLeaks for airing the laundry.
But this leaves out the force most responsible for creating the nightmare in which we now find ourselves wide awake: neoliberalism. That worldview  fully embodied by Hillary Clinton and her machine  is no match for Trump-style extremism. The decision to run one against the other is what sealed our fate. If we learn nothing else, can we please learn from that mistake?
Here is what we need to understand: a hell of a lot of people are in pain. Under neoliberal policies of deregulation, privatisation, austerity and corporate trade, their living standards have declined precipitously. They have lost jobs. They have lost pensions. They have lost much of the safety net that used to make these losses less frightening. They see a future for their kids even worse than their precarious present.
At the same time, they have witnessed the rise of the Davos class, a hyper-connected network of banking and tech billionaires, elected leaders who are awfully cosy with those interests, and Hollywood celebrities who make the whole thing seem unbearably glamorous. Success is a party to which they were not invited, and they know in their hearts that this rising wealth and power is somehow directly connected to their growing debts and powerlessness.
For the people who saw security and status as their birthright  and that means white men most of all  these losses are unbearable.
Donald Trump speaks directly to that pain. The Brexit campaign spoke to that pain. So do all of the rising far-right parties in Europe. They answer it with nostalgic nationalism and anger at remote economic bureaucracies  whether Washington, the North American free trade agreement the World Trade Organisation or the EU. And of course, they answer it by bashing immigrants and people of colour, vilifying Muslims, and degrading women. Elite neoliberalism has nothing to offer that pain, because neoliberalism unleashed the Davos class. People such as Hillary and Bill Clinton are the toast of the Davos party. In truth, they threw the party.
Trumps message was: All is hell. Clinton answered: All is well. But its not well  far from it.
Neo-fascist responses to rampant insecurity and inequality are not going to go away. But what we know from the 1930s is that what it takes to do battle with fascism is a real left. A good chunk of Trumps support could be peeled away if there were a genuine redistributive agenda on the table. An agenda to take on the billionaire class with more than rhetoric, and use the money for a green new deal. Such a plan could create a tidal wave of well-paying unionised jobs, bring badly needed resources and opportunities to communities of colour, and insist that polluters should pay for workers to be retrained and fully included in this future. It could fashion policies that fight institutionalised racism, economic inequality and climate change at the same time. It could take on bad trade deals and police violence, and honour indigenous people as the original protectors of the land, water and air.
People have a right to be angry, and a powerful, intersectional left agenda can direct that anger where it belongs, while fighting for holistic solutions that will bring a frayed society together.
Such a coalition is possible. In Canada, we have begun to cobble it together under the banner of a peoples agenda called The Leap Manifesto , endorsed by more than 220 organisations from Greenpeace Canada to Black Lives Matter Toronto, and some of our largest trade unions.
Bernie Sanders amazing campaign went a long way towards building this sort of coalition, and demonstrated that the appetite for democratic socialism is out there. But early on, there was a failure in the campaign to connect with older black and Latino voters who are the demographic most abused by our current economic model. That failure prevented the campaign from reaching its full potential. Those mistakes can be corrected and a bold, transformative coalition is there to be built on.
That is the task ahead. The Democratic party needs to be either decisively wrested from pro-corporate neoliberals, or it needs to be abandoned. From Elizabeth Warren to Nina Turner, to the Occupy alumni who took the Bernie campaign supernova, there is a stronger field of coalition-inspiring progressive leaders out there than at any point in my lifetime. We are leaderful, as many in the Movement for Black Lives say.
So lets get out of shock as fast as we can and build the kind of radical movement that has a genuine answer to the hate and fear represented by the Trumps of this world. Lets set aside whatever is keeping us apart and start right now.

19282,SoftBank of Japan Will Buy U.S. Private Equity Giant Fortress - The New York Times,"Over its   existence, the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank and its founder, Masayoshi Son, have been known for ambitious and sometimes   moves. Now, SoftBank is nearing its most unusual move yet: It is buying Fortress Investment Group, an American private equity giant that oversees around $70 billion in assets. That business is a radical departure from the technology and telecommunications holdings for which the Japanese company is known. But the acquisition is intended to energize SoftBank’s other enormous new endeavor: a $100 billion technology investment fund that threatens to roil the private equity world. The move highlights the immense ambitions of SoftBank’s brash founder, Mr. Son. The    mogul, who is one of Japan’s richest men, has sought to shake up the American telecommunications industry and recently sought to win over President Trump by announcing intentions to create jobs in the United States. “Fortress’s excellent track record speaks for itself, and we look forward to benefiting from its leadership,   expertise and   investment platform,” Mr. Son said in a statement late Tuesday. “For SoftBank, this opportunity will immediately help expand our group capabilities, and, alongside our     SoftBank Vision Fund platform, will accelerate our SoftBank 2. 0 transformation strategy of bold, disciplined investment and world class execution to drive sustainable   growth. ” Over the past three decades, SoftBank has become one of Japan’s most formidable technology companies. It is perhaps best known for its telecommunications empire, which stretches from Japan to Sprint in the United States. SoftBank also has portfolio of investments that includes stakes in the Alibaba Group of China, the Japanese affiliate of Yahoo and   like the online lender SoFi. At its helm, the entire time, has been Mr. Son. An   businessman, Mr. Son began the business as a software distributor, but eventually moved into cellphone service and became the first Japanese carrier to embrace the iPhone. He has never been known for his modesty, repeatedly boasting about outsize ambitions like dethroning Verizon and ATT atop the American wireless industry with Sprint. SoftBank will be paying $3. 3 billion for Fortress, a premium to the company’s stock market value of $2. 3 billion. As part of the agreement, SoftBank has the option of bringing in partners to help cover the cost of the deal and who may want to become investors in Fortress funds, too, thus increasing assets under management. The deal frees up Peter L. Briger Jr. and Wesley R. Edens of Fortress to focus on their strengths as fund managers  —   several of their private equity funds have produced   returns over time  —   without having to deal with the headaches of running a public company. As leaders of a public company, they struggled mightily to bolster their stock, more so than their competitors. Recently, the firm shut down its flagship hedge fund. The purchase of Fortress, a prominent private equity firm with a specialty in investing in distressed assets, was driven by Rajeev Misra, a former top derivatives expert at Deutsche Bank who has taken a leading role in setting investment strategy for the SoftBank Vision Fund. After leaving Deutsche Bank in 2008, where he had worked closely with Anshu Jain, who headed the bank’s global markets operations, Mr. Misra went to UBS and then spent several months at Fortress, where he came to know the firm’s chairmen, Mr. Briger and Mr. Edens, well. Now, Mr. Misra will be helping steer an enormous new fund that is intended to invest in technology companies worldwide, often by taking huge stakes. SoftBank is expected to contribute at least $25 billion to the fund, while partners in the fund include Saudi Arabia and Apple. All told, SoftBank will now oversee assets under management of $170 billion, making it one of the largest private investors in the world after the Blackstone Group, which manages about $330 billion. While private equity firms have performed poorly as publicly traded stocks, they are attractive in part because of their ability to lock up money for multiple years and charge high fees. As an entity that is regulated  —   if relatively lightly compared with, say, a bank  —   Fortress will have to operate at arm’s length from the $100 billion Vision Fund when it comes to making investments. And the team of investors under Mr. Misra and Mr. Son will also remain unchanged. Still, it expected that there will be ample opportunity for the Vision Fund to benefit from shared intelligence between the two entities. That could mean Fortress seeing a deal in a telecommunications company that does not fit its mandate and passing it along to the Vision Fund. The transaction also widens the Vision Fund’s capacity to source new investments, given Fortress’s global network. For Fortress, the motivation was to join with one of the world’s most innovative investors and to enter global markets, like the Middle East, where they have trailed some of their peers. Fortress went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2007, before the financial crisis. But shares of Fortress, like shares of other publicly traded private equity firms, have performed poorly in recent years. Fortress’s stock price is down 80 percent since it began trading, and its executives have made no secret that the joy of being a public company has largely evaporated. The firm’s struggles trace to the financial crisis, when it was slow to exit the subprime loan business, forcing heavy losses. The stock dipped below $1, and the firm did not consistently return to profitability until 2012. At the same time, Mr. Edens positioned the firm to capitalize on the economic recovery, piling back into the subprime business through its purchase of the mortgage servicer Nationstar and consumer lender Springleaf, now known as OneMain Financial. Mr. Edens, a former Lehman Brothers partner who   Fortress, has turned the firm’s $124 million Springleaf investment into a stake valued at roughly $2 billion. Those investments underscore Fortress’s breadth across the American economy. As detailed in a New York Times investigation last year, Fortress is one of several private equity firms that have assumed a pervasive and influential role in daily American life, stepping in for banks that pulled back in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Under the terms of the deal, Fortress will become an independent subsidiary of SoftBank. Fortress’s principals, who control roughly a third of the firm’s voting shares, have agreed to vote in favor of the sale, which is expected to close by year’s end. On Tuesday, before the deal was announced, shares of Fortress rose 6. 5 percent on unusually heavy trading volume.",0
19283,Seeing America Through Ángel Franco’s Eyes - The New York Times,"Times Insider delivers    insights into life at The New York Times. In a large newsroom, the collaboration between a reporter and a photographer often depends on the whims of their respective assigning editors, who calculate strengths, weaknesses, and, most of all, availability. Who’s up to cover that fire? Who’s up to shoot it? The resulting slapdash teamwork between writer and photographer can end as quickly as it began they may work together the next day, or never again. But for many years now, I have been fortunate to work with exceptional New York Times photographers for extended periods of time while writing a national column called “This Land. ” Lately, I have been collaborating with Todd Heisler, a stunningly gifted photographer and a great companion. Before Todd, I traveled for several years beside the recently retired Nicole Bengiveno, whose profound empathy comes through in her camera’s every click, and who deserves some formal commendation for having put up with a certain hack  —   me  —   for so long. And before Nicole, there was Ángel Franco, who retired last month to end a storied Times career  —   and who began the “This Land” column with me 10 years ago this month. The template for our relationship  —   indeed, for “This Land”  —   was established in early 2007, as we headed out to do our inaugural column, one on Logan, a small West Virginia city struggling with a fatal mine disaster and the decline of King Coal. Mr. Franco and I began by walking the streets, noticing: the coal train running through the city’s core the dust settling on buildings along the tracks and the Jesus Christ carved from anthracite, prominent in a store’s window display. Noticing  —   that was the word for it. At one point we went to a small diner, and engaged in a brief exchange with the waitress. After she had taken our order, I asked, “Did you hear what she said?” And Mr. Franco repeated her words exactly: “‘Are we ready yet, children? ’” There it was. As with Todd and Nicole, as with so many other photographers  —   and may God forgive any reporter who uses the term “my photographer”  —   Mr. Franco is an attentive observer, witnessing and listening always. In that   diner, I knew that my Times colleague embraced the storytelling worth of the small and quiet moment. This is going to be fun, I thought. For the next two years, Mr. Franco and I produced a column a week, just about, and wound up filing    dispatches from each of the 50 states. This, of course, was madness. Our weeks would often begin on Monday at Newark Liberty International Airport, and end on Friday, or Saturday, even Sunday, with frantic efforts to figure out where to go to next. Louisiana? Montana? Maine? (The only way we were able to maintain some semblance of sanity, by the way, was by having the great Cate Doty help us with possible story ideas, travel logistics and dinner recommendations she was a full partner in this misbegotten venture. I also owe a debt of gratitude to then National desk editor, Suzanne Daley, and then deputy national editor, David Firestone, both of whom were integral in allowing “This Land” to begin.) You can look it up. We went to a retirement home in  Penney Farms, Fla. to visit the coroner in “The Wizard of Oz. ” To Havana, Ill. to report on the Asian carp infesting the Illinois River. To Kalaupapa, Hawaii, to meet the last residents of a colony to which those with leprosy, also known as Hansen’s disease, were once relegated. To Nashville to witness an execution by electric chair. To Bethel, Alaska, to explore the    games of bootleggers. To Bill, Wyo.  —   population five, maybe  —   to stay in a new hotel catering to railway workers. To Cottage Grove, Wis. to meet the pastor who baptized Jeffrey Dahmer in a prison whirlpool. To Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, to uncover the    intrigue at a county fair’s  . To Denver, to cover the annual convention of the Sovereign Grand Lodge of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows (where we felt perfectly at home). Kalispell, Mont. Lake Mead, Nev. Ainsworth, Neb. Newport, Ind. Pascagoula, Miss. Greensburg, Kan. Hollywood, Md. Sylva, N. C. The datelines blur into one American story, captured in all its breadth by Mr. Franco and his camera. I often had no idea what to do for the next column. One Saturday morning, while scanning online newspapers for ideas, I noticed a news brief about a farewell breakfast in a V. F. W. hall in Mohave Valley, Ariz. for a high school graduate named Resha Kane. After the meal, she was to be taken by motorcycle escort to Las Vegas, to catch a flight to Fort Hood, where she would begin her Army career in exchange for college tuition. I called my good friend Mr. Franco  —   who, of course, got it immediately. We flew out the next day, and were present when Ms. Kane, who looked much younger than her 18 years, said her goodbyes. Mr. Franco’s memorable photograph of this young woman in fatigues, saying goodbye to her father  —   the fear of her unknown, of our unknown, conveyed in her eyes  —   hangs in the newsroom. Once again he had noticed, and captured, that small and quiet moment. Working closely with Mr. Franco for two years, I could not help but be blown away by his fierce dedication to his art, by his determination to capture a moment’s essence  —   and by his unflagging reportorial curiosity, which led to my favorite moments on assignment: the evening debriefing. Sitting in a booth at a Chili’s or Texas Roadhouse hard against some interstate, Mr. Franco and I would pore over what we had just seen and heard, comparing notes, dissecting motives, framing The Story to come. One modest testament to Mr. Franco’s art is in how I remember our travels. It’s not my opening paragraphs or closing kickers that I recall, but rather Mr. Franco’s photographs, which return me so completely to the Mississippi despair of a   FEMA trailer, to the   joy of a small Maine amusement park, to the expansive wonder of a remote South Dakota spot known as the Center of the Nation. It is a rare privilege to see this great country, in all its heartbreaking,   wonder, on the dime of your employer. A rarer privilege, still, to have also seen it through the   eyes of Ángel Franco.",0
19284,Deliberately Forgotten.,"Words are battling in my head and I cannot truly form a sentence empty of frustration. 
The phone is barely ringing to Aleppo. And, when they finally pick up, no word is discernible. The internet connection is cut. There’s no actual way of reaching anyone, to make sure your loved ones are safe. 
This is West Aleppo. 
A few days ago, a school was targeted, A SCHOOL Six children, six innocent lives, only there to getaway from the atrocity that is war, to learn, to reach a future, taken away, leaving torn families behind. 
This is West Aleppo. 
Yesterday, as the situation was getting worse and worse, my aunts and their families found themselves forced to seek what’s left of safety and refuge, at my grandmother’s house. 
This is West Aleppo. 
My friend wondering if he will survive one more month in this bloodshed because everyone around is dying. 
This is West Aleppo. 
Aleppo, where East and West have been battlefields for years now. Yet, as always we hardly hear of those paying the price. Forgotten, probably deliberately. After all, all that has mattered since day one was the « winner » of this horror story. 
Shame. Shame on this world. Shame on the mainstream media, playing a game with us, trying to convince us of the care they feel for the Syrian people dying but only talking about some parts of it. 
Where are the mediatized pictures of Aleppo these last few days… Where are those people always acting like Syria has become their number one worry while six years ago, they didn’t even know how to place it on a map of the Middle East…? Or is it just that some lives aren’t really worth remembering…? 
You don’t chose where you are born, where your house is. I have loved ones in both parts of Aleppo and I worry about them as much and I cannot bear the fact that a side is more worthy of empathy than the other just because there’s apparently a « good » and a « bad » while all I’m seeing is my people suffering wherever they are.",0

19286,What Is At Stake In the Election,"Here Are The Presstitutes Who Control American’s Minds: http://www.veteransnewsnow.com/2016/10/26/1010359-65-us-journalists-at-a-private-dinner-with-hillary-clintons-team-and-john-podesta/ 
I just heard an NPR presstitute delare that Texas, a traditional sure thing for Republicans was up for grabs in the presidential election. Little wonder if this report on Zero Hedge is correct. Apparently, the voting machines are already at work stealing the election for Killary. http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-25/texas-rigged-first-reports-voting-machines-switching-votes-hillary-texas 
From my long experience in journalism, I know the American public is not very sharp. Nevertheless, it is difficult for me to believe that Americans, whose jobs, careers, and the same for their children and grandchildren, have been sold out by the elites who Hillary represents would actually vote for her. It makes no sense. If this were the case, how did Trump get the Republican nomination despite the vicious presstitute campaign against him? 
It seems obvious that the majority of Americans who have been suffering terribly at the hands of the One Percent who own Hillary lock, stock, and barrel, will not vote for the people who have ruined their lives and the lives of their children and grandchildren. 
Furthermore, if Trump’s election is as impossible as the presstitutes tell us—Hillary’s win is 93% certain according to the latest presstitute pronouncement—the vicious 24/7 attacks on Trump would be pointless. Wouldn’t they? Why the constant, frenetic, vicious attacks on a person who has no chance? 
There are reports that a company associated with Hillary backer George Soros is supplying the voting machines to 16 states, including states that determine election outcomes. I do not know that these reports are correct. However, I do know for a fact that the oligarchic interests that rule America are opposed to Trump being elected President for the simple reason that they are unsure that they would be able to control him. 
It is hard to believe that dispossessed Americans will vote for Hillary, the representative of those who have dispossessed them, when Trump says he will re-empower the dispossessed. Hillary has denigrated ordinary Americans who, she says, she is so removed from by her wealth that she doesn’t even know who they are. Clearly, Hillary, paid $675,000 by Goldman Sachs for three 20-minute speeches, is not a representative of the people. She represents the One Percent whose policies have flushed the prospects of ordinary Americans down the toilet. 
What is really disturbing is the pretense by the presstitute scum that Trump’s lewd admiration for female charms is deemed more important than the prospect of nuclear war. At no time during the presidential primaries or during the current presidential campaign has it been mentioned that Russia is being assaulted daily by propaganda, threatened by military buildups, and being convinced that the United States and its European vassals are planning an attack. 
A threatened Russia, made insecure by inexplicable hostility and Western propaganda, is a danger manufactured by the neoconservative supporters of Hillary Clinton. 
If the American people are really so unbelievably stupid that they think lewd remarks about women are more important than avoiding nuclear war, the American people are too stupid to exist. They will deserve the mushroom clouds that will wipe them and everyone else off the face of the earth. 
Donald Trump is the only candidate in the primaries and the general election who has said that he sees no point in conflict with Russia when Putin has shown nothing but desire to work things out to mutual advantage. 
In contrast, Hillary has declared the thrice-elected president of Russia to be “the new Hitler” and has threatened Russia with military action. Hillary talks openly about regime change in Russia. 
Surely, in a free media at least one person in the print and TV media would raise this most important of all points. But where have you seen it? 
Only in my columns and a few others in the alternative media. 
In other words, we are about to have an election in which the important issue has played no role. And yet allegedly we are the exceptional, indispensable people, a people’s democracy protected by a free press. 
In truth, this mythical description of America is merely a cloak for the rule of the Oligarchs. And the Oligarchs are risking life on earth for their continual supremacy. (Reprinted from PaulCraigRoberts.org by permission of author or representative)",0
19287,"Re: If Donald Trump Wins, He Will Be 70 Years, 7 Months And 7 Days Old On His First Full Day In Office","Archives Michael On Television If Donald Trump Wins, He Will Be 70 Years, 7 Months And 7 Days Old On His First Full Day In Office By Michael Snyder, on November 1st, 2016 
A couple of weeks ago, it looked like Hillary Clinton was all set to cruise to victory , but now the FBI has delivered an election miracle in the nick of time. A few of my readers had criticized me for suggesting that Trump might lose, but I don’t know who is going to win the election, and so all I had to go on was the cold, hard numbers. And a couple of weeks ago the cold, hard numbers were telling me that Hillary Clinton was going to win. Of course it is entirely possible that the national polls might have been seriously wrong, but even the state polls in the most important battleground states consistently had bad news for Trump. So things didn’t look good for Trump at the time, but now that the FBI has renewed their investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails the poll numbers have shifted dramatically in Trump’s favor . 
As I write this article, the national polls have really tightened up. In fact, the latest ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll puts Trump 1 point ahead of Clinton. Trump has all of the momentum at the moment, but that does not mean that he is going to win. As we have seen already in this race, one day can literally change everything. 
And as I noted yesterday , more than 23 million Americans have already voted, and most of that voting was done during a period of time when Hillary Clinton was doing very well in the polls. 
So we shall see what happens. But if Trump does win on November 8th, there is a fact about his birthday which will start to get a lot of attention. 
Donald Trump was born on June 14th, 1946. If you move ahead 70 years from that date, that brings you to June 14th, 2016. Moving forward another 7 months brings you to January 14th, 2017, and moving forward another 7 days brings you to January 21st, 2017. 
And if Donald Trump wins the election, January 21st will be his first full day in office. 
Of course Trump would be inaugurated on January 20th, but he would only be president for part of that day. 
So that means that Donald Trump would be 70 years, 7 months and 7 days old on his first full day as president of the United States. 
And this would happen during year 5777 on the Hebrew calendar. 
These amazing “coincidences” were first pointed out on Facebook by a user named Alyson Kelly. Some may take these numbers as a sign that Donald Trump is supposed to become the next president, but I want to make it exceedingly clear that I do not know what is going to happen, nor am I making any sort of prediction about what is going to happen. 
I just thought that this information was “interesting” and so I thought that I would share it. 
Someone that does believe that Trump is going to win is Glenn Beck. He was been virulently anti-Trump throughout this campaign, but now he is convinced that Clinton will be unable to overcome this new email scandal, and he is calling this renewed investigation by the FBI “the greatest gift given to any candidate of all time in the history of America.” 
Beck also says that if Clinton wins now it will be evidence that “magic exists”, and he is currently projecting that Trump should win the national vote by 5 points … 
“Let’s just say he was 8 points, that was fair to say, 8 points behind last week,” Beck said, according to a transcript posted on his website . “He should win by 5 points.” 
Beck later added: “How can the next president face a possible collapsing economy, possible war with Russia, and a current war with ISIS? Oh, and also, be under FBI investigation and indictment? Can’t. Can’t.” 
The conservative personality called the latest FBI revelation “the greatest gift given to any candidate of all time in the history of America” and added that if Clinton still managed to win, it would be akin to proof “magic exists.” 
Hopefully Glenn Beck is right, because none of us should want to see Hillary Clinton in the White House. 
She is the most evil, corrupt and scandal-ridden politician of this generation, and I can’t understand how any American in their right mind could possibly vote for her. 
And the hits just keep on coming. Wikileaks has just released an email in which John Podesta told Clinton “fixer” Cheryl Mills that they were “going to have to dump all those emails so better to do so sooner than later” … 
It was not entirely clear what Podesta meant by that phrase, but it could potentially be smoking gun evidence of obstruction of justice . 
Back in 2008, Barack Obama was new, intriguing and mysterious. We didn’t know a lot about him, and so one can almost understand how the American people could have been fooled by him. 
But in 2016, Americans know more about Hillary Clinton than they have ever known about any candidate in modern American history. 
The Clintons have a history of crimes and scandals that goes all the way back to the 1980s, but about half the country is choosing to ignore all of that history and vote for her anyway. 
I believe that this election is America’s final exam. Originally there were 17 Republicans and 5 Democrats running for the presidency. When you throw in the major third party candidates, that brings us to a total of approximately 25 people that the American public could have chosen from. 
If the American people willingly choose the most wicked candidate out of all of them after everything that has been revealed, I don’t think that anyone will be able to say that we don’t deserve the bitter consequences that follow that decision. 
The time for talking is almost over, and shortly we shall find out which path the American people have chosen. 
If that choice turns out to be Hillary Clinton after everything that we have seen during this election cycle, I truly believe that we will have reached the point of no return as a nation.",0
19288,DNC To Sue Trump For Telling Truth: Trump Admits Everything Is A Lie,"The DNC is suing the Republican National Committee due to Donald Trump’s claims that Hillary Clinton is committing election fraud. 
Via YourNewsWire 

The suit was filed in a U.S. District Court in New Jersey and aims to silence Trump’s claim that the election is rigged, which the DNC are particularly sensitive about. The DNC alleges that the RNC has not done enough to reprimand Trump for claiming that the election is rigged, and seeks to have the court hold the committee in civil contempt as well as levy sanctions.
The DNC claims that because the RNC has done “ballot security” work, they are agreeing with Trump that the election is rigged. Marc Elias, Hillary Clinton’s campaign counsel, claims that there is also a racial element to Trump’s claims of voter fraud.
“Trump has falsely and repeatedly told his supporters that the November 8 election will be ‘rigged’ based upon fabricated claims of voter fraud in ‘certain areas’ or ‘certain sections’ of key states,” the Democratic attorneys, including Hillary Clinton campaign counsel Marc Elias, wrote.
“Unsurprisingly, those ‘certain areas’ are exclusively communities in which large minority voting populations reside.” Election Day is in 13 days.

19289,Hillary and Trump Could Both Be Criminally Charged After The Election,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton have made headlines recently for their alleged problems with the law . Trump, who in April of 2016 was named as the defendant in a lawsuit filed by Katie Johnson, is scheduled to appear before a court on December 16, 2016. The lawsuit alleges Trump, along with former banker billionaire and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, raped Johnson when she was thirteen. The incident allegedly happened in the 1990s. Epstein, who was convicted of soliciting an underage girl for prostitution in 2008, has also been associated with former President Bill Clinton, whose name appears in “ flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the ‘Lolita Express, ’” a term used in association with Epstein’s Boeing 727 jet. The jet was allegedly set up with beds where Epstein and guests “ had group sex with young girls .” The lawsuit was first filed in April , but U.S. Magistrate Judge Karen Stevenson threw the suit out in May because Johnson then failed “ to state a civil rights claim .” The plaintiff was representing herself at the time, claiming to be unemployed and having only $276 to her name. In June, Johnson went on to refile the suit in the Manhattan federal court. This time around, Johnson filed the suit under the name “Jane Doe,” asking $75,000 plus attorney fees. But in September, Johnson dropped her lawsuit, only to have it refiled weeks later with three affidavits instead of two. While Trump is scheduled to appear in court for a status conference in December in reference to this case, it still requires more information before it leads to a trial or settlement. In contrast to Trump’s case, Clinton’s brush with the law is taking place at a different, more advanced level — but is still not close enough to conviction to ruin her chances of being elected. Just over a week before Americans head to the polls to cast their ballots, the FBI announced it would be reopening its the probe into presidential nominee and former secretary of state Clinton’s use of a private email server. The announcement followed the discovery of an email stash found on a laptop that belonged to former congressman Anthony Weiner. Weiner’s wife, Huma Abedin, is a longtime Clinton aide. She claims to have been unaware that her emails were on Weiner’s device. Though the FBI has announced it obtained a warrant to review the 650,000 emails, it is unlikely the agency’s investigation will achieve any results before election day. The FBI is seeking to determine whether the messages found on Weiner’s computer include any classified information or evidence that may indicate Clinton undermined U.S. national security. In an article for Law Newz , Ronn Blitzer attempts to answer some of the questions the public might raise now that the FBI has announced the probe, attempting to determine how Clinton’s legal future will look if she’s elected president. While the law “ is hazy, ” Blitzer writes , he goes over several scenarios. First, he explains “ it’s highly unlikely that an indictment would come before November 8 .” If it happened, however, “ the indictment itself wouldn’t mean that Clinton could no longer run, as an indictment is only an accusation, not a convictio n.” Theoretically, he continues , “ the Electoral College could … go rogue and not vote for Clinton, even if their states tell them to .” Another possibility is that Clinton would be pressured, either by the DNC or the public, to “ give up her candidacy. ” In the case Clinton wins but is indicted before her inauguration, “ she could try to play beat-the-clock and hope to take office before her case concludes .” But if she’s both indicted and convicted before the inauguration and then sentenced, “ she may be deemed incapacitated, in which case Section 3 of the 20th Amendment kicks in and the Vice President-Elect, in this case Tim Kaine, would become President .” But if Clinton wins the election and is inaugurated as the investigation is carried on, “ Clinton would luck out ,” Blitzer explains , “ due to the philosophy that Presidents — and only Presidents — [sic] are immune from prosecution while in office .” Since the House of Representatives determined in 1873 that a president may only be impeached over offenses committed after their inauguration, Blitzer writes , impeachment over the email scandal isn’t likely to take place. And even if she’s convicted after moving to the White House, “ President Hillary Clinton could pardon herself .” These scenarios could all play out fairly similarly in Trump’s case, assuming the rape lawsuit filed against him leads to a conviction. But whether Clinton or Trump is elected, their federal or FBI probes may result in nothing more than footnotes in the grand scheme of things — especially once we’re faced with the realization that elected officials are required to meet lower standards of conduct than the rest of us . Only after the FBI probe is finalized will we know if Congress is willing to tackle the presidential immunity rules. source:",0
19290,Walmart Goes Against The Grain Of Obama’s America With New Thanksgiving Ad,"0 comments 
Families united in prayer on Thanksgiving Day. Prayer alone is not what comes to mind when you think of Obama’s America where we are told to leave God at home and out of our pledge. 
There has never been a more crucial time to look to God, as our nation is being divided and torn apart by the selfish greed of a corrupt society with leaders that lead from behind, and hide their dark secrets right in plain sight…because, they can. 
Now Walmart has brought us a Thanksgiving commercial that is a huge reminder of what is good, and what is right. A reminder of what a good foundation is made up of. Being grateful, family, and prayer. 
Most of all…coming together. 
The 30-second ad, which at World Series rates cost Walmart $500,000 â features the diversity of Americas families and the camaraderie of its service members as they gather, pray and enjoy the bonds of family. A commercial showing everyone praying before eating??? đđťđđťđđťđđť great job Walmart!! #Walmart

âAmerica, letâs come together and take a moment to reflect on what weâre truly thankful for this holiday season. Friends, family and the chance to spend time with the ones we love. Walmart would like to give thanks to all of our Veterans and Active Duty Service Members at home and oversees this holiday season.â 
Walmart has invited a spirit of thanksgiving with just a few seconds of video. Can you imagine if “everyday Americans” brought just a few seconds of thanksgiving into their lives daily? 
What a difference it would make. It could change the very state we’re in right now. Where everything is about oneself and selfish desires. A generation of self-absorbed selfie taking kids who think they can’t do hard things. 
For them…it would make a HUGE difference. Related Items",0
19291,Trump Assails Nordstrom for ‘Unfairly’ Dropping His Daughter Ivanka’s Line - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump lashed out on Wednesday at the Nordstrom department store chain for dropping his daughter Ivanka’s accessories and clothing line, once again raising ethical questions about the relationship between his presidency and his family’s sprawling business interests. Mr. Trump has already broken with tradition by singling out companies for criticism, like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, automakers and news organizations, sometimes causing gyrations in their stock prices and prompting debates about whether corporations would tailor their conduct to suit a bellicose president. But in those cases, his ire targeted government contracts, departing American jobs or news coverage  —   not his own family’s personal fortunes. Six days after Nordstrom announced that, based on sales, it would no longer carry Ms. Trump’s products  —   a decision that prompted some Trump supporters to call for a boycott of the stores  —   the president took to Twitter to complain that “Ivanka has been treated so unfairly” by the company. He first posted the message from his personal account, and then   it from his official White House account. Mr. Trump’s complaint also raised questions about how he might handle the moves of numerous other companies as their relationships with Trump brands change. The large national discount retailers T. J. Maxx and Marshalls, and Neiman Marcus, the luxury department store, for example, have recently taken steps to give less prominence to Ms. Trump’s products. Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump’s press secretary, said the president’s tweet was not about business but about “an attack on his daughter. ” “For people to take out their concern about his actions, or his executive orders, on members of his family, he has every right to stand up for his family,” Mr. Spicer said. It was not clear if Mr. Spicer was referring to critics of Mr. Trump who have called for a boycott of businesses bearing the family name, or to some political motive by Nordstrom. After the president temporarily barred people from seven   countries from entering the United States, Nordstrom sent its employees a statement saying that it valued immigrants and offered support to those affected by the executive order. On Wednesday, responding to Mr. Spicer’s comments, Nordstrom maintained that it had pulled Ms. Trump’s products based on their declining sales performance. The company said it informed Ms. Trump of its decision in early January. “Over the past year, and particularly in the last half of 2016, sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point where it didn’t make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now,” the Nordstrom statement said. “We’ve had a great relationship with the Ivanka Trump team. ” As Mr. Trump has noted several times, the president is exempt from conflict of interest provisions in federal law that prohibit other government officials from using their positions to benefit themselves or their family members financially. So even if his post was meant to intimidate Nordstrom or other retailers that still work with Ivanka Trump, it probably does not violate conflict of interest rules, said ethics experts, who nonetheless called it inappropriate. “It is a total misuse of presidential power,” said Lawrence M. Noble, the general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center and formerly the top lawyer at the Federal Election Commission. “He is really bringing to bear the whole weight of the office of president on a business decision. Take another company that is considering whether or not to drop her line  —   they obviously are going to ask themselves if they want to be attacked by the president. ” Mr. Trump’s blast at Nordstrom came two days after his wife, Melania, filed a libel lawsuit that described her “multiyear term” as “one of the most photographed women in the world”  —   an apparent reference to her status as a candidate’s wife and now first lady  —   as a lucrative business opportunity. And Mr. Spicer, the White House spokesman, has urged people to visit the Trump International Hotel in Washington, which opened late last year. Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a group that promotes ethics in government, said Mr. Trump’s swipe at Nordstrom was not a major issue in itself. But Mr. Weissman said it demonstrates that as president, Mr. Trump continues to have multiple conflicts of interest with his own and his family’s business interests. Mr. Trump refuses to sell his assets or put them into a blind trust, but he has said that he has ceded operation of his businesses to his adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric. “He has committed to severing himself from the family business operations,” Mr. Weissman said. “That is obviously not the case. ” Ivanka Trump has no formal role in the administration, but her father has included her in meetings with foreign officials and business leaders, and her husband, Jared Kushner, is an adviser to the president. After years as a business executive, Ms. Trump has suddenly found herself without a clear path to walk as she adjusts to life in Washington. She has expressed frustration to a number of associates with Nordstrom’s decision, describing it as a political move and maintaining that the sales of her brand had not sagged. While she is no longer involved in the management of her business, she is said to be acutely aware of the controversies surrounding her product line. The Trump presidency is forcing retailers to rethink their relationships with Trump product lines, weighing how well they sell and what actions will anger or placate the largest number of customers. After Nordstrom said it was dropping Ivanka Trump’s merchandise, Trump supporters on social media began calling for a boycott of the stores. Last week, T. J. Maxx and Marshalls stores sent a note to employees  —   a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times  —   telling them to throw away signs for Ivanka Trump products. “Effective immediately, please remove all Ivanka Trump merchandise from features and mix into” the racks where most products hang, the note read. “All Ivanka Trump signs should be discarded. ” The instruction was to eliminate special displays for the merchandise, “not to remove it from the sales floor,” said Doreen Thompson, a spokeswoman for the TJX Companies, the retailers’ parent corporation. “We offer a rapidly changing selection of merchandise for our customers, and brands are featured based on a number of factors,” she said. Ms. Thompson did not respond directly to questions about whether instructing stores to discard signs was unusual. But an employee at one of the company’s stores, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said she had not received such a request during her several years working there. Neiman Marcus recently stopped selling Ms. Trump’s jewelry and accessories through its website, but her clothes are still sold at Macy’s, the nation’s largest department store chain, as well as its sister company Bloomingdale’s, where her shoes and handbags are available online. In August, Bloomingdale’s committed to selling her clothes in seven of its stores, according to a spokeswoman, Anne Keating. “I think they all have probably been looking closely at Ivanka’s sales numbers and weighing whether they’re worth all the problems she’s brought them,” said Shannon Coulter, who helped found #GrabYourWallet, an online campaign to boycott Trump products.",0
19294,Amnesty Warns Against Using White Phosphorus In Mosul Operation,"  Carol Adl in Middle East , News // 0 Comments 
Amnesty International have received credible witness and photographic evidence of white phosphorus projectiles exploding in the air over an area about 20 kilometres east of the Iraqi city Mosul. Evidence white phosphorus used in area near Mosul, Iraq posing deadly risk to civilians fleeing the fighting https://t.co/TWuLGbokS0 pic.twitter.com/BVROVe91i1 
— AmnestyInternational (@AmnestyOnline) October 28, 2016 
The human rights watchdog has urged the Iraqi government and US-backed coalition not to use white phosphorus in the vicinity of Mosul, warning of devastating health consequences for civilians who are trying to flee the ISIS held city. 
US forces were reported to be using white phosphorus recently in Iraq, though they insist they’d only done so in ways consistent with their interpretation of international law. 
White phosphorus is an incendiary substance which burns at extremely high temperatures upon exposure to air and is legally used both for smoke screens and for illumination in war zones. Its use in areas where civilians are present is however, considered a war crime. 
“White phosphorus can cause horrific injuries, burning deep into the muscle and bone. It is possible that some of it will only partially burn and could then reignite weeks after being deployed,” said Donatella Rovera, Senior Crisis Response Adviser at Amnesty International. 
RT reports: 
While alleging that Assyrian population of Karemlesh had fled the advance of the Islamic State (IS formerly known as ISIS/ISIL) terrorists in August 2014, Amnesty pointed out that during the operation to free Mosul, refugees fleeing towards Erbil will be forced to pass through the contaminated area. 
“We are urging Iraqi and coalition forces never to use white phosphorus in the vicinity of civilians. Even if civilians are not present at the time of its use, due to the residual risks they should not use airburst white phosphorus munitions unless it is absolutely necessary to achieve military objectives which cannot be accomplished through safer means,” Rovera said. 
Examining photographs taken by a New York Times photographer on October 20 and then interviewing him, Amnesty could not definitively conclude which forces used the white phosphorus munitions. 
“It is not clear whether the projectiles were fired by Iraqi central government forces, Peshmerga forces of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), or forces belonging to members of the US-led coalition,” Amnesty said. 
But the NGO did conclude based on the photographic evidence that the explosion dispersal pattern “appears consistent with the US-made 155-mm M825A1 projectile, which ejects 116 felt wedges containing white phosphorus over an area between 125 – 250 meters wide.” 
The watchdog called on the forces in the area not to use the highly-dangerous weapon or at the very least inform populations about the areas where it was used. 
“It is absolutely imperative that the forces using white phosphorus publicize details of areas potentially contaminated by the substance, to minimize the risk of accidental harm to civilians,” said Rovera. 
Iraqi and Kurdish forces, supported by the US-led international coalition launched an operation to retake Mosul on October 17. The fighting since then displaced an estimated 100,000 people, while up to 1.5 million people remain trapped in Mosul. 
Jihadists have taken “tens of thousands” civilians hostage and are herding them towards the city of Mosul to use as human shields, the United Nations warned earlier. 
“Credible reports suggest that ISIL has been forcing tens of thousands of people from their homes in sub-districts around Mosul and have forcibly relocated numbers of civilians inside the city itself since the operation began on the 17th of October to restore Iraqi government control over Mosul,” said UN human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani on Friday.",0
19295,England players controversially allowed to wear three lions,"England players controversially allowed to wear three lions 02-11-16 FIFA has turned down a request to stop the England team disrespecting the England crest by wearing it. Many fans believe the current team’s wearing of the three lions shows a lack of respect to those who had gone before them and managed to pass a ball ten yards. England supporter Wayne Hayes said: “Is this what Terry Butcher ran around with his head pissing blood for? Is this why Gazza cried? Is this why Geoff Thomas shanked that shot against France? “To see the crest besmirched by Wayne Rooney wearing it while wandering around the pitch like he’s in IKEA is a disgrace.” England manager Gareth Southgate said: “The decision whether to wear the three lions should be a personal one, unless you fuck up a vital penalty you’re inexplicably taking in a major tournament, in which case you should be allowed nowhere near them.” Funds raised by the sale of England shirts with the crest help to fund various causes, such as firing managers and staging doomed bids to host the world cup.

19296,“Billionaire” Donald Trump’s Presidential Campaign Is Flat Out Broke,"The Washington Post reported : 
Donald Trump raised just $29 million for his presidential campaign committee in the first 19 days of October, about half as much as his Democratic rival, putting him at a severe financial disadvantage in the crucial final days of the White House contest, new campaign finance reports filed Thursday night showed. 
The GOP presidential nominee had just $16 million left in his campaign coffers on Oct. 19, compared to Hillary Clinton’s $62 million. When the cash reserves of their joint fundraising committees are included, Clinton’s war chest grew to $153 million, while Trump’s totaled $68 million. 
Trump’s total fundraising dropped 39% in the first 19 days of October. $29 million is close to nothing for a national presidential campaign in the closing weeks of the race. At a time when Trump needs boots on the ground to get out the Republican vote, his presidential campaign is broke, and in debt to the tune of $2 million. There isn’t going to be a last-minute ad blitz for Trump, or a reservation of television time so that the Republican nominee can speak directly to voters before election day. 
The plan for Trump is for the campaign to continue to limp along with lots of rallies, which are good for Trump’s ego, but not effective in getting voters to the polls. Trump promised to donate $100 million to his campaign but has only given $56 million . The billionaire who promised to self-finance has run his presidential campaign into the ground. Trump took ten times more money out of his campaign in reimbursements to his own businesses than he gave in October. 
Fundraising is an indicator of expected election outcomes. The money tends to go towards the winner at the end of an election. Hillary Clinton is having no trouble raising money, which suggests that enthusiasm is high among her supporters. Trump’s cash crush points to a depressed base that doesn’t expect him to win. 
Trump has done what he does best. He talked a big game while bankrupting the Republican Party for his own personal gain. Convincing Republicans to give him their nomination may go down in history as Trump’s biggest con of all.",0
19297,Black Health Experts Renew Fight Against Menthol Cigarettes - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Menthol cigarettes account for about a third of all cigarettes sold in the United States, and they are particularly popular among black smokers  —   about four out of five report smoking them, according to federal surveys. The effects are devastating: About 45, 000   die each year from   illnesses  —   the largest cause of preventable death, more than homicides, AIDS and car accidents. Black men have the highest lung cancer mortality rate of any demographic group. Three years ago, the Food and Drug Administration seemed poised to take action. It said research showed that the mint flavoring made it easier to start smoking and harder to quit, meaning that the substance harmed public health, a finding that activists and experts believed laid the groundwork for banning menthol. But nothing has happened, and on Tuesday, a group of   activists and health experts made an appeal to President Obama, arguing that the issue was not only one of health, but also of social justice. “What we’re trying to do is involve the president of the United States in this discussion,” said Phillip Gardiner, a chairman of the African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council. “We die disproportionately of   diseases. Part of what has taken place here is the use of menthol cigarettes. ” Black leaders have tried for years to get the federal government to deal with menthol without success. One obstacle has been divisions among   on the issue. The tobacco industry had long provided economic support to   organizations like the N. A. A. C. P. according to industry documents made public during the federal government’s settlement with tobacco companies in 1998, which weakened the fight. But that might be changing. An invigorated public conversation about race in the United States seems to be breathing new life into the issue. In July, the N. A. A. C. P. voted to support state and local efforts to restrict the sale of menthol cigarettes, a drastic departure from the past. A spokesman for the N. A. A. C. P. says the group receives no funding from the tobacco industry. “It’s been a pivotal year,” Dr. Gardiner said. “There’s been some motion. ” Menthol has a long history among  . Valerie Yerger, a researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, who has studied the tobacco industry, said documents showed that cigarette companies targeted     neighborhoods. She said Lorillard, the maker of Newport, the most popular menthol brand, ordered its sales representatives in the 1980s to “stay out of the suburbs and go into tough   neighborhoods. ” Maura Payne, a spokeswoman for R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, which owns Lorillard, said she could not comment because the documents were written long before the company acquired Lorillard in 2015. Lisa Henriksen, a researcher at the Stanford Prevention Research Center, said she had documented patterns of racial disparities in tobacco marketing. In a 2012 study of tobacco sales near California high schools, she found the higher the enrollment of   students, the higher the percentage of advertisements for menthol cigarettes. Newports were cheaper, she found, near schools with higher shares of   students. Ms. Payne said it was her understanding that Lorillard’s retail programs “were offered uniformly on a statewide basis. ” Spending for magazine advertising of menthol cigarettes went from 13 percent of total ad spending in 1998 to around 76 percent in 2006, according to the Campaign for   Kids. From 1998 to 2002, Ebony was nearly 10 times as likely as People to have menthol advertisements. Dr. Henriksen argued the marketing had an effect. While smoking rates have been declining across the nation, rates for menthol cigarette use among those 18 to 25 climbed to 16 percent in 2010, from 13 percent in 2004, according to a 2011 federal report. From 2008 to 2010, about 57 percent of youth smokers used menthol cigarettes, according to Truth Initiative, an antismoking research group. The F. D. A. said it had received more than 175, 000 public comments in response to its 2013 findings on menthol. A spokesman, Michael Felberbaum, said the agency “is continuing to consider regulatory options related to menthol. ” Carol McGruder, a chairwoman of the African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council, said the group had sent a letter to Mr. Obama his wife, Michelle, and a number of heads of federal agencies, including the F. D. A. So far, she said, it had not received a reply. But it still hopes to. “Our children deserve protection from the police,” she said. “They deserve protection from the deadly silent predator: the tobacco industry. ”",0
19298,"Investigating Donald Trump, F.B.I. Sees No Clear Link to Russia - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   For much of the summer, the F. B. I. pursued a widening investigation into a Russian role in the American presidential campaign. Agents scrutinized advisers close to Donald J. Trump, looked for financial connections with Russian financial figures, searched for those involved in hacking the computers of Democrats, and even chased a lead  —   which they ultimately came to doubt  —   about a possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump Organization to a Russian bank. Law enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government. And even the hacking into Democratic emails, F. B. I. and intelligence officials now believe, was aimed at disrupting the presidential election rather than electing Mr. Trump. Hillary Clinton’s supporters, angry over what they regard as a lack of scrutiny of Mr. Trump by law enforcement officials, pushed for these investigations. In recent days they have also demanded that James B. Comey, the director of the F. B. I. discuss them publicly, as he did last week when he announced that a new batch of emails possibly connected to Mrs. Clinton had been discovered. Supporters of Mrs. Clinton have argued that Mr. Trump’s evident affinity for Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin  —   Mr. Trump has called him a great leader and echoed his policies toward NATO, Ukraine and the war in Syria  —   and the hacks of leading Democrats like John D. Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign, are clear indications that Russia has taken sides in the presidential race and that voters should know what the F. B. I. has found. The F. B. I. ’s inquiries into Russia’s possible role continue, as does the investigation into the emails involving Mrs. Clinton’s top aide, Huma Abedin, on a computer she shared with her estranged husband, Anthony D. Weiner. Mrs. Clinton’s supporters argue that voters have as much right to know what the F. B. I. has found in Mr. Trump’s case, even if the findings are not yet conclusive. “You do not hear the director talking about any other investigation he is involved in,” Representative Gregory W. Meeks, Democrat of New York, said after Mr. Comey’s letter to Congress was made public. “Is he investigating the Trump Foundation? Is he looking into the Russians hacking into all of our emails? Is he looking into and deciding what is going on with regards to other allegations of the Trump Organization?” Mr. Comey would not even confirm the existence of any investigation of Mr. Trump’s aides when asked during an appearance in September before Congress. In the Obama administration’s internal deliberations over identifying the Russians as the source of the hacks, Mr. Comey also argued against doing so and succeeded in keeping the F. B. I. ’s imprimatur off the formal findings, a law enforcement official said. His stance was first reported by CNBC. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the minority leader, responded angrily on Sunday with a letter accusing the F. B. I. of not being forthcoming about Mr. Trump’s alleged ties with Moscow. “It has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisers, and the Russian government  —   a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States, which Trump praises at every opportunity,” Mr. Reid wrote. “The public has a right to know this information. ” F. B. I. officials declined to comment on Monday. Intelligence officials have said in interviews over the last six weeks that apparent connections between some of Mr. Trump’s aides and Moscow originally compelled them to open a broad investigation into possible links between the Russian government and the Republican presidential candidate. Still, they have said that Mr. Trump himself has not become a target. And no evidence has emerged that would link him or anyone else in his business or political circle directly to Russia’s election operations. At least one part of the investigation has involved Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman for much of the year. Mr. Manafort, a veteran Republican political strategist, has had extensive business ties in Russia and other former Soviet states, especially Ukraine, where he served as an adviser to that country’s ousted president, Viktor F. Yanukovych. But the focus in that case was on Mr. Manafort’s ties with a kleptocratic government in Ukraine  —   and whether he had declared the income in the United States  —   and not necessarily on any Russian influence over Mr. Trump’s campaign, one official said. In classified sessions in August and September, intelligence officials also briefed congressional leaders on the possibility of financial ties between Russians and people connected to Mr. Trump. They focused particular attention on what cyberexperts said appeared to be a mysterious computer back channel between the Trump Organization and the Alfa Bank, which is one of Russia’s biggest banks and whose owners have longstanding ties to Mr. Putin. F. B. I. officials spent weeks examining computer data showing an odd stream of activity to a Trump Organization server and Alfa Bank. Computer logs obtained by The New York Times show that two servers at Alfa Bank sent more than 2, 700 “ ” messages  —   a first step for one system’s computers to talk to another  —   to a   server beginning in the spring. But the F. B. I. ultimately concluded that there could be an innocuous explanation, like a marketing email or spam, for the computer contacts. The most serious part of the F. B. I. ’s investigation has focused on the computer hacks that the Obama administration now formally blames on Russia. That investigation also involves numerous officials from the intelligence agencies. Investigators, the officials said, have become increasingly confident, based on the evidence they have uncovered, that Russia’s direct goal is not to support the election of Mr. Trump, as many Democrats have asserted, but rather to disrupt the integrity of the political system and undermine America’s standing in the world more broadly. The hacking, they said, reflected an intensification of    operations that never entirely abated after the Cold War but that have become more aggressive in recent years as relations with Mr. Putin’s Russia have soured. A senior intelligence official, who like the others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a continuing national security investigation, said the Russians had become adept at exploiting computer vulnerabilities created by the relative openness of and reliance on the internet. Election officials in several states have reported what appeared to be cyberintrusions from Russia, and while many doubt that an Election Day hack could alter the outcome of the election, the F. B. I. agencies across the government are on alert for potential disruptions that could wreak havoc with the voting process itself. “It isn’t about the election,” a second senior official said, referring to the aims of Russia’s interference. “It’s about a threat to democracy. ” The investigation has treated it as a counterintelligence operation as much as a criminal one, though agents are also focusing on whether anyone in the United States was involved. The officials declined to discuss any individual targets of the investigation, even when assured of anonymity. As has been the case with the investigation into Mrs. Clinton, the F. B. I. has come under intense partisan political pressure  —   something the bureau’s leaders have long sought to avoid. Supporters of both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump have been equally impassioned in calling for investigations  —   and even in providing leads for investigators to follow. Mr. Reid, in a letter to Mr. Comey in August, asserted that Mr. Trump’s campaign “has employed a number of individuals with significant and disturbing ties to the Russia and the Kremlin. ” Although Mr. Reid cited no evidence and offered no names explicitly, he clearly referred to one of Mr. Trump’s earlier campaign advisers, Carter Page. Mr. Page, a former Merrill Lynch banker who founded an investment company in New York, Global Energy Capital, drew attention during the summer for a speech in which he criticized the United States and other Western nations for a “hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change” in Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union. Mr. Page responded with his own letter to Mr. Comey, denying wrongdoing and calling Mr. Reid’s accusations “a witch hunt. ” In an interview, he said that he had never been contacted by the F. B. I. and that the accusations were baseless and purely partisan because of his policy views on Russia. “These people really seem to be grasping at straws,” he said. Democrats have also accused another Republican strategist and Trump confidant, Roger Stone, of being a conduit between the Russian hackers and WikiLeaks, which has published the emails of the Democratic National Committee and Mr. Podesta, the Clinton campaign manager. Mr. Stone boasted of having contacts with the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, and appeared to predict the hacking of Mr. Podesta’s account, though he later denied having any prior knowledge. Mr. Stone derided the accusations and those raised by Michael J. Morell, a former C. I. A. director and a Clinton supporter, who has called Mr. Trump “an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation. ” In an article on the conservative news site Breitbart, Mr. Stone denied having links to Russians and called the accusations “the new McCarthyism. ”",0
19299,"Revel in the Bounty of Spring, With a Feast From Yotam Ottolenghi - The New York Times","The first thing Yotam Ottolenghi did before he began cooking a   feast for family and friends  —   before sliding the lamb into the oven, before building four salads, before assembling an immense layer cake, before he even started to sort through the mountain of ingredients stacked on the kitchen counters  —   was to take a look at the china on which the food would eventually be served. “Food styling is what I do best,” he said. “So I start at the end, with the plates and platters. And then I start to cook. ” This is a task many home cooks ignore, then wonder why their meals are not quite as beautiful as the ones photographed in Ottolenghi’s   books or served at his London restaurants and takeout shops. He put the names of the dishes he was going to cook onto sheets of paper and then matched each one with the platter that he thought would best highlight the food’s color and shape: cerulean blue for some plumlike beets, for instance, and a stark white for the grilled and crispy meat. It took about five minutes. But in the world of Ottolenghi, what food looks like, and how it is served, matters as much as how delicious it is. And it is very delicious. Ottolenghi, 47, is a British citizen who was born and raised in Israel. Married with two young boys, he is also the paterfamilias of a much bigger Ottolenghi household: partners and employees in a thriving business that includes three restaurants, two shops, books (five and counting, starting with “Ottolenghi: The Cookbook,” in 2008) and a regular newspaper column. Ottolenghi’s food is vaguely vegetarian, but not exclusively so, a mix of Israeli and Palestinian and Turkish and Syrian and Armenian and Asian influences that he has made seem effortlessly elegant  —   at least if you can find the right spices. (Which you can if you have access to an international market or the Internet.) For a generation of home cooks whose crowning glory might have been a glistening Sunday roast accompanied by wan vegetables, the brightly colored, richly scented salads and side dishes prepared in his kitchens and outlined in his recipes provide a kind of gateway to culinary excellence, with color and smell and flavor all wrapped together in a magnificent synesthetic whole. It was that larger clan Ottolenghi was cooking with and for this day, a group of friends who have found their professional and personal lives aligned around a shared enterprise and common aesthetic. It was a busman’s holiday for people who really like to drive buses. There was Tara Wigley, with whom he collaborates on books and recipes. She had offered up the kitchen and garden of her South London home for the feast. With her were Sarah Joseph and Esme Howarth, two cooks who labor alongside Ottolenghi in the   atelier he maintains at his headquarters in Camden. Others would arrive later to mix cocktails, grill things, open wine. It would be a day of work, perhaps, but one that ended with a grand party. “I don’t see it as a formal thing,” Ottolenghi said. He saw the meal, he said, as a Middle Eastern take on a proper English garden party. Ottolenghi spent the previous afternoon shopping, driving through thick London traffic in his Prius, checking his usual haunts, stores at which he shops for both work and leisure. He went to Godfrey’s in Highbury, the same butcher that supplies his restaurants, for lamb, and chatted amiably with Chris Godfrey, whose family has run the place since 1905. Then he dashed across the street to the serene La Fromagerie for cheese. He tacked toward his home in Camden for verdant herbs and vegetables and luscious yogurt from Parkway Greens, as he does nearly every day with his sons, and then to Kensington High Street for pomegranates, fresh almonds and dried rose petals from Bahar and Zaman, two Iranian shops. The groceries piled high behind him in the car. Those groceries took up most of the counter space in Wigley’s kitchen. Ottolenghi is a list maker, as anyone preparing a lot of food for a lot of people ought to be, and after he was done selecting platters, he pulled out a folded list of the tasks they needed to complete before everyone arrived. Wigley, Joseph and Howarth gathered around him to talk it through. It was their menu as much as his, and the discussion that followed was familial and cooperative, less a chef barking orders than a group of friends figuring out how best to tackle a crossword puzzle. Here again were important lessons for the home cook who aspires to serve a feast: Do not work alone. And as a corollary: Revel in it. Choose a menu collaboratively, one in which all the dishes emerge from the same larder, complementing one another, and then cook it collaboratively as well, so that if there is immense bounty on the table when you’re done, no one has become exhausted preparing it. By noon, the kitchen was humming with activity. The lamb, which was now in the oven, perfumed the air with ginger and cumin and cloves. Howarth blackened eggplants on the stovetop as the first step in creating a kind of deconstructed baba ghanouj, while Wigley sliced cherry tomatoes and red onions for a salad she would mix with pomegranate seeds, little hunks of feta and copious amounts of mint, basil and za’atar, the Middle Eastern spice blend generally made of oregano, thyme, salt and toasted sesame seeds. Joseph, meanwhile, wedged herself into a corner and began to fill a roasting pan with beets and whole heads of garlic. She was going to roast them all into softness, then use the garlic in     yogurt and place the caramelized beets on top. Ottolenghi said he wanted to prepare the yogurt. “I do like to cook, you know,” he said. The dishes mounted. They built a delicate bowl of sliced cucumber and mâche. It was a taste of spring scattered with mint and cilantro leaves and showered in nigella seeds, with a dressing of yogurt and ginger, garlic and lemon juice that they would dot onto the salad just as it was served. There was basmati rice to bake as well, with shallots, garlic, fresh curry leaves and saffron, a surprisingly rich and flavorful combination, a dish that would pair with almost any grilled or roasted meat. “I’ll do it!” Howarth said eagerly. The four cooks worked together as touring concert musicians might, taking a day off just to jam. Dessert was complicated. The plan was to build what Ottolenghi calls a celebration cake, a dessert he serves at catered events. Helen Goh, a longtime pastry collaborator, with whom he is writing a book on baking, was coming to the feast. Ottolenghi, who trained as a pastry chef at Le Cordon Bleu in London after finishing a master’s thesis in philosophy at Tel Aviv University, wanted it to be perfect for her: layers of cake held together not by flour or nuts but by what Ottolenghi called “the magic of whipped egg whites, sabayon and the chilling effect of the freezer. ” The day before, he made a   ganache. He also baked the spongy cake layers and put them in the freezer overnight. Now he needed only to put the cake together, a task he set to with intense concentration, straightening only to examine his work, somewhat critically. “I think it’s best if it is superrustic,” he said. And here once more was guidance for the home cook. This cake was far from perfect. The edges of the layers were not flawlessly cut. There were cracks across their centers. The cream was loosely applied, and the berries on top of it were spread almost  . And yet: They were not. The cake looked incredibly elegant. When he was finished, Ottolenghi gathered the platters and started to fill them. Again he bent to the job, his back almost parallel to the floor, arranging the food just so, a heron at work. It might have seemed precious except that the results far outstripped the time spent achieving them. He placed the dishes on a sideboard to await the start of the party. “  food is so horrible,” he said. “You can let it sit out and be beautiful instead. ” The kitchen, already crowded, began to fill with family and friends. Ramael Scully, the head chef at Ottolenghi’s NOPI, arrived and quickly headed toward the grill. Scully was born in Malaysia to parents of Chinese, Indian, Malay and Irish descent and raised in Australia. “So I like to burn things,” he said when he arrived. “Scully’s the man in the family,” Ottolenghi replied, to laughter. Ottolenghi’s husband, Karl Ottolenghi Allen, followed with their older son, Max, who is 3. Ottolenghi picked him up and smothered him with kisses, before Wigley’s three children burst downstairs to take Max to the garden. Sami Tamimi, the Palestinian chef who collaborated with Ottolenghi on two cookbooks (including the   “Jerusalem” from 2012) was hard on their heels. Everyone was hugging everyone else, gossiping and catching up, palming fresh almonds off the counter as snacks. A party had broken out and spilled from the kitchen into the garden. The whole tableau came together there in perfect   light: a large, boisterous family bound together by business and love. Ottolenghi intercepted his son running across the grass. Adults had started to gather around the table, to seat themselves and pour one another wine. “Let’s roll up our sleeves, Max,” Ottolenghi said. “Let’s eat a lot of food. ” Recipes: Jerusalem Lamb Shawarma |    Salad | Tomato and Pomegranate Salad | Baba Ghanouj, Deconstructed | Grilled Asparagus With Caper Salsa | Baked Rice | Celebration Cake",0
19300,Social Media Happy Shot Elephant Crushed a Hunter to Death - Breitbart,"A hunting expedition went seriously wrong in Zimbabwe on Friday when South African big game hunter Theunis Botha was crushed to death by a charging elephant, after it was shot by a fellow hunter. [Botha, better known for his prowess as a leopard and lion hunter, led hunting excursions with his company Game and Hounds Safaris. The    father of five paid the ultimate price by choosing to lead a safari to hunt wild elephants, when he mistakenly steered his party into a herd of breeding pachyderms.   One elephant charged the hunters and surprised Botha by picking him up with his trunk, reported the Daily Wire. A fellow hunter shot the   creature to save Botha, but it crashed to the ground and crushed Botha to death. Many who knew Botha described him as a “passionate and professional hunting pioneer,” and paid tribute to him on his company’s website: “RIP Theunis Botha. Our heartfelt condolences to Carike and family. He was a great man! So sad!” “A legend has fallen but will never be forgotten  …     It’s with a sad heart that we say goodbye to you Oom Theunis Botha. ” “Our deepest condolences to the family. May God be with you all in this difficult time. ” Botha’s daughter posted pictures of her father, including one of them together after shooting a gazelle a few years back.  The hunter had his detractors as well. Commenters posting on his 2012 YouTube safari video (below) demonstrated their glee that Botha was killed. ”Karma took care of you! ,” “Hey a**hole. I hope you rot in hell,” and “I am super glad he got what was coming to him,” commenters wrote. ",0

Con la intención de garantizar que su mujer es “la mejor americana disponible en estos momentos”, el nuevo presidente de los Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, convocará con carácter de urgencia las elecciones a primera dama. “Las últimas elecciones demuestran que la democracia funciona, por lo que creo que la figura de la esposa del presidente no debe ser ajena a este proceso y su figura debe ser valorada y juzgada por todo el mundo”, ha declarado el magnate esta mañana desde Washington. 
“No podemos estar seguros de que Melania sea la primera dama correcta si no se somete a una competición con todas las otras mujeres mayores de edad de los Estados Unidos”, ha explicado el nuevo presidente de los Estados Unidos. 
Según Trump, los americanos están ya acostumbrados a valorar y opinar sobre mujeres con severidad “por lo que votarlas en unas elecciones no será un problema”. 
“Mañana pondremos en fila a todas las candidatas y yo mismo elegiré a la mejor en un proceso democrático transparente y justo”, ha insistido. 
Trump, sin embargo, ha tenido unas palabras cariñosas con su actual esposa y confía en que no tendrá problemas en ser elegida primera. “Melania, mi actual mujer, ya superó un proceso muy duro de elección en su país de origen, en las bodegas del barco que la trajeron a Estados Unidos y en el sótano oscuro en el que a escogerla, no va a tener ningún problema en resultar vencedora en las elecciones”, ha explicado el presidente. 
El político también cree que sería bueno para el país que la primera dama “fueran dos mellizas” o incluso un equipo de primeras damas “a fin de garantizar la mayor eficiencia posible”. 
Pese a su confianza en Melania, fuentes de la Casa Blanca han informado de que Trump apuesta por el continuismo de Michele Obama en el cargo. “No sólo ha mostrado solvencia durante cuatro años sino que puede ser una experiencia interesante tanto para ella como para mí”, defiende el presidente. 
Según las fuentes, su hija Tiffany es otra de las candidatas preferidas por el propio Trump.",0

Marc Rich traded with America’s enemies. He traded with Ayatollah Khomeini’s Iran when the Ayatollah held 53 Americans hostage in 1979. He made $2 billion selling oil to South Africa during the UN embargo of the country. He did deals with Khadafy’s Libya,Milosevic’s Yugoslavia, Kim Il Sung’s North Korea, Communist dictatorships in Cuba and the Soviet Union itself.

19305,Activist Wins Interim Decision to Ban ‘Chief Wahoo’ at MLB Games in Toronto,"In a temporary win for political correctness the Cleveland Indians and parent company, Rogers Communications, lost an interim decision to throw out a discrimination claim alleging that the team’s mascot “Chief Wahoo” and their logo are offensive and discriminatory. [Douglas Cardinal, a Canadian architect who designed the Smithsonian’s National Museum of the American Indian and is a member of the Blackfoot tribe, filed suit in October that using the Cleveland team name “Indians” and the “Chief Wahoo” logo and mascot during games at the Toronto Blue Jays Rogers Centre violates discrimination laws under the Ontario Human Rights Code.   Cardinal’s objective is to ban the Cleveland Indians from donning their team name or logos at MLB games played in Toronto. “As an Indigenous person, I am encouraged that the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal has accepted jurisdiction over my complaint and agrees that it can proceed to a hearing,” said Cardinal in an official statement.  “Unfortunately, the consciousness of genocide and apartheid continues to be fostered by the insensitive use of demeaning and degrading symbols, mocking indigenous peoples,” Cardinal added. “This must cease in order for reconciliation to have any meaning and substance. ” On May 23, according to a document filed at canlii. com, Tribunal adjudicator   Pickel ruled that Cardinal had standing to bring suit against the Indians and Rogers. “If the applicant was either not indigenous, not a baseball fan, and not otherwise interested in attending games at the Rogers Centre, my finding on the issue of standing would have been different,” she wrote. “In my view, the applicant has asserted a sufficient personal interest to have standing to bring this application. ”  You can read Pickel’s  full ruling here. If Cardinal should win, the team would have to remove the name “Indians” and the Wahoo imagery from their uniforms when playing games in Canada.  Bill Baer at NBC Sports reports that MLB fans are the oldest of all sports fans. When they die off, younger fans will be   with Cardinal and the notion that such mascots and imagery are racist. “MLB will have trouble courting them with racist iconography,” he writes.  “Even if the humanity argument doesn’t persuade one —  which it should, full stop —  the business angle should be convincing enough to anyone involved in fighting this battle to preserve Chief Wahoo that it’s a lost cause. ”",0
19306,CAN IT GET MORE CORRUPT? Bill That Bans Naming Officers Involved in Shootings Goes to Pennsylvania Governor,"Editor’s Note : Disgusting. This country just gets more and more corrupt by the day… it’s insane. Pretty soon it will collapse of its own weight under so much disgusting corruption.

The Pennsylvania legislature has passed a law prohibiting the release of officers’ names for up to 30 days after a police-related death has occurred. It was backed by Philadelphia police unions and will become law if signed by Democratic Governor Tom Wolf.
The measure passed Thursday after the Republican-controlled legislature voted along party lines. If the bill becomes law, it will prevent public officials from releasing the names of officers involved in shootings which cause death or “ serious bodily injury ” for up to 30 days after the incident, or until the conclusion of an official investigation.
The bill, HB 1538, was sponsored by state Rep. Martina White (R-Philadelphia) and is a direct contradiction of the Philadelphia Police Department’s policy of releasing names within 72 hours of a shooting.
The 72-hour rule was created by the Department of Justice and put into place by former police commissioner Charles H. Ramsey in 2014, after it was recommended. Speaking in support of the rule at the time, Ramsey said : “ I don’t think you can reasonably expect to shoot people and remain anonymous. ”
However, the influential Philadelphia Police Union has defended HB 1538.
“ We’re just asking to put a lid on the boiling pot until things calm down, especially if it’s an investigation that could lead to protests in the community, ” John McNesby, president of the 14,500-strong union, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
White claims the bill is needed, due to the dangers faced by police officers
“ I was watching the television and just saw how officers are being gunned down and other officers in different states had been subjected to harassment and the very things that they are trying to protect citizens like ourselves from experiencing, and to me the 72-hour rule is really just an arbitrary number, ” White told the Post-Gazette.
However, neither McNesby nor White could identify any instances of officers or their families being harmed due to being publicly identified.
McNesby told the Post-Gazette that he was unaware of any direct threats that had taken place, but said “ that’s what we’re looking to stop before it becomes a reality. ”
The American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania has criticized the bill, calling it “ a policy that will heighten tensions between the police and the communities they serve” and accusing it of being “completely tone deaf to the needs of communities that are impacted by police brutality. ”
Rep. Margo Davidson (D-Delaware County) has also spoken out against the bill, saying it undermines “ the bridges that have been built between law enforcement and communities of color. ” She added that “ this legislation will do nothing but breed suspicion. ”
Davidson, along with many other Philadelphia Democrats, opposed the bill in the 151-32 vote.
Governor Wolf has yet to comment on whether or not he will sign the bill, which passed the Senate and House with a veto-proof majority. If Wolf still decides to veto, an override of that veto would only be able to take place after the next election.

19307,Biggest Insurance Company in Obamacare Exchanges Rallies Behind Ryan’s Obamacare 2.0 - Breitbart,"Anthem, the nation’s second largest health insurance company, backed the Republican leadership’s plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. [Anthem addressed House Republicans in a letter, saying  the “time to act is now” to address the faltering individual insurance market. The health insurance giant urged Republicans to move “as quickly as possible. ”  Anthem CEO Joseph Swedish wrote to the chairmen of the House Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means committees that the leadership’s bill “addresses the challenges immediately facing the individual market and will ensure more affordable health plan choices for consumers in the short term. ” The health insurance company supports the Ryan plan’s provisions to repeal Obamacare’s health insurance tax, temporarily continuing Obamacare’s   subsidies, and doling out tax credits for those on the Obamacare exchanges. Anthem CEO Swedish explained, “These provisions are essential and must be finalized quickly to have the intended impact on products and prices to benefit consumers. ” The Blues Association asked the Republican leadership to drop a   30 percent premium surcharge on individuals who fail to maintain their health insurance throughout the entire year, warning that it could destabilize the market. Republicans added the provision to the bill. Senator Rand Paul ( ) told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview that the insurance companies stand to benefit from Paul Ryan’s Obamacare repeal plan. Paul said that “They actually subsidize the insurance companies. Right now, insurance companies are losing money and Obamacare has this rescue thing called ‘risk corridors’ to bail out the insurance companies. Paul Ryan has got the same thing, he just calls it reinsurance and it’s $100 million worth. I predict that might not even be enough. So I don’t like any of it. ”",0
19308,"Debbie Reynolds, Wholesome Ingénue in 1950s Films, Dies at 84 - The New York Times","Debbie Reynolds, the wholesome ingénue in 1950s films like “Singin’ in the Rain” and “Tammy and the Bachelor,” died on Wednesday, a day after the death of her daughter, the actress Carrie Fisher. She was 84. Her death, following a stroke, was confirmed by her son, Todd Fisher, according to her agent, Tom Markley of the Metropolitan Talent Agency. Ms. Reynolds was taken to a Los Angeles hospital on Wednesday afternoon. According to the celebrity news site TMZ, she had been discussing funeral plans for Ms. Fisher, who died on Tuesday after having a heart attack during a flight to Los Angeles last Friday. [ Read Carrie Fisher’s obituary | Watch Debbie Reynolds perform ] On Tuesday, Ms. Reynolds had expressed gratitude to her daughter’s fans on Facebook. “Thank you to everyone who has embraced the gifts and talents of my beloved and amazing daughter,” she wrote. “I am grateful for your thoughts and prayers that are now guiding her to her next stop. ” Ms. Reynolds’s career peak may have been her   Academy Award nomination for playing the title role in “The Unsinkable Molly Brown” (1964) a    western musical based on a true story. Her   film is probably “Singin’ in the Rain” (1952) the classic MGM musical about 1920s moviemaking, in which she held her own with Gene Kelly and Donald O’Connor, although she was only 19 when the movie was shot and had never danced professionally before. Her fans may cherish her sentimental   portrayals, like the title role in “Tammy and the Bachelor” (1957) in which she played a Louisiana moonshiner’s   granddaughter who spouted folksy wisdom. Her greatest fame, however, may have come not from any movie role but from the Hollywood scandal involving her husband and a glamorous young widow. In 1955, Ms. Reynolds married Eddie Fisher, the boyish music idol whose hits included “Oh! My  ” and “I’m Walking Behind You,” and the young couple were embraced by fan magazines as America’s sweethearts. Their best friends were the producer Mike Todd and his new wife, the   film star Elizabeth Taylor. When Mr. Todd died in a   crash in 1958, Ms. Reynolds and Mr. Fisher rushed to comfort Ms. Taylor. Mr. Fisher’s comforting, however, turned into a very public extramarital affair. He and Ms. Reynolds were divorced early the next year, and he and Ms. Taylor were married weeks later. That marriage lasted five years. Ms. Taylor left Mr. Fisher for Richard Burton, whom she had met in Rome on the set of “Cleopatra” (1963). Almost 40 years later, in an interview with The Chicago   Ms. Reynolds said of Ms. Taylor, “Probably she did me a great favor. ” In her 1988 autobiography, “Debbie: My Life,” she described a marriage that was unhappy from the beginning. “He didn’t think I was funny,” Ms. Reynolds wrote of Mr. Fisher. “I wasn’t good in bed. I didn’t make good gefilte fish or good chopped liver. So what did he have? A cute little girl next door with a little   nose. That was, in fact, all he actually ever said he wanted from me. The children, he said, better have your nose. ” Mary Frances Reynolds was born on April 1, 1932, in El Paso. Her father, Ray, worked for the railroad and struggled financially during the Depression. Her mother, Maxene, took in laundry to help make ends meet. As members of the Church of the Nazarene, they considered movies sinful. With the promise of a better job, Ray moved to California when Mary Frances was 7, and the family soon followed. Her career dream was to go to college and become a gym teacher, she often said, but when she was named Miss Burbank 1948, everything changed. Two of the judges were   scouts, and she was soon under contract to Warner Bros. which changed her name. In 1950, she had her first screen credit in “The Daughter of Rosie O’Grady,” a musical comedy starring June Haver and Gordon MacRae. (Two years earlier she had a small uncredited part in “June Bride. ”) The same year, she played Helen Kane, the 1920s singer known as the     girl, in “Three Little Words” and also appeared in “Two Weeks With Love,” in which she sang “Aba Daba Honeymoon” with Carleton Carpenter. The song became a huge novelty hit. Her roles seemed to mirror 1950s attitudes toward love, marriage and family. In 1955, she played a     girl opposite Frank Sinatra in “The Tender Trap. ” In 1956, she starred with her new husband, Mr. Fisher, in “Bundle of Joy,” a musical remake of the 1939 comedy “Bachelor Mother. ” After the    scandal, Ms. Reynolds rode on a crest of good will and was a popular   in a long string of films, mostly lighthearted romantic comedies, including “The Gazebo” (1959) “Say One for Me” (1959) and “The Pleasure of His Company” (1961). She also played the title role in “The Singing Nun” (1966) appeared in “Divorce American Style” (1967) and was part of the   ensemble cast of “How the West Was Won” (1963) a rare drama among her more than three dozen movie credits. “Drama’s unhappy, and playing someone unhappy would make me unhappy,” she told The Boston Globe in 1990. “Ain’t for me, honey. ” She took a stab at series television with a sitcom, “The Debbie Reynolds Show” (1969) in which she played a wacky Lucy   wife who wanted to be a journalist like her husband. It lasted only one season. But she soon achieved a kind of immortality as the voice of Charlotte the selfless spider in the animated film version of E. B. White’s children’s classic “Charlotte’s Web” (1973). She had married Harry Karl, a wealthy shoe retailer, in 1960, but by the time they divorced in 1973, he had gambled away or otherwise misspent his fortune and hers. Ms. Reynolds set out to   herself financially. She headed to New York that year to make her Broadway debut in a revival of the 1920s musical “Irene,” for which she received a Tony Award nomination for best actress in a musical. In 1976, she had a     Broadway show, “Debbie. ” She made her last Broadway appearance in 1983, taking over the role originated by Lauren Bacall in the musical version of “Woman of the Year. ” She later toured the country with stage shows including a new version of “The Unsinkable Molly Brown. ” She had taken her musical and comedy talents to Las Vegas as early as 1960 and became a fixture there in the ’70s and ’80s. She and her third husband, Richard Hamlett, a Virginia real estate developer, established their own hotel, casino and   museum there. But there were financial problems, and the property had to be sold in the ’90s. A decade or so later, it looked as if Ms. Reynolds would finally find a permanent home for her Hollywood memorabilia museum, this time in Pigeon Forge, Tenn. the home of Dolly Parton’s theme park, Dollywood. But that, too, fell through, and in 2011, a large portion of her collection was auctioned at the Paley Center in Beverly Hills. Two sales, the first in June and the second in December, took in a little more than $25 million, including $4. 6 million for the dress Marilyn Monroe wore in the famous   scene in “The Seven Year Itch. ” For a while, Ms. Reynolds seemed to be better known as the mother of Ms. Fisher  —   who shot to stardom as Princess Leia in the “Star Wars” movies and wrote semiautobiographical novels  —   than as an actress or singer. Ms. Fisher’s 1987 book, “Postcards From the Edge,” made into a film starring Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine, reflected the sometimes difficult relationship between her and her famous mother. Ms. Reynolds’s career took something of a back seat to her personal life when she married Mr. Hamlett in 1984, but they divorced 12 years later. In 1996, Ms. Reynolds made an     comeback when Albert Brooks cast her as his   yet admirably   widowed mother in “Mother. ” Her uncharacteristically   comic performance earned her a Golden Globe nomination, though not the Oscar nomination that many had predicted. The next year, she played Kevin Kline’s mother in the   film comedy “In  Out. ” And beginning in 1999, she won new fans with a recurring role on the NBC sitcom “Will  Grace” as Bobbi Adler, the Debra Messing character’s gregarious, uninhibited mother, who had a tendency to burst into song (show tunes, of course). Ms. Reynolds continued acting and doing voice work in both films and television into her late 70s. In 2013, she appeared as Liberace’s   mother in the HBO movie “Behind the Candelabra,” with Michael Douglas as Liberace. She appears in the documentary “Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds,” which was shown at the New York Film Festival in October, and of which her son, Mr. Fisher, is a producer. She is survived by Mr. Fisher and a granddaughter, Billie Lourd.",0

Allen West told baseball pitching great Curt Schilling, the host of Whatever It Takes, that it is important to take care of our veterans and the warriors down range in a Thursday interview. [“I know that we are not taking care of our veterans,” said Schilling, whose show broadcasts weekdays from 9:00 a. m. to 11:00 a. m. at Breitbart. com, with replays available at Soundcloud. . “I am embarrassed that my country does not take care of its veterans. ”  West, a former Republican congressman from Florida, said, “That is why we need more veterans serving in the House and Senate. ” The former battalion commander in Iraq told Schilling if there were more veterans in Congress, they would stop programs like the $17 million program to decide which handgun should replace the Beretta 9mm. Schilling asked West, as someone who deployed overseas, how does a democracy like the United States that accepts the Law of Warfare prepare its soldiers to combat an enemy that plays by no rules? “This is what I told my soldiers before we deployed in 2003 to Iraq: ‘The person that you are here in the United States of America in this environment, you have to leave that person here,’” he said. “When you get on the airplane, the person that lands over there has to be a different person,” he said. “The person who lands over there in a combat theater of operations needs to understand their task and purpose,” he said. “They have to understand they have to protect themselves and they have to protect the soldiers to their left and to their right —  and they have to realize that they are in an environment where any man, woman, or child can potentially be the enemy. ” West said before going into a combat zone, at some point the soldier’s training must be supplemented by the soldier’s own will to fight and survive. Given that the Rules of Engagement are so restrictive and the penalties so severe, soldiers must make   decisions under an unfair duress, he said. “We cannot have our men and women   themselves because they are concerned about any type of legal ramifications. ” West said we need to do a better job preparing the American people for war so that they understand the enemy we are facing and what our soldiers need to do to defeat that enemy. It is sickening that Army 1st Lt. Chris Lorance was sentenced to 20 years at Fort Leavenworth for firing upon the enemy, but Army Pvt. Chelsea Manning had her sentence commuted by President Barack Obama and Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl still has not been   for deserting his post in Afghanistan, the colonel said.

19310,The Brexiter’s guide to what’s British,"The Brexiter’s guide to what’s British 04-11-16 
GOOD Brexit morning. Since June 24th, it has become apparent that some things which claim to be British are anything but, and only loyal Brexiters can tell the difference. 
Here’s the ultimate Brexiter’s guide to what is British and what will leave our shores forever when the Sacred Emerald is placed in the Queen’s crown to trigger Article 50: 
The British legal system – not British. Based on the Magna Carta, clearly not native to these shores as it has a foreign name, the British legal system has spent centuries convicting British people who must logically be innocent by virtue of their nationality. 
The BBC – not British. The ‘British’ in the BBC’s name is a Trojan horse which sneaks multicultural propaganda into the homes and hearts of decent patriots. All BBC News programmes have been entirely fictional since 1964. 
News International – British. This US-owned media corporation is as British as steak-and-ale pie, dog-fighting in rural barns and Oxo. 
16,141,241 Remain voters – not British. Probably Brazilian. Go back to Brazil. 
Winning World War II – British. America was involved at the very, very end, for between five and ten minutes. Russia had no idea it was even going on. 
Parliament – not British. None of them were elected. They were all appointed by a cabal of elite judges who are all homosexuals.

19311,Fascism? Environmentalists Force Coal Plant Closure. Town’s Economy Hit HARD…,"Louder With Crowder October 27, 2016 
Sometimes a thin layer of crust accumulates on the surface of the ocean, mostly made up of fecal matter and trash. It’s where environmentalists come from. 
They are, effectively, the pits. Also, environmentalists hate people (see Top 5 Environmentalists Who Openly Support Killing Off Humans ). A side effect of being sad, soggy little bottom dwellers. So it’s no surprise they want to kill off coal mines in Montana , despite the fact that said coal mines are pillars which help support the economy and the town’s well being. Also electric cars , but whatever: 
The 2,300 residents in Southeast Montana face an uphill battle to keep the city alive against an onslaught of legal battles and a major anti-coal crusade launched by outsiders. 
An out of court agreement was reached to close two of the four units of Colstrip’s coal-fired power plant by 2022. The Sierra Club and the Montana Environmental Information Center, which sued the plant, see the closure as a victory. 
Plant operators came to an agreement with activists [because] Oregon Democratic Gov. signed legislation mandating the state be coal-free by 2030… 
Consequences. 
It’s a win for everybody. Except the people employed by the coal plant… Also, Colstrip’s entire economy. Coal plant workers make money, then spend that money at other businesses. Except now all those lads will be jobless, which means they won’t be spending money or helping to boost the economy as much anymore, which means other businesses will suffer. Thanks environmentalists. 
By the way, “Green Earth” SJWs tend to also be fans of the Indians . The people, not the baseball team. Racist. That wee tidbit is worth noting, considering how their eco-friendly plan isn’t very native-friendly… 
“You lose two of those units, and you are shutting down half the town,” Small said. “This closure will have an economic impact on the reservations, throughout the County and across the State…” Small is of North Cheyenne descent. He’s made an extra effort to recruit American Indian students… Nearly three dozen Northern Cheyenne work at the Colstrip plant, and three times that figure work in the coal fields. 
A double header. Bad for the economy, bad for the indigenous people. 
As mentioned above, the coal plant never stood a chance. Thanks to impending regulations, the plant has long seen the end drawing near. Possibly because they would rather close indefinitely in order to be spared from ever having to hear another squawking lobbyist attempt to “talk” them into seeing things their way. Whatever the reason, environmentalists and the state teamed up to bully the coal plant into shutting down. Now the future of an entire town lies in jeopardy. 
Environmentalists happily stomped their cloven hooves all over people’s livelihoods. But hey, less smog. #Caring 
Also, man–made climate change of the hot hots is a myth. Stop it. This article was posted: Thursday, October 27, 2016 at 5:55 am Share this article",0
19312,Watch: First Lady Melania Trump Weeps at National Cathedral,"First Lady Melania Trump wept as    Marlana VanHoose sang the hymn “How Great Thou Art” during the Inaugural Prayer Service at the Washington National Cathedral in the nation’s capital on Saturday morning. [Hundreds of worshippers joined President Donald Trump the First Lady Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen most of the Cabinet and Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy for an ecumenical prayer, featuring a wide variety of faiths.  The service, which has become part of the inaugural tradition over the past several decades, sounded a message of national unity, echoing a theme that featured in several of Friday’s inaugural addresses as well. On Saturday morning, with politicians seated in the pews as ordinary congregants, and religious leaders and laypeople leading them in prayer, without the pomp and ceremony of the day before, there was a sense of humility shared by all in the chapel, as well as a palpable sense of joy. There were many highlights from the deeply moving service. VanHoose, however, provided the service’s most poignant moment. VanHoose  —   who is blind, and has mild cerebral palsy  —   performed the   hymn, whose words include: “I see the   hear the rolling   power   universe displayed. ” (Watch the videos below from different angles.)  The First Lady, seated in the front row, appeared to wipe away tears several times, and rose to her feet to lead a standing ovation when VanHoose had finished. Rabbis, imams, and representatives of a variety of Christian denominations, as well as several other faiths, offered songs and readings. The Jewish text, for example, was 1 Kings 3:   on King Solomon’s prayer for wisdom  —   and God’s answer. This reporter was quoted by Voice of America: “I felt in many ways this was the heart of the inauguration,” Pollak said. “It was the nation coming together in humility, praying together and asking God for help. ”   …     Political divisions among Americans are part of life, and perhaps they will be felt more intensely in the coming months, Pollak added, “but hopefully those who were present [at the cathedral] and those who watched throughout the country will remember how joyful it was to be together, because it’s moments like these that will guide us through the difficult times. ” UPDATE: President Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump, Jr. tweeted a video of VanHoose’s performance with the comment: “One of the most incredible and moving performances I’ve seen from yesterday’s #NationalPrayerService. ” One of the most incredible and moving performances I’ve seen from yesterday’s #NationalPrayerService https:  .  via youtube,  —   Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) January 22, 2017,  Joel B.

Carney said: “I’m off to Canada, which will hopefully be far enough away that I can’t hear the sound of this shithole country sliding into the Atlantic.

Its a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people, and serve the people it will.

We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. Were going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.
We will also finally take care of our great veterans.
(APPLAUSE)
Theyve been so loyal, and Ive gotten to know so many over this 18-month journey. The time Ive spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors. Our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. Its going to happen.
(APPLAUSE)
We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations willing to get along with us. We will be.

Well have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big, no challenge is too great.
TRUMP: Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach.
America will no longer settle for anything less than the best.
(APPLAUSE)
We must reclaim our countrys destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. Were going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful things once again.
I want to tell the world community that while we will always put Americas interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone  all people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility; partnership, not conflict.
And now Id like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight, very, very historic victory.
First, I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on me right now.
(APPLAUSE)
Great people. Ive learned so much from them. They were wonderful in every regard. I had truly great parents.

And Lara, unbelievable job, unbelievable.
Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much.
What a great group. Youve all given me such incredible support, and I will tell you that we have a large group of people. You know, they kept saying we have a small staff. Not so small. Look at all the people that we have. Look at all of these people.
And Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve and David. We have got  we have got tremendously talented people up here. And I want to tell you, its been  its been very, very special. I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy Giuliani.

Great man.
Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who is that? Is that the mayor that showed up?
(LAUGHTER)
Is that Rudy? Oh, Rudy got up here.
Another great man who has been really a friend to me. But Ill tell you, I got to know him as a competitor because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats: Dr. Ben Carson. Where is Ben?
(APPLAUSE)
Where is Ben?
TRUMP: And by the way, Mike Huckabee is here someplace, and he is fantastic. Mike and his family, Sarah  thank you very much.

A very special person who believed me and, you know, Id read reports that I wasnt getting along with him. I never had a bad second with him. Hes an unbelievable star. He is. . .
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: Thats right. How did you possibly guess? So let me tell you about Reince, and Ive said this. I said, Reince  and I know it, I know. Look at all those people over there. I know it. Reince is a superstar. But I said, They cant call you a superstar, Reince, unless we win, because you cant be called a superstar  like Secretariat  if Secretariat came in second, Secretariat would not have that big, beautiful bronze bust at the track at Belmont.
But Ill tell you, Reince is really a star. And he is the hardest-working guy. And in a certain way, I did this  Reince, come up here. Where is Reince? Get over here, Reince.
(APPLAUSE)
Boy oh boy oh boy. Its about time you did this, Reince. My God.
(APPLAUSE)
Say a few words. No, come on, say something.
RNC CHAIRMAN REINCE PRIEBUS: Ladies and gentlemen, the next president of the United States, Donald Trump.
(APPLAUSE)
Thank you. Its been an honor. God bless. Thank God.
TRUMP: Amazing guy.
Our partnership with the RNC was so important to the success and what weve done.
So I also have to say Ive gotten to know some incredible people  the Secret Service people.
(APPLAUSE)
Theyre tough and theyre smart and theyre sharp, and I dont want to mess around with them, I can tell you. And when I want to go and wave to a big group of people and they rip me down and put me back down on the seat. But they are fantastic people, so I want to thank the Secret Service.
(APPLAUSE)
And law enforcement in New York City. Theyre here tonight.
(APPLAUSE)
These are spectacular people, sometimes underappreciated unfortunately, but we appreciate them. We know what they go through.
So, its been what they call a historic event, but to be really historic, we have to do a great job. And I promise you that I will not let you down. We will do a great job. We will do a great job.
(APPLAUSE)
I look very much forward to being your president, and hopefully at the end of two years or three years or four years, or maybe even eight years. . .
(APPLAUSE)
. . . you will say, so many of you worked so hard for us, but you will say that  you will say that that was something that you really were very proud to do and I can. . .
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: Thank you very much.
And I can only say that while the campaign is over, our work on this movement is now really just beginning.
(APPLAUSE)
Were going to get to work immediately for the American people. And were going to be doing a job that hopefully you will be so proud of your president. Youll be so proud. Again, its my honor. It was an amazing evening. Its been an amazing two-year period. And I love this country.
(APPLAUSE) Thank you. Thank you very much.
(APPLAUSE)
Thank you to Mike Pence. Thank you.

19315,Federal Reserve Fines Goldman Sachs $36 Million in Document Leak - The New York Times,"The Federal Reserve took action on Wednesday against Goldman Sachs and one of its former executives, escalating a   investigation into a leak of confidential government information. The action, which forced Goldman to pay a $36. 3 million penalty, stemmed from an incident in 2014, when a junior Goldman banker took confidential information from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The junior banker, whom Goldman promptly fired, received the information from a New York Fed employee. Both men  pleaded guilty to stealing government property, and Goldman paid a $50 million penalty to New York State regulators because its “management failed to effectively supervise” the banker. The Fed did not act against Goldman at the time, making its decision to pursue Goldman now a somewhat unusual move. The action, which cites Goldman for an “unauthorized use and disclosure of confidential supervisory information,” is also an awkward one for the Fed. The leak, after all, originated at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with one of its own employees. And the junior Goldman banker who received the confidential information was a former New York Fed employee himself. Goldman, not the New York Fed, was the one to uncover the leak. Yet the Fed’s board in Washington, a unit that operates separately from the New York Fed, is the one penalizing Goldman. And the Fed’s action goes further than Goldman’s settlement with New York State last year, reaching back several years to highlight how the bank failed since 2012 to have sufficient policies and employee training to prevent a leak like this one. The case reflects a broader effort at the Fed to adopt a tougher stance against Wall Street misconduct and to crack down on individual bankers. In 2015, the Fed chose to bar six bankers from the industry, twice the number in 2014. The year before that, the Fed did not take any such actions. The Fed’s case against Goldman, the details of which were reported last week by The New York Times, centers on what could have been a regulatory gold mine. The confidential information, the Fed said, included reports of bank examinations and other “confidential reports prepared by banking regulators. ” The documents effectively provided Goldman with a window into the Fed’s private insights about regulatory matters. And the bank, the Fed said, used the information in presentations to current and prospective clients “in an effort to solicit business. ” “The board expects all firms, including Goldman Sachs, to comply with all U. S. laws, rules and regulations,” the Fed said in a statement, noting that it is “illegal to use or disclose confidential supervisory information without prior approval. ” In its own statement, Goldman said it was “pleased to have resolved this matter. ” The bank emphasized that it had fired the former junior banker, Rohit Bansal, and that it had immediately notified the Fed after discovering that he had “improperly obtained information from his former employer, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. ” Goldman also fired Joseph Jiampietro, an executive who helped oversee Mr. Bansal. Goldman’s investigators found leaked New York Fed documents on Mr. Jiampietro’s desk, though the company never concluded that he knew about the leak. Instead, it reported to regulators that he had “failed to properly escalate” the problem. But now the Fed, unlike New York State, has taken aim at Mr. Jiampietro, previously a senior adviser to Sheila C. Bair when she was chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In announcing an action against Mr. Jiampietro, the Fed said it was seeking to impose a fine and to “permanently bar him from the banking industry stemming from his and his subordinates’ unauthorized use” of confidential information. Unlike Goldman, Mr. Jiampietro’s lawyers are fighting the case through the Fed’s civil disciplinary proceedings, disputing that Mr. Jiampietro had anything to do with the leak. They note that Mr. Bansal, who accepted a misdemeanor plea deal with federal prosecutors in Manhattan, did not explicitly accuse Mr. Jiampietro of instructing him to obtain the documents. In a previous statement, a lawyer for Mr. Jiampietro accused the Fed of appearing to use his client “as an industry scapegoat. ” The lawyer, Adam Ford of the law firm Ford O’Brien, added on Wednesday that “the allegations filed against Mr. Jiampietro are demonstrably false. ” Mr. Jiampietro, he said, “never requested confidential supervisory information from anyone and never used it for his or anyone’s benefit. ” “The Fed has the law wrong and the facts wrong,” Mr. Ford said. “Mr. Jiampietro intends on fighting these allegations and looks forward to full vindication. ” The Fed’s actions on Wednesday were not its first to stem from the leak. The New York Fed fired its employee and notified law enforcement agencies, saying at the time that it was “resolute to learn from our experiences. ” The Fed board in Washington also permanently barred Mr. Bansal from the industry. Goldman, which under the terms of its settlement with the Fed must enhance its program for preventing its employees from soliciting or accepting leaked regulatory information, said in its statement: “We previously reviewed and strengthened our policies and procedures after Bansal was terminated. We have no tolerance for the improper handling of confidential supervisory information. ” Mr. Bansal, who received probation for his role in the leak, “looks forward to putting this behind him and moving on with his life,” his lawyer, E. Scott Morvillo, said at the time of his sentencing. And yet the case will linger for Mr. Bansal. The Fed is likely to call him as a witness against Mr. Jiampietro.",0

19317,Pro-Palestinian protesters trap pro-Israel students in London university hall,"Pro-Palestinian protesters trap pro-Israel students in London university hall Pro-Palestinian protesters trap pro-Israel students in London university hall By 0 149 
Police were called after pro-Palestinian protesters stormed an Israel event at a London university, yelling “shame, shame” and trapping attendees in the room the talk was being held in, it has been reported. 
Israeli activist Hen Mazzig was addressing a group at University College London (UCL) on Thursday about the conflict between Israel and Palestine when protesters from the Friends of Palestine Society tried to stop his speech by chanting: “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.” 
According to the Jewish Chronicle, protesters then blocked attendees from leaving or getting into the lecture hall, chanting: “5, 6, 7, 8, Israel’s a terror state.” 
Officers reportedly told attendees to not leave the room without police protection. One student claimed she had been “assaulted” and “attacked” by the protesters. I was assaulted. We were attacked. But freedom will prevail. @HenMazzig did a great job sharing his story amidst a whirlwind of hate. #UCL 
— Devora Khafi (@DevoraKhafi) October 27, 2016 
In a video broadcast on Facebook from inside the hall, Mazzig tells his followers: “The situation is really out of control, we’re hiding in a room and there are protesters outside. 
“I don’t think that even in my days in the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] it was as bad as it is right now, it’s really scary,” he said. 
He later tweeted: “I had to be rushed out of the event at @UCL with security. The campus was the war zone and the streets are the safe place. I’m out. My god.” 
In a statement, the Union of Jewish students said: “There can be no excuses for the events that took place at UCL last night. 
“The fact that such violence and hostility took place only nine months after the incident at KCL [King’s College London], with police having once again to be called, is an absolute disgrace. 
“UCL Friends of Israel were simply trying to engage students in discussion on Israel, but instead were met with a wall of intolerance and intimidation aimed at shutting down free speech.” 
Earlier this year, protesters interrupted a talk by Ami Ayalon, an ex-commander of the Israeli Navy and former head of the Shin Bet, at King’s College in London. One protester was later found guilty of assaulting a Jewish student at that protest.

19318,"Sheldon Adelson Focuses on Congressional Races, Despite Donald Trump’s Pleas - The New York Times","The Las Vegas billionaire Sheldon G. Adelson and his wife are giving more than $40 million to groups backing Republican congressional candidates, according to campaign filings and interviews with Republican strategists, disregarding repeated entreaties for support from allies of Donald J. Trump and dealing a major setback to Mr. Trump’s efforts to rally the   Republican givers. The contributions will again make Mr. Adelson and his family among the largest known donors in American politics, after several years in which they played a more subdued role in national Republican  . But Mr. Adelson’s decision to deploy his wealth down ballot, less than two months before Election Day, also reflects the reluctance of most of the biggest Republican donors to invest in their party’s  . Mr. Adelson once dangled the possibility of giving as much as $100 million to   groups, an infusion that at a stroke would have made the groups financially competitive against Hillary Clinton. But in recent weeks, the mercurial casino magnate  —   who entertained but ultimately rebuffed pitches from an array of Republican candidates during the party’s nominating contest this election cycle  —   became convinced that Mr. Trump’s chances of victory had diminished, according to Republicans briefed on his decision. The Adelson family’s biggest contributions are going instead to two “super PACs” backing Senate and House Republicans, each of which will get $20 million, making Mr. Adelson the single largest known donor to political organizations in the country. Mr. Adelson also gave $1. 5 million in August to a super PAC backing Senator Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire. Mr. Trump is already raising far less money directly for his campaign than Mrs. Clinton is raising for hers, taking in $42 million in August compared with her $59 million. Now he is also heading toward Nov. 8 with relatively limited financial help from super PACs and outside groups that can accept unlimited contributions from rich donors. Groups supporting Mr. Trump have aired just $12 million in broadcast advertising, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group. Mrs. Clinton’s allies, buoyed by a sharp increase in giving by wealthy liberals on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley, are expected to spend at least $160 million by Election Day. “If you want to help that Senate candidate or that gubernatorial candidate, the best way we could have done it was to nominate any of the other people who were running,” said Douglas Heye, a former adviser to House Republicans. “That’s not the reality of the world right now. The best way to do that now is to help that campaign directly. ” Two Republicans with knowledge of his giving said that Mr. Adelson was allocating a far smaller sum, $5 million, to benefit the top of the Republican ticket: token support by Mr. Adelson’s standards. And in a striking move, the money will go not to any of the   super PACs but to organizations controlled by a fellow billionaire, Joe Ricketts, a Wyoming investor, whose own political operation will decide how to spend it. The Ricketts family spent millions of dollars during the primaries to defeat Mr. Trump, who responded with a Twitter message that the Rickettses “better be careful, they have a lot to hide!” A spokesman for Mr. Adelson declined to comment. “Everyone reached out to him. He promised $100 million,” said Ed Rollins, an adviser to Great America, one of several outside groups supporting Mr. Trump. “At this point in time, he’s like everyone else. Now he’s going to be a player, just not to the same extent. ” Mr. Trump’s efforts have been hampered in part by confusion: There are at least three competing super PACs supporting him. One is controlled and chiefly funded by the New York billionaire Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah Mercer, who have close ties to Mr. Trump’s campaign team. Two others, Great America PAC and Rebuild America Now, are controlled by rival teams of consultants, but each has received a blessing of sorts from the Trump family. Mr. Trump’s son Eric appeared at a   this month for Great America, while another son, Donald Jr. was the special guest at an event for Rebuild America Now less than a week later. While Mr. Trump has enjoyed success for a Republican presidential candidate in raising small contributions, the same qualities that have fired up his   supporters have turned off many wealthier Republican contributors, making it difficult for both Mr. Trump and the Republican National Committee to keep pace among larger donors. Mr. Adelson at one point appeared to be the biggest potential backer in Mr. Trump’s corner. This spring, he published an   article endorsing Mr. Trump and urging other Republicans to get behind him, and in August he donated $1. 5 million to the Republican convention, where Mr. Trump was formally nominated in July. But in the months since, Mr. Trump has shrugged off private pleas from Mr. Adelson and others within his party to modulate his tone and message against Mrs. Clinton. Those issues came to a head at a meeting this month of major conservative donors convened by the billionaire hedge fund executive Paul Singer, a resolute Trump opponent who has opined that Mr. Trump’s campaign proposals would cause a “widespread global depression” if enacted. Representatives of the Ricketts family, the Senate Leadership Fund and Americans for Prosperity, the political organization overseen by the billionaire industrialists David H. and Charles G. Koch, were among those pitching donors at the meeting. So was the Republican National Committee chairman, Reince Priebus, who told donors that he needed to raise another $60 million to $70 million to support the party and Mr. Trump through Nov. 8. According to a person who attended, Mr. Priebus urged donors to view the Republican slate as a package and argued that supporting Mr. Trump would help   races. But the Kochs’ political organization, backed by an overlapping group of large conservative donors, is so far steering clear of the presidential race and focusing its efforts on the House and Senate. And some of the top Republican donors in the country have now, like Mr. Adelson, given to the Koch organization or the Senate Leadership Fund, according to Tuesday’s filings. These donors include Mr. Singer, the Chicago hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin, and a company controlled by Frank L. VanderSloot, a prominent Idaho businessman. Mr. Adelson’s $5 million will go to yet another group, called Future45, which was set up and funded last year by the Ricketts family, Mr. Singer and Mr. Griffin to test lines of attack against Mrs. Clinton. Future45 and a sister nonprofit group, now being run solely by Mr. Ricketts’s team, are hoping to raise more than $25 million. The Ricketts family has provided $1 million, according to a Republican strategist involved in the effort. The hope is that a round of fall advertising aimed at Mrs. Clinton could help soften her support in states that also feature competitive House and Senate races, aiding Republican candidates in those contests. The Wall Street Journal first reported details of the group’s new direction on Tuesday. “The Ricketts are committed to helping Republicans win up and down the ballot this fall, including   and every other Republican candidate up and down the ballot,” said Brian Baker, a spokesman for the family. Mr. Adelson, whose fortune is estimated at almost $32 billion, could easily afford to spend more for Mr. Trump in the weeks ahead. But Mr. Adelson and other donors are rapidly running out of time to have an effect on the race. Even his contributions to Republican congressional efforts are coming late in the game, when the price of advertising is climbing drastically and there are fewer undecided voters to persuade. In part to mitigate those costs, the Senate Leadership Fund reserved $40 million in fall advertising in June, before the cash was available to pay for it. Democratic groups, meanwhile, are enjoying success in persuading rich donors and unions to pour money into super PACs, bolstered by Mrs. Clinton’s warm relationships with wealthy donors in her party. Through the start of September, according to Federal Election Commission filings, the lead   group, Priorities USA Action, had raised $13 million from S. Donald Sussman, a wealthy financier, and $9. 5 million from the retired hedge fund billionaire George Soros. S. Daniel Abraham, the billionaire founder of SlimFast, has contributed $9 million to the group. The entertainment executive Haim Saban and his wife, Cheryl, have contributed $10 million, according to federal records. Other outside Democratic groups are also intensifying their efforts for the final weeks before the election, focusing on   outreach rather than television advertising. Tom Steyer, the billionaire environmentalist, said in an interview on Tuesday that he was pouring another $15 million into For Our Future, a joint super PAC he is running with several labor unions. The group is spending money in seven swing states, chiefly on field organizing and voter mobilization. It aims to knock on eight million doors between now and the election. “We believe that that form of communication is the way to actually engage people,” Mr. Steyer said.",0

The Death Of John Kennedy By Michael Rivero
There have been two official investigations. One concluded Oswald acted alone, the other that there was a conspiracy. After half a century, many of the key documents which could tell the whole story remain classified. John F. Kennedy's brain is still missing from the National Archives. Why, if it is an open and shut case? Why the secrecy, if Oswald was just a ""crazed lone gunman""? 
The House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded that John F. Kennedy was the victim of a conspiracy based on the recording of the gunshots fired in Dealey Plaza, captured over a police radio. A total of 7 impulses were caught on the tape, but citing budgetary constraints, the HSCA only had 4 of them analyzed. The analysis concluded that all 4 were gunshots, two of them occurring within 1/2 a second of each other, too close to be fired by one man. Comparisons of the echoes with test shots fired in Dealey Plaza confirmed that at least one of the recorded shots had indeed been fired from the Grassy Knoll. Needless to say, the existence of 5, rather than just 3, gunshots destroyed the Oswald as lone gunman cover-up. Warren supporters quickly tried to dismiss the audio record of the gunshots by claiming that the recording was actually of gunshots in another part of the city, and confused for Dealey Plaza shots because of a timing error. Without explaining just where the other shots had occurred, or why the echo patterns exactly matched the test shots fired in Dealey Plaza, the Warren supporters declared victory. New research has shown that the report that dismissed the audio recording of the gunshots was itself deeply flawed, and ignored evidence that confirmed both the location and time of the recording as being in Dealey Plaza at the time of the JFK assassination. This means that the original House Select Committee on Assassinations conclusion is the correct one. There were at least five gunshots in Dealey Plaza, two of them within 1/2 second of each other, and at least one of the shots came from the Grassy Knoll. UPDATE: The Deathbed Confession of CIA Agent, E. Howard Hunt to his son on the JFK Assassination. UPDATE: Numerous witnesses had reported a large obvious exit wound in the back of Kennedy's head, consistent with the reports of a gunshot from the Grassy Knoll. The Warren Commission dismissed the exit wound and reports of a shooter on the Grassy Knoll and published in their report photographs of the back of Kennedy's head that showed no damage. Now it has been revealed that the Warren Commission did not publish the actual autopsy photos but substituted photos taken after morticians had reconstructed Kennedy's head an anticipation of a possible open casket viewing prior to the funeral , as had been done with Lincoln. 
Although described as a mix-up, the simplest explanation is deliberate deception by the Warren Commission. Dan Rather's ""fib"" 
Dan Rather, at the time an unknown newscaster from a small market Texas TV station, viewed the Zapruder film, then described it to America on the CBS network. As this recording of that broadcast shows, Rather lied to all of America in claiming that the head shot pushed John F. Kennedy's head forward. 
Rather makes the claim that Kennedy's head ""rocketed forward"" at 2:15 in the above video. He also makes a point of saying there were only three shots in total. Rather's meteoric rise to network status and stardom soon followed this broadcast. When the Zapruder film was finally shown publicly, during Jim Garrison's trial of CIA agent Clay Shaw, Rather's lie was revealed for all to see. A Revealing Wink 
Most Americans who lived through the Kennedy assassination are very familiar with the above photo of Vice President Lyndon Johnson being sworn in as President aboard Air Force One. 
But very few people are aware of another photograph snapped just seconds later!

19320,Oklahoma Governor Vetoes Bill That Would Charge Abortion Doctors - The New York Times,"Gov. Mary Fallin of Oklahoma vetoed a bill on Friday that would impose felony charges on doctors who perform abortions, calling the measure vague and unconstitutional. Ms. Fallin is a conservative Republican with a strong record of supporting restrictions on abortion, which she emphasized in a statement announcing her decision a day after the Legislature had passed the bill. But she acknowledged the virtual certainty that the bill would be struck down by the courts and said that the way to overturn Roe v. Wade was “the appointment of a conservative,   justice to the United States Supreme Court. ” The bill, which passed both houses of the   Legislature by wide margins, said doctors who performed abortions could be criminally charged and face prison terms of one to three years. It also said the state would revoke the medical license of any doctors who performed an abortion unless it was necessary to protect the life of the mother. Mainstream medical groups in Oklahoma and nationally had condemned the bill and called on Ms. Fallin to veto it. Legal groups defending abortion rights predicted a rapid challenge in state or federal courts. Because it would effectively ban abortion in the state, the bill would have been quickly blocked as unconstitutional, legal experts said. While the Supreme Court has allowed states to impose restrictions like waiting periods, it has firmly held that women have a right to an abortion until the fetus is viable outside the womb, around 24 weeks into pregnancy. The bill’s sponsor, Senator Nathan Dahm, had said he relished the chance to fight for it in court and hoped that it could lead to a reconsideration of abortion rights by the Supreme Court. Mr. Dahm said Friday that he was considering whether to seek an override of the governor’s veto, which would require a   majority in both houses of the Legislature. Liberty Counsel, a conservative Christian legal group based in Florida, had promoted the bill and said it would provide the state with free legal aid to defend it. On Friday, the group reacted angrily to Ms. Fallin’s veto and called for an override. “This is a despicable betrayal of her word and of innocent children whose lives will be cut short because of her cowardly act,” said Mat Staver, the chairman of Liberty Counsel. It was unclear on Friday whether the governor’s strongly worded rejection of the bill would dissuade legislators from seeking to save it. “The bill is so ambiguous and so vague that doctors cannot be certain what medical circumstances would be considered ‘necessary to preserve the life of the mother,’ ” Ms. Fallin said, adding that the bill could not survive a constitutional challenge.",0
19321,Prince Overdosed on Fentanyl. What Is It? - The New York Times," Minnesota officials reported on Thursday that Prince died in April of an overdose of the opiate fentanyl. The authorities have not revealed how the musician obtained the drug or whether a doctor had prescribed it. But it has been reported that he had hip surgery in the   and may have still been in pain. Fentanyl has become a source of concern for government agencies and law enforcement officials as death rates from   overdoses and seizures of the drug have risen in several states. Here’s what we know about the drug. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid, prescribed to help patients deal with severe pain. Opioids help to reduce patients’ perception of their suffering and can induce a state of extreme relaxation and euphoria. Fentanyl was synthesized in 1960, and it was introduced as an anesthetic. It is sold under brand names like Actiq, Duragesic and Sublimaze, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. It can be consumed via a patch, an injection, smoking and a lollipop, among other methods. Fentanyl is up to 100 times more potent than morphine and can be 30 to 50 times more powerful than heroin. Even when taken in small amounts, it can be fatal. Fentanyl is a Schedule 2 drug, meaning that while it is used for medical treatment, it is known to have a high potential for abuse. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is frequently mixed with heroin, cocaine or both when sold illegally, in many cases without the user’s knowledge. An overdose of fentanyl can result in severe respiratory depression or arrest, during which breathing is slowed or ceases altogether. But determining what is a standard lethal dose of opioids like fentanyl is complicated. A dose that can kill one person may provide medicinal pain relief for another. And taking prescription opioid painkillers for a long time can build up a tolerance to the drugs. In March 2015, the Drug Enforcement Administration issued a nationwide alert about the dangers of fentanyl. It said that the Mexican authorities had shut down several labs and that fentanyl that had been seized in the Northeast and in California in 2014 had “originated from Mexican   organizations. ” In an article in The New York Times in March, Maura Healey, the Massachusetts attorney general, said fentanyl was the cartels’ “drug of choice. ” “They have figured out a way to make fentanyl more cheaply and easily than heroin and are manufacturing it at a record pace,” she said. According to the D. E. A. episodes of abuse involving fentanyl initially appeared in the  . From 2005 to 2007, the agency said, the drug caused more than 1, 000 deaths in the United States. The fentanyl that caused those deaths originated in a single lab in Mexico that was later shut down, ending the surge.",0
19322,"For Obama, Syria Chemical Attack Shows Risk of ‘Deals With Dictators’ - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   When it came time to make his case for the judgment of history, President Barack Obama had a ready rebuttal to one of the most cutting critiques of his time in office. Although friends and foes alike faulted him for not following through on his threat to retaliate when Syria gassed its own people in 2013, Mr. Obama would counter that he had actually achieved a better result through an agreement with President Bashar   to surrender all of his chemical weapons. After last week, even former Obama aides assume that he will have to rethink that passage in his memoir. More than 80 civilians were killed in what Western analysts called a sarin attack by Syrian forces  —   a chilling demonstration that the agreement did not succeed. In recent days, former aides have lamented what they considered one of the worst moments of the Obama presidency and privately conceded that his legacy would suffer. “If the Syrian government carried out the attack and the agent was sarin, then clearly the 2013 agreement didn’t succeed in its objective of eliminating Bashar’s C. W.,” or chemical weapons, said Robert Einhorn, who was the State Department special adviser for nonproliferation and arms control under Mr. Obama before the agreement. “Either he didn’t declare all his C. W. and kept some hidden in reserve, or he illegally produced some sarin after his stock was eliminated  —   most likely the former. ” Other former Obama advisers questioned the wisdom of negotiating with Mr. Assad and said last week’s attack illustrated the flaws in the deal, which was brokered by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as a way to prevent the United States from using force. “For me, this tragedy underscores the dangers of trying to do deals with dictators without a comprehensive, invasive and permanent inspection regime,” said Michael McFaul, who was Mr. Obama’s ambassador to Russia. “It also shows the limits of doing deals with Putin. Surely, the Russians must have known about these C. W. ” Putting the best face on it, former Obama advisers said it was better to have removed 1, 300 tons of chemical weapons from Syria even if Mr. Assad cheated and kept some, or later developed more. “Imagine what Syria would look like without that deal,” said Antony J. Blinken, a former deputy secretary of state. “It would be awash in chemical weapons, which would fall into the hands of ISIS, Al Nusra or other groups. ” Still, the administration knew all along that it had probably not gotten all of the chemical weapons, and tried to get Russia to help press Syria, without success. “We always knew we had not gotten everything, that the Syrians had not been fully forthcoming in their declaration,” Mr. Blinken said. Even before last week’s chemical attack, many veterans of Mr. Obama’s team considered his handling of Syria his biggest failing and expressed regret that their administration did not stop a war that has left more than 400, 000 dead and millions displaced. Many of them even praised President Trump for taking the very action that Mr. Obama refused to take four years ago, by ordering a cruise missile strike against Syria. “Donald Trump has done the right thing on Syria,”   Slaughter, the director of policy planning in Mr. Obama’s State Department, wrote on Twitter. “Finally!! After years of useless handwringing in the face of hideous atrocities. ” Tom Malinowski, an assistant secretary of state for human rights for Mr. Obama, wrote in The Atlantic, “The lesson I would draw from that experience is that when dealing with mass killing by unconventional or conventional means, deterrence is more effective than disarmament. ” Mr. Obama grappled with Syria for much of his tenure but resisted being directly drawn in, for fear of thrusting America into another Middle East quagmire without solving the problem. The most searing moment came in 2013, when Mr. Assad’s forces killed 1, 400 civilians with chemical weapons, brazenly crossing what Mr. Obama had said would be his “red line. ” Mr. Obama prepared a military strike to retaliate, but hesitated amid domestic opposition in both parties and asked Congress to decide whether to proceed. When it became clear that Congress would not give its approval, he grabbed onto a political lifeline from Mr. Putin, who proposed a deal in which Mr. Assad would give up his chemical weapons arsenal. Under the deal, Syria joined the Chemical Weapons Convention, and over the next nine months, vast stores of lethal poisons were removed and ultimately destroyed. In June 2014, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons certified that all of Syria’s declared weapons had been removed. Two months later, when the last chemicals were destroyed, Mr. Obama celebrated. “Today we mark an important achievement in our ongoing effort to counter the spread of weapons of mass destruction by eliminating Syria’s declared chemical weapons stockpile,” he said in a statement. In the months to come, Mr. Obama and his aides pointed to that agreement in response to criticism that he had failed to enforce his red line. “Well, it turns out we’re getting chemical weapons out of Syria without having initiated a strike,” Mr. Obama said in April 2014. “So what else are you talking about?” Three months later, Secretary of State John Kerry said, “With respect to Syria, we struck a deal where we got 100 percent of the chemical weapons out. ” And three months after that, Mr. Kerry said Mr. Obama’s threat of force had made it possible to “cut the deal that got 100 percent of the declared chemical weapons out of Syria, and people nevertheless have been critical  —   one day of bombing versus the virtue of getting 100 percent of the chemical weapons out of Syria. ” As late as this January, Susan E. Rice, Mr. Obama’s national security adviser, said on NPR: “We were able to find a solution that didn’t necessitate the use of force that actually removed the chemical weapons that were known from Syria in a way that the use of force would never have accomplished. We were able to get the Syrian government to voluntarily and verifiably give up its chemical weapons stockpile. ” Publicly, Mr. Obama’s advisers sometimes referred to “known” or “declared” stockpiles to qualify their claims, and sometimes did not. But from the start of the deal, there were discrepancies in Mr. Assad’s weapons declarations. In February 2016, James R. Clapper Jr. the national intelligence director, told Congress that “we assess that Syria has not declared all the elements of its chemical weapons program. ” Moreover, Mr. Assad’s forces resorted to makeshift chlorine bombs, using a chemical that was not covered by the agreement and is not barred by international law, though its use as a weapon of war is. Mr. Blinken said the Obama administration had pressed the United Nations to respond, but Russia blocked such efforts. Critics say Mr. Obama oversold the agreement with Russia. “The defense was that he got all the C. W. out, and now that defense is shown to be plain false,” said Elliott Abrams, a deputy national security adviser to President George W. Bush. “If Obama administration officials knew that at the time, they were deliberately misstating the facts. I think Obama will never live this down, nor should he. ” Frederic C. Hof, who worked on Syria policy at the State Department under Mr. Obama before leaving and becoming a sharp critic of the administration, said the agreement remained defensible because it took weapons out of Mr. Assad’s hands. But Mr. Hof noted that Mr. Assad was still left “free to perform mass homicide by other means,” and that neither Mr. Obama’s deal nor Mr. Trump’s missile strike would stop him. “He now counts on the West again to leave him free to kill as long as he does so without chemicals,” Mr. Hof said. “If this is what happens, the U. S. airstrikes of April 7 will go down in history as a        gesture that did nothing to counter violent extremism, stop mass homicide or restore the reputation of the U. S. ”",0
19323,Soros-Financed Groups Unite to Sue for Trump White House Visitor Logs - Breitbart,"Three   government watchdog groups have reportedly banded together to sue the Department of Homeland Security for the release the logs of visitors to the White House and to President Trump’s homes in both  New York and Florida. [Unreported in the news media coverage of the lawsuit is that two of the three organizations are directly funded by billionaire George Soros’s Open Society Foundations while the third group is the project of a fund that has financed leftist groups along with Soros.  Politico, which first reported on the   lawsuit, documented: The suit, set to be filed Monday in federal court in New York, contends that the Secret Service is in violation of the law by failing to respond to Freedom of Information Act requests for details on visitors to the White House and other locations where Trump has spent time since taking office.   …     By filing in New York rather than in Washington, where most FOIA suits are filed, the plaintiffs may be trying to avoid having the case scuttled by a key legal precedent already on the books that sharply limits the public’s right to see logs of visitors to the White House complex. The three organizations that filed the complaint are the National Security Archive, the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Government (CREW) which Politico notes was also involved in a   lawsuit for government records. The National Security Archive documents on the “funders and support” section of its website that it is funded by Soros’s Open Society Institute  as well as the Open Society Fund, Inc. CREW, the second group that is party to the visitor logs lawsuit, describes itself as an organization that utilizes “  legal actions to target government officials who sacrifice the common good to special interests. ” CREW, which does not publicize its donor list, has received financing from Soros’s Open Society Foundations. According to Discover the Networks, CREW has also been funded by the   Tides Foundation. In August 2014, longtime Hillary Clinton ally David Brock, founder of the heavily   Media Matters for America progressive group, was elected chairman of CREW’s board. Brock departed the organization last December, but Politico reported in January that CREW is part of a network of groups for which the activist is attempting to raise $40 million to take on Trump.  Also in January, CREW filed a lawsuit claiming that Trump is in violation of a Constitutional clause banning government officials from accepting benefits from foreign nations.  The third organization suing for the visitor logs is the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.  The Institute, a $60 million effort, was launched last year by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation together with Columbia University.  Numerous Knight Foundation projects are also financed by Soros. The Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas at the University of Texas at Austin, for example, was also the recipient of a $270, 000 grant from Soros’s Open Society Foundations.  The Knight Foundation and the Open Society both fund the ProPublica journalism project.  The two charities are also founding sponsors of the New Americans Campaign, which says it seeks to “help modernize naturalization assistance in the United States and help more lawful permanent immigrants become U. S. citizens. ”  Since Trump took office,   groups have been leading a constant effort to thwart the U. S. president’s policies, as this reporter has thoroughly documented. In one of many examples, tomorrow a coalition of activist groups plans to hold a massive   Tax March in Washington and at least 60 other locations.  Unreported by much of the news media is that most of the listed partners and support organizers of the march are openly financed by Soros or have close links to Soros financing.  One Tax March organizer is the   Indivisible Project, which has been helping to lead   activism nationwide. Breitbart News extensively reported that Indivisible leaders are openly associated with groups financed by Soros.  Soros reportedly also has ties to more than 50 “partners” of the   Women’s March that was held the day after Trump’s inauguration. Also, this journalist first reported on the march leaders’ own close associations with Soros. In February, Breitbart News reported a   group distributed an actual script with   talking points for citizens to use when meeting with constituents in town halls, including during last week’s Congressional recess.   The script provided    language suggestions that accuse the Trump administration of “xenophobia, racism, and Islamophobia. ”  It asked activists to use the descriptors to petition their representatives to “forcefully condemn” and support legislation opposing Trump’s immigration and border security agendas.  In January, immigration lawyers from groups financed by Soros, a champion of open border policies, were signatories to a lawsuit that successfully blocked Trump’s original executive order halting visas for 90 days for “immigrants and  ” from Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, Yemen, Iran, and Iraq.

19324,Trump Campaign Admits They Are Trying To Steal The Election With Voter Suppression,"Bloomberg reported : 
To compensate for this, Trump’s campaign has devised another strategy, which, not surprisingly, is negative. Instead of expanding the electorate, Bannon and his team are trying to shrink it. “We have three major voter suppression operations under way,” says a senior official. They’re aimed at three groups Clinton needs to win overwhelmingly: idealistic white liberals, young women, and African Americans. Trump’s invocation at the debate of Clinton’s WikiLeaks e-mails and support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership was designed to turn off Sanders supporters. The parade of women who say they were sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and harassed or threatened by Hillary is meant to undermine her appeal to young women. And her 1996 suggestion that some African American males are “super predators” is the basis of a below-the-radar effort to discourage infrequent black voters from showing up at the polls—particularly in Florida. 
The effort was obvious, and according to the polling, it is failing. 
Voter turnout among young women is expected to rise according to the latest Harvard IOP young voters poll. Sanders started flocking towards Clinton in August , and haven’t left, and early voting statistics show that African-American turnout is solid in swing states. 
The Trump campaign has realized that they don’t have enough supporters to win, so they are adopting tactics that run contrary to the heart of democracy to shrink the electorate in critical states. 
However, for voter suppression efforts like Trump’s to be effective, the campaign must have a credible messenger. Donald Trump is not a credible messenger to any of the voters that he is trying to deter, and he has no effective surrogates that are capable of delivering his message. 
A voter suppression effort was expected from the Trump campaign. What is unexpected is that the campaign would publicly brag about it. 
People on all sides of the political spectrum who care about basic democratic institutions should be alarmed by Trump’s public attack on democracy. 
The good news for all Americans is that Democrats are already fighting back , and the Trump campaign’s dark efforts to steal an election appear to be failing.",0

19326,What will Hillary Clinton do for India? Not Much and Here's Why,"Bill Clinton and his cabinet members pursued Anti-India activities and as Secretary of State Hillary did the same. As President, she will no doubt continue to bully India. 7 Shares
7 0 0 0
There are only weeks left until we find out if we have a President Trump or a President Clinton. Donald Trump is perceived as the candidate who is against the corrupt establishment, while Hillary Clinton is seen as part and fabric of the establishment and as the most corrupt candidate to run for President in the history of the country.
A President Clinton in a few weeks would return us to the hostile climate towards India that we saw in the 1990s overseen by her husband. After he took office in 1993 the US relationship with India went on a considerable down-slide. For nearly a year, Clinton did not bother appointing an ambassador to India even as he went about opposing India on multiple fronts, leading to anger in the Indian establishment. Initially he was intent on disarming and weakening India by preventing access to technology and also mounted a sustained attack on the Indian economy by imposing several economic sanctions.
In 1991, Senator Joe Biden, who is now the Vice President under Barack Obama, introduced an amendment in the bill granting aid to Russia, making the aid conditional on the fact that Russia could not sell cryogenic engines for India's space programme. The Clinton administration was hellbent on hurting the development of India's space and technology sectors and blocked the sale of Cray supercomputers that had been approved under the Ronald Reagan administration. India was also targeted for several economic sanctions and was threatened under what was called the Super 301 clause of the American trade law.
These economic sanctions were specifically borne out in the way Mr Clinton attacked the Indian textile and carpet industries. Throughout the 1990s, the terms ""Dunkel Draft"", ""Super 301"", ""WTO"" and ""patent laws"" became synonyms for the US attempts to retard the Indian economy and led to many protests in India.
By 1996, India was justified in believing that Indo-US relations had hit the lowest point, but things took a dramatic turn for the worse during Bill Clinton's second term in office. Madeleine Albright became the new Secretary of State and she was increasingly hostile to India especially through her pseudo-racist television outbursts. In fact she loved attacking India so much she went at it after leaving office and called for a plebiscite in Kashmir, justifying the actions of violent groups in the process.
MORE... Clinton's Policies Look Like a Death Sentence for Americans 10 Things to Expect with a Hillary Clinton Presidency Hillary Clinton must be indicted How Hillary Clinton ushered in a one party dictatorship of monopoly capital Remember this is the same blood-soaked Albright who advocated bombing Yugoslavia and then got her investment firm to attempt a takeover of mines in that country. Like the Clintons, she also knows how to abuse her power. Lest we forget, Albright also justified the deaths of half a million Iraqi children and claimed that the deaths were ""worth it"". And the icing on the cake for this particularly nasty woman? Albright has already threatened women in America and claimed that there was a special place in hell reserved for them if they did not vote for Hillary Clinton.
There is already talk of Joe Biden in the frame as Secretary of State under Hillary Clinton. Biden would continue his anti-India agenda and try to thwart the development of India's space programme and other technological advancements. Then of course there is Hillary's closest confidante, a duplicitous lady called Huma Abedin who is of Pakistani descent and whose family has links to radical elements in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Abedin could end up playing an important role in determining American foreign policy and would be certainly anti-Modi.
Another point against Hillary Clinton is that the hawkish Henry Kissinger has supports her and her oeuvre as Secretary of State. This is the same Kissinger who is so hostile against India, many of his racist statements are even on tape to that end.
It is in the light of this setting that many Indian-Americans have opposed the candidacy of Hillary Clinton and have come out in support of Donald Trump. In contrast to the policies of the Clintons, Trump has promised to make India the best friend of the US and has stated that he looks forward to working with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Trump has also reached out to Hindus in US. While there is always a risk of the unknown and it is not clear if Trump can make the change he wants to, a Hillary presidency will certainly be a major step back for India.
In order for India to build a constructive relationship with US, it requires people in both countries to have good intentions. It is clear that India cannot have a strong and forward looking relationship with the US if Hillary Clinton is running the corridors of power. On the other hand, Donald Trump has articulated the right intent and his stance holds promise for India.",0

BOSTON GLOBE 

Donald Trump is criticizing the FBI’s decision not to criminally charge Hillary Clinton. He says ‘‘now it’s up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box.’’ 
Trump kicked off his Election Day eve blitz with a rally Monday in Florida. He told the Sarasota crowd that ‘‘the system is rigged, but at least we know it.’’ 
He claimed that ‘‘our country is a laughing stock all over the world.’’ 
The Republican nominee than pantomimed quotation marks when he said the word ‘‘justice’’ as he hit the FBI and the Department of Justice for their handling of the case. 
FBI Director James Comey notified Congress Sunday that a review of new emails connected to Clinton’s servers did produce evidence that would warrant charges. 
11:45 a.m. 
An ex-aide to former President Bill Clinton alleged in a hacked email that Chelsea Clinton used the family’s charitable foundation to help underwrite her 2010 wedding. 
The 2012 exchange between Doug Band and Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta was released by the WikiLeaks organization. Stolen messages have chronicled tensions within the Clinton Foundation between Band and the daughter of the Democratic presidential nominee. 
Band told Podesta that Chelsea Clinton was gossiping to outsiders that she was investigating questionable spending. Band suggested that she is the one who should be scrutinized for ‘‘using foundation resources for her wedding.’’ He did not provide details about this. A Clinton Foundation spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Band was later forced out amid issues with his outside consulting firm.

Philadelphia’s public transit system will be up and running in time for Election Day now that a weeklong strike has ended. That’s a relief to the state’s Democrats. 
Democratic city officials were worried that the strike could affect turnout at the polls Tuesday. Pennsylvania does not offer early voting, so Election Day turnout is key. 
The state has favored Democrats in recent presidential elections, but polls suggest the race is tightening. Democrat Hillary Clinton is counting on strong support in the Philadelphia area. Both candidates are campaigning in the state Tuesday. 
The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority and the union representing roughly 4,700 transit workers announced a tentative agreement early Monday. Subways were soon operating on a reduced schedule and limited trolled serve was restored.

19329,Former C.I.A. specialist Philip Giraldi: the 9/11 narrative needs revision,"By Jonas E. Alexis on October 26, 2016 Philip Giraldi: “The new Pearl Harbor turned out to be 9/11."" …by Jonas E. Alexis 

Former counter-terrorism specialist and military intelligence officer of the C.I.A. Philip Giraldi has recently nailed the 9/11 narrative by saying that “ Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan just for starters may have been involved in or had knowledge relating to 9/11…” 
We all ought to applaud Giraldi for starting to investigate some of those issues because Giraldi is not just your typical guy. He is a historian. He has a Ph.D. from the University of London in European history and has been working as an investigative journalist for years. 
Giraldi was a C.I.A. officer for eighteen years in places like Turkey, Italy, Germany, and Spain. He also speaks several languages, including Turkish, Italian, German, and Spanish. He has written articles for MSNBC, Fox News Channel, National Public Radio, Good Morning America, etc. 
According to Giraldi, the 9/11 attack was almost certainly another Pearl Harbor, which is to say that the government almost certainly had it coming. The Neocons and the Bush administration, says Giraldi, were part of the problem largely because they were “pushing to increase U.S. military capabilities so that the country would be able to fight multi-front wars. The signatories of the neocon Project for the New American Century paper observed that was needed was a catalyst to produce a public demand to ‘do something,’ that ‘something’ being an event comparable to Pearl Harbor. Seventeen signatories of the document wound up in senior positions in the Bush Administration. “The new Pearl Harbor turned out to be 9/11. Given developments since 9/11 itself, to include the way the U.S. has persisted in going to war and the constant search for enemies worldwide to justify our own form of Deep State government, I would, to a large extent, have to believe that PNAC was either prescient or perhaps, more diabolically, actively engaged in creating a new reality.” 
VT writers and editors have been saying that the 9/11 attack was indeed a covert operation for quite a while. And this is not some kind of “conspiracy theory.” Even Fox News, of all places, got it right when they made it quite clear that the Israelis almost certainly had enough knowledge about the 9/11 attack: 
Israel’s fingerprints are all over the 9/11 attack. In 2011 at least 200 Israelis were arrested. 140 of those were detained by the FBI right before the 9/11 attack. Many of those Israelis “had used cover stories to gain access to sensitive government buildings and the homes of American officials.” [1] The Washington Post, [2] the Telegraph, [3] and other media outlets such as the widely read French newspaper Le Monde [4] began to ask why many of those people were arrested. No one was able to answer the question because those Israelis were never prosecuted. 
According to John Farmer, former senior counsel to the 9/11 Commission, the 9/11 Commission report is unreliable and many who wrote the report were misled.394 These issues prompted a number of physicists and professors—at least 75 of them—to postulate that more evidence was needed for the airplane hypothesis. 
One of them, Professor David Gabbard, declared, “We’re academics and we’re rational, and we really believe Congress or someone should investigate this.” [5] These doubters have been labeled “conspiracy theorists.” According to Sylvain Cypel of Le Monde, there is no doubt that the Israelis—at least the Mossad—were aware of the 9/11 attack before it happened. [6] 
Giraldi again should be praised for his moral and intellectual candor. The similarities between 9/11 and Pearl Harbor are quite striking. Former US Senate candidate Mark Dankof and I will be examining the issues revolving around Pearl Harbor tentatively at the end of this year. Giraldi concludes his analysis with a sober thought: “If it can be demonstrated that the attacks carried out on that day were quite possibly set up by major figures both inside and outside the political establishment it might produce such a powerful reaction that the public would demand a reversal of the laws and policies that have so gravely damaged our republic. It is admittedly unlikely that anything like that could ever take place, but it is at least something to hope for.” 
If Solzhenitsyn is right, then the Powers That Be can’t triumph forever. So, there is no need for despair and there is every reason to be hopeful. Solzhenitsyn put it best: 
“Our way must be: never knowingly support lies! Having understood where the lies begin—step back from that gangrenous edge! Let us not glue back the flaking scale of the Ideology, not gather back its crumbling bones, nor patch together its decomposing garb, and we will be amazed how swiftly and helplessly the lies will fall away, and that which is destined to be naked will be exposed as such to the world.” [7]

19330,SpaceX Launches Rocket Carrying Space Station Cargo - The New York Times,"KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla.  —   Engines ignited and a rocket lifted off here on Sunday, for the first time since the last space shuttle launch five and a half years ago. A Falcon 9 rocket from Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corporation  —   SpaceX  —   was launched, quickly disappearing into a low cloud deck, with 5, 500 pounds of supplies, experiments and other cargo headed to the International Space Station. The Dragon cargo capsule is to arrive at the station on Wednesday. A robotic arm will grab the capsule and take it to one of the docking ports. “All is looking great,” Jessica Jensen, the director of Dragon mission management at SpaceX, said in a news conference after the launch. “We’re not expecting any issues. ” SpaceX was again able to recover the booster stage. As the second stage ignited to push the cargo capsule to orbit, the booster turned around back toward land. Eight minutes after it left the ground, it set down on a landing site a few miles away. It was the eighth successful landing and the third on land. (The other landings occurred on floating platforms in the ocean.) The success was another step in the recovery of SpaceX from a major setback last September when one of its rockets caught fire and exploded on a launchpad at the adjoining Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. A launch attempt on Saturday was called off with 13 seconds left because of what Mr. Musk described as “slightly odd” readings with a backup motor for steering the engine nozzle on the second stage. In response to a question posted on Twitter by a MSNBC producer, Mr. Musk said that he called off the launch to take a closer look to make sure the readings were not a sign of a more significant, undetected problem. In another post, Mr. Musk wrote, “1% chance isn’t worth rolling the dice. Better to wait a day. ” Overnight, SpaceX technicians swapped out the mechanism. The odd readings did not recur during Sunday’s countdown. . SpaceX hopes to catch up on its jammed schedule, which was delayed after the explosion. It plans to launch a used rocket  —   one of the recovered boosters  —   this spring. The next cargo mission for NASA is to be the first to reuse a capsule from a previous flight. The launch of the Falcon Heavy, a larger rocket years behind schedule, is aimed for summer. And by the end of the year, the company wants to test a rocket and capsule that is to lead to ferrying astronauts to the space station. Beyond the resumption of SpaceX’s space station deliveries, Sunday’s launch also marked a transition of the Kennedy Space Center toward private use of the facilities. In 2014, SpaceX took over a former space shuttle launchpad that NASA no longer needed. “This pad would have just sat here and rusted away in the salt air had we not had the use agreement with SpaceX,” Robert D. Cabana, the space center director, said at a news conference in front of the launchpad on Friday. “What an awesome use of a great American asset. ” Launchpad 39A was where the space shuttle Atlantis lifted off on July 8, 2011, on the last shuttle mission, and was home to the first shuttle launch in 1981. It was also the starting point for all but one of the manned Apollo missions, including Apollo 11, the first moon landing, in 1969. The cancellation by the Obama administration of Constellation, a program intended to send astronauts back to the moon, led many to wonder whether the Kennedy Space Center had much of a future. The revised vision for NASA, unveiled in early 2010, called for a   hiatus in rocket development to allow investment in innovative but unready technologies  —   and nothing on the horizon to launch from Kennedy. (Launching continued at Cape Canaveral.) Mr. Cabana recast Kennedy from a center dedicated to launching NASA rockets to what he described a “multiuser spaceport. ” Congress pushed the Obama administration to revive aspects of Constellation. Two months after the last space shuttle mission, NASA announced the Space Launch System, a   rocket that would take astronauts on deep space missions and eventually to Mars. While the cancellation of Constellation battered Kennedy, another shift in NASA direction  —   turning over the launching of space station astronauts to private companies  —   opened possibilities. SpaceX and Boeing won the NASA contracts. Boeing is now building its   Starliner in a Kennedy building once used for refurbishing space shuttles. SpaceX and Boeing are scheduled to launch the first astronaut missions in 2018, although a report released Thursday by the federal Government Accountability Office concluded that remaining technical obstacles would cause the launches, already a year late, to slip into early 2019. For SpaceX, issues included cracks in the turbine blades of the engines. At the Friday news conference, Gwynne Shotwell, the president of SpaceX, said the response of company officials was, “The hell we won’t fly before 2019!” Ms. Shotwell said the cracks were long known and represented an acceptable risk for current satellite and cargo missions. She said the company had incorporated a fix in the next upgrade of the Falcon 9 rocket, which is to fly later this year. On Twitter, Mr. Musk said, “I feel very confident of 2018. ” Sierra Nevada, one of the companies that lost the astronaut competition but which has since been selected for carrying cargo to the space station, has also opened up shop at Kennedy Space Center as has Blue Origin, the rocket company founded by Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, and Moon Express, a   company seeking to send robotic landers to the moon. However, NASA still had no use for launchpad 39A or many of the other buildings that had been used for the space shuttle program. The other former shuttle pad, 39B, is sufficient to handle up to three Space Launch System launches a year, Mr. Cabana said. Currently, NASA envisions a pace of one launch every one or two years. With its lease, SpaceX dismantled some of the shuttle infrastructure, built a large hangar for storing its rockets and refurbished the pad to handle the Falcon 9, the Falcon Heavy and NASA astronaut launches. “We want to see more launches, government and commercial, off all these pads,” Mr. Cabana said. The rocket launched Sunday carried Sage III, an instrument to be installed on the space station to measure levels of ozone, aerosols and dust in the Earth’s atmosphere for at least three years. It is latest in a series of instruments that have made similar measurements since the late 1970s. Another instrument will track lightning. The cargo capsule is also carrying a demonstration project to test autopilot navigation technologies for eventual use by robotic spacecraft to repair satellites. With the successful launch from Kennedy, SpaceX will now work to bring the launchpad damaged in September back into operation this summer. As SpaceX wraps up development of its Falcon rockets, Ms. Shotwell said, in about a year, the company will shift its attention to Mr. Musk’s dream of a spacecraft for taking people to Mars.

All the suspense is building up with Hillary and the FBI, as the election is literally right around the corner. What will happen to her? Who knows since the Justice Department is blocking the investigation . Obviously there’s something fishy! 
Good morning Hillary Clinton! We already hit you today with FBI: Clinton Foundation Case ‘Likely’ Moving Toward an Indictment. What else could possibly go wrong? How about everything? 
Like audio recordings of the FBI wanting to investigate the Clinton Foundation, but the DOJ getting in the way? Yes, the same DOJ headed up by Loretta Lynch (see Nothing to Hide? AG Loretta Lynch ‘Pleads Fifth’ On Iran Ransom Investigation)… 
The FBI had secretly recorded conversations of a suspect in a public-corruption case. The suspect was talking about alleged deals the Clintons made, these people said. The agents listening to the recordings couldn’t tell from the conversations if what the suspect was describing was accurate. But it was, they thought, worth checking out. Prosecutors thought the talk was hearsay and a weak basis to warrant aggressive tactics, like presenting evidence to a grand jury, because the person who was secretly recorded wasn’t inside the Clinton Foundation. FBI investigators grew increasingly frustrated with resistance from the corruption prosecutors. Some executives at the bureau itself, to keep pursuing the case. 
Let me break this down for you real simple for any errant leftist who found this site while searching for Gender Queer styling tips. As a general rule, people who join the FBI respect the law. Some may even love the law. These FBI agents go through intense study and training with dreams of taking down baddies. Sometimes with a gun, sometimes with a pen. FBI agents, as a general rule, are in the FBI so they can be good guys. Okay? Okay. 
So when agents discovered Hillary Clinton, a politician sitting at the tippity-top of our government, was possibly engaging in criminality, which may have endangered the security of the United States, these FBI agents wanted to pursue. Good guys vs. Bad Lady with Cankles. 
BUT, the higher-ups (like Loretta Lynch) at the Justice Department, essentially told the FBI agents to look the other way. Hillary was being protected (or so it appears) so she could run for and become president. The first lady president. Priorities. 
Kind of runs counter to everything these FBI agents stand for, yes? It appears they were unwilling to stand down and ignore justice. This isn’t so much of a surprise to us: read also CORRUPTION: FBI, DOJ Wanted to Investigate Hillary. Comey and Lynch Intervened. 
With five days to go, who knew Hillary’s closing argument would be “But I don’t think I’m getting arrested?” 
I hope Hillary is feeling very scared right about now. Does she think she can just get away with all of her lies?! Apparently the entire democratic party thinks the same. These people are despicable. America, do yourself a favor and KEEP HER OUT OF OFFICE. Related Items",0

NYT Scare Tactics for Hillary 
by Stephen Lendman 
The Times shamelessly serves as Hillary’s press agent, masquerading as a legitimate source of news and information. 
On November 5, its editors hyped a nonexistent “catastrophe that looms if we wake up Wednesday morning to President-elect Trump…Averting the worst starts with electing Hillary Clinton,” they blustered. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/06/opinion/sunday/imagining-america-on-nov-9.html?_r=1 
Appealing to voters unwilling or dubious about supporting her, they ignored her high crimes and unfitness for any public office, calling Trump “an ignorant and reckless tyrant,” then asking: “(W)hat did you do to stop him” if he emerges triumphant? 
Claiming “Republican efforts to jam the electoral machinery through lies, legal obstructions and the threat of violence,” they ignored DNC rigged primaries for Hillary, urging voters to “hold out, however intimidating the process and long the lines.” 
The Times never served its readers responsibly, an exclusive voice for wealth, power and privilege. Its press agent journalism for Hillary turned itself into a laughing stock – disgracefully supporting a war criminal/racketeer/perjurer, the most recklessly dangerous presidential aspirant in US history, her elevation to the nation’s highest office risking nuclear war. 
Calling the Republican party “sick” ignores America’s deplorable political process too debauched to fix – money controlled fantasy democracy, voters having no say over who governs. 
“If Mr. Trump is rejected on Tuesday, the nation will have a momentary breather,” Times editors blustered, adding “(a)nd some good news to build on…(a)nd the electorate will have demonstrated its decency.” 
It’s hard imagining anyone swallowing this rubbish. Whoever emerges triumphant on November 8, ordinary people lose – with an important difference between Trump and Hillary. 
Her empowerment as commander-in-chief of America’s military risks unthinkable nuclear war. At least with Trump, we’re likely to avoid a potential catastrophe able to end life on earth – what Times editors won’t ever explain, shamelessly supporting a war goddess lunatic endangering everyone.

19333,Our Restaurant Critic Goes National. First Stop: California. - The New York Times,"Editors’ Note: The Times has published starred reviews of restaurants in the New York metropolitan area since 1963. Starting today, we will occasionally offer such reviews of restaurants in other cities as well, applying the same standards that govern our reviews in New York: a minimum of three anonymous visits to the restaurant. SANTA MONICA, Calif.  —   On my table at Cassia was a thick, black, gnarled pig tail. The menu said it was grilled, but I was ready to believe it had been incinerated in a rage, as if I had mortally insulted the chef and serving me this stick of carbon were his revenge. But the nice woman waiting on me didn’t seem to think anything was wrong. She seemed excited for me. Would I like her to cut it up, she asked? “Um,” I began. Before I finished, she slid a knife’s point down the length of the tail. “I want to make sure you really get all the meat,” she said, lifting out links of bone. “Sometimes I see people serving themselves, and they don’t get into it the right way. ” She got into it, all right, leaving me with a heap of meat, soft fat and skin. It was not nearly as annihilated as it looked at first glance. I rolled a forkful or two into a curl of Bibb lettuce with some Thai basil, cilantro and laksa leaf, and dipped it into nuoc cham. The antiphony of char and fat, cool leaves and warm grease, fish sauce and green herbs is in the end a simple thing. Or it would be simple if Vietnamese stalls across the United States sold grilled pig tails. One of the most appealing things about Cassia, a   restaurant here, is its pointed lack of interest in being confrontational, as my meeting with the pig tail illustrates. The restaurant goes out of its way to be accommodating, without doing too much violence to the various Asian cuisines that inspire much of the menu. Bryant Ng, the chef, isn’t in the business of scrawling his signature on other countries’ cultures. He doesn’t max out the fat and the funk, the standard tactic now for American cooks who want to let it be known that they are down with Asian cuisines. He’s more focused on balance than extremes. Mr. Ng owns Cassia with his wife, Kim Ng, and another couple, Josh Loeb and Zoe Nathan, who among other places run an impressive wine bar nearby called Rustic Canyon. The idea of Cassia was to flesh out the ideas Mr. Ng developed at his last restaurant, the Spice Table, within the framework of a busy,   brasserie. A whiff of blazing wood drifts across the menu and around the restaurant, which would look like an aircraft hangar if it weren’t broken up by an open grill, an   counter and a bar where seats have a view of Seventh Street beyond a mountain range of liquor bottles. As if you were at La Coupole, you could start with a shellfish platter, although here you’d be working your way from oysters with a lime and   mignonette and a sambal cocktail sauce, to   claws with a chunky and   romesco, to chilled prawns that taste of garlic, laksa leaf and smoke. Another portal into a meal, one that better suggests the kitchen’s reach, is a charcuterie plate: thin mahogany slices of lamb ham a floppy, spicy sausage something like mortadella crossed with ’nduja spoonfuls of salty pork fat, melting away under bread warm off the grill strips of Singaporean candied bacon a slab of Vietnamese pork meatloaf, liberated from banh mi at last, and excellent with some chopped fermented cabbage. The only dull item of the bunch was the smoked curried duck, a bit dry and not especially curried. The cabbage relish may or may not be Mr. Ng’s homage to choucroute, but his    has more obvious ancestors. The clarity and focus of the broth, along with the tenderness of the braised short rib, come from the classic French pot roast the star anise and cinnamon in the broth are borrowed from Vietnamese pho. The short rib had something in common with corned beef, too, which along with the cabbage and mustard made me wonder whether the Irish weren’t also mixed up in this remarkable dish somehow. It’s the lamb breast, though, that really shows off Mr. Ng’s skill for harnessing the energies of his ingredients. Cumin seeds and Sichuan peppercorns have been stuck on the meat, and then a big   gob of sambal has been dropped on top. Sesame sauce and a bed of jasmine rice lap up the spices. The dish could have landed like a brick to the back of the head, but its powerful flavors are handled with some delicacy. Nothing about Cassia is small. Not the dining room, not the menu, not the   wine list, which covers about 80 bottles from Europe and the West Coast, and not the portions, which are really and truly meant for sharing. My table of three never made it to the bottom of a bowl of chickpeas sunk in a lush coconut yellow curry, as delicious as they were pinched in crisp triangles of flatbread from the clay oven. I left some of the charcuterie fried rice behind, too, even though I’d kept going back in for another taste of sweet lap cheong, pork fat and salted fish long after I’d stopped feeling hungry. On the other hand, my appetite was still intact when I lost interest in the jellyfish salad, the name an unsuccessful attempt to rebrand a   salad that would have been called “oriental” in the 1980s. Meals glide on currents of fish sauce and lime juice, steered by the staff’s attention to the mechanics of   service. Serving spoons arrive before you can ask, and bowls that are wet with the anchovy broth that is poured over black cod will be cleared and replaced before you’re brought the grilled pork belly over Vietnamese vermicelli noodles, slick with a dressing that is a little more concentrated and   than usual. If there are any doubts that Cassia has a thick Gallic streak, the floating islands will dispel them. Yes, the puffs of meringue bobbing in lime crème anglaise are browned, but this is unmistakably the dessert that has disappeared into the mouths of a million French citizens. There is also a tart of dark chocolate with bananas in a pastry shell that is classically crisp. If I were to recommend one meal that captures some of the energy in the Los Angeles dining scene right now, I might come up with reasons not to mention Cassia. It is an outlier. It’s not exploring new horizons in fermentation, like Baroo. It doesn’t offer a direct connection to another country’s cuisine, like the dizzyingly good Sichuan   Chengdu Taste. It isn’t impossibly, irresistibly tiny, like Petit Trois or Le Comptoir. It doesn’t have the      bravura of Night  Market (Song). It isn’t alluringly scruffy, like Gjusta, serving bialys to Venice beach bums. It’s not making an explicit appeal to the generation that grew up thinking of Los Angeles as the easternmost city in Asia, as Roy Choi’s places do. All these other options would flash through my mind. And then I’d wonder if maybe I were overthinking the question. Because, while Cassia is not the epitome of any particular trend, most of the food coming out of its kitchen is just really delicious.",0
19335,US Tells Russia That Time For 'Apocalypse Equation' Is Now,"Report on the phone call held between President’s Putin and Obama says that was discussed that the much feared time for the “Apocalypse Equation” may be now, not later.

The “Apocalypse Equation” refers to report authored by one of the most secretive women in US intelligence circles named Audrey Tomason who is Obama’s Director for Counterterrorism suggesting that it would be more humane for our world to undergo a “planned and controlled genocide” rather than to see it descend into the abyss of chaos it is now entering.


The Apocalypse Equation, (technically called a ""stochastic equation,"" because it describes the relationship of probability to time) shows what nuclear weapons ultimately mean for ""civilization."" If each of a large number of nuclear missiles existing today has even a small probability of being launched, over time the probability of a launch (APocalypse) approaches certainty. The more missiles, the shorter the time before a launch. Unless nuclear weapons are deactivated, and nonviolent means developed to take the place of military violence for achieving justice and peace, civilization is doomed .

Sex Files: FBI agents guilty of sleeping with sources, watching porn at work and searching files for addresses of ‘hot’ celebrities 
By Daniel Bates – Daily Mail – Feb 1, 2011 
It is supposed to be the nation’s elite police force, working to the highest standards of all. But hundreds of FBI agents each year are in fact having to be disciplined for serious breaches of misconduct, secret files have revealed. 
In the past three years more than 1,000 FBI employees have been found guilty of inappropriate behaviour, including one agent who had a sexual relationship with a source. Another agent used FBI databases to get personal details about celebrities he thought were ‘hot’. And one male member of staff shared confidential information with his news reporter girlfriend, and then threatened to release a sex tape the two had made unless she kept it quiet. 
The litany of misconduct was detailed in confidential summaries of disciplinary rulings obtained by CNN. The disclosure threatens to undermine the FBI’s reputation for, as its own motto points out, ‘Fidelity, Bravery, Integrity’. The bureau could also face harsh criticism over its refusal to fire any of those caught out, even though the offences were of a grave nature. 
Among the toughest punishments was for the agent who had the seven-month sexual relationship with a source. He was suspended for 40 days. Another employee drunkenly ‘exploited his FBI employment’ at a strip club by falsely claiming he was conducting an official investigation. He was suspended for 30 days. In another case a supervisor who viewed pornography in his office during work hours, while ‘sexually satisfying himself’ (so the file states) got a 35-day suspension. And an employee in a ‘leadership position’ misused a government database to check on two friends who were exotic dancers and allowed them into an FBI office after hours was ordered to stay away from work for 23 days. 
President of the FBI Agents’ Association Konrad Motyka said such behaviour was ‘never acceptable’. He added: ‘Demonstrable incorrect conduct or criminal conduct is not acceptable and never should be’. 
FBI Assistant Director Candice Will defended the decision not to fire any of the employees caught out behaving inappropriately. She said that 500 cases of misconduct were referred to her in the bureau’s Office of Professional Responsibility each year. Of those around 70 per cent – or 350 – were disciplined, including 30 who were fired. 
The FBI employs 34,300 people, including 13,700 agents. 
Assistant Director Will said: ‘We do have a no-tolerance policy. We don’t tolerate our employees engaging in misconduct. ‘We expect them to behave pursuant to the standards of conduct imposed on all FBI employees. It doesn’t mean that we fire everybody. You know, our employees are human, as we all are. We all make mistakes. So, our discipline is intended to reflect that. We understand that employees can make mistakes, will make mistakes. When appropriate, we will decide to remove an employee. When we believe that an employee can be rehabilitated and should be given a second chance, we do that.’ Rate this:",0
19338,Rapper Wiz Khalifa Angers Colombia with Visit to Pablo Escobar’s Grave,"A photo of rapper Wiz Khalifa apparently paying tribute to the late Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar sparked furor across the South American country this week.

19339,He who has no name speaks: Italian earthquakes were retribution for anti-Jewish UNESCO vote,"  GPD is our General Posting Department whereby we share posts from other sources along with general information with our readers. It is managed by our Editorial Board He who has no name speaks: Italian earthquakes were retribution for anti-Jewish UNESCO vote By GPD on October 28, 2016 Likud deputy minister: Italy earthquakes retribution for UNESCO vote Deputy Minister Ayoob Kara attributes two earthquakes in Italy, during which he was on a state visit to the Vatican, to Italy's decision to vote for a UNESCO resolution disregarding Jewish connection to Jerusalem Deputy Minister Ayoob Kara By Itamar Eichner for YNet News, Israel Deputy Minister Ayoob Kara (Likud) caused controversy when he blamed two massive earthquakes which hit Italy on Wednesday for the country’s vote in favor of a UNESCO resolution disregarding a Jewish connection to the Temple Mount. The deputy minister, who was in Italy when the earthquakes hit, ascribed the natural disasters to divine will.The resolution itself sparked an outcry in Israel and among the international Jewish community since it disregarded the Jewish connection to its holy sites in Jerusalem.
Kara headed an Israeli delegation to the Vatican which was sent in an effort to shore up opposition for the resolution. Kara even managed to have a short conversation with the Pope during his visit. 
“Going through the earthquake wasn’t the most comfortable of experiences, but we trusted that the Holy See would keep us safe,” Kara wrote in his memo. 
“I’m sure that the earthquake happened because of the UNESCO decision, which the Pope strongly disagreed with. He even said publicly that the holy land is connected to the Nation of Israel.” 
After recovering from the earthquake, Kara met with the Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Parolin, and tried to convince the cardinal to change the Vatican’s position on the UNESCO decision. 
Two earthquakes, which struck Italy this week, were “retribution” for the country’s support of the UNESCO resolution disregarding the Jewish connection to Jerusalem, Israeli Deputy Minister for Regional Cooperation Ayoob Kara said. 
“I’m sure that the earthquake happened because of the UNESCO decision,” Kara, a member of the ruling Likud Party, wrote in a memo, Ynetnews website reported. 
Ironically, the Israeli politician was on a state visit to the Vatican when the quakes hit central Italy on Wednesday, killing one and injuring 10 people. 
Earlier the same day, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), passed a resolution criticizing Israel for its handling of the holy site in Jerusalem – called Temple Mount by Jews, and Haram al-Sharif by Muslims. 
The document was adopted after heated debate over its wording, and particularly the Arabic names used in the document. Italy was among the nations voting in favor of the resolution. 
Israel blasted UNESCO and its Arab members for trying to undermine Jewish connections to the holy site. 
Kara arrived in the Vatican in a fruitless effort to avert the resolution, but still managed to have a small chat with the leader of the Catholic Church. 
According to Kara, Pope Francis “strongly disagreed” with the resolution. 
“He (the Pope) even said publicly that the holy land is connected to the Nation of Israel,” the deputy minister stressed. 
As for surviving the natural disaster, the Israeli politician said that “going through the earthquake was not the most comfortable of experiences, but we trusted that the Holy See would keep us safe.” Related Posts: No Related Posts The views expressed herein are the views of the author exclusively and not necessarily the views of VT, VT authors, affiliates, advertisers, sponsors, partners, technicians, or the Veterans Today Network and its assigns.

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/abc-news-caught-staging-fake-crime-scene.html ABC News has been caught staging a fake “crime scene” for reporter Linsey Davis to report from in a segment broadcast on Good Morning America. Viewers were presented with the sight of Davis standing in front of yellow police tape with the words “SHERIFF’S LINE DO NOT CROSS” and ABC News, reporting from the site for hours, claimed Davis was in the middle of an active crime scene.But she wasn’t. The ABC News report had more in common with a Hollywood production than a breaking news report.Linsey Davis was actually standing in a field in Woodruffe, South Carolina – not at the crime scene she was claiming to be reporting from.Sources with knowledge of the matter say the sheriff’s tape was placed there by the ABC News crew for the purpose of its inclusion in the live shot.A photo leaked by an anonymous source shows the sheriff’s tape running no more than 30 yards – and tied at both ends to ABC News camera stands. Busted – and ABC know it. “This action is completely unacceptable and fails to meet the standards of ABC News,” said Julie Townsend, the vice president of communications at ABC News. “As soon as it was brought to our attention, we decided to take the producer out of the field, and we’re investigating further.” Fake Sheriff’s Tape, Fake News But ABC News’ recent behavior gets even worse. While they are spending money and resources on faking crime scenes to set their viewers’ pulses racing, they have also been exposed misleading their audience about real news.After ignoring the bombshell news that the FBI has been conducting an active investigation into the Clinton Foundation for more than a year, Good Morning America on Friday finally realized they couldn’t continue ignoring the story without losing credibility.So they covered the story. But only for 40 seconds and only to dismiss it as “inaccurate and “unsubstantiated.” CBS This Morning’s Major Garrett followed up by chiding “unconfirmed speculation.”On Good Morning America, correspondent Tom Llamas continued the misleading angle. “With just four days to go, Trump in full attack mode against Hillary Clinton, sending his crowds into a frenzy with these unsubstantiated reports ABC News sources say are inaccurate.” How can anybody trust these exposed liars anymore? Deceit and manipulation are fundamental to mainstream media operations these days. Evidence that the Main Stream Media is fabricating news for propaganda reasons:",0
19342,In the Shadow of a Fairy Tale - The New York Times,"When she was 6, my stepdaughter, Lily, told me that her favorite character in “Cinderella” was the evil stepmother. This wasn’t entirely surprising. During play dates, Lily often liked to play orphan, writing down long lists of chores: dichs (dishes) moping (mopping) feeding (the fish). She and a friend liked to drink something they called pepper water, which was ordinary tap water they pretended their cruel   had made undrinkable. Maybe it was thrilling to stage her own mistreatment, to take power over the situation of powerlessness she had imagined. Maybe she just liked a virtuous reason to dump water on the floor. When I asked Lily why Cinderella’s stepmother was her favorite character, she leaned close to me and whispered, like a secret, “I think she looks good. ” For all her cruelty, the evil stepmother is often the   character most defined by imagination and determination, rebelling against the patriarchy with whatever meager tools have been left to her: her magic mirror, her vanity, her pride. She is an artist of cunning and malice, but still  —   an artist. She isn’t simply acted upon she acts. She just doesn’t act the way a mother is supposed to. That’s her fuel, and her festering heart. In many ways, fairy tales  —   dark and ruthless, often structured by loss  —   were the stories that most resembled Lily’s life. Her mother died just before her 3rd birthday, after a   struggle with leukemia. Two years later, Lily got a stepmother of her own  —   not a wicked one, perhaps, but one terrified of being wicked. I wondered if it was comforting for Lily to hear stories about   children who had lost what she had lost  —   unlike most of the kids at her school, or in her ballet classes, whose mothers were still alive. Or perhaps it brought the stories dangerously near, the fact that she shared so much with them. Maybe it peeled away their protective skins of fantasy, made their pepper water too literal, brought their perils too close. When I read her the old fairy tales about daughters without mothers, I worried that I was pushing on the bruises of her loss. When I read her the old fairy tales about stepmothers, I worried I was reading her an evil version of myself. I sought these tales avidly when I first became a stepmother. I was hungry for company. I didn’t know many stepmothers, and I especially didn’t know many stepmothers who had inherited the role as I had inherited it: fully, overwhelmingly, with no other mother in the picture. Our family lived in the aftermath of loss, not rupture  —   death, not divorce. This used to be the normal way of being a stepmother, and the word itself holds grief in its roots. The Old English “steop” means loss, and the etymology paints a bleak portrait: “For stepmoder is selde guod,” reads one account from 1290. A text from 1598 says, “With one consent all stepmothers hate their daughters. ” The fairy tales are obviously damning: The evil queen from “Snow White” demands the secret murder of her stepdaughter after a magic mirror proclaims her beauty. The stepmother from “Hansel and Gretel” sends her stepchildren into the woods because there isn’t enough to eat. Cinderella sits amid her fireplace cinders, sorting peas from lentils, her   body appeasing a wicked stepmother who wants to dull her luminosity with soot because she feels threatened by it. It’s as if the stepmother relationship inevitably corrupts  —   it is not just an evil woman in the role but a role that turns any woman evil. A “stepmother’s blessing” is another name for a hangnail, as if to suggest something that hurts because it isn’t properly attached, or something that presents itself as a substitutive love but ends up bringing pain instead. The evil stepmother casts a long, primal shadow, and three years ago I moved in with that shadow, to a     apartment near Gramercy Park. I sought the old stories in order to find company  —   out of sympathy for the stepmothers they vilified  —   and to resist their narratives, to inoculate myself against the darkness they held. My relationship with Charles, Lily’s father, held the kind of love that fairy tales ask us to believe in: encompassing and surprising, charged by a sense of wonder at the sheer fact of his existence in the world. I uprooted my life for our love, without regret. Our bliss lived in a thousand ordinary moments: a first kiss in the rain,   eggs at a roadside diner in the Catskills, crying with laughter at midnight about some stupid joke he would make during an “American Ninja Warrior” rerun. But our love also  —   always  —   held the art and work of parenting, and much of our bliss happened on stolen time: that first kiss while the sitter stayed half an hour late those diner eggs on a spontaneous road trip possible only because Lily was staying with her grandmother in Memphis our hands clamped over our mouths during those fits of midnight laughter so we wouldn’t wake up Lily in the next room. This felt less like compromise and more like   a divergence from the scripts I’d always written for what my own life would look like. I approached the first evening I spent with Lily as a kind of test, though Charles tried to stack the deck in my favor: He decided we would get takeout from the pasta place Lily liked, then spend the evening watching her favorite movie  —   about two princess sisters, one with a touch that turned everything to ice. That afternoon, I went to find a gift at the Disney Store in Times Square  —   not only a place I had never been but a place I had never imagined going. I hated the idea of bribing Lily, trading plastic for affection, but I was desperately nervous. Plastic felt like an insurance policy. The clerk looked at me with pity when I asked for the “Frozen” section. I suddenly doubted myself: Was it not a Disney movie? The clerk laughed when I asked the question, then explained: “We just don’t have any merchandise left. There’s a worldwide shortage. ” She was serious. They had nothing. Not even a tiara. Or they had plenty of tiaras, but they weren’t the right tiaras. I scanned the shelves around me: Belle stuff, “Sleeping Beauty” stuff, Princess Jasmine stuff. There had to be other movies Lily liked, right? Other princesses? There was a moment when I considered buying something related to every princess, just to cover my bases. I had some vague realization that the   panic in the back of my throat was the fuel capitalism ran on. On my cellphone, I was on hold with a Toys “R” Us in the Bronx. On my way out, I spotted something shoved into the corner of a shelf. It looked wintry. It had   cardboard packaging: a sled. I cannot even tell you my relief. My sense of victory was complete. The sled came with a princess, and also maybe a prince. (A Sami ice harvester, I would learn.) The set came with a reindeer! (Named Sven.) And even a plastic carrot for him to eat. I tucked the box under my arm protectively as I walked to the register. I eyed the other parents around me. Who knew how many of them wanted this box? I called Charles, triumphant. I told him the whole saga: the clerk’s laughter, the worldwide shortage, the frantic phone calls, the sudden grace of glimpsing   cardboard. “You won!” he said, then paused. I could hear him deciding whether to say something. “The princess,” he asked, “what color is her hair?” I had to check the box. “Brown?” I said. “Sort of reddish?” “You did great,” he said after a beat. “You’re the best. ” But in that beat, I could hear that I had the wrong princess. Charles wasn’t criticizing he just knew how much a princess could mean. He had spent the last two years   in princesses, playing mother and father at once. The truth of the wrong princess was also the truth of unstable cause and effect: With parenting, you could do everything you were supposed to, and it might still backfire, because you lived with a tiny, volatile human who did not come with any kind of instruction manual. The possibility of failure hung like a low sky, pending weather, over every horizon. In “The Uses of Enchantment,” the psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim makes a beautiful argument for the kinds of reckoning that fairy tales permit: They allow children to face primal fears (parental abandonment) and imagine acts of rebellion (defying authority) in a world reassuringly removed from the one they live in. Enchanted woods and castles are so conspicuously fantastical, their situations so extreme, that children don’t need to feel destabilized by their upheavals. I wondered if that was still true for Lily, whose loss lived more naturally in fairy tales than other places. It can be a fine line between stories that give our fears a necessary stage and stories that deepen them  —   that make us more afraid. In an 1897 letter to the editor in Outlook, a       American lifestyle magazine, one reader laments the effects of reading “Cinderella” to young children: “The effect or impression was to put stepmothers on the list of evil things of life. ” But in our home, it was less that “Cinderella” put stepmothers on an evil list and more that the story raised the question  —   with a kind of openness that might have been impossible otherwise  —   of whether stepmothers belonged there. Often, Lily used the figure of a   wicked stepmother to distinguish our relationship from the one we had just read. “You’re not like her,” she would say. Or when it came to the stepmother she admired from “Cinderella,” she was generous: “You look better than her anyway. ” I wondered if claiming the stepmother as her favorite was another version of playing orphans  —   a way of claiming the source of fear and taking some control over it. Did she worry I would turn cruel? Did she love me fiercely so I wouldn’t? I wondered if it helped her to see us reflected and distorted by a dark mirror, if these more sinister versions of our bond made her feel better about our relationship  —   or gave her permission to accept what might feel hard about it. I actually found a strange kind of comfort in the nightmare visions of mean stepparents I found in popular media  —   at least I wasn’t cruel like them. It was a kind of ethical schadenfreude. In many ways, these stories my family inherited mapped imperfectly onto ours. In fairy tales, the   was often duped and blind. He had faith in a woman who didn’t deserve it. His trust, or his lust, permitted his daughter’s mistreatment. Charles was like these   fathers in only one way: He trusted me from the beginning. He believed I could be a mother before I believed it. He talked openly about what was hard about parenting, which made it feel more possible to live in love and difficulty  —   love as difficulty. He knew what it meant to wake day after day, choose three possible dresses, pour the cereal, repour the cereal after it spilled, wrestle hair into pigtails, get to school on time, get to pickup on time, steam the broccoli for dinner. He knew how much it meant to learn the difference between the animated ponies with wings and the animated ponies with horns and the animated ponies with both  —   the alicorns. He knew what it meant to do all that, and then wake up and do it all over again. My relationship with Lily, too, was not like the story we inherited from fairy tales  —   a tale of cruelty and rebellion  —   or even like the story of   popular media: the child spurning her stepmother, rejecting her in favor of the true mother, the mother of bloodline and womb. Our story was a thousand conversations on the 6 train or at the playground in Madison Square Park. Our story was painting Lily’s nails and trying not to smudge her tiny pinkie. Our story was telling her to take deep breaths during tantrums, because I needed to take deep breaths myself. Our story began one night when I felt her small, hot hand reach for mine during her favorite movie, when the Abominable Snowman swirled into view on an icy mountain and almost overwhelmed the humble reindeer. That first night, when we sang songs at bedtime, she scooted over and patted the comforter, in the same bed where her mother spent afternoons resting during the years of her illness, directly below the hole Charles had made  —   angrily swinging a toy train into the wall  —   after a telephone call with an insurance company, a hole now hidden behind an alphabet poster. “You lie here,” Lily told me. “You lie in Mommy’s spot. ” If the wicked stepmother feels like a   archetype, then its purest, darkest incarnation is the evil queen from “Snow White. ” In the Brothers Grimm tale from 1857, she asks a hunter to bring back her stepdaughter’s heart. After this attack fails (the hunter has a bleeding heart of his own) the stepmother’s aggression takes the form of false generosity. She goes to her stepdaughter in disguise, as an old beggar crone, to offer Snow White objects that seem helpful or nourishing: a corset, a comb, an apple. These are objects a mother might give to her daughter  —   as forms of sustenance, or ways of passing on a female legacy of    —   but they are actually meant to kill her. They reach Snow White in the folds of her new surrogate family, where the seven dwarves have given her the opportunity to be precisely the kind of “good mother” her stepmother never was. She cooks and cleans and cares for them. Her virtue is manifest in precisely the maternal impulse her stepmother lacks. The evil stepmother is so integral to our familiar telling of “Snow White” that I was surprised to discover that an earlier version of the story doesn’t feature a stepmother at all. In this version, Snow White has no dead mother, only a living mother who wants her dead. This was a pattern of revision for the Brothers Grimm they transformed several mothers into stepmothers between the first version of their stories, published in 1812, and the final version, published in 1857. The figure of the stepmother effectively became a vessel for the emotional aspects of motherhood that were too ugly to attribute to mothers directly (ambivalence, jealousy, resentment) and those parts of a child’s experience of her mother (as cruel, aggressive, withholding) that were too difficult to situate directly in the biological   dynamic. The figure of the stepmother  —   lean, angular, harsh  —   was like snake venom drawn from an unacknowledged wound, siphoned out in order to keep the maternal body healthy, preserved as an ideal. “It is not only a means of preserving an internal   mother when the real mother is not all good,” Bettelheim argues, “but it also permits anger at this bad ‘stepmother’ without endangering the good will of the true mother, who is viewed as a different person. ” The psychologist D. W. Winnicott puts it more simply: “If there are two mothers, a real one who has died, and a stepmother, do you see how easily a child gets relief from tension by having one perfect and the other horrid?” In other words, the shadow figure of the   stepmother is a predatory archetype reflecting something true of every mother: the complexity of her feelings toward her child, and a child’s feelings toward her. Even if Lily didn’t split her ideas of motherhood into perfect absence and wicked presence, I did  —   assigning precisely that psychic division of labor. I imagined that her biological mother would have offered everything I couldn’t always manage: patience, pleasure, compassion. She would have been with Lily in her tantrums. She wouldn’t have bribed her with ridiculous amounts of plastic. She wouldn’t get so frustrated when bedtime lasted an hour and a half, or else her frustration would have the counterweight of an unconditional love I was still seeking. I knew these   were ridiculous  —   even “real” parents weren’t perfect  —   but they offered a certain easy groove of   comforting in its simplicity. A woman mothering another woman’s child, Winnicott observes, “may easily find herself forced by her own imagination into the position of witch rather than fairy godmother. ” In a study called “The Poisoned Apple,” the psychologist (and stepmother) Elizabeth Church analyzed her interviews with 104 stepmothers through the lens of one particular question: How do these women reckon with the evil archetype they stepped into? “Although their experience was the opposite of the   stepmothers,” she reported, insofar as “they felt powerless in the very situation where the   stepmothers exerted enormous power,” they still “tended to identify with the image of the wicked stepmother. ” She called it their poisoned apple: They felt “wicked” for experiencing feelings of resentment or jealousy, and this fear of their own “wickedness” prompted them to keep these feelings to themselves, which only made them feel more shame for having these feelings in the first place. Folk tales often deploy the stepmother as a token mascot of the dark maternal  —   a woman rebelling against traditional cultural scripts  —   but the particular history of the American stepmother is more complicated. As the historian Leslie Lindenauer argues in “I Could Not Call Her Mother: The Stepmother in American Popular Culture, ” the figure of the American stepmother found her origins in the American witch. Lindenauer argues that the   popular imagination took the same terrible attributes that the Puritans had ascribed to witches  —   malice, selfishness, coldness, absence of maternal impulse  —   and started ascribing them to stepmothers instead. “Both were examples of women who, against God and nature, perverted the most essential qualities of the virtuous mother,” Lindenauer observes. “Moreover, witches and stepmothers alike were most often accused of harming other women’s children. ” The stepmother became a kind of scapegoat, a new repository for aspects of femininity that felt threatening: female agency, female creativity, female restlessness, maternal ambivalence. By the late 18th century, the stepmother was a stock villain, familiar enough to appear in grammar books. One boy was even injured by his dead stepmother from beyond the grave, when a column above her tombstone fell on his head. The particular villainy of the stepmother  —   the duplicity of tyranny disguised as care  —   enabled colonial rhetoric that compared England’s rule to “a stepmother’s severity,” as one 1774 tract put it. In an article that ran in Ladies’ Magazine in 1773, on the eve of the American Revolution, a stepdaughter laments her fate at the hands of her stepmother: “Instead of the tender maternal affection . .. what do I now see but discontent,   and    authority?” The stepmother offers bondage cunningly packaged as devotion. But the American popular imagination hasn’t always understood the stepmother as a wicked woman. If it was true that she was an   gold digger  —   a   witch  —   then it was also true that she was a    saint, happily prostrate to the surge of her own innate maternal impulse. In the Progressive Era, she was proof that being a good mother was less about saintly instincts and more about reason, observation and rational  . You didn’t have to have a biological connection  —   or even an innate caregiving impulse  —   you just had to apply yourself. When I interviewed Lindenauer about her research, she told me that she was surprised to discover these vacillations, surprised to find the figure of the virtuous stepmother showing up in the very same women’s magazines that had vilified her a few decades earlier. She eventually started to detect a pattern. It seemed as if the stepmother found redemption whenever the nuclear family was under siege: in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War, or when divorce emerged as a social pattern in the early 20th century. The stepmother became a kind of “port in the storm,” Lindenauer told me. “It’s better to have a stepmother than no mother at all. ” The golden era of the American stepmother archetype  —   the summit of her virtue  —   was the second half of the 19th century, during and after the Civil War, when sentimental novels and women’s magazines were full of saintly stepmothers eager to care for the motherless children who stumbled into their laps. In Charlotte Yonge’s 1862 novel, “The Young   or, a Chronicle of Mistakes,” the young stepmother Albinia is portrayed as a woman with a surplus of good will, just waiting for people with needs  —   read: grief  —   deep enough to demand the deployment of her excess goodness. Her siblings worry about her marrying a widower with children, afraid she will become a kind of indentured servant, but the novel reassures us that “her energetic spirit and love of children animated her to embrace joyfully the cares which such a choice must impose on her. ” When her new husband brings her home, he apologizes for what he is asking from her. “As I look at you, and the home to which I have brought you, I feel that I have acted selfishly,” he says. But she won’t let him apologize. “Work was always what I wished,” she replies, “if only I could do anything to lighten your grief and care. ” With the children, Albinia says everything right: She is sorry they have her in place of their mother. They can call her Mother, but they don’t have to. Although the novel is subtitled “A Chronicle of Mistakes,” Albinia doesn’t seem to make many. When I read in the novel’s epigraph, “Fail  —   yet rejoice,” it felt like a lie and an impossible imperative at once. In fact, the entire voice of the saintly stepmother felt like an elaborate humblebrag. She knew she would always be second  —   or third! or fifth! or 10th!  —   but she didn’t care. Not one bit. She just wanted to be useful. I thought I would be glad to discover these virtuous stepmothers, but instead I found them nearly impossible to accept  —   much harder to stomach than the wicked stepmothers in fairy tales. My poisoned apple wasn’t the wicked stepmother but her archetypal opposite, the saint, whose innate virtue felt like the harshest possible mirror. It would always show me someone more selfless than I was. These stories forgot everything that was structurally difficult about this kind of bond, or else they insisted that virtue would overcome all. This is why fairy tales are more forgiving than sentimental novels: They let darkness into the frame. Finding darkness in another story is so much less lonely than fearing the darkness is yours alone. I punished myself when I lost patience, when I bribed, when I wanted to flee. I punished myself for resenting Lily when she came into our bed, night after night, which wasn’t actually a bed but a futon we pulled out in the living room. Every feeling I had, I wondered: Would a real mother feel this? It wasn’t the certainty that she wouldn’t, but the uncertainty itself: How could I know? I had imagined that I might feel most like a mother among strangers, who had no reason to believe I wasn’t one, but it was actually among strangers that I felt most like a fraud. One day early in our relationship, Lily and I went to a Mister Softee, one of the ice cream trucks parked like land mines all over the city. I asked Lily what she wanted, and she pointed to the double cone of soft serve, the biggest one, covered in rainbow sprinkles. I said, Great! I was still at the Disney Store, still thrilled to find the sled set, still ready and willing to pass as mother by whatever means necessary, whatever reindeer necessary, whatever   necessary. The double cone was so huge that Lily could barely hold it. Two hands, I would have known to say a few months later, but I didn’t know to say it then. I heard a woman behind me ask her friend, “What kind of parent gets her child that much ice cream? ”’u2029I felt myself go hot with shame. This parent. Which is to say: not a parent at all. I was afraid to turn around. I also wanted to turn around. I wanted to make the stranger feel ashamed, to speak back to the maternal superego she represented, to say: What kind of mother? A mother trying to replace a dead one. Instead I grabbed a wad of napkins and offered to carry Lily’s cone back to our table so she wouldn’t drop it on the way. As a stepparent, I often felt like an impostor  —   or else I felt the particular loneliness of dwelling outside the bounds of the most familiar story line. I hadn’t been pregnant, given birth, felt my body surge with the hormones of attachment. I woke up every morning to a daughter who called me Mommy but also missed her mother. I often called our situation “singular,” but as with so many kinds of singularity, it was a   blade  —   a source of loneliness and pride at once  —   and its singularity was also, ultimately, a delusion. “Lots of people are stepparents,” my mother told me once, and of course she was right. A Pew Research Center survey found that four in 10 Americans say they have at least one step relationship. Twelve percent of women are stepmothers. I can guarantee you that almost all these women sometimes feel like frauds or failures. In an essay about stepparents, Winnicott argues for the value of “unsuccess stories. ” He even imagines the benefits of gathering a group of “unsuccessful stepparents” in a room together. “I think such a meeting might be fruitful,” he writes. “It would be composed of ordinary men and women. ” When I read that passage, it stopped me dead with longing. I wanted to be in that meeting, sitting with those ordinary men and women  —   hearing about their   bribes, their everyday impatience, their frustration and felt fraudulence, their desperate sleds. In the methodology portion of her “Poisoned Apple” study, Church admits that she disclosed to her subjects that she was also a stepmother before interviewing them. After an interview was finished, she sometimes described her own experiences. Many of her subjects confessed that they had told her things during their interviews that they had never told anyone. I could understand that  —   that they somehow would feel, by virtue of being in the presence of another stepmother, as if they had been granted permission to speak. It was something like the imagined gathering of unsuccessful stepparents, as if they were at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in a church basement, taking earned solace in the minor triumphs and frequent failures of their kind: a kind of kin. The decision to call the stepmother Mother, or the decision not to call her Mother, is often a dramatic hinge in stories about stepmothers, a climactic moment of acceptance or refusal. In a story called “My ” published in The Decatur Republican in 1870, a young girl regards her new stepmother with skepticism. When her stepmother asks her to play a song on the piano, trying to earn her trust and affection, the girl decides to play “I Sit and Weep by My Mother’s Grave. ” But lo! The stepmother is undeterred. She not only compliments the girl on her moving performance she shares that she also lost her mother when she was young and also used to love that song. The story ends on a triumphant note, with the daughter finally calling her Mother, an inverted christening  —   child naming the parent  —   that inaugurates the “most perfect confidence” that grows between them. For Lily, calling me Mother wasn’t the end of anything. The day after Charles and I married in a Las Vegas wedding chapel  —   just before midnight on a Saturday, while Lily was having a sleepover with her cousin  —   Lily asked almost immediately if she could call me Mommy. It was clear she had been waiting to ask. I remember feeling moved, as if we had landed in the credits at the end of a movie, the soundtrack crescendoing all around us. But we weren’t in the credits. We were just getting started. I was terrified. What would happen next? What happened next was pulling into a   for snacks and feeling Lily tug on my sleeve to tell me she had an “adult drink” at the   birthday party and now felt funny. She didn’t want me to tell her dad. It was like the universe had sent its first maternal test. Was she drunk? What should I do? If I was going to let myself be called Mommy, I had to be prepared to deal with the fallout from the   birthday party. Charles eventually deduced that she had had a few sips of iced tea. It felt less as if I had “earned” the title of mother  —   the way it has figured in so many sentimental stories, as a reward for behaving the right way and defying the old archetypes  —   and more as if I had landed in the 1900 story called “Making Mamma,” in which    Samantha layers a dressmaker’s dummy with old fabric in order to make a surrogate mother for herself. It was as if Lily had bestowed a deep and immediate trust in me  —   unearned, born of need  —   and now I had to figure out how to live inside that trust without betraying it. Once I stepped into the costume of a   cultural archetype, I got used to hearing other people’s theories about my life. Everyone had ideas about our family without knowing anything about our family. One woman said our situation was easier than if I had a terrible ex to compete with another woman said I would be competing with the memory of Lily’s perfect biological mother forever. When I wrote about a family vacation for a travel magazine, the editor wanted a bit more pathos: “Has it been bumpy?” she wrote in the margins of my draft. “What are you hoping for from this trip? A tighter family bond? A chance to let go of the sadness? Or . .. ?? Tug at our heartstrings a bit. ” I realized that when this editor imagined our family, she envisioned us saturated by sadness, or else contoured by resistance. More than anything, I liked her “Or . .. ? ?” It rang true. It wasn’t that every theory offered by a stranger about our family felt wrong it was more that most of them felt right, or at least held a grain of truth that resonated. Which felt even more alarming, somehow, to be so knowable to strangers. But every theory also felt incomplete. There was so much more truth around it, or else something close to its opposite felt true as well. I rarely felt like saying, No, it’s nothing like that. I usually wanted to say: Yes, it is like that. And also like this, and like this, and like this. Sometimes the fact of those assumptions, the way I felt them churning inside everyone we encountered, made stepmotherhood feel like an operating theater full of strangers. I was convinced that I was constantly being dissected for how fully or compassionately I had assumed my maternal role. I’u2009only ever found two fairy tales with good stepmothers, and they were both from Iceland. One stars a woman named Himinbjorg, who helps her stepson through his mourning by helping him fulfill the prophecy his mother delivered to him in a dream: that he will free a princess from a spell that had turned her into an ogre. By the time he returns from his mission victorious, the royal court is ready to burn Himinbjorg at the stake, because everyone is convinced that she is responsible for his disappearance. What I read as her selflessness moved me. She is willing to look terrible in order to help her son pursue a necessary freedom. I worried that I cared too much about proving I was a good stepmother, that wanting to seem like a good stepmother might get in the way of actually being a good stepmother. Perhaps I wanted credit for mothering more than I wanted to mother. Himinbjorg, on the other hand, is willing to look like a witch just to help her stepson break the spell he needs to break. Then there was Hildur. Hildur’s husband had vowed never to marry after the death of his first queen, because he was worried that his daughter would be mistreated. “All stepmothers are evil,” he tells his brother, “and I don’t wish to harm Ingibjorg. ” He is a   king who has already absorbed the wisdom of fairy tales. He knows the deal with stepmoms. But he falls in love with Hildur anyway. She says she won’t marry him, though  —   not unless he lets her live alone with his daughter for three years before the wedding. Their marriage is made possible by her willingness to invest in a relationship with his daughter that exists apart from him, as its own fierce flame. The closest thing Lily and I ever had to an Icelandic castle was a series of bathrooms across Lower Manhattan. Bathrooms were the spaces where it was just the two of us: the one with wallpaper made from old newspapers, the one where she insisted that people used to have braids instead of hands, the one at a Subway with a concrete mop sink she loved because it was “cool and simple. ” Bathrooms were our space, just as Wednesdays were our day, when I picked her up from school and took her to the Dunkin’ Donuts full of cops at Third Avenue and 20th before I rushed her to ballet, got her suited in her   leotard and knelt before her tights like a supplicant, fitting bobby pins into her bun. At first, I expected an Olympic medal for getting her there only two minutes late. Eventually I realized that I was surrounded by mothers who had done exactly what I’d just done, only they had done it two minutes faster, and their buns were neater. Everything that felt like rocket science to me was just the stuff regular parents did every day of the week. But those afternoons mattered, because they belonged to me and Lily. One day, in a   bathroom in SoHo  —   a few months before Lily, Charles and I moved into a new apartment, the first one we would rent together  —   Lily pointed at the walls: pink and brown, decorated with a lacy pattern. She told me she wanted our new room to look like this. Ours. She had it all planned out. In the new place, Daddy would live in one room, and we would live in the other. Our room would be so dainty, she said. She wasn’t even sure boys would be allowed. This was what Hildur knew: We needed something that was only for the two of us. A few months later, reading Dr. Seuss’s “Horton Hatches the Egg” to Lily in that new apartment, I felt my throat constricting. Horton agrees to sit on an egg while Mayzie the bird, a flighty mother, takes a vacation to Palm Beach. Mayzie doesn’t come back, but Horton doesn’t give up. He sits on a stranger’s egg for days, then weeks, then months. “I meant what I said, and I said what I meant,” he repeats. “An elephant’s faithful, one hundred per cent!” When the egg finally hatches, the creature that emerges is an  : a   baby with a small, curled trunk and   wings. Her tiny trunk made me think of Lily’s hand gesticulations  —   how big and senseless they got, like mine  —   and how she had started to make   lists, as I did, just so she could cross things off. But she also had a poster of the planets in her bedroom, because her mom had loved outer space, and she was proud to say she always had her “nose in a book,” just as her grandmother told her that her mother always had. She has two mothers, and she always will. For me, the stakes of thinking about what it means to be a stepmother don’t live in statistical relevance  —   slightly more than 10 percent of American women might relate!  —   but in the way stepparenting asks us to question our assumptions about the nature of love and the boundaries of family. Family is so much more than biology, and love is so much more than instinct. Love is effort and desire  —   not a sentimental story line about easy or immediate attachment, but the complicated bliss of joined lives:    sandwiches, growing pains at midnight, car seats covered in vomit. It’s the days of showing up. The trunks we inherit and the stories we step into, they make their way into us  —   by womb or shell or presence, by sheer force of will. But what hatches from the egg is hardly ever what we expect: the child that emerges, or the parent that is born. That mother is not a saint. She’s not a witch. She’s just an ordinary woman. She found a sled one day, after she was told there weren’t any left. That was how it began.",0
19343,Syria - Waiting For The Next Moves,"November 08, 2016 Syria - Waiting For The Next Moves 
We had expected a Syrian Army ""Election Campaign"" , a large size attack on Al Bab or east-Aleppo. That did not happen despite the right ""assets"" being in place and I have heard no reason yet why it was delayed. The Russian aircraft carrier group, which was expected last Friday along the Syrian coast, will only arrive this evening. It must have intentionally slowed its travel. There has been no single Syrian or Russian airstrike on east-Aleppo in last 21 days. ""Rebel"" shelling of west-Aleppo has not stopped for a day and caused many casualties. That will now change. One Russia source claims the Russian fleet will engage immediately. NOTAMs, NOtices To Air Men, about imminent operations on Syria's west-coast have been released. The declared areas and times of operation correspond to a campaign, not a single strike. 
After some 12 days of fighting, the second large al-Qaeda campaign to break the siege on east-Aleppo by attacking the south western side of west-Aleppo completely failed. While the first round nearly achieved a break through but was then contained the second attack was only a alibi attempt which never made any progress towards its claimed aim. The Syrian army has recaptured the housing project 1070 and will soon have cleaned all other areas that were shortly in the hands of the Jihadis. The loss in material and men for the Jihadis were immense. The Syrian army has finally learned how to defend against suicide vehicle bombs: have adequate weapons ready in the front line to kill them on their approaches. Of nearly 20 such bomb runs only 3 or 4 reached their targets and losses from those were less sever than from earlier bombs. The Jihadis and their ""western"" media and ""expert"" proxies seem to have given up on east-Aleppo. There is no sign that another break through attempt will be launched. 
The Obama administration has announced a campaign to encircle Raqqa in center-east Syria. It bought help from the Kurdish YPG to achieve that and has thereby excluded a Turkish campaign. The taking of Raqqa is supposed to be left to some Arab troops in cooperation with the Kurds. But those Arab troops do not yet exist and hiring and training has not even begun. The whole announcement of the beginning of a Raqqa campaign was obviously not serious. The Kurds will take a few small towns and the U.S. will temporarily protect them from sever Turkish interference in their areas in Syria. Raqqa will not be attacked before next years spring. 
The Turks are now miffed (though silently relieved) that they were not asked to take part in the Raqqa campaign. They have been promised that they may help to ""develop a long-term plan for seizing, holding and governing Raqqa"". That means exactly nothing. But the Turks never had a real chance to go and take Raqqa. It is too far from their borders and the imponderables are too big. 
In the area around Damascus the Ghouta rebel hold out has been split and reduced to small kettles which will be eliminated within a few days. The Syrian capital is safe for now and its people can live a rather normal life without fear of being killed in the next minute by some random grenade. A significant number of troops will become available when all the small rebel areas around the capital are gone. Those can be used in future campaigns. The frontline strength of the Syrian army in critical areas will increase and its maneuver force will become more powerful and efficient. 
The momentum in all of west Syria is on the side of the Syrian government. The Jihadists are more and more concentrated in Idleb governate and city. When the surrounded hold outs in its back are eliminated the Syrian army can launch an assault on them. The east is complicate. Deir Ezzor is still surrounded by ISIS and will likely be attacked again soon. Reinforcements for the defenders would be welcome. 
The Kurds are playing games and change alliances every now and than. For the time they again bet on the U.S. - a hope that has already been disappointed several times. The U.S. will let them fall as soon as it is convenient. The Kurds will learn again that such a policy does not bear tasteful fruits. There is a common Turkish and Syrian interest in cutting them back to size. In a year from now we may see new surprise alliances in that area. 
All the positive developments we have seen especially in west-Syria may be for naught if a new U.S. president decides to throw up the chess board and risk World War III by attacking Syrian and Russian positions. Its about the most stupid thing Washington could do and has thereby a good chance to happen.

• The risk of false positives . Besides leading to unnecessary mental anguish and medical treatment, a false cancer diagnosis may also interfere with your eligibility for medical insurance, which can have serious financial ramifications 
• The risk of false negatives , which is of particular concern for dense-breasted women 
• The fact that ionizing radiation actually causes cancer and may contribute to breast cancer when done over a lifetime. 
Results published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) show that women carrying the BRCA1/2 gene mutation are particularly vulnerable to radiation-induced cancer 1 
• The fact that studies repeatedly find that mammograms have no impact on mortality rates As so expertly demonstrated in the video above, created by Dr. Andrew Lazris and environmental scientist, Erik Rifkin, Ph.D., it’s easy to misunderstand the benefits of mammograms. Mammograms are said to reduce your risk of dying from breast cancer by 20 percent, but unless you understand where this number comes from, you’ll be vastly overestimating the potential benefit of regular mammogram screening . Most doctors also fail to inform patients about the other side of the equation, which is that far more women are actually harmed by the procedure than benefit from it. 1 in 1,000 Women Is Saved by Regular Mammogram Screening While 10 Undergo Cancer Treatment for No Reason Incredible as it may sound, the 20 percent mortality risk reduction touted by conventional medicine actually amounts to just 1 woman per 1,000 who get regular mammograms. How can that be? As explained in the video, for every 1,000 women who do not get mammograms, 5 of them will die of breast cancer. For every 1,000 women who do get mammograms, 4 will die anyway. The difference between the two groups is 20 percent (the difference of that one person in the mammogram group whose life is saved). On the other side of the equation, out of every 1,000 women who get regular mammograms over a lifetime: HALF will receive a false positive. So while they do NOT have cancer, about 500 out of every 1,000 women getting mammograms will face the terror associated with a breast cancer diagnosis 64 will get biopsies, which can be painful and carry risks of adverse effects 10 will go on to receive cancer treatment for what is in actuality NOT cancer, including disfiguring surgery and toxic drugs or radiation. Surgery, chemo and radiation are all risky, and dying from the treatment for a cancer you do not have is doubly tragic All things considered, the evidence seems quite clear; most women should probably avoid mammograms, as they cause far more harm than good. Many studies have now come to that conclusion, and the most recent research, 2 published just in time for Breast Cancer Awareness Month, again hammers home that point. Harms of Mammography Eclipse Benefits For this study, the researchers analyzed U.S. cancer statistics collected by the government in order to estimate the effectiveness of mammography. By comparing records of breast cancers diagnosed in women over the age of 40 between 1975 and 1979 — a time before mammograms came into routine use — and between 2000 and 2002, three key findings emerged. 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 The incidence of large tumors (2 centimeters or larger) has declined, from 68 percent to 32 percent The number of women diagnosed with small tumors has increased, from 36 to 64 percent The incidence of metastatic cancer, which is the most lethal, has remained stable This may initially sound like good news for mammograms, but in absolute numbers, the decrease in large tumors was actually rather small — a mere 30 tumors less per 100,000 women. Meanwhile, the dramatic increase in small tumors was mostly attributed to overdiagnosis — an estimated 81 percent of these small tumors did not actually need treatment. The fact that metastatic cancer rates remained even suggests we’re not catching more of them, earlier. Instead, we’re catching and treating mostly harmless tumors. The researchers also found that two-thirds of the reduction in breast cancer mortality was attributable to improved treatment, such as the use of tamoxifen. Breast cancer screening only accounted for one-third of the reduction in mortality. Lead researcher Dr. H.Gilbert Welch explains the findings of the study in the video above. As reported by WebMD: 9 “The upshot, according to Welch, is that mammography is more likely to ‘overdiagnose’ breast cancer than to catch more-aggressive tumors early. What’s more, the researchers said that while breast cancer deaths have fallen since the 1970s, that is mainly due to better treatment — not screening. Welch noted the current study’s findings have nothing to do with women who feel a lump in the breast. ‘They need to get a mammogram,’ he stressed. But, Welch suggested, when it comes to routine screening, women can decide based on their personal values.” Screening as Personal Choice When speaking to NBC news, Welch went on to say that “screening is a choice. It’s not a public health imperative.” 10 At present, most conventional cancer specialists do view mammograms as an imperative, although recommendations vary depending on who you listen to. As of last year, the American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends women of average risk should have their first mammogram at age 45, followed by an annual mammogram up until age 55. Women 55 and older should have them every other year. 11 Meanwhile, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends waiting until the age of 50, and only getting a mammogram every other year thereafter. 12 In response to heated debate over the varying guidelines, the U.S. Congress passed legislation requiring insurance companies to cover mammograms regardless of age. Not surprisingly, the ACS has sharply criticized the latest study. In a statement, chief cancer control officer of ACS, Dr. Richard Wender, said: “These conclusions are bold, attention-grabbing and should be taken with a grain of salt — actually, an entire spoonful.” The problem with Wender’s attitude is that this is by no means the first or only study suggesting that mammography has been vastly oversold. In fact, a number of studies have now refuted the validity of mammography as a primary tool against breast cancer. The Evidence Overwhelmingly Refutes Routine Use of Mammography Other studies that support the findings of the featured study include the following: ✓ Archives of Internal Medicine, 2007 : A meta-analysis of 117 randomized, controlled mammogram trials. Among its findings: Rates of false-positive results are as high as 56 percent after 10 mammograms. 13 ✓ Cochrane Database Review, 2009 : This review found that breast cancer screening led to a 30 percent rate of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, which actually INCREASED the absolute risk of developing cancer by 0.5 percent. The review concluded that for every 2,000 women invited for screening throughout a 10-year period, the life of just one woman was prolonged, while 10 healthy women were treated unnecessarily. 14 ✓ New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), 2010 : This study concluded that the reduction in mortality as a result of mammographic screening was so small as to be nonexistent — a mere 2.4 deaths per 100,000 person-years were spared as a result of the screening. 15 ✓ The Lancet Oncology, 2011 : This study described the natural history of breast cancers detected in the Swedish mammography screening program between 1986 to 1990, involving 650,000 women. Since breast lesions and tumors are aggressively treated and/or removed before they can be determined with any certainty to be a clear and present threat to health, there has been little to no research on what happens when they are left alone. This study however, demonstrated for the first time that women who received the most breast screenings had a HIGHER cumulative incidence of invasive breast cancer over the following six years than the control group who received far less screenings. 16 ✓ The Lancet, 2012 , showed that for every life saved by mammography screening, three women are overdiagnosed and treated with surgery, radiation or chemotherapy for a cancer that might never have given them trouble in their lifetimes. 17 ✓ Cochrane Database Review, 2013 : A review of 10 trials involving more than 600,000 women found mammography screening had no effect on overall mortality. 18 ✓ NEJM, 2014 : Drs. Nikola Biller-Andorno and Peter Jüni published a paper in which they describe the findings of an independent health technology assessment initiative to assess the effectiveness of mammography, of which they were a part: 19 “First, we noticed that the ongoing debate was based on a series of reanalyses of the same, predominantly outdated trials … Could the modest benefit of mammography screening in terms of breast-cancer mortality that was shown in trials initiated between 1963 and 1991 still be detected in a trial conducted today? 
Second, we were struck by how nonobvious it was that the benefits of mammography screening outweighed the harms. 
The relative risk reduction of approximately 20 percent in breast-cancer mortality associated with mammography that is currently described by most expert panels came at the price of a considerable diagnostic cascade, with repeat mammography, subsequent biopsies and overdiagnosis of breast cancers — cancers that would never have become clinically apparent … 
Third, we were disconcerted by the pronounced discrepancy between women’s perceptions of the benefits of mammography screening and the benefits to be expected in reality. The figure shows the numbers of 50-year-old women in the United States expected to be alive, to die from breast cancer, or to die from other causes if they are invited to undergo regular mammography every [two] years over a 10-year period, as compared with women who do not undergo mammography … The Swiss Medical Board’s report was made public on February 2, 2014. 20 It acknowledged that systematic mammography screening might prevent about one death attributed to breast cancer for every 1,000 women screened, even though there was no evidence to suggest that overall mortality was affected. 
At the same time, it emphasized the harm — in particular, false positive test results and the risk of overdiagnosis … The board therefore recommended that no new systematic mammography screening programs be introduced and that a time limit be placed on existing programs. In addition, it stipulated that the quality of all forms of mammography screening should be evaluated and that clear and balanced information should be provided to women regarding the benefits and harms of screening.” ✓ British Medical Journal (BMJ), 2014 : A Canadian study put the rate of overdiagnosis and overtreatment from mammography at nearly 22 percent. 21 ✓ JAMA Internal Medicine, July 2015 : Here, researchers concluded mammography screenings lead to unnecessary treatments while having virtually no impact on the number of deaths from breast cancer. A positive correlation between breast cancer screening and breast cancer incidence was indeed found, but there was no positive correlation with mortality. 22 , 23 ✓ Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, September 2015 : The conclusion of this study is stated right in the title, which reads: “Mammography screening is harmful and should be abandoned.” 24 , 25 In short, the authors concluded that decades of routine breast cancer screening using mammograms has done nothing to decrease deaths from breast cancer, while causing more than half (52 percent) of all women undergoing the test to be overdiagnosed and overtreated. According to lead author Peter C. Gøtzsche, had mammograms been a drug, “it would have been withdrawn from the market long ago.” It’s Time to Revise the ‘When in Doubt, Cut It Out’ Mentality Going back to where we started, even when using the cancer industry’s own statistics mammography comes up short, provided you understand what the 20 percent actually means. To reiterate, the difference between getting routine mammograms and not getting them is that the life of 1 in 1,000 women is saved. Four die even with mammograms, compared to five deaths among those who do not get screened. And again, 10 of those 1,000 screened women will be treated for cancer even though they do not actually have it. Clearly the choice is yours. If you find comfort in thinking you may be that one person who is saved, then by all means follow your heart or gut instinct. Just be clear about the risks, because the chances are far greater you could be one of the 10 who ends up undergoing chemo or a mastectomy for a tumor that would not have caused you harm. As noted by Dr. Joann Elmore of the University of Washington School of Medicine: 26 “We get credit for curing disease that never would have harmed the patient. We receive positive feedback from patients thanking us for ‘saving my life,’ alarming feedback from patients with ‘missed diagnoses’ and no feedback at all from patients whose cancer was overdiagnosed. The mantras, ‘All cancers are life-threatening’ and ‘When in doubt, cut it out’, require revision.” Solid Evidence for Vitamin D as a Cancer Prevention Tool Mammograms are portrayed as the best form of “prevention” a woman can get. But early diagnosis is not the same as prevention. And when the cancer screening does more harm than good, how can it possibly qualify as your best hope? I believe the evidence really speaks for itself when it comes to mammography. The same can be said for research into vitamin D, which repeatedly shows that optimizing your vitamin D level within a range of 40 to 60 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) provides impressive cancer protection. I believe testing your vitamin D level is one of the most important cancer prevention tests available. Ideally get tested twice a year. There are exceptions, of course. If you feel a lump in your breast, a mammogram may be warranted, although even then there are other non-ionizing alternatives, such as ultrasound, which has been shown to be considerably superior to mammography, especially for dense-breasted women who are at much higher risk of a false negative when using mammography. One of the most recent studies 27 looking at vitamin D for breast cancer found that vitamin D deficiency is associated with cancer progression and metastasis. As noted by Stanford University researcher, Dr. Brian Feldman: 28 “A number of large studies have looked for an association between vitamin D levels and cancer outcomes, and the findings have been mixed. Our study identifies how low levels of vitamin D circulating in the blood may play a mechanistic role in promoting breast cancer growth and metastasis .” Having higher levels of vitamin D has also been linked to increased likelihood of survival after being diagnosed with breast cancer. 29 In one study, breast cancer patients who had an average of 30 ng/ml of vitamin D in their blood had a 50 percent lower mortality rate compared to those who had an average of 17 ng/ml of vitamin D. I am really grateful that the medical community has embraced vitamin D and started using it. However, it’s important to understand that the best way to get vitamin D is from sensible sun exposure, and if you’re really interested in optimal health and healing you will do everything in your power to get it. This is one of the reasons I moved to Florida. I have not swallowed vitamin D in over 8 years and still have levels over 60 ng/ml. There are many other benefits of sunlight exposure other than vitamin D. Over 40 percent of sunlight is near-infrared rays that your body requires to structure the water in your body and stimulate mitochondrial repair and regeneration. If you merely swallow vitamin D and avoid the sun, you are missing a primary benefit of sensible sun exposure. If you are stuck in the winter and have low vitamin D, it is probably best to swallow oral vitamin D like a drug, but please recognize that this is a FAR inferior way to optimize vitamin D levels and you are missing many important biological benefits when you avoid sun exposure. You can learn more about vitamin D’s influence on cancer and other health problems in my previous article, “ The Who, Why and When of Vitamin D Screening .” The fact of the matter is there are many strategies that are far more beneficial in terms of breast cancer prevention than mammography. So if you’re hitching your fate on mammograms, you’re doing yourself a huge disservice. For key dietary guidelines and lifestyle strategies that can help reduce your cancer risk, please see my previous article, “ Top Tips to Decrease Your Breast Cancer Risk .” Another excellent resource is Dr. Christine Horner’s book, “Waking the Warrior Goddess: Dr. Christine Horner’s Program to Protect Against and Fight Breast Cancer ,” which contains scientifically validated all-natural approaches that can protect against and treat breast cancer.

19345,"For Kansas Coach Bill Self, Sticking to Basketball Is Convenient - The New York Times","KANSAS CITY, Mo.  —   Kansas Coach Bill Self has spent a lot of time with his basketball team this season, certainly more time than should be necessary. But that’s expected when many of your players entangle themselves in    troubles. Away from the floor, he has counseled them to be good. In   talks, he has begged them to stay focused. In one instance, when the freshman star Josh Jackson was questioned by the police in early December about the possibility that he damaged a car belonging to a Kansas women’s basketball player, Self was right there in a study room of Jackson’s dorm, at his side. It also happened to be 5:46 a. m. on a Thursday, not exactly the normal meeting time for a coach and a player. Self, who is in his 14th season coaching at Kansas, probably had better things to do that morning. But his team  —   which is the No. 1 seed in the Midwest Region of the N. C. A. A. tournament and on Thursday will play No. 4 Purdue in the round of 16  —   has demanded more than just Xs and Os and motivational speeches from him. And he has given more. Yet he wants to talk about it less. On Wednesday, he deflected a question about what it has been like for him to deal with players’ behavior problems in a season when the Jayhawks could win it all. Yet he should know that if the Jayhawks keep winning, those questions will keep coming. “I couldn’t be prouder,” Self said at a news conference. “And I’m proud of how they’ve handled everything. ” There has been a lot to handle. Just in the last few months, too. Here’s a quick list: On Jan. 25, The Kansas City Star reported that the University of Kansas police were investigating a possible rape of a    in the dormitory where the basketball players live, with other male students. Five players were listed as witnesses  —   Frank Mason III, Mitch Lightfoot, Lagerald Vick, Tucker Vang and Jackson  —   subjecting Self to a crash course on criminal justice. “From what I have learned,” Self said, “a witness can be many things,” including someone who might or might not have even been at the scene of the crime. During that rape investigation, the police found two glass smoking devices, one with residue, in the junior forward Carlton Bragg Jr. ’s room and charged him with possession of drug paraphernalia. Bragg was suspended indefinitely from the team. Indefinitely, as in three whole games. At the end of January, The Star again reported bad news for the Jayhawks. A university investigation found that Vick, a sophomore guard, most likely hit a female student, the women’s basketball player McKenzie Calvert, in the arm multiple times in 2015 and kicked her in the face. The report recommended two years of probation for Vick for committing domestic violence. Two years of probation, but he continued to play basketball. Then in March, Calvert, the player whose car Jackson is accused of damaging, said she was temporarily suspended for her actions in the episode involving Jackson, and that her subsequent playing time decreased dramatically. She said it bothered her that Jackson did not receive similar punishment. At the Big 12 tournament this month, Jackson was suspended for the first game, but not for the car incident. Instead, he was punished for backing into a car on campus without telling the police and then getting three tickets in connection with the incident. At that tournament, Self praised his team for playing through all the distractions. Self explained himself further last week, saying his players took responsibility for what happened and have since moved on. “It’s not easy to have your name across the ticker each and every day about something when somebody keeps bringing up an additional thing or two when we already know this took place a long  —   quite a while ago,” he said of incidents, which didn’t actually take place all that long ago. His players have also gone out of their way to keep their season from being irreparably stained. Several said on Wednesday they had a meeting before the N. C. A. A. tournament to remind themselves to just keep their heads down and play. Focusing on basketball meant talking only about basketball. Jackson said that “a lot of guys on our team made mistakes, I have as well,” and that Self “has done a great job” in keeping the team from being distracted by its    issues. Vick said he considers Self to be just like a father because he protects the players and teaches them to simply do their jobs. Bragg said Self teaches them “so many    lessons. ” “Like how to be a man,” Bragg said. “Little things. How to talk to people. How to give handshakes. Just the little things. ” When asked if the team had learned a lesson from all of this season’s problems, Bragg said: “I don’t really want to go into that. No comment. ” The silence was all part of Self’s plan. He wanted his team to rally around Jackson, and it has. He asked his team to forget about the past, and it has, at least for the time being. He said his team was aware of what was going on when it came to its problems beyond basketball, but was trying to look at the big picture. That picture features a basketball court and a shiny trophy. “I think it’s just, sometimes, families go through stuff and you just gotta put blinders on and go at the job at hand,” Self said last week. “And I think they’ve kind of found their basketball court as their safe haven. ” Until they have to head to another kind of court. Jackson’s coming court date in the property damage incident is April 12. He was also scheduled to appear in court on Monday for his traffic violations, but according to a clerk at the Lawrence Municipal Court, that date was changed to April 14. After the basketball season is over.",0
19346,Video: Mexican Cartel Forces Rivals to Clean in Lingerie Inside Prison,"MONTERREY, Nuevo Leon  —   A leaked video that was allegedly taken inside a prison in this border state revealed how a group of cartel members dressed their rivals in lingerie and mocked them as they were forced to clean various cells. [The video shows a group of cartel members on their hands and knees wearing bras and other lingerie crawling on the floor while other kick them and shout various insults. The   inmates are forced to clean one of the common areas inside the Apodaca state prison.   Some of the insults shouted by the inmates point to the humiliated cartel members being members of the Cartel Del Noreste (CDN) faction of the Zetas cartel. Breitbart Texas has reported in the past that the CDN has been fighting a territorial war with a rival faction of the Zetas called “Vieja Escuela Z” or Old School Z. It remains unclear if the inmates humiliating the CDN are rivals or members of the same faction who have switched sides.  One of the men on the floor has been identified as Daniel Gustavo “El Muletas” Valencia Treviño. A regional leader within the CDN, he was named Muletas or “Crutches” due to the loss of his leg. Valencia Treviño was arrested in late February by Mexican authorities.  It remains unclear when the video was taken, however Nuevo Leon authorities confirmed to Breitbart Texas that  as soon as the video surfaced, they carried out a series of raids at the prisons in Apodaca and Topo Chico where they seized a cell phone, various shanks, and some small remnants of marijuana. Editor’s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.  The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used. Breitbart Texas’ Cartel Chronicles are published in both English and in their original Spanish. This article was written by “M. A. Navarro” from Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas and Tony Aranda from Monterrey, Nuevo León. ",0
19347,Neediest Cases Fund Opens 105th Campaign - The New York Times,"Michael Marrero discovered just how fragile his family’s circumstances were when his wife and son were unexpectedly hospitalized with a rare disease. Mr. Marrero, a butcher, could not cobble together enough money to pay the medical bills and the cost of getting to and from doctor appointments, as well as the family’s everyday expenses. The bills mounted and went unpaid as the family tried to decide which to settle up first. The Marreros were evicted from their apartment in January and have been living in a shelter since then. Desperate for help, they turned to the Children’s Aid Society, one of the eight beneficiary organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The Neediest Cases Fund was born in 1912, the year after Adolph S. Ochs, then the publisher of The New York Times, gave a stranger money for shelter and new clothes on Christmas Day. The first campaign lasted nine days and collected $3, 630. 88, about $86, 575 in today’s dollars, from 117 contributors. The fund begins its 105th campaign on Sunday, adding its first beneficiary organization in decades, as the country rebounds from a crippling recession that has left some New Yorkers still searching for a recovery of their own. But it is not just those knocked down by economic forces who have sought assistance, often from overburdened social service groups trying to supply a lifeline. Those in need of help can often pinpoint the moment they slipped into poverty, homelessness or despair. For Gertrudis Torres, it was after her husband died of throat cancer and she faced soaring bills for her own cancer treatment. For Latoya Farquharson, it was when her boyfriend went to prison and she had to raise their two children and pay the rent on a cleaner’s salary. For David Nublett, it was when he was hit by a car in the Bronx and could no longer work or get up and down the stairs to his   apartment by himself. Since it was founded, the Neediest Cases Fund has assisted thousands of children, families, single parents and retirees. They have received counseling, job training and other social services. Often, the help is more tangible: $65 to cover a college application fee $150 for a tablet computer $500 for baby clothes, a stroller and a crib. The Times pays the fund’s overhead costs, with all donations going directly to the beneficiary organizations. Contributions will be collected through Feb. 10. Private social service organizations have stepped in to try to offset cuts to public assistance at the local, state and federal levels. They have worked to meet the needs not only of those born into families who rely on aid and have long been unable to escape poverty, but also of those who have fallen from the lower tiers of the middle class. From 2010 to 2014, according to the United States Census Bureau, 15. 6 percent of New Yorkers lived in poverty among children, 22. 1 percent belonged to families living below the poverty line. This year, according to data compiled by New York City, nearly 62, 000 homeless people slept in city’s shelters every night in September, about twice as many as during the depths of the financial crisis. “We do the whole cowboy thing of, get on your horse, take your gun, shoot the problem and then you move on and everything’s fine,” said Toba Kerson, a retired professor of social work at Bryn Mawr College. “And that’s not what most of these problems are: They’re chronic. ” “We blame people for things they absolutely cannot help, that are circumstantial as opposed to something that came from within them,” she added. The role of government in providing welfare services has ebbed and flowed over time, from the creation of Social Security during the Great Depression to President Lyndon B. Johnson’s war on poverty in the 1960s to more recent efforts by politicians to scale back social welfare programs. Though such programs have generally improved the lives of people they serve, a large percentage of poor Americans are unable to receive the benefits, said Michael Lipsky, the author of “  Bureaucracy,” a history of   welfare and public service. As a result of lifetime benefit limits and reductions in aid by state governments, he said, less than a quarter of children in poverty across the country receive assistance now, down from   in recent decades. “The poorest of the poor are less well served than they were 20 years ago,” Mr. Lipsky said. “Benefits have been siphoned off. There is less in the aid package than there was. Despite some improvements, the poorest of the poor are not better off. ” Private donations, like those from the Neediest Cases Fund, can help fill those gaps, he said. And today, social service groups are having to adapt to a new landscape of philanthropy. The effects of the financial crisis included a decline in charitable giving, and while donations have risen steadily in the years since, Americans have not been as generous as they were before the downturn. The recession also changed opinions about those who seek assistance, said Judith McCoyd, associate professor at the School of Social Work at Rutgers University. “People looked around and thought, ‘Gee, if this is happening to Uncle Bud and that’s happening to my friend down the street and to all of these people I know,’” she said. “For this short little period of time, people recognized, ‘Wow, bad things do happen to good people. ’” But, she added, Americans’ empathy for those who are not like them has been tested during what was a bitter presidential campaign. Donations to the Neediest Cases campaign surpassed $4 million in the 1990s, topped $6 million in 1998 and peaked at $9. 8 million in 2001. In recent years, contributions have dipped below $6 million last year’s campaign raised $5. 7 million. The need for donations remains as pressing as ever, across all demographics. The International Rescue Committee, which is based in New York City and joins the Neediest Cases Fund this year as the eighth beneficiary organization, serves people across the United States and around the world. Four of the eight organizations supported by the Neediest Cases Fund have religious ties, but all assist anyone in need of help, regardless of their faith. “Sometimes people hear the word ‘Catholic’ and think we’re exclusive to the people we serve,” said Msgr. Alfred LoPinto of Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens. “But it’s important for people to understand that we never ask about anyone’s religious background or beliefs, nor question their ethnicity, orientation or anything like that. We love them as our brothers and sisters, and we want to walk with them as they rebuild their lives. ” The year was 1865. The Civil War had just ended, and homeless, wounded Union soldiers, as well as children orphaned by the war, were living on the streets of Brooklyn. Many of the young boys sold newspapers  —   the original “newsies. ” A predecessor to Brooklyn Community Services was in its first year of existence. Responding to the need, the organization provided orphaned boys with beds, food and schooling. The organization’s focus is much the same today. It provides   and   education, youth development, child abuse prevention services, job training and services for people with mental illness and those who are disabled. It has 25 locations throughout Brooklyn, including the Brooklyn High School for Leadership and Community Service, where   students receive    training. Money raised through the Neediest Cases Fund goes to support   needs and service development. Catholic Charities was founded in 1917 primarily to help improve the lives of children suffering from poverty, abuse and neglect. It still focuses on children, while supporting families coping with hunger, homelessness and other hardships. The organization also works to welcome new immigrants to the United States, including refugees hoping to make New York their home. Catholic Charities is a federation of around 90 charitable agencies in the New York area, serving up to 400, 000 people every year. Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens started in 1899 with a concentration on child welfare, serving families in need, particularly those in immigrant communities. While the organization continues to assist immigrants, it has expanded its mission to include, among other things, aiding those with mental illness and housing homeless people. Money raised through the Neediest Cases Fund goes largely to emergency relief services, especially housing assistance. The organization provides more than 3, 000 units of affordable housing. “We’re not just providing a roof over people’s heads,” said Monsignior LoPinto, the organization’s chief executive. “But also a comprehensive service that helps them rebuild their lives and add stability. We cover A to Z. ” The founding of the Children’s Aid Society, in 1853, is linked to the development of the American child welfare system. At the turn of the 19th century, many immigrant children who had been orphaned were pushed onto New York City’s streets. Today, the society focuses on early education, health and wellness, family and home, and social and emotional development at more than 50 locations across the five boroughs and in Westchester County, N. Y. Money raised through the Neediest Cases Fund provides children with sundry items, from prom dresses to textbooks, that help them live normal lives. Community Service Society was founded when two nonprofits merged in 1939: the Charity Organization Society, founded in 1882, and the Association for the Improvement of the Condition of the Poor, in 1843. Community Service Society helps young people make the transition from school to work, ensuring that they have the tools and knowledge to enter the job market and begin a successful career. Community Service Society enrolls New Yorkers in health insurance, helps them access public benefits and advocates for increased funding for public housing, among its varied services. Founded in 1922, when many of the nonprofits that interacted with government were   organizations, The Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies formed to represent the needs of Protestants at a table that then included Catholics and Jews. At the time, the group focused on child welfare.

19348,Trump and U.S. Chamber of Commerce Pull No Punches on Trade Policy - The New York Times,"In January, Thomas J. Donohue, the feisty chief executive of the U. S. Chamber of Commerce, noted  —   without naming names  —   that there were “loud voices” this election season who talked about walling off America from talent and trade. He called that position “morally wrong and politically stupid. ” In March, Mr. Donohue got a little more blunt. “Donald Trump has very little idea about what trade really is,” he told Bloomberg television. And recently, the gloves came off completely. As the presumptive Republican nominee gave a speech, threatening to rip up trade accords and put tariffs on goods from China, the chamber   its jabs and counterpunches. “Under Trump’s trade plans, we would see higher prices, fewer jobs, and a weaker economy,” read one tweet. Another tweet warned that the chamber’s analysis shows that Mr. Trump’s proposed tariffs “would strip us of at least 3. 5 million jobs. ” For the chamber, the bastion of free enterprise and free trade whose roots date back more than 100 years, Mr. Trump’s willingness to upend trade agreements, to tax goods from important countries and even invite a trade war is tantamount to rolling tanks up to its doors. The acrimonious relationship between the chamber and the presumptive Republican nominee is highly unusual: Historically, the two have been as close as peanut butter and jelly. “I’m pretty sure at this point, Trump is just dug in on immigration and trade and the chamber is just going to have to go past him, basically, try to make sure good policy gets recognized by members of the House and Senate,” said Douglas   who was the chief economist for John McCain’s presidential bid in 2008. Indeed, much of the chamber’s political push is now focused on Congress. The goal is to help Republican candidates who share its principles hold crucial congressional seats, no matter who wins the presidential race. The growing divide between Mr. Trump and myriad bulwarks of the conservative Republican Party comes as the party races toward its convention in Cleveland next week. The convention is typically the time when the party rallies behind its candidate and develops a set of common policy goals and proposals. “What are they going to do with the Republican platform? I have no idea,” said Stuart Stevens, the chief strategist for Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential run. Mr. Trump, with his swaggering,     campaign style, has shown time and again a willingness  —   nay, an eagerness  —   to thumb his nose at the   members of the Republican establishment, whether big donors like the Koch brothers or powerful entities like the U. S. Chamber of Commerce. “They’re a special interest that wants to have the deals that they want to have,” Mr. Trump said to cheers at a packed rally in Bangor, Me. the day after his trade speech. The chamber, he added, was “controlled totally by various groups of people that don’t care about you whatsoever. ” Mr. Trump’s isolationist trade policies play well to individuals who perceive the Republican establishment and their ilk have gotten rich from existing trade policies while their own jobs have moved to   countries like Mexico or China. “He’s running as a populist    candidate and there’s hardly a more important organization on the right side of Washington politics than the Chamber of Commerce,” said Richard L. Hall, a professor at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan. “But I don’t think the Chamber of Commerce is going to sit silent when Trump is taking positions that run against some of their main themes. ” On its website, the chamber has started to post dire predictions of what a Trump presidency might mean. “Republican   Donald Trump has promised to ‘make America great again,’” began an article posted on the chamber’s website in April. “Does a recession sound ‘great’ to you? Do 7 million lost jobs sound like ‘winning’?” The chamber is no fan of Hillary Clinton’s policies, either. The Washington Post recently published an   by Mr. Donohue in which he said both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were wrong on trade. For much of its existence, the chamber acted as a trade association for American businesses, typically adopting   stances on deregulation of various industries, corporate tax rates and trade agreements. That changed when Mr. Donohue took over as the chamber president in 1997. The former chief executive of the American Trucking Associations, with his shock of white hair and   demeanor, Mr. Donohue, 77, morphed the chamber into a political lobbying machine with revenue topping $200 million, according to its 2014 tax filings. The chamber says it does not get involved in presidential elections, and that is mostly true. The Center for Responsive Politics shows relatively small donations given to Republican presidential candidates over the years. In 2012, Mr. Romney was the largest recipient, taking in $36, 900, according to data compiled by the center. A spokeswoman for the chamber said any donations to presidential candidates came from individuals in the chamber, rather than the chamber itself. A spokeswoman for the Center for Responsive Politics said its data typically includes donations from company executives because they have the resources to donate and usually do so for business reasons. While the vast majority of the chamber’s huge cash stockpile goes to its lobbying efforts  —   $124 million in 2014  —   another sizable slice goes to outside advertising. In the midterm elections in 2014, the chamber spent $35 million, overwhelmingly supporting Republican candidates. So far this year, it has spent nearly $14 million, none in support of Democrats. But to Mr. Trump’s point, the chamber does not publicly describe how it makes decisions regarding what policies or politicians to support. Inside the chamber is a bit murky. Its board is a mix of   leaders, trade associations and executives from large corporations, including IBM, Caterpillar, Phillips 66, Dow Chemical Company and Allstate Insurance. But over all, the chamber does not make its membership public. A search of tax records for donations to the chamber shows that while it has received significant donations from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the foundation set up by the billionaire investor Steven A. Cohen, some of its biggest contributions have come from the types of conservative political action committees that Mr. Trump likes to target. Crossroads GPS, the PAC founded by Karl Rove, gave $5. 2 million to the chamber while Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the PAC founded by the Koch brothers, gave $2 million, according to 2014 tax filings, the most recent that were available. In an email, a spokeswoman for the chamber responded to a query by noting that the chamber has a “$250 million operation that represents American businesses of all sizes from across the country. ” When not tackling Mr. Trump on trade, the chamber is throwing its considerable political muscle and money behind Republican candidates in critical congressional races who share its ideology on free trade. Those candidates include Senator Rob Portman, who is fighting for   in the battleground state of Ohio. Before he entered the Senate, Mr. Portman was the United States trade representative for former President George W. Bush, where he supported the Central American Free Trade Agreement. Yet Republican strategists are curious how the gap between Mr. Trump and traditional conservatives over trade and other major themes will play out in the coming months. “Basically, Trump has a position on trade that no one who has ever been a nominee of any party has ever had  —   a 45 percent tariff on goods,” Mr. Stevens, the Romney strategist, said. “How is that going to work where you have joint efforts between the presidential campaign and the state parties with candidates who want free trade? Are you going to have half the phone bank calling for a 45 percent tariff, and the other half calling for reasonable trade policies?”",0

19350,Roger Goodell Doesn’t Think Kaepernick Is Being ’Blackballed’ - Breitbart,"PHOENIX  —   On Tuesday, ESPN reporter Sal Paolantonio asked NFL commissioner Roger Goodell if he thinks free agent quarterback Colin Kaepernick is being “blackballed” after kneeling during the national anthem last season. [“I haven’t heard that from our clubs in any way that that’s an issue,” Goodell said during a press conference to conclude the NFL owners meetings at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix.  Goodell believes that if a team feels Kaepernick can help them win, he’ll likely get signed. “My experience in 35 years is that our clubs make independent evaluations of players they work hard to try to improve their teams,” Goodell added. “But if they think a player can help improve their team, they’re going to do that. ” The NFL has a dearth of elite quarterbacks. With only around   of them in a   league, about   of teams are still searching for a true   at quarterback. Without an elite quarterback, it’s hard to challenge for an NFL championship. The NFL is a   league. Teams like Cleveland, Houston, Denver, San Francisco, Jacksonville and the New York Jets are desperately searching for a franchise quarterback. If Kaepernick was one, he’d be signed by now. But, he’s not, and he hasn’t played well since the 2013 season. As ESPN’s Trent Dilfer put it, he’s a “remedial” reader of defenses. Kaepenick often gets stuck on his primary read, and doesn’t do a good job of seeing the whole field. He has a tendency to drop his eyes and halt his progressions when he feels pocket pressure. He also has accuracy issues. Teams don’t sign mediocre players who are distractions. Great player who are a distraction  —   yes. Middle of the road performers who are distractions usually have a very hard time finding a job. Kaepernick was a major distraction for the 49ers last year due to his anthem kneeling, which became an international story. Why did he kneel? “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” Kaepernick told NFL. com last August. How the United States “oppresses black people and people of color” in the modern era is unclear, but he feels it’s still an issue. However, Kaepernick’s camp has made it clear the quarterback will stand for the National Anthem moving forward. That should help him in his job search. But, what really would help him is playing better.",0

19354,"India Hobbles Through a Cash Crisis, and Electronic Payments Boom - The New York Times","NEW DELHI  —   For a year, Ashish Kumar Mandal scratched out a living selling dumplings on the streets of New Delhi for a bit less than 50 cents a plate, until the government banned most of the country’s currency bills last month, crushing his   business. In desperation, the    took a step he had never even contemplated before: He offered his customers the option of paying electronically. Mr. Mandal is among millions of Indians  —   snack vendors and rickshaw drivers, cobblers and   sellers  —   who are moving swiftly toward a cashless economy, fulfilling what Prime Minister Narendra Modi now says was one of his objectives in banning   and   notes, worth about $7. 40 and $14. 80. India is experiencing an acute shortage of bills to replace the   notes that were banned as of Nov. 9, and which made up 86 percent of the country’s currency. There have been numerous reports of people waiting in line for hours at banks or A. T. M. s, only to find that the machines are out of cash. As the public struggles with too few bills in circulation, business has fallen in many sectors to a small fraction of what it was before the ban. Economists warn that India’s growth of 7. 3 percent in the most recent quarter, among the fastest of any large economy, could take a hit if the cash shortage continues. “After the currency ban, my sales came down sharply,” said Mr. Mandal, who sells dumplings from a handcart in a market in the New Ashok Nagar neighborhood. “Providing change was a big problem. ” After a customer suggested that he take electronic payments, he downloaded software that allows him to accept such transactions on his phone. Forty percent of his sales are now conducted electronically, he says. Even merchants who do not have smartphones are contemplating buying one. “If people are flying in planes, how long we can ride on bullock cart?” asked Sunil Jaiswal, who charges less than $2 to repair watches in an alley near Connaught Place. The   ban was originally presented as a move to curb corruption, counterfeiting and   black money, the   cash on which tax is not paid that is estimated to make up as much as   of business transactions in India. To be effective, the move had to be a closely guarded secret until the last minute, to prevent those holding black money from unloading it before the ban went into effect  —   the morning after the decision was announced. As a result, the government did not print enough replacement cash in time for the change, and it continues to struggle to do so fast enough, creating a cash shortage that has strangled large sectors of the economy. But Indians are switching to electronic payments more rapidly than many experts had predicted, and in speaking of the recent currency moves, Mr. Modi has begun emphasizing the benefits of a cashless economy over the anticorruption fight. Across the country, about 70, 000 merchants a day are signing up for India’s   mobile payments platform, Paytm, about 14 times as many as the daily average before the currency decision, said Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder and chief executive of Paytm and One97 Communications, the   behind it. Since the   ban, the number of daily transactions on Paytm has grown to nearly six million, an increase of 350 percent, and the service is adding half a million users each day, Mr. Sharma said. “Earlier, we were the innovator, now we are the mainstream,” he said. “This is the start of the golden age for financial technology companies. ” More than 230 million people in India use electronic wallets, the finance minister, Arun Jaitley, said, representing nearly   of the country’s population. At the same time, the government has tasked banks in the country with adding one million machines in stores to process credit and debit card transactions by March 2017, a   increase from the 1. 5 million available today. The number of credit and debit card machines that have been added since the   ban was put in place is not yet available. But Icici Bank, one of India’s biggest private lenders, says it has detected a sharp increase in demand from merchants processing debit and credit card charges. A spokeswoman for Icici said that the bank had installed six times as many machines last week as it did, on average, before the limit on   bills. Still, A. P. Hota, managing director and chief executive of the National Payments Corporation of India, an umbrella group for sellers of retail payment systems, said that he was skeptical the government could achieve its goal of adding one million new credit and debit card machines in a few months, calling it “a gigantic task. ” The infrastructure is not yet in place to process the paperwork involved and to teach merchants how to use the machines, he said. “A merchant will have several legitimate queries, like how to reconcile the payments, how to get money, if there is a problem, whom to contact,” Mr. Hota said. “There has to be an infrastructure to handle these queries. ” In part because of increased demand from small and midsize merchants, as well as from government departments, the number of credit and debit card transactions has soared to 10 million a day, more than three times as many as before November, said Deepak Chandnani, managing director for South Asia and the Middle East of Worldline India Private Limited, a division of the French company Atos. Worldline produces about a third of the machines used to process these charges in India. One97, the owner of Paytm, has hired 3, 500 employees in the last month, 50 percent more than it had hired in the previous two years, the company’s founder, Mr. Sharma, said. Unable to meet demand from merchants seeking help setting up the systems, the company ran newspaper advertisements with instructions to help business owners do it themselves. The ads also serve as posters for merchants to advertise that they use Paytm. Saurabh Porwal, 31, who sells onions on the roadside in Harola Market in Noida, a city near Delhi, downloaded the Paytm app after seeing the newspaper advertisement, which he then posted on his stall. “If you deal in less cash, it is less of a problem,” he says. Moving toward a cashless economy would carry benefits for the government, ensuring that more taxes are paid and providing banks with more reserves to extend loans. About 78 percent of transactions in India last year were made in cash, compared with 20 percent in the United States, a joint study by Google India and Boston Consulting Group found. Still, those adopting cashless technology are a minority. At Janpath Cloth Market in Delhi, where vendors shout out discounted prices to   only one of more than 100   shops advertised a cashless system. Amit Maheshwari, who sells men’s pants, displays a white piece of paper on his stall saying, in bold type, “Paytm Accepted Here. ” After the currency change, sales at the shop fell to about 10 percent of what they were before, he said. Then a customer who was browsing said he would buy some pants if he could use Paytm. “We had no idea what this was,” Mr. Maheshwari said. “He taught us how to use it. ” Since adopting Paytm, sales have risen to 50 percent of what they were before the currency change, he said. “Everybody should use it. Anybody can use it,” he said. But many vendors around India are still resistant. Mustkeem Ahemad, 38, who sells chicken in Harola Market, says that electronic payment systems are too complex for him. “How can you pay on a phone? Only an educated person can do it,” he said. “I am illiterate, so I just can’t do it. ”",0
19355,Vitamins Gone Gummy - The New York Times,"For nearly 100 years, candy companies have made gummy treats  —   those chewy,     bears, worms and fish that kids love to eat. But now the gummy bear has grown up. A number of supposedly “  ” gummies for adults have been introduced in the vitamin and supplement market. Among the many choices: Vitafusion sells Power C Gummy Vitamins for Adults, which promise “great tasting gummies with natural orange flavor. ” Caltrate Gummy Bites pack calcium and vitamin D in black cherry, orange or strawberry gummy candies. “They taste good  —   like candy,” said Susan Drexler, 53, a Manhattan real estate agent and gummy vitamin lover. “I take them much more consistently. ” Ms. Drexler got into gummies through her    daughter, Alana. Ms. Drexler has a “bear of a time swallowing large pills or capsules,” she said. A few years ago, she tried some of her daughter’s gummy vitamins, and from then on she was hooked. “Her kid gummies were my ‘gateway drug,’” said Ms. Drexler. “Now I buy the adult ones, and we share those. ” Millions of people are hooked on gummies as a health supplement. Gummy multivitamins accounted for 7. 5 percent of the $6 billion multivitamin market in the United States in 2016, according to estimates from the Nutrition Business Journal and projections from IBISWorld, a research company. And gummy products over all now account for $1 billion of the $41 billion supplement market in the United States, a more than 25 percent jump in sales since 2015, according to IBISWorld. “We’ve seen a really nice increase in demand for gummy supplements over the past three to four years,” Doug Jones, the chief merchandise officer at Vitamin Shoppe, which carries a broad assortment of gummy vitamins and supplements, said in an email. Gummy vitamins and supplements originally targeted children, and were offered as a fun way to get kids to take their vitamins. But in 2012, Perrigo, a supplement maker with headquarters in Ireland, began marketing gummy products to adults. Last year, the company announced that it was partnering with Ferrara Candy Company, maker of Trolli Sour Brite Crawlers, to develop multivitamins for adults over 30. One reason gummy vitamins are so popular with adults these days is “pill fatigue. ” A 2005 AARP study found that, on average, adults 45 and older said they take four prescription medications daily. But some people say that switching to a gummy version of a vitamin or supplement makes them feel as if they aren’t taking so many pills. Gummies also appeal to people who, like Ms. Drexler, have difficulty swallowing pills. The flavorings in gummy candy can also hide the taste. “Vitamins can be nasty,” said Paul Breslin, a professor of nutritional sciences at Rutgers University, and a researcher at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia. “Some taste bad. Some can be astringent. A lot of others have foul odors. Gummies are a pleasant way to mask the aversiveness. ” But beyond the sweet flavor, humans enjoy chewing, said Mr. Breslin. “Let’s face it, these are dynamic experiences of moving your mouth,” he said. “People love to chew it’s in our genes. We buy chewing gum. ” But the pleasures of chewing come at a cost. Consumers can take one Nature Made Vitamin C 1, 000 milligram pill costing about 10 cents (a   bottle costs about $30). To get the same amount of vitamin C from a Nature Made gummy vitamin, consumers would need to take eight gummies, at a cost of about 70 cents (a bottle of 80 125 milligram gummies costs $7) And gummy vitamins typically contain one to two grams of sugar each  —   a 1, 000 milligram dose of Nature Made Gummy Vitamin C contains 8 grams of sugar. Some companies have begun offering   versions of gummy vitamins for consumers who prefer a sugar substitute. One issue with the sweet taste of gummy vitamins and supplements is that people might eat too many. “The only concern I might have is if people are tempted to eat these like candy and end up overdosing on vitamins,” especially “those that are fat soluble,” which can cause a range of problems if ingested over long periods, said Kim Larson, a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Hallie Rich, the president of Alternavites, steered clear of gummies when coming up with her own line of vitamins. “With the fillers and additives there’s only so much space for active nutrients,” she said. “You’re missing ingredients or they aren’t there in enough quality to make a difference. They are a glorified candy. ” Susan Pica agrees. Ms. Pica, 40, the vice president of national sales for an executive transportation company, in Stamford, Conn. saw a gummy vitamin C display at CVS, along with a coupon to “buy one get one free. ” She had fond memories of the Flintstones chewables she took as a child, so she thought she’d try them. “I felt like I was eating Sour Patch Kids,” she said. “’How can these be good for you? My teeth actually hurt from eating them. ” After seeing sugar sprinkled on the vitamins and settled at the bottom of the bottle, she checked the ingredients on the label. The bottle listed sugar, corn syrup and sodium citrate among the ingredients. “I decided to use the gummy vitamins as a treat, like candy,” she said. “Because that’s what they are  —   candy. ”",0
19356,"John Brademas, Indiana Congressman and N.Y.U. President, Dies at 89 - The New York Times","John Brademas, a political, financial and academic dynamo who served 22 years in Congress and more than a decade as president of New York University in an    quest to promote education, the arts and a liberal agenda, died on Monday in Manhattan. He was 89. His death was announced by N. Y. U. Mr. Brademas liked to say that being a university president was not much different from being a congressman: You shake hands, make speeches, remember names and faces, stump for a cause and raise money relentlessly. The difference, he said, is that you do not have to depend on voters to renew your contract every two years. As a Democratic representative from Indiana from 1959 to 1981, Mr. Brademas became known as Mr. Education and Mr. Arts. He sponsored bills that nearly doubled federal aid for elementary and secondary education in the   and that created the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities. He was also instrumental in annual financing of the arts and humanities and in the passage of Project Head Start, the National Teachers Corps and college tuition aid and loan programs. He opposed the Vietnam War and many defense measures, rebuked President Richard M. Nixon in the Watergate scandal and voted for civil rights legislation, environmental protections, day care programs and services for the elderly and people with disabilities. He became majority whip, the House’s   official, and was   10 times in a mostly conservative district, winning up to 79 percent of the vote. But he was swept out of office in the 1980 Republican landslide that elected Ronald Reagan president. Mr. Brademas lobbied hard for the N. Y. U. job and, as president from 1981 to 1992, transformed the nation’s largest private university from a commuter school into one of the world’s premier residential research and teaching institutions. When he took over, Mr. Brademas had no experience running a large organization. The university had seven undergraduate colleges, 10 graduate and professional schools, 13, 000 employees and a $500 million annual budget. There were 45, 000 students and housing for only a few thousand, in crowded Greenwich Village and scattered sites around New York City. But he was a gregarious leader with voluminous contacts in government and corporate life. His skills as a politician and   had been honed in a whirlwind of congressional and civic responsibilities. And, as his admirers came to believe, he was  —   if there is such a thing  —   a natural university president. “No one hit the ground running as well as Brademas,” said L. Jay Oliva, N. Y. U. ’s vice president for academic affairs, who became chancellor and succeeded his boss 11 years later, and who died in April 2014. “All his instincts were university presidential. ” Looking collegiate in tweeds and sweaters, displaying boundless energy, Mr. Brademas plunged into meetings with deans, trustees, students and faculty members to learn N. Y. U. ’s strengths and weaknesses. He joined the boards of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (he later became chairman) the New York Stock Exchange, the Rockefeller Foundation, RCA and the Loews Corporation. He courted investment bankers, foundation executives, real estate moguls and private philanthropists, and reached out to N. Y. U. alumni across the country and around the world. He also cultivated relationships with Mayor Edward I. Koch, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, leaders of the State Legislature and the City Council, newspaper publishers and other media V. I. P. s, union officials, leaders in the arts and the heads of museums, cultural institutions and other colleges and universities. He was often in Washington, conferring with education officials and members of Congress. He stoutly opposed the Reagan administration’s education cutbacks and attempts to abolish the National Endowment for the Arts. By the end of his tenure  —   he stepped down in late 1991 but retired as president emeritus in 1992 after a sabbatical  —   he had raised $800 million for N. Y. U. and nearly doubled its endowment, to $540 million. He had recruited top scholars from around the country to join the faculty added new fields of study, like the Onassis Center for Hellenic Studies and the Skirball Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies enlarged the campus and added 11 residence halls, providing housing for half of the undergraduates. He also had established N. Y. U. study programs in Cyprus, Egypt, France, Israel and Japan. “I find in Washington Square a tremendous sense of diversity, vitality and excitement, products of the enlivening mixture of New York University and New York City,” Mr. Brademas said in his farewell address to 6, 500 graduates. “With all its troubles, New York City is still the place to be. And N. Y. U. is still the place to get an education. ” John Brademas was born on March 2, 1927, in Mishawaka, Ind. the son of Stephen and Beatrice Goble Brademas. His father, a Greek immigrant, ran a restaurant and quoted Socrates to him: “Things of value come only after hard work. ” His mother was an   teacher, and one grandfather was a college professor. In 1945, he graduated from Central High School in nearby South Bend, where he was valedictorian and the star quarterback on the football team. He enrolled at the University of Mississippi, where he joined a Navy officer training program. After his freshman year, he won a scholarship and transferred to Harvard, a change he called  . He became a top student and president of the Wesley Foundation, the campus Methodist student group. In successive summers, he worked at an auto plant in South Bend, lived among Indians in Mexico and was an intern at the United Nations temporary headquarters in Lake Success, N. Y. After graduating from Harvard with high honors in 1949, he attended Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar and in 1954 earned a social studies doctorate. Back home in northern Indiana, he resolved to run for Congress in a largely Republican district with diverse demographics: farmers,   retailers,   workers, members of East European ethnic groups, affluent and   voters, and college communities that included the University of Notre Dame. It took three tries. After losing races in 1954 and 1956, he gained political experience as an aide to two members of Congress and in Adlai E. Stevenson’s 1956 presidential campaign. He taught political science at St. Mary’s College for a year, was active in civic affairs and in 1958 finally won the seat for Indiana’s Third Congressional District. Mr. Brademas was unmarried for most of his political career, but in 1977 he married Mary Ellen Briggs, a   medical student at Georgetown University and the mother of four children by a former marriage. After the couple moved to New York, she became a dermatologist at N. Y. U. Medical Center. She survives him, as do three stepchildren, John Briggs, Katherine Goldberg and Jane Murray a sister, Eleanor Brazeau and six  . His stepson Basil Briggs Jr. died in 2003. Mr. Brademas was the author of “Washington, D. C. to Washington Square” (1986) and, with Lynne P. Brown, “The Politics of Education: Conflict and Consensus on Capitol Hill” (1987). From 1994 to 2001 he was chairman of the President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, and from 2004 to 2007 he was a member of the New York State Board of Regents. In 2005, N. Y. U. established the John Brademas Center for the Study of Congress, a research and teaching facility. He was the recipient of more than 50 honorary degrees and scores of awards, many of them conferred by European governments or cultural organizations, particularly those of Greece and Spain, whose histories and politics had been among his lifelong interests.",0
19357,Nikonorova: Donbass' UN recognition will be Kiev's own fault,"November 17, 2016 - Fort Russ -  Antifashist - translated by J. Arnoldski - 


The international community could recognize the international legal status of the Donetsk People’s Republic if Kiev finally discredits itself in the negotiation process on settling the conflict in Donbass. This was stated by the acting foreign minister of the DPR and representative of the republic to the political subgroup of the Contact Group, Natalya Nikonorova. 
Nikoronova is sure that sooner or later the conditions will be created for the people’s republics to be recognized as participants in international relations with full rights. 
“If we consider the precedent set by Kosovo, which was immediately recognized by several member states of the UN, then the DPR could became a full subject of international relations after a very short period of time given favorable geopolitical factors,” Nikonorova stated. 
According to her, these conditions will be met if Kiev “finally discredits itself in the negotiation process” on resolving the conflict in Donbass. 
At the present moment, the DPR and LPR are not recognized by a single UN member state. The authorities of the people’s republics of Donetsk and Lugansk unilaterally declared independence from Ukraine on May 12th and April 28th, 2014 respectively. The independence of the DPR and LPR is recognized only by South Ossetia, which does not have the status of a recognized state and is not part of the UN. 
For a long time already, the settlement of the situation in Donbass has been complicated largely by Kiev. Even according to Ukraine’s representative to the humanitarian subgroup of the Contact Group, Viktor Medvedchuk, Kiev is purposefully delaying the realization of the Minsk Agreements.  

Recently, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavel Klimkin bragged that Kiev is discussing the formulation of a “road map” for implementing the Minsk Agreements only with Berlin and Paris, but Moscow is equally a guarantor of the document.

19358,"Disappointed in Rio, Tatyana McFadden Returns to Form in New York City Marathon - The New York Times","As Tatyana McFadden churned the hand rings of her racing chair, she climbed the slope of the Queensboro Bridge. Head down, legs tucked underneath, her bent elbows jutted into the air like the hind legs of a grasshopper. It was Mile 16, one of the toughest climbs of the New York City Marathon, the critical spot where triceps scream and biceps throb. “That was my golden ticket right there, Mile 16,” McFadden said after winning the women’s wheelchair race for the fifth time. “I climbed it hard and lost everyone there. ” The race was expected to be one of Sunday’s most thrilling competitions, with a field that included the top three finishers from the Rio Paralympics. There the gold medalist Zou Lihong defeated McFadden in a photo finish. But on Sunday not even a zoom lens could find Zou, who suffered a flat tire near Mile 13 and never made it to Manhattan. McFadden won in 1 hour 47 minutes 43 seconds, almost two minutes ahead of Manuela Schär, to sweep the four major marathons (Boston, London, Chicago, New York) for the fourth straight year. For those riding in the marathon’s lead car, about 15 yards ahead of McFadden, it is a race amid a race. With the trunk of the black S. U. V. open, two race officials sit with their legs splayed in front. Their only backrest is a case of Gatorade tucked behind the back seat. When McFadden gets too close to the lead car, the officials yell, “Speed it up!” When she begins to tailgate again, the driver hits the gas. McFadden’s constant companion is a cameraman sitting precariously in the sidecar of a motorcycle, his dangling arms holding a camera low. She is also flanked by several cyclists who act as bodyguards of sorts by keeping wayward pedestrians at bay. Despite the blue police tape that cordons off the course, despite the barricades and police officers at every intersection, despite the 26. 2 miles of closed city streets, some people do not seem to notice that there is a marathon going on. Twice during the race, pedestrians dart in front of McFadden’s path. At Mile 3, a woman ambles across a line painted in marathon blue near Bay Ridge Avenue. “Watch it, lady!” the officials in the lead car scream. An escort cyclist frantically blows his whistle like a traffic cop trying to prevent a   collision. The woman looks up nonchalantly as if to say, “Oh, is this a thing?” The second near miss happens just before Mile 21. A man enters the crosswalk and looks up at the traffic light  —   which means nothing on Sunday  —   before he hears: “Outta the way! Move!” Stunned, he moves back toward the sidewalk, wondering what the commotion is all about. McFadden does not notice. The view of wheelchair racers is vastly different from that of most runners. In their   chairs, their heads are down, their bodies angled forward. Their attention is inward and downward, on the marathon blue line, on the possible potholes, with the occasional glance over their shoulder to see who trails behind. McFadden does not see the Hasidic Jews walking in Williamsburg, the crayoned signs taped onto a playground fence or the   stretch of Museum Mile. She does not hear the yapping dogs and the crying child or smell the glorious aroma of bacon. “Because of the bridges, because of the corners, because of the road surfaces, New York City is definitely the toughest marathon that we do,” the wheelchair racer Josh George said. “This is one of the few races where I cross the finish line, and I think: ‘Oh, thank you for being done. Thank you that this is over.’ A lot of the other races, you finish, and it was tough, and you’re tired, but you’re not on the brink of dying. ” On the lower level of the Queensboro Bridge, the stretch of the race that is closed to spectators, the Manhattan skyline looms, but it feels like a dark, quietly rumbling tunnel. “I love that bridge,” McFadden said afterward. No one loves that bridge, which is perhaps what sets McFadden apart. Uphill climbs are her specialty. Born with spina bifida and paralyzed from the waist down, she spent six years in a Russian orphanage before being adopted by an American family. Because she had no wheelchair, she taught herself to walk using her arms. Doctors said she probably would not live long, but sports changed  —   and perhaps saved  —   her life. McFadden’s family was here, as usual, including her youngest sister, Ruthi, and her parents, Debbie McFadden and Bridget O’Shaughnessey. They had all set their phone alarms.   time: 3:45 a. m. After a glass of beet juice and an espresso, there was a   of Tatyana’s prerace playlist  —   beginning with Beyoncé’s “Run the World (Girls)” and ending with a family singalong of the Black Eyed Peas’ “I Gotta Feeling. ” Before Tatyana left for the race, she told her parents, “I have to finish what I didn’t finish in Rio. ” McFadden won six medals in Rio, including four golds, in seven events. But it was the   finish on the flat, looped marathon course that tugged at her the most. Zou’s win had stunned the field because she had raced in only one other major marathon, finishing fifth in London earlier this year. After her win in Brazil, Zou was invited by New York Road Runners to become the first Chinese professional woman in its wheelchair event. None of the other top contenders quite knew what to expect from Zou on Sunday since they had never faced her in a race with so many inclines. The first mile, on the   Bridge, is the longest and steepest hill on the course. “We lost her on the first climb,” McFadden said of Zou. So much for a rematch, or even a rival. McFadden pushed well ahead of the field at the start, before Schär, Amanda McGrory and Susannah Scaroni caught up by Mile 6 in Brooklyn. The pack stayed tight until the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge. Koch, a former New York mayor, had a trademark line  —   “How’m I doin’?”  —   and McFadden had an answer. Just fine. She even loves the crosswind. Makes it even tougher. Here she continued to pass the elite male wheelchair racers, including her coach, Adam Bleakney, a   Paralympian. What did he say to his star racer? “Not a word,” Bleakney said. “She was going too fast. ”",0
19359,People in Damascus ‘have fear in their eyes’: Filmmaker,"syria , cinema , movies Russian filmmaker Maria Ivanova. Source: Elena Kern / press-photo 
Where did you find the courage to go to the Middle East to make a film on migrants? 
Maria Ivanova: I began making my film in Berlin, in a camp for refugees. I was searching for a female protagonist. But when I arrived, I was told that girls do not flee Syria alone, only with their husbands or relatives. 
In the end I visually began ""capturing"" interesting faces. I found my protagonist – 14-year-old Muhammad, who was sent by his parents to Germany alone. He did the whole journey alone so that later, he could get his relatives out of Syria through the legal process of family reunification. 
During the shooting I understood that I needed to go to Damascus, where this boy's parents stayed. Because of the hassle in obtaining a Syrian visa my cameraman and I travelled to Syria through Beirut. In Lebanon you don't need a visa. 
U.S. needs Russia in Syria: Russian analysts 
As we were driving along the road I knew that ISIS was only 10 kilometres [6 miles] away, very near. We were driving incredibly fast, at 200 kilometres per hour, when the driver saw a motorcycle coming. So our car quickly turned around and headed in the opposite direction. “Why?” I asked the driver later. Because terrorists often drive around at night on motorcycles, he said. 
That’s how we got to Damascus. There was no heating in the apartment we were taken to. No electricity and hot water. We slept on something similar to a couch. There are no real beds there. And at three in the morning, I heard bombing. 
Is all of Damascus in this state? 
M.I.: I was in the south and there it was frightening to walk out on the street. People have fear in their eyes, the atmosphere is very heavy. 
Did you meet the parents of your protagonist Muhammad? How did you contact them? 
M.I.: They welcomed us with open arms. They fed us. They have all means of communication, they use social networks. After meeting with them we returned to Beirut and went to the refugee camps in Lebanon's mountains, filming there for two weeks. 
Were the Lebanese camps different from the German ones? 
M.I.: Of course. Lebanon doesn’t have special conditions. There’s a character in our film, a man who has 17 children. He lives in a tent that he has divided into several parts. He patches up the holes. They all sleep on the floor. Despite their horrible position, these people offered us food and played the oud [an Arabian musical instrument – RIR] for us. They joked… Their life is based on the hope that they will return home. Of course, many want to go to Europe. They fill out applications. But Europe does not accept everyone. 
Lebanon is an unusual country. Just think, there are 18 religious confessions on a territory that is smaller than the Moscow Region. There are four million residents and one and a half million Syrian refugees. And yet, I never saw a conflict between, say, Christians and Muslims. They all go to the same restaurants, the same movie theatres, everyone is friendly. 
Which films are you taking to the festival in Lebanon? 
M.I.: We finished this documentary film just a few days ago and I decided to hold the premiere in Lebanon, where we shot most of the material. Moreover, our partner, the TV channel RT, is producing two documentary films: Women against ISIS and Sector of Contradiction . The directors of these films are coming to answer questions and hold master classes. 
How much is Russian culture present in Lebanon? Do people speak Russian there? 
M.I.: Many Lebanese studied in the Soviet Union. There is even an association of Soviet university graduates. These people speak Russian, many even married Russian citizens. Furthermore, there are 30,000 Russians living there. There are Lebanese who attend classes and study Russian. Sure, you mostly hear Arabic, English and French. Russian culture is not well known. So we sort of filled a vacuum. 
A common film market for Russia, India and China? 
Is the war in the neighbouring country felt in Lebanon? 
M.I.: You still feel the previous war, the civil war. There are buildings scarred by bombings. There are many military personnel, roadblocks, armoured personnel carriers, patrols. But next to a destroyed building you can find a modern art gallery, which is followed by soldiers again, and then a modern theatre. This is a patchwork country, it is very heterogeneous. 
Once I was at the Sarajevo Film Festival, which had a really heavy atmosphere. There were no stadiums there. They had turned into cemeteries since there was no space for burying people. While in Lebanon you feel very light. You want to live, despite certain moments… The presence of soldiers, on the contrary, creates the feeling of security. 
I travelled there by car with a driver, saw beautiful cities, mountains, wine production. I went to an apple festival. I wasn’t afraid. The country has a modern airport, taxis, hotels, wonderful restaurants, beaches and movie theatres. The thing is that no one anywhere will give you 100-percent guaranteed security, including when you're driving through France or Germany. In terms of security, Lebanon is no different than Europe.

19360,"After Bring Fans to Stands in Droves, Mets Considering Promoting Tim Tebow to AA Ball","After becoming one of the Columbia Fireflies best fan draws, former NFL quarterback and now   baseball player Tim Tebow may be in line for a promotion, according to sources. [Tebow’s playing stats have been quite respectable, especially considers he is almost a decade older than many of his teammates.  The    former Denver Bronco was signed to a minor league contract by the New York Mets this year and has been playing in South Carolina, achieving a 849 OPS over his last 16 games. Tebow has a . . . 370 slash line with two homers and 11 RBIs in 28 games for Columbia, the New York Post reports. His work on the diamond puts him in a solid position and the Mets have taken notice. According to sources, there is talk of bumping the player up to the next level in AA ball. But, there is undoubtedly another reason for this consideration. After all, Tebow has become a major   for the Fireflies. Tebow is helping the Fireflies break team attendance records this year as fans scramble to see their new favorite player. In fact, by some estimates, Tebow has booted attendance for the Fireflies by a whopping 92 percent. Tim Tebow is boosting attendance by 92% in Columbia Fireflies road games according to @BaseballAmerica.  —   Michael Mayer (@mikemayerMMO) May 12, 2017,  And, Tebow hasn’t just helped the team he plays for bring fans to the stadium. He is a draw everywhere he goes. “We had 4, 500 people in the stands,” Hickory Crawdads season ticket holder Christopher Pack told the Associated Press this month, “and 4, 300 were there to see Tim Tebow. ” The AP continued, saying, “People show up in Tebow’s NFL jerseys, and Florida Gator outfits, lining up around the rails in this intimate ballparks trying to get autograph or a selfie with Tebow. ” Tebow has been such a draw, even for other teams, that the Augusta, Georgia, GreenJackets found themselves scrambling to find enough concession workers to handle the crowd when Tebow came to town. On that day, 5, 830 fans turned out to see Tebow play, well above the GreenJackets’ average of 3, 190 fans. Clearly the Mets want to bring that excitement to AA ball and thence to New York itself and the Majors if Tebow can continue playing at level. This is all a far cry from the doubters who insisted that Tebow’s ideas of becoming a pro baseball player were the silly dreams of a silly man. Now, it appears that the Mets feel his capabilities are sustainable and that he is bringing fans to the stands in droves is a plus. It’s a   punch that can’t be denied.

One of those tourists, “Gary from Chicago,” has since become a social media sensation  —   but according to media reports, he is also a registered sex offender who was just released from prison. [According to ABC Chicago, Gary Alan Coe was convicted of attempted rape and served more than 20 years in prison. Coe told the outlet that he was released from prison just three days before he posed for pictures with Denzel Washington and kissed Nicole Kidman’s hand in the front row at the Academy Awards.  Coe, a   “Chicago boy,” was accompanied to Sunday’s ceremony by his fiancée, Vickie Vines. After Vines told Kimmel that her favorite actor was Denzel Washington, the ABC funnyman enlisted the   actor to officiate the couple’s wedding live  . “I now pronounce you husband and wife,” Washington said as the audience burst into applause. “Kiss the bride. ” Watch Denzel Washington marry two of Jimmy Kimmel’s surprise guests at the #Oscars. pic. twitter.   —   Hollywood Reporter (@THR) February 27, 2017,  Coe said since leaving prison he’s found the love of his life and forgiveness through faith. “Change is possible.

According to Page Six, Jimmy Kimmel Live! canceled Coe’s scheduled appearance on the show Monday night, though a producer was reported to have told him the cancellation was due to a timing issue. Many of the stars at Sunday night’s ceremony have been critical of President Donald Trump’s immigration policy, including his order temporarily prohibiting immigration from seven   Middle Eastern countries, which has since been blocked by the 9th Circuit Court. The order would have temporarily suspended the U. S. Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days, which in turn would have prohibited the arrival of refugees into the United States during that period while the refugee vetting process was being reviewed. A number of celebrities at the Oscars  —   including Loving actress Ruth Negga and Moana songwriter   Miranda  —   wore ACLU ribbons on their dresses and tuxedos to show their opposition to Trump’s policies.

19362,"While Donald Rakes In Donations From Poor Supporters, His Wealthy Kids Give ZILCH (VIDEO)","While Donald Rakes In Donations From Poor Supporters, His Wealthy Kids Give ZILCH (VIDEO) By Ellen Brodsky on October 30, 2016 Subscribe 
If money talks, the Trump kids’ lack of donations to their father’s presidential campaign speaks volumes. Despite the fact that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s children are frequent surrogates for their father, they have not dug into their wallets for his White House run. 
According to The Daily Beast , the sum total of donations from Trump’s four adult children is $376.20. That amount came from Eric Trump and was described as an in-kind donation for meals. But he was reimbursed the same amount that same day. 
The Trump kids have donated large sums for political causes in the past. According to a 2015 report by OpenSecrets.org : Daughter Ivanka Trump has donated over $130,000 to Republicans and Democrats; Son Donald Trump, Jr. has donated more than $80,000 to candidates and committees from both sides of the aisle; Son Eric Trump has given approximately $51,000, mostly to Republicans, and Trump’s youngest daughter, Tiffany Trump, is not listed in the report. 
It’s not just Trump’s family that has refrained from donating to his campaign. Also missing from the Trump-donor rolls, according to The Daily Beast , are such prominent surrogates as Rudy Giuliani, Ben Carson, and Newt Gingrich. 
Meanwhile, The Daily Beast also notes, Trump is raking in lots of dough from small contributors: “When the Trump campaign began soliciting online donations in June , the candidate asked for a paltry $10 from each contributor—an appeal his millionaire kids didn’t respond to. The request resulted in a quick $3 million haul from his supporters though. And by September, Trump had paid his own businesses around $8.2 million , comprised of rent, food, and facilities and payroll for corporate staffers. He even used tens of thousands of dollars in campaign donations to buy copies of his own book .” 
Maybe Trump’s inner circle hasn’t donated because they know where the money’s really going. 
The Young Turks’ Cenk Uygur explains further how Trump uses campaign donations to line his own pockets:

19363,Black Female Playwrights Want You to Face Facts. The Harsh Ones. - The New York Times,"It’s not unusual for theater, like many of the arts, to address a pressing social or political issue. But what strikes me as unusual this fall is that most of such work comes from notable black female playwrights: Sarah Jones, Anna Deavere Smith and Lynn Nottage all have new (or new to New York) works that grapple with problems preoccupying contemporary culture. What’s more, the Signature Theater Company will begin its celebration of the work of   Parks, whose plays, while stylistically exploratory and tremendously varied, nevertheless often have a powerful social consciousness. (Another example: Danai Gurira, whose “Eclipsed,” about sexual abuse of women in African civil wars, was a Tony nominee for best play this year and opens in San Francisco in the spring.) With Black Lives Matter and #OscarsSoWhite galvanizing attention N. F. L. football players stirring controversy by failing to stand for the national anthem, to protest endemic racism and even Beyoncé taking fierce political stands in her new music, these playwrights are in sync with the national mood, using the tools of theater to bring us face to face with hard facts about the world we live in. I am particularly looking forward to a further bracing encounter with Ms. Nottage’s “Sweat,” which I first saw at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, and which begins performances at the Public Theater in October. In shaping this   drama about factory laborers facing bleak futures, Ms. Nottage and her director, Kate Whoriskey, drew on interviews with residents of a Pennsylvania city ranked among the poorest in the country. Mostly set in a bar where the workers hang out, the play explores the tensions  —   racial, interpersonal and otherwise  —   that tear at the fabric of the community, as jobs in manufacturing that once provided a solid   living for millions of Americans grow scarce. I probably don’t need to remind you that anger at the decline of the   economies has been much discussed in the presidential election this year. But as in her previous plays, including “Intimate Apparel” and “Ruined,” Ms. Nottage nimbly avoids the didactic in her exploration of the fallout from the collapse of manufacturing. “Sweat” handily earns its grabby title, pulsing with the intensity of drama drawn directly from the   experiences of its characters. The playwright and performer Anna Deavere Smith has a long history of addressing topics of meaty political or social currency, having examined racial conflict in “Fires in the Mirror” and “Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992,” and more recently the chronically   health care system in “Let Me Down Easy. ” Her new show, “Notes From the Field: Doing Time in Education,” focuses on how the failings of public schools are ineluctably intertwined with the high incarceration rates of young men, and young black men in particular. Drawing, as always, on dozens of interviews, Ms. Smith once again is the sole performer, using her virtuosic acting skills to embody various characters discussing an issue that has been boiling up in the public sphere for more than a year, as the deaths of black men at the hands of the police has become a matter of national attention. The production, directed by Leonard Foglia, is now at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass. and begins performances in October at the Second Stage Theater in New York. And this fall brings the welcome return of Sarah Jones, like Ms. Smith an incandescent performer who holds the stage on her own, most famously in her show “Bridge  Tunnel,” seen on Broadway in 2006. In her latest, “ ” which begins performances in September and is presented by the Manhattan Theater Club, Ms. Jones explores the lives of workers in the sex industry. Like Ms. Smith  —   and, for that matter, Ms. Nottage  —   Ms. Jones likes to draw from life, and conducted nearly 100 interviews to gather material for the show, in which she will portray almost 20 different characters. And, finally, this fall Ms. Parks becomes only the second black woman to have a series of productions dedicated to her work at the Signature Theater, after the pioneering playwright Adrienne Kennedy. Ms. Parks’s “residency” will comprise four plays, spanning both this season and next. It starts in October with “The Death of the Last Black Man in the Whole Entire World,” a surrealistic play that riffs pointedly on stereotypes of black culture as it depicts what the title suggests, an event that takes place over and over. In the spring comes “Venus,” which explores the life of a South African woman, Saartjie Baartman, who became an object of public fascination  —   not of a flattering kind  —   when she was taken to London to be exhibited in freak shows. It may well be a coincidence that the season will bring us a rich handful of plays by black women addressing issues reverberating through American culture today (and yesterday, and the day before). Or it may be an indication that while many playwrights continue to concentrate on staple   themes of troubled families and personal strife, black women are using their gifts to widen our perspectives and confront truths that it might be more comfortable to ignore.",0
19364,North Korean Missile Explodes Seconds After Launch,"The latest North Korean missile test failed on Wednesday, with the rocket exploding “within seconds of launch,” according to the U. S. Pacific Command. [“South Korea and the US are aware of the missile launch and to their knowledge, North Korea’s missile was not successfully launched,” said South Korea’s Ministry of Defense about the North Korean missile test, in a statement relayed by CNN.  Reuters reports the launch was made from “near the city of Wonsan, on North Korea’s east coast, the same place from where it launched several   missiles last year, all but one of which failed. ” A South Korean military official agreed with the U. S. assessment that the missile “may have exploded right after it took off from a launch pad. ” The Washington Post writes that American and South Korean military intelligence services are still analyzing the data they gathered about the launch and are not yet certain precisely what type of missile it was. North Korea tested a rocket engine that dictator Kim   described as technology of “historic significance” over the weekend, but it’s not clear if this failed test involved one of those engines.",0
19365,Tim Kaine Compares Donald Trump’s Comments on Russian Hacking to Watergate Scandal - The New York Times,"Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia on Sunday compared Donald J. Trump’s encouragement of Russia to hack Hillary Clinton’s emails to the Watergate scandal, which led to President Richard M. Nixon’s resignation. Mr. Kaine, Mrs. Clinton’s running mate, made the remarks on ABC’s “This Week” while he was being questioned about Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, an issue that has dogged her throughout her campaign. Mr. Kaine used the moment to attack Mr. Trump’s refusal to release his income tax returns and to attack his comments this summer that Russia should make public anything they might have stolen from Mrs. Clinton’s emails, remarks he made in the wake of the disclosure that hackers had accessed emails from the Democratic National Committee. “He has openly encouraged Russia to engage in cyberhacking to try to find more emails or materials, and we know that this cyberattack on the D. N. C. was likely done by Russia,” Mr. Kaine said of Mr. Trump on Sunday. “A president was impeached and had to resign over an attack on the D. N. C. during a presidential election in 1972,” Mr. Kaine added, referring to the Watergate scandal. “This is serious business. So contrast the Hillary situation, where the F. B. I. said there’s no need for legal proceedings, with an attack that is being encouraged by Donald Trump on the D. N. C. by Russia, similar to what led to resignation of a president 30 years ago. ” During a news conference in July, Mr. Trump said he hoped Russian intelligence services had successfully hacked Mrs. Clinton’s email. “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30, 000 emails that are missing,” Mr. Trump said at the time. “I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. ” Mr. Kaine wasn’t the only candidate to invoke Mr. Nixon’s name in an attack. In a taped interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press” that aired Sunday, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, Mr. Trump’s running mate, called Mrs. Clinton “the most dishonest candidate for president of the United States since Richard Nixon. ” Yet Mr. Pence also opened the door for more criticism of Mr. Trump by vowing to release his own income tax returns within the next week. Mr. Trump has refused to release his own returns, but Mr. Pence said his running mate would eventually disclose them as well, although he did not say when that might happen. Last week The Washington Post revealed that Mr. Trump had to pay a $2, 500 penalty to the I. R. S. because his charitable foundation had made an improper political donation. On CNN’s “State of the Union,” Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who has become one of Mr. Trump’s closest advisers, suggested that Mr. Trump had backed away in his speech on Wednesday from his proposal to carry out mass deportations of people who are in the country illegally. Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Trump’s speech “leaves a very big opening for what will happen with the people who remain here in the United States after the criminals are removed and after the border is secure. ” “Donald Trump, as he expressed in one of his interviews recently, would find it very, very difficult to throw out a family that’s been here for, you know, 15 years and they have three children, two of whom are citizens,” Mr. Giuliani said. “That is not the kind of America he wants. ”",0
19366,"Donald Trump, Leonard Cohen, Mosul: Your Friday Evening Briefing - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Vice   Mike Pence, above center, will lead Donald Trump’s transition effort, taking the reins from Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. Mr. Trump now says he may be willing to leave in place two popular provisions of the Affordable Care Act. He is holding meetings with his advisers in Trump Tower, which has been transformed into a kind of fortress by the Secret Service and the local police. So far, the transition team includes some of the very same people Mr. Trump said had too much clout in Washington: corporate consultants and lobbyists. Names circulating include Myron Ebell, an outspoken “climate contrarian,” to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Some of the foreign policy experts who derided Mr. Trump’s campaign could also end up joining his administration. ____ 2. As the dust settles, Democrats are recognizing two central problems of Hillary Clinton’s flawed candidacy. After her decades in Washington and paid speeches for financial institutions, she couldn’t connect with voters who felt rage at the establishment and Wall Street. And she ceded white   voters, instead focusing on young, Latino and   voters who did not turn out for her as they did for President Obama. ____ 3. After the election, the West Coast feels a little like its own country. In California, 61. 5 percent of voters chose Mrs. Clinton, the highest percentage for a Democrat since 1936. Residents also voted to legalize marijuana, making it legal along the entire West Coast. Above, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom spoke at a rally in support of that issue on Tuesday. There and in surrounding states, voters also embraced bilingual education, gun control, higher taxes and more funding for schools and transportation. ___ 4. Today is Veterans Day. With many World War II veterans in their twilight years, one teenager has started a nonprofit to record video interviews with them for posterity. “These men are my biggest heroes and my closest friends,” Rishi Sharma wrote on a crowdfunding site. Above, a woman held photos of her nephew, Pfc. Le Ron A. Wilson, who was killed in Iraq at age 18, along the parade route in New York City. ____ 5. Leonard Cohen, the masterly songwriter who died this week at 82, intoned his songs with serene gravity. On his last album, “You Want It Darker,” released less than a month ago, Mr. Cohen’s voice had descended to a husky recitation, cushioned by choirs and string arrangements but as fearlessly flinty as ever, our critic writes. His final ruminations were on mortality, love and a divinity that he faced and questioned to the very end. As always, he sought stark truth before comfort. ____ 6. In Iraq, Islamic State militants are killing scores of civilians as troops advance toward the city of Mosul, the U. N. says. The militants have forced children to kill and have used chemical agents against Iraqi and Kurdish forces, the agency said. In one massacre, militants were said to have shot 40 civilians, then strung up their bodies from electricity poles. Above, Iraqi special forces in a quiet moment during the advance. ____ 7. If you’re wrestling with the major themes of this week’s election, you may want to look to art for insight. Here’s a look at six recent plays that reckon with the lives of   Americans and others facing economic anxiety. Four are onstage now in New York, two are available to read, and all of them are favorites of our critics. Above, “Sweat,” at the Public Theater. ____ 8. Chinese and British bird groups began tracking two cuckoo subspecies found near Beijing to unravel the puzzle of their winter getaways. Turns out they cover thousands of miles, across a dozen countries and an ocean. The “common cuckoo,” as the species is called, is capable of exhilarating odysseys, despite a reputation as a    flier. ____ 9. The   film “Arrival,” in theaters now, has some eerie extraterrestrials, but not a lot of action. Instead, it “leans into feeling and thinking, and reminds you again that there’s more to this genre than heavy artillery,” our critic says. Above, Amy Adams plays Louise Banks, a linguistics professor who leads a team of investigators when spaceships touch down. ____ 10. Finally, Thanksgiving approaches. Here are recipes you can make in advance, so you can focus on the turkey (and your guests) on the big day. Pie crust, stock, bread as well as most cakes, casseroles and relishes can be made weeks in advance and frozen. Have a great weekend. ____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

19367,Hillary Supporters Jay-Z And Beyonce Are Members Of Aleister Crowley’s Satanic Cult OTO,"NTEB Ads Privacy Policy Hillary Supporters Jay-Z And Beyonce Are Members Of Aleister Crowley’s Satanic Cult OTO Other celebrities linked to OTO include the rapper Jay-Z, who has repeatedly purloined imagery and quotations from Crowley’s work. Whether wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with ‘Do what thou wilt’ or hiring Rihanna to hold aloft a flaming torch in his music videos (a reference to the Illuminati, an outlawed secret society whose name supposedly derives from Lucifer, or ‘light bringer’), he has given the sect priceless publicity. by Geoffrey Grider November 5, 2016 Aleister Crowley, who was born into an upper-class British family in 1875, styled himself as ‘the Great Beast 666’. He was an unabashed occultist who, prior to his death in 1947, revelled in his infamy as ‘the wickedest man in the world’. 
“And he was withdrawn from them about a stone’s cast, and kneeled down, and prayed, Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.” Luke 22:41,42 (KJV) 
His form of worship involved sadomasochistic sex rituals with men and women, spells which he claimed could raise malevolent gods and the use of hard drugs, including opium, cocaine, heroin and mescaline. 
Crowley’s motto — perpetuated by OTO ( Ordo Templi Orientis ), — was ‘do what thou wilt’. And it is this individualistic approach that has led to a lasting fascination among artists and celebrities. Led Zeppelin’s Jimmy Page, for example, routinely took part in occult magical rituals and was so intrigued by Crowley he bought his former home, Boleskine House, on the shores of Loch Ness in Scotland. And there are now OTO lodges scattered around the country, practising the same ceremonial rituals and spreading the word of Crowley. Jay-Z and Beyonce are leading the way 
Other celebrities linked to OTO include the rapper Jay-Z , who has repeatedly purloined imagery and quotations from Crowley’s work. Whether wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with ‘Do what thou wilt’ or hiring Rihanna to hold aloft a flaming torch in his music videos (a reference to the Illuminati , an outlawed secret society whose name supposedly derives from Lucifer, or ‘light bringer’), he has given the sect priceless publicity. 
His clothing line , Rocawear , is shot through with OTO imagery such as the ‘all seeing eye’ in a triangle, the ‘eye of Horus’ (an ancient Egyptian symbol frequently referenced in occult texts) and the head of Baphomet (the horned, androgynous idol of Western occultism). Beyoncé Knowles admits demon possession by Sasha Fierce: 
Some conspiracy theorists have seized on this as evidence that he is a member of a secret Masonic movement which they believe permeates the highest levels of business and government. Others take a more pragmatic view: that it is commercial opportunism, cashing in on impressionable teens’ attraction to the ‘edginess’ of occult symbolism. Yet OTO is much more than a marketing opportunity for attention-seeking celebs. It is a living religion, with adherents still practising occult rituals set out by Crowley in his books. 
This week I tracked down John Bonner, 62, the head of OTO in the UK, to his home in East Sussex. He told me: ‘We are not a mass-appeal sort of organisation — in the UK we number in our hundreds. Worldwide it’s thousands. Hillary Clinton gets in formation with Jay Z and Beyonce: 
Celebrities are not always a boon or a benefit. ‘We are used to being misunderstood. Many stories about Crowley, like people saying he filed his teeth down into fangs, are nonsense. 
‘YOU COULD CALL US A SEX CULT IN A WAY, BECAUSE WE RECOGNISE, ACCEPT AND ADORE THE WHOLE PROCESS WHICH GOES TOWARDS MAKING TANGIBLE THE PREVIOUSLY INTANGIBLE.’ According to adherents of OTO it takes years of study before you can begin to understand what the religion is about — much like the equally controversial Church of Scientology. 
A former FBI agent , Ted Gundersen, who investigated Satanic circles in LA, found that Crowley’s teachings about ‘raising demons to do one’s bidding’ suggested human sacrifice, preferably of ‘an intelligent young boy’. 
John Bonner is dismissive of any idea that he and his fellow believers would even begin to countenance such excesses, pointing out that his is the only religion that sends people a letter of congratulations when they decide to leave (‘because they are exercising free will, which is what we’re all about’). 
But he accepts many people may not be able to deal with Crowley’s complex teachings. 
‘You’re not supposed to just jump straight in to it. It takes time and study, but our rituals are not for public consumption. You need to join us and go through the initiation process before you can begin to understand. ‘But according to our beliefs we can’t turn anyone away. So if you are over 18, are passably sane and are free to attend initiations, then you have an undeniable right of membership.’ source SHARE THIS ARTICLE Geoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.

19369,Новая Зеландия заявила о приостановке работы над резолюцией по Алеппо,"27 октября 2016, 07:10 Новая Зеландия приостановила разработку проекта резолюции Совета Безопасности ООН по прекращению боевых действий в сирийском Алеппо. 
«Мы также должны озвучить свое глубокое разочарование тем, что другие постоянные члены Совета (кроме России. — RT) отказались от содержательного взаимодействия по ключевым положениям нашего проекта резолюции и вместо этого настаивали на включении в него заведомо неприемлемых оборотов», — приводит ТАСС заявление постпреда Новой Зеландии в Совбезе Джерарда ван Боэмена. 
По словам дипломата, в ходе дискуссий в совете возникла ситуация, «когда один из участников спора заявил, что ключевой параграф в нашем проекте недопустим, потому что приведет к прекращению всех воздушных бомбардировок восточного Алеппо, а другие сказали, что он неприемлем, поскольку не сможет гарантировать прекращение бомбардировок». 
Как отметил ван Боэмен, в настоящее время «никаких перспектив обойти эти взаимоисключающие позиции». Однако в то же время дипломат выразил надежду, что подготовленный проект резолюции станет основой будущего решения Совбеза по данной проблеме. 
Ранее постпред России при ООН заявил , что проект резолюции, предложенный Новой Зеландией, и предусматривавший немедленное прекращение авиаударов и вывод боевиков из восточной части города, не соответствует основным подходам Москвы. 
Новозеландская резолюция по Алеппо стала третьей , отклонённой Совбезом за месяц. Подписывайтесь на наш Telegram , чтобы быть в курсе самых важных новостей. Для этого достаточно иметь Telegram на любом устройстве, пройти по ссылке и нажать кнопку Join.",0
19370,5 Key Revelations for Free Thinkers to Consider After Election 2016,"Waking Times 
The political system we have today is not the democratic republic it pretends to be. National elections are orchestrated public relations events, engineered to serve the complex interests of the plutocracy and shadow government . The perception of differences between major party candidates is limited to within a narrow spectrum of mainstream ideology, and voting has become a tool used by the oligarchy to routinely refresh the illusions of choice and consent. 
Indoctrinated to believe this system is mandatory for human prosperity and security, consideration of alternatives is practically unthinkable to the citizenry. Most have their entire lives and fortunes invested in this game, and as such, a truth this heavy is simply too much to process and too painful to accept. Obedience and compliance to state and culture have their sleepy, comfortable perks, but the natural inclination of the human spirit is to gravitate towards truth and freedom. When this is ignored or denied, inner peace is impossible, and outer chaos inevitable. 
For this, the free-thinker will always emerge as the winner in a contest against the statist, for, it is the soul who needs no illusions and carries no attachments which can look upon the ashes of ruin and give them credit for being the first signs of new bloom. 
Now that the unbelievable spectacle of election 2016 is complete, here are some critical things that free-thinkers can take away from this rather insane and revelatory experience. 
1.) The mainstream, corporate media is unashamedly here to convince and distract you, not to inform or empower you. Most media outlets, including many alternative outlets, have fully exposed themselves as partisan organizations with no commitment to objectivity or logic. We are at last free from the chokehold of this organized form of propaganda and ideological occupation. 
2.) People still do not yet understand the true nature of government as an organization which derives its power and authority from the superior application of violence. They don’t yet fully understand that in order for government to offer a solution to a problem, it must first create that very problem. Many are still unready to admit that we are ruled by a plutocratic, oligarchical, corporate state that does not take orders from elected politicians. 
Because of this, there are now plenty of opportunities to inspire and awaken people with serious information. 
3.) Social chaos and mindless incivility has been properly revealed as a reflection of inner chaos, fear and disharmony. It’s clear now that many have been trained to choose team loyalty over personal independence. To choose destructiveness instead of creativity, to build echo chambers instead of round tables, to relish conflict over curiosity, and to seek the comfort of group-think over the uncertainty of individuality. 
These programs are socially engineered diseases and their chief symptoms are violence in word and deed. This is out in the open now, for those who have eyes to see and ears to hear. 
“We have met the enemy, and he is us.” ~ Pogo 
4.) There is no place on planet earth where free-thinking people can enjoy voluntary community and peaceful coexistence without interference by the state and its sympathizers. Sad, but true. The entire world is colonized by statist ideology and there is no where to run or hide from this mindset. Yet, there is sufficient living freedom in this revelation alone, because from anywhere now, we can openly engage in any one of a million simple acts of revolution and independence , and they will be witnessed and absorbed by those most in need. 
5.) At long last, some of the darkest, ugliest and most difficult to look at issues are bubbling up into mainstream consciousness. The long and well-documented history of occultism , pedophilia, human-trafficking, human sacrifice, Satan worship and dark ritual among the world’s ruling elite can finally be openly discussed without instant mindless backlash. The proverbial black cat is out of the bag now, and there has never been a better time to participate in the work of waking people up to the high crimes of the elite. Final Thoughts 
In 2016 your personal awakening counts more than your vote , for the only thing that can turn the tide on endless war, unstoppable surveillance, the strategy of tension, weaponized stress , environmental ruin, and unchecked debt-slavery, is a large enough and spiritied enough class of fearless, righteous individuals. Until free humanity emerges victorious from the mental slavery of the state, we will get the president that we deserve.

19371,"ESPNW Writer Shows Her Obsession with Gender, While Scolding America for Its Obsession with Gender - Breitbart","A sports writer for ESPNW used her recent column on women’s college swimming to scold America for being “obsessed” by gender, all while pushing the genderqueer or   political ideology on readers. [In a discussion of University of Michigan women’s swim team member G Ryan, ESPNW writer Katie Barnes notes that Ryan “identifies as genderqueer or  . ” She goes on to insist that the pool is “an oasis in a society obsessed with gender. ”  That “obsession,” Barnes claims, creates “issues for Ryan where there do not need to be. ” Indeed, Ryan goes on to complain about her sport, saying, “It’s still hard to get up and put on a suit some days. It’s not the best sport. You’re wandering around half naked for hours at a time. ” Barnes seems to find the subject difficult too, as throughout the piece she refers to Ryan  —   who was born female  —   as “they” every time a personal pronoun is needed in the article. Barnes notes that Ryan demands that people call her “they” or “them” when talking of her, according to Newsbusters. org, As Barnes notes,   is used as a “  option to the more common   or   pronouns because they better reflect their identity as genderqueer. ” The University of Michigan bent over backwards to accommodate Ryan’s demands for the use of  . Barnes writes: Ryan came out to the team as   nearly a year ago  …     Over the past year, the team has made adjustments to the language it uses because, frankly, Ryan’s presence challenges the very binary that governs classification in athletics. The team Ryan swims on is commonly referred to as “Team 42” rather than the women’s team (it is the 42nd edition of the “women’s” team) and emails are addressed using   language such as “Blue” or “All Michigan athletes. ” Barnes’ revelations of how Coach Mike Bottom is dealing with all this is typical of the tortured logic and grammar employed to bend to Ryan’s demands (my bold): “We sing about their growth,” Michigan swimming and diving coach Mike Bottom said of Ryan. “As they begin to understand themselves, there’s been a strength that’s moved into the water, and out of the water. That’s been the excitement. ” Naturally, Barnes had to shift from Ryan’s complaints, and the Michigan swim team’s reaction, to politics. It is a simple change but not an easy one. Ryan’s presence asks the complicated question, of what does inclusion of   athletes look like in an athletic system defined as a binary? There is no simple answer to that question, and it is one being grappled with across the United States. At times the lack of understanding of trans identity is used as a cudgel to ostracize trans people, as seen in North Carolina with HB2 and more recently in Texas with Mack Beggs and the consideration of SB6. But as Newsbusters’ Jay Maxson notes, there has been a lot of use of the “cudgel” to “ostracize” Americans who want to continue recognizing biological and traditional gender identifications, not to mention those who have safety and religious concerns. So, while ESPN’s Barnes slams the country for this “obsession with gender,” she indulges her own obsession with rewriting the rules for how we address gender.

19372,"Bill Paxton, Star of ‘Big Love’ and Movie Blockbusters, Dies at 61 - The New York Times","Bill Paxton, the affable actor who was a   in a string of 1990s blockbuster movies including “Twister,” “Titanic” and “Apollo 13,” and who later played the lead in the critically acclaimed television drama “Big Love,” has died. He was 61. His death, from complications of surgery, was announced on Sunday by a family representative. The statement did not say when or where Mr. Paxton died, but Rolling Stone magazine reported that he died on Saturday. Early in his career, Mr. Paxton had small parts in “The Terminator” (1984) and “Aliens” (1986). Both films were directed by James Cameron, who later featured him in more   roles: as a   salesman who cheated Jamie Lee Curtis’s character in “True Lies” (1994) and as the   scientist who salvaged the wreck of the ocean liner in “Titanic” (1997). He also starred in Ron Howard’s   film “Apollo 13” (1995) portraying Fred Haise, one of three astronauts on a mission to the moon that experienced serious mechanical problems, and in “Twister” (1996) as a  . Mr. Paxton appeared regularly on television in the last decade. On the HBO series “Big Love,” from 2006 to 2011, he played Bill Henrickson, the patriarch of a polygamist family in Utah, receiving three Golden Globe nominations for his portrayal. In 2012, he was nominated for an Emmy Award for playing Randolph McCoy in the     “Hatfields  McCoys” on the History Channel. And in 2014 he appeared in six episodes of “Marvel’s Agents of S. H. I. E. L. D. ” on ABC. Mr. Paxton returned to TV this year as the star of “Training Day,” CBS’s new police drama. A spinoff of the 2001 movie starring Denzel Washington, the series had its premiere this month, and only four episodes have been broadcast. In total, 13 episodes of “Training Day” have been filmed, and Mr. Paxton appears in all of them. For now, the show will continue to be shown on Thursday nights, but its future is not certain. Reviews have been mixed  —   though Mr. Paxton’s performance as a rogue cop has been praised  —   and its ratings have been low, averaging little more than four million viewers. In a statement, CBS and Warner Bros. Television offered no word on the show’s future. William Paxton was born on May 17, 1955, in Fort Worth, the son of the former Mary Lou Gray and John Lane Paxton, a businessman and sometime actor. When he was 8, Bill and his brother, Bob, were taken by their father to see President John F. Kennedy on the morning of Nov. 22, 1963, in Fort Worth, hours before his assassination in Dallas. “I remember just a really euphoric crowd,” he recalled in a 2013 interview. “I was a bit young to really understand later the consequences of the event. ” There is a photograph of Mr. Paxton from that morning, perched on a stranger’s shoulders. He graduated from Arlington Heights High School in Fort Worth and moved to Los Angeles the next year to break into the film industry, finding jobs as a production assistant and set dresser. At 21 he enrolled in New York University, where he studied with the acting teacher Stella Adler, but dropped out after two years to return to Los Angeles to pursue acting there. “I didn’t see any point in a degree,” he told Texas Monthly. “I didn’t see where I’d be filling that in on an application for any kind of job. ” Mr. Paxton’s survivors include his wife of more than 30 years, Louise Newbury and two children, James and Lydia. Long before his role in “Big Love,’’ Mr. Paxton was   in assessing his status in Hollywood. “It’s always a little frustrating when you’re reading a script after 10 guys ahead of you have had a chance to pick it over,” he said in 1998. “You can almost see the bread crumbs. I haven’t had a role that’s propelled me into major stardom. Sure, I’ve had roles that put me on the playing field. A lot of base hits. No home runs. ”",0

Filmmaker Trevor Loudon’s new documentary The Enemies Within exposes the communist and radical Islamist background of the probable new leader of the Democratic Party. Rep. Keith Ellison (D}, Minnesota), center 
Keith Ellison , a Marxist/Muslim Democratic Congressman from Minnesota, could soon become the Democratic National Committee chairman. 
With the endorsements of Senators Harry Reid , Chuck Schumer , Bernie Sanders and more than 250,000 signatures on an “Ellison for chairman” petition, Representative Ellison is the early favorite for the position. 
Many writers have focused on Ellison’s Islamic beliefs, but few have examined his extensive Marxist connections. 
Trevor Loudon’s The Enemies Within poses a simple question –“Could your Congressman pass an FBI background check?” 
With close ties to both the Communist Party USA and several Muslim Brotherhood front groups, Trevor Loudon believes that Congressman Ellison would have no chance of passing even the most the rudimentary type of background check, applied to the most low-level federal government employees. 
Yet within days, Representative Ellison may lead one of this country’s two main political parties.

19374,American Journalist Told to Leave Swedish No Go Zone by Police,"American video journalist Tim Pool claims he was told to leave the Stockholm no go suburb of Rinkeby by police after masked men started following him. [American journalist Tim Pool has been in Sweden the past week investigating No Go Zones like Malmö’s infamous Rosengård suburb and various no go areas in the capital, Stockholm. As he was exploring the Stockholm suburb of Rinkeby, he claimed masked men approached him and police told him to leave. However, police deny he was escorted out of the area, Swedish broadcaster SVT reports.  According to Pool, he wasn’t even filming when several men started following him and his group. He said police also started following him, and when the men put on masks Swedish officers told him to leave the area so as not to cause an incident. Pool released a video on his YouTube channel that shows him speaking with a Swedish photographer in the centre of Rinkeby. The   area was recently plagued by looting and violence, including cars being set on fire, after a local man was arrested by police. The video then cuts to Pool saying police had told him the group needed to leave or up to fifty men could come and drastically escalate the tense situation. The video continues showing a Swedish police van following Pool and his associates away from the shopping centre for several minutes escorting them out of the No Go Zone. The police have fired back against Pool’s claims, saying the increased police presence was due to a “poetry event”. A spokesman said: “We had extra police on the ground today and tonight because of the poetry evening in Rinkeby because there will be so many visitors. ” The police alleged the reason they told Pool to leave was because he was filming locals and it might cause trouble because people in the area don’t like to be filmed. The shopping area in Rinkeby is where an Australian television crew was attacked last year. The Channel Nine crew had come to the area to investigate the effects of mass migration when they were approached by several men and were punched, kicked, and rammed with a car. Only months later in Husby, another no go   suburb of Stockholm, a Norwegian TV crew was attacked in a cafe while they were interviewing   economist Tino Sandandaji. Mr. Sandandaji recently released a book called Mass Challenge, a “sincere and   analysis” of the country’s immigration policy, that was banned by a library in Stockholm for allegedly promoting racism.

19375,CONTROVERSIAL NEW ‘ANTI-FAMINE’ GMO POTATO STRAINS APPROVED,"Home › HEALTH | US NEWS › CONTROVERSIAL NEW ‘ANTI-FAMINE’ GMO POTATO STRAINS APPROVED CONTROVERSIAL NEW ‘ANTI-FAMINE’ GMO POTATO STRAINS APPROVED 0 SHARES [11/3/16] The US Department of Agriculture has given its seal of approval to two new strains of genetically engineered potatoes. By using double stranded RNA, the potatoes have been engineered to resist the pathogen responsible for the Irish potato famine. 
There could be two new potatoes hitting the soil next spring after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) signed off on two more genetically modified potatoes from Simplot, an agribusiness based in Idaho, on Monday. 
The only obstacle for the new potatoes becoming available on the market is a voluntary review process from the FDA, much to the chagrin of GMO skeptics. 
Jeffrey Smith, founder of the Institute for Responsible Technology, expressed concern for not only the FDA’s voluntary testing program but for the genetic modifying process the potatoes have undergone, in an interview with RT. 
“ It makes sense on paper, ” he said of the potatoes that are purported to be resistant to blight – the pathogen responsible for the Great Famine. However, one of the issues is that the effects of modified these genomes are largely unknown. 
“ When we tamper with the genome in the way that they’ve been doing with genetic engineering in our food supply, you end up increasing allergens, toxins, new diseases or other problems – causes massive collateral damage in the DNA” he said. 
But blocking the blight is not the only selling point of these scientific spuds. In addition, they are meant to be engineered to prevent bruising and black spots, have a reduction of a chemical that creates carcinogens when cooked at high temperatures and also ship better. 
However, all of these benefits could be a curse in disguise. The method used for engineering these potatoes is called double stranded (ds) RNA, meaning the genes of an organism have been reprogrammed or silenced. Post navigation",0
19376,"High School Journalists Land a Scoop, and the Principal Resigns - The New York Times","Four days after students at a high school newspaper in Kansas published an article that questioned the credentials of a recently hired principal, she resigned. The episode, which unfolded at Pittsburg High School in Pittsburg, Kan. about 125 miles south of Kansas City, garnered news coverage and won praise from journalism organizations for investigative reporting by student journalists. The story began to germinate on March 6, when the Pittsburg Community Schools announced it had hired Amy Robertson as the high school principal. In a statement, it said her “diverse and extensive experience impressed district staff and leadership and repeatedly propelled her to the top” of the list of candidates. She had “decades of experience in education” and was the chief executive of a consulting firm that advised companies on education, the statement said. Maddie Baden, a    junior and a staff member of the   newspaper The Booster Redux, set out to write a profile. Emily Smith, a teacher and adviser to The Redux, said on Wednesday that she had not expected the reporting to lead to questions about Ms. Robertston’s credentials. “We’re Midwesterners,” she said. “As soon as somebody puts something on paper, we think they’re honest about what they’re saying. ” But in multiple interviews over several days, Ms. Robertson provided details of her background that did not hold up, Ms. Smith said. Then Ms. Robertson became increasingly evasive. “She was asked direct questions,” Ms. Smith said. “She couldn’t give direct answers. ” Ms. Smith coached the students to press for clearer responses, pushing them to be more assertive with an adult in authority than they were accustomed. The students questioned the legitimacy of Corllins University, an institution where Ms. Robertson said she got her master’s and doctorate degrees. It lists no physical address on its website and has been the subject of consumer complaints and warnings about its lack of accreditation. Her profile on LinkedIn, the professional networking site, did not identify where she had earned her master’s degree and Ph. D. listing only “ . ” Smaller details also aroused the students’ curiosity. For instance, Ms. Robertson said she had earned a bachelor’s of fine arts degree from the University of Tulsa, but when the students checked, they learned it does not confer that kind of degree, Ms. Smith said. The students and Ms. Smith met with the school superintendent, Destry Brown, about their concerns, and he was “supportive and open,” she said. They kept reporting and “continued to write up to five minutes before it went to print,” she said. On Friday, The Redux, a monthly broadsheet published 10 times a year, hit the newsstands with a   story, headlined “District Hires New Principal” and with the subheading, “Background called into question after discrepancies arise. ” On Tuesday night, the board of education met and announced that Ms. Robertson had resigned. “In light of the issues that arose” she felt it was in the district’s best interest, a board statement said. Ms. Robertson, who was to assume the $   position starting on July 1, could not be immediately reached for comment on Wednesday. Ms. Robertson, who lived in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, was the principal of the Dubai American Scientific School, and recently had her license temporarily suspended by education authorities there, The Gulf News reported. Immigration issues prevented her from getting needed permits, The News reported. Mr. Brown praised the students for their persistence but acknowledged he felt a twinge of disappointment about how it unfolded. He said Ms. Robertson’s hiring was contingent on passing a background check and producing needed documentation. He said the details would have come out eventually, but the students’ work sped thing up. “I believe strongly in our kids questioning things and not believing things just because an adult told them,” he said. “I have a little bit of heartburn over the whole article. I wasn’t going to stop that because I believe in that whole First Amendment thing. ” Journalism groups were also full of praise. Tom Rosenstiel, executive director of the American Press Institute, a journalism research and training group, said his organization has seen outstanding work from college students working with professional journalists on investigations but said that what the high school students did “really stands out. ” At a time of shrinking resources in newsrooms, students are helping to fill gaps in coverage, he said, adding, “There’s a sense that significant journalistic investigations can come from anywhere now. ” Student journalists are routinely underestimated by those in positions of authority, Frank LoMonte, executive director of the Student Press Law Center, said on Wednesday. The students consulted with him about their reporting on the article. The article might never have appeared had it not been for the Kansas Student Publications Act, which grants students independent control over their editorial content, including material that might paint a school in an unflattering light, he said. A 1988 Supreme Court ruling gave administrators the authority to censor the content of student journalists. Ten states, including Kansas, passed laws giving students independent control, although administrators can still remove material that is obscene, defamatory or poses a danger to the school. Similar bills are pending in nine other states, Mr. LoMonte said. “If that same situation happened in Texas, New York or Florida, that story would not have seen the light of day,” he said. He credited school administrators for taking a   approach and letting the students pursue the reporting. “I hope it really emboldens young people to take on substantive news stories even if they are afraid of administrative censorship,” he said. “This story proves you can make positive changes in your community through journalism. ”",0
19377,FBI Just Announced It’s Looking Into The Trump Campaign’s Ties To Russia,"Comments 
It’s official. NBC is now reporting that Donald Trump’s campaign management has fallen under the scrutiny of an FBI inquiry, which is sure to blossom into a formal criminal investigation centered on Trump’s disgraced ex-manager Paul Manafort’s stewardship of the Republican campaign and his close ties to Ukraine. When he departed, Manafort was facing felony charges , and now the FBI’s suspicions have been confirmed by the evidence. 
New York Times f ound Ukrainian documents which outlined $12.7 million in previously unreported payments from a Ukrainian political party to Manafort, precipitating his departure from the campaign. 
The FBI has been conducting a preliminary inquiry into Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort’s foreign business connections, law enforcement and intelligence sources told NBC News Monday . Word of the inquiry, which has not blossomed into a full-blown criminal investigation, comes just days after FBI Director James Comey’s disclosure that his agency is examining a new batch of emails connected to an aide to Hillary Clinton. 
Trump has taken a series of pro-Russian positions that experts from both parties say are far outside the mainstream, and inexplicable from a political viewpoint. He continues to cast doubt on Russian involvement in election hacking, for example, despite the intelligence community’s public assessment. 
Just last night, we reported that Nevada Senator Harry Reid issued a statement alleging that the FBI had spoken of, “explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government.” Maryland Congressman Elijah Cummings told CNN this morning that members of Congress in the Democratic minority have actively requested that the FBI look into the various news reports that Trump’s campaign, guided by Manafort, had drifted into Putin’s orbit. 
“Any specifics of what the FBI or intelligence agencies may be looking at are not something that the bureau should be discussing publicly.” ranking Democratic Congressman on the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff said, “But here, where the director has discussed an investigation involving one candidate, it opens the director up to claims of bias if he doesn’t discuss other potential investigations.” 
That’s right, in a misguided pursuit of fairness, the FBI Director may have just trashed decades of investigatory policy and been forced to disclose the existence of their active inquiry into the Trump campaign.",0

At least 300 civilians have been killed in just 11 air strikes by the US-led coalition, a report has found amid concern for families trapped in Isis’ stronghold of Mosul. 
Amnesty International urged the Pentagon and its allies to “come clean” about the full extent of deaths in operations against the so-called Islamic State, with official inquiries so far acknowledging only dozens of casualties. 
Assessing reports from the ground, eyewitness interviews, satellite imagery, photos and video footage, investigators said US Central Command (Centcom) may have “failed to take necessary precautions to spare civilians and carried out unlawful attacks” in Syria. 
The 11 coalition attacks reviewed by Amnesty include strikes during operations to drive Isis out of Manbij over the summer, when more than 100 civilians, including children, where reportedly killed in the villages of al-Tukhar , al-Hadhadh and al-Ghandoura in their homes and at a market.",0
19380,"Brazil Arrests 10 in Terror Plot as Olympics Near, Officials Say - The New York Times","RIO DE JANEIRO  —   The Brazilian authorities arrested 10 members of an Islamist militant group that was organizing terrorist attacks, officials announced Thursday, raising tension around the country just two weeks before the start of the Olympic Games. The Federal Police said in a statement that the suspects belonged to a group called the Defenders of Sharia. Agents from an antiterrorism unit are investigating the group’s activities in several states, including Rio de Janeiro, where the Games will take place. The arrests were announced at a time when the Brazilian authorities are coming under scrutiny over security preparations for the Olympics. Responding to the truck massacre last week in Nice, France, Brazil’s sports minister, Leonardo Picciani, told reporters on Wednesday that “the government is absolutely convinced that the Games will be safe. ” Brazil’s justice minister, Alexandre de Moraes, said Thursday that Brazil’s main intelligence agency, known as ABIN, was working with foreign intelligence services and the Federal Police, an investigative force in Brazil that is similar to the F. B. I. Officials said that the people arrested had communicated with one another via WhatsApp and Telegram, two mobile messaging services. Mr. Moraes said the suspects had been taken into custody “when they went from basic commentaries about the Islamic State to preparatory acts. ” Still, Mr. Moraes emphasized the group’s embryonic nature, calling it “an amateur cell without any preparation. ” He said that its members had been seeking to buy weapons in Paraguay, including an   rifle, but that no such arms acquisitions were confirmed. “This is a disorganized cell,” Mr. Moraes said, who described all those arrested as Brazilian citizens. He said that intercepted messages showed members of the group celebrating the recent attacks in Orlando, Fla. and Nice. Mr. Moraes did not provide more details about what kind of attack the group was planning, but he said officials had to act “because of the proximity of the Olympics. ” Marcos Josegrei da Silva, the federal judge overseeing the case, said on Thursday that the suspects ranged in age from 20 to 40, and that they communicated with each other using code names in Arabic even though none appeared to have Arab ancestry. “It’s hard to call them terrorists,” Judge da Silva said. “But even though they don’t have a very solid organization, the arrests are warranted from a legal point of view. ” One suspect, identified in Brazilian media reports as Vitor Barbosa Magalhães, 23, converted to Islam several years ago and lived in the city of Guarulhos in São Paulo State’s metropolitan area, where he works in his father’s car repair shop. Mr. Magalhães’s wife told reporters he had traveled to Egypt in 2012 to study Arabic and Islam. After returning to Brazil, he gave classes in Arabic over YouTube and maintained a WhatsApp group to discuss Islam, she said. Concern has been increasing here over the potential for terrorist attacks around the Olympics, with police   squads responding to various reports of bags left in public areas (no explosive devices have been found). These fears are relatively new in Brazil, a country that has largely been spared the kind of   attacks that have horrified Europe, the Middle East, the United States and many other parts of the world. Brazilian officials have also said they were enhancing security measures following a report by the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors jihadist websites, saying that a group calling itself Ansar   Brazil had proclaimed allegiance to Abu Bakr   the leader of the Islamic State. The arrests on Thursday marked a turning point in the way Brazil’s government generally discusses terrorism threats. For more than a decade, and especially after the Sept. 11 attacks, Brazilian intelligence officials have been monitoring individuals suspected of links to terrorism. During that time, however, “Brazilian government officials kept saying publicly that no credible evidence exists that people who live inside Brazil have links to terrorism,” said Marcos Ferreira, a scholar focusing on terrorism in South America at the Federal University of Paraíba. At the same time, other experts voiced caution as to whether the suspects would have put a plot into motion. “Initially, these arrests seem very fragile,” said Rodrigo Monteiro, a security specialist at the Federal Fluminense University in Rio. “We need to wait a bit for the government to define the threat in a better way. ” On Thursday, the justice minister, Mr. Moraes, said that violent crime remained the priority ahead of the Olympics. Despite gun control measures, Rio is still awash in weapons, with drug gangs wielding control over parts of the city. The authorities have begun deploying tens of thousands of troops to bolster security in Rio. “The biggest concern is still crime,” Mr. Moraes said.",0
19381,Russian Navy Fleet Starts Strikes at Terrorists' Positions in Syria's Aleppo,"BY AHT Staff Russian Navy Fleet Starts Strikes at Terrorists' Positions in Syria's Aleppo Russian warships deployed in Syrian waters targeted the terrorist groups' positions in the Western part of Aleppo city and in the Eastern side of the town of al-Bab, inflicting major damage on the militants, an expert in strategic affairs disclosed on Saturday. 5 Shares 0 1 
Kamal al-Jafa termed Moscow's Kaliber cruise missile attacks on terrorist centers in Western Aleppo city and the town of al-Bab, North of the city, as a sign of the crucial role that the Russian naval forces are to play in Aleppo's Large-Scale Military Operation. 
""The attacks came as preparations for the implementation of al-Bab operation are over now,"" al-Jafa said. 
""Turkey tries to increase its role in the diplomatic settlement of Syrian crisis via its influence in al-Bab region,"" he added. 
""If the Syrian army seizes control of al-Bab within the framework of a coalition with Russia and Iran and diplomatic and logistical support of China, the aspirations and plans of the US, Turkey and even Saudi Arabia will fall flat and the Syrian government's sovereignty in Northern Syrian will be expanded,"" the expert underscored. 
A Russian military and diplomatic source had disclosed earlier today that the Russian fighter jets on 'Admiral Kuznetsov' aircraft carrier and the country's navy fleet would start strikes on terrorists in Aleppo in Northern Syria soon. MORE... The Criminal West’s State Sponsorship of Terrorism 
""Russian warplanes, on board the Kuznetsov aircraft carrier, will soon hit the positions and gatherings of the terrorist groups in Aleppo,"" the source said. 
""Mig 29 and Sukhoi 33 fighter jets have taken off Admiral Kuznetsov' aircraft carrier in recent days and have carried out reconnaissance operations over Syria,"" the source added. 
""Mig 29 and Sukhoi 33 fighter jets' reconnaissance flights were aimed at identifying the new positions of the terrorists and preparing a list of terrorist targets to hand over to the navy fleet (a cruiser and destroyer),""the sources went on to say. 
""The Russian fleet, including Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier, 'Pyotr Veliky' nuclear power guided missile cruiser and Admiral Gregorowich destroyer are ready for military operation,"" the source underlined. 
Sources in the Russian Defense Ministry disclosed on Tuesday that the country's aircraft carrier group was ready to launch a strike targeting terrorists in the province of Aleppo. 
The source told Russia's Gazeta that the attack, which would likely engage Kalibr cruise missiles, would target militants outside Aleppo, and not the residential areas. 
The group, which includes Russia's 'Admiral Kuznetsov' aircraft carrier, 'Pyotr Veliky' nuclear power guided missile cruiser and two destroyers, completed its transfer to the Mediterranean Sea and is getting ready to strike, the Defense Ministry source said. 
""The group's main goal is to carry out missile strikes on terrorists outside of Aleppo that are attempting to get into the city"", the source added. 
He also said that Kalibr cruise missiles would be used in the strikes, but did not specify from which ships the missiles would be launched. 
No Russian surface ship that was currently in the Med was capable of firing the Kalibr-NK missiles, but submarine-launched Kalibr-PL could be used in the strike. The surface-launched type of Kalibr missile could also be launched from the Caspian Sea. 
Final details of the strike were being worked out, the source told Gazeta.ru, including zeroing in on the terrorists' locations, finding out the details of their transport routes, base camps and storage and training facilities. 
""The strikes will avoid the city of Aleppo to prevent civilian casualties, because terrorists continue to use city residents as human shields."" 
Early in November, a Russian naval group, headed by Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier and the battle cruiser Peter the Great, arrived in the Mediterranean Sea, causing quite a stir in the West.",0

19383,Henrik Stenson Beats Phil Mickelson in British Open Duel - The New York Times,"TROON, Scotland  —   Phil Mickelson had turned back the clock for a fourth consecutive day. He had made a birdie on the opening hole of Sunday’s final round at the 2016 British Open and never looked back. His game was as sharp as it had ever been on the final day of a major championship. Winless for the past three years, the    Mickelson was tied for the tournament lead, just five holes and perhaps one last surge from becoming the oldest British Open champion in 149 years. And yet Mickelson felt as if nothing he was doing was enough to win. Or might ever be enough on this day. Three birdies, an eagle and no bogeys in his first 13 holes? Mickelson’s playing partner, Henrik Stenson, had not flinched at that run, rolling in dicey, spectacular and lengthy birdie putts from seemingly every quarter of the Royal Troon greens. “I had to make   or   just to try to keep pace with him,” Mickelson later said. The two of them went to the 15th green sizing up birdie putts, with Stenson’s ball 51 feet from the hole and just off the green. “I had about a   on 15, and I’m thinking, ‘I’ve just got to make that,’” Mickelson said. He was right, because Stenson improbably sank his monster putt. When Mickelson missed, Stenson had the edge he needed and ran with it. His ninth and 10th birdies in the closing three holes were only exclamation points on the way to a British Open title that made Stenson the first Swede to win a men’s major golf championship. Stenson became the second golfer to win a major with a final round of 63, finishing three strokes ahead of Mickelson, whose    65 was the lowest score he has posted in the final round of a major. Stenson’s score of 20 under par tied Jason Day’s record for the lowest winning score relative to par in a major, and Stenson’s aggregate   score of 264 was also a major championship record. J. B. Holmes was the closest pursuer to Stenson and Mickelson, finishing in third place, a whopping 14 strokes behind the champion. “I knew Phil wasn’t going to back down at any point, and in some ways, that made it easier for me because I knew I could never rest and had to keep making birdies,” said Stenson, who had twice finished tied for the third at the British Open and once was second, when Mickelson won the event in 2013. But Stenson said he had entered this year’s tournament certain that his fortunes at major championships  —   he has four other career   finishes in majors  —   were finally going to turn. “It’s not something you want to run around and shout,” he said. “But I really did feel like I was going all the way this week. I could feel my putting improving and leading me there. ” While Mickelson has a   history of   finishes in major championships, Stenson, the world’s   golfer, had also been in something of a slump until recently, with one win on the PGA or European tours since 2014 and multiple   and   finishes. Those   may have been on Stenson’s mind when Sunday did not start auspiciously. He badly missed an   par putt to bogey the first hole. When Mickelson birdied that hole, he vaulted into the lead, eclipsing the     advantage Stenson had held overnight. But with pluck, precision and a steely putting stroke under pressure, Stenson found the resolve missing in previous major championship finales. Stenson has always been known as a great ball striker, especially with his irons. If he has displayed a weakness, it has been on the greens, where short putts have especially bedeviled him in tense moments. But Sunday, he thrived. Still, Stenson knew his reputation. As crucial as the long putt on the 15th green was, when Stenson was asked which situation made him the most nervous Sunday, he quickly mentioned a      putt he faced on the   16th hole. Mickelson had just made a birdie, and Stenson said it occurred to him as he stood over his short birdie putt that it was vital that he not give Mickelson any momentum heading into the final holes. “That was the most pressure I felt,” he said. “Making that putt was huge. ” It mimicked many other moments when Stenson held off the charging Mickelson, who did not make a bogey Sunday. Stenson made birdie putts of 12 and 15 feet on the second and third holes. When Mickelson eagled the fourth hole, Stenson made sure he remained tied for the lead with his third birdie in the first four holes. The tie was briefly broken at the   eighth hole, which is known as the Postage Stamp, when Mickelson’s tee shot was considerably inside Stenson’s, but it was Stenson who made a birdie putt, while Mickelson missed. Mickelson pulled even again at the 11th hole, then made a spectacular par save after rescuing his ball from the fescue rough twice on the 12th hole. But Stenson charged ahead yet again on the 14th hole with his seventh birdie when he converted a   putt. After Sunday’s trophy ceremony, Stenson courteously acknowledged that he grew annoyed having to repeatedly answer questions about why no male Swedish golfer had won a major championship. “Many great players from my country tried in past decades, and there’s been a couple of really close calls,” he said. He added that his countryman Jesper Parnevik, who was second at the British Open in 1994 and tied for second in 1997, had contacted him before Sunday’s final round. “He sent me a message, ‘Go out and finish what I didn’t manage to finish,’” Stenson said. “And I’m really proud to have done that, and it’s going to be massive for golf in Sweden. ” Mickelson, meanwhile, remained disenchanted over falling short of winning his sixth major championship. “It’s not like I have decades left of opportunities to win majors, so each one of these means a lot to me,” he said. But as a close eyewitness to a historic final round, he knew better than anyone what had transpired at Royal Troon on Sunday. “I played close to flawless golf and was beat,” Mickelson said. “It’s probably the best I’ve played and not won. But Henrik made 10 birdies, so what are you going to do? “I like and respect him  —   it was impressive, and he’ll be a great champion. ”",0
19384,"Uninhibited Chinese Swimmer, Discussing Her Period, Shatters Another Barrier - The New York Times","BEIJING  —   The uninhibited Fu Yuanhui, the Chinese swimmer beloved for her    expressions, has made waves once again. On Saturday night in Rio, she freely discussed having her period while competing in the Olympics, breaking what has long been a taboo among female athletes. The video of her poolside interview quickly went viral. Ms. Fu’s remarks came after the Chinese women’s swimming team narrowly missed winning a medal in the   medley relay. In a   interview, Ms. Fu, who had already won a bronze medal for the   backstroke, could be seen crouching as her teammates were questioned one by one. As the commentator turned to her, Ms. Fu stood up, grimacing in pain. The commentator ventured a guess that Ms. Fu must be suffering from a stomachache, which Ms. Fu quickly corrected. “It’s because I just got my period yesterday, so I’m still a bit weak and really tired,” she said. “But this isn’t an excuse for not swimming well. ” Ms. Fu’s candor immediately attracted a deluge of comments online. On Weibo, China’s   social media platform, the hashtag related to the subject was searched more than half a million times by the end of Sunday, with many commenters expressing their support for Ms. Fu’s openness. “Only those who have gotten their periods know how deathly painful it can be,” one wrote. “You are too awesome. ” A male user wrote, “To compete during her period and still feel bad about placing fourth: Fu Yuanhui, you are amazing. You are our pride. ” Female commenters also took to social media to dispute largely   criticism that swimming in a pool while menstruating was unhealthy and unhygienic. “Don’t talk to me about staining the pool red or taking medicine to stop one’s period,” a female commenter wrote. “Haven’t you heard of something called a tampon?” In many parts of the world, menstruation is still regarded with shame and distaste, though that is changing. In the United States, creative hashtag campaigns on social media and online petitions have challenged the discomfort about   topics. Female athletes, including the former tennis star Annabel Croft of Britain, have criticized the silence surrounding menstruation in sports. In 2015, the American musician Kiran Gandhi ran the London Marathon during her period sans female hygiene products to protest   crossing the finish line with bloodstains prominently on display. Yet more open discussion about menstruation has been more slow to catch on in China. When talking about their periods, if at all, women still prefer to use euphemisms like “a visit from my aunt” or “taking a break. ” Television ads for feminine hygiene products are banned during prime viewing times as inappropriate. As a result, very few Chinese women use tampons, because it is widely, and falsely, believed that they can rob a woman of her virginity. This month, Chinese entrepreneurs plan to introduce the country’s first domestic tampon brand. All tampons sold in China have been imported, and most are sold online. In February, Anhui Province issued regulations allowing women to take up to two days off for menstrual pain, provided they could procure a doctor’s note certifying their symptoms. However, critics feared the practice might have the unintended effect of discouraging employers from hiring women and pointed out that women might still elect to forgo a paid menstrual leave to avoid criticism from male colleagues. “Fu Yuanhui’s comments have raised awareness, because Chinese society still approaches menstruation indirectly, even considering it unlucky,” said Chen Yaya, a feminist activist and researcher at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. “But there’s no need for this at all. The period is simply an everyday phenomenon. ”",0
19385,"Angelina Jolie’s Father Speaks Out Against Illuminati, Makes A Chilling Statement","In a video uploaded to YouTube, Voight slammed both George Soros and Hillary Clinton, claiming they are attempting to turn America into a country of tyranny. 
Via AlternativeNews 

“May God protect the real truth and may Donald Trump win this presidency. He will save our America, and he will certainly make it great again,” he said . Voight has repeatedly supported Trump throughout the election cycle despite the business tycoon’s unprovoked attacks on his daughter Angelina Jolie’s looks.
Scroll Down For Video Below In the video, posted on Voight’s social media channels, he said: ‘We were once a country of freedom. Now we’re becoming a country of tyranny. ‘Thousands of refugees will flood our nation, and no one will know the good guys from the bad guys. It will kill our economy which is at an all time low under the years of Obama’s presidency.’
Millions of jobs have been created, unemployment has plummeted, and the economy has grown about two per cent each year under Obama’s administration, with experts grading it a ‘solid B or B+’, CNN reported. But Voight also warned that people would lose their Second Amendment rights under Hillary Clinton, even though she has repeatedly disputed similar statements.
Voight went on to say: ‘Freedom of religion will be attacked…and Hillary will try to stop all conservative voices on TV and radio. ‘Our highest courts will become socialist, and she will restrict what America was founded on – our freedom to become a small business owner and pursue our own personal dreams.’
Voight also accused Soros of ‘turn[ing] hundreds of Jewish people over to the Nazis to be exterminated during World War II,’ an idea perpetuated by conservative commentator Glenn Beck. When Soros was 14, his father bribed an agriculture official in Nazi-occupied Hungary to pose as his Christian godfather.
Soros once accompanied the man during an inventory of an estate left behind by the wealthy Jewish aristocrat Mor Kornfeld. In a 1998 episode of 60 Minutes, Soros said: ‘I had no role in taking away that property. So I had no sense of guilt.’
While Voight made no reference to Trump’s comments about women in his latest video, he came out to defend the business tycoon days earlier. ‘I am so ashamed of my fellow actor Bobby DeNiro’s rant against Donald Trump…’

‘Donald Trump’s words were not as damaging as Robert DeNiro’s ugly rant. Trump’s words did not hurt anyone.’ Voight tweeted in response to the Republican candidate’s comments that he could sexually harass women without consequence.

‘I don’t know of too many men who haven’t expressed some sort of similar sexual terms toward women, especially in their younger years,’ Voight added. Trump has since been accused of sexual harassment by six women in the days following the 2005 hot mic recording’s emergence.
The presidential candidate has spoken out against Voight’s daughter over the last decade, saying in 2006: ‘[Angelina Jolie has] been with so many guys she makes me look like a baby, OK, with the other side. And, I just don’t even find her attractive.’ In 2007, Trump said: ‘Angelina Jolie is sort of amazing because everyone thinks she’s like this great beauty. ‘I really understand beauty. And I will tell you, she’s not—I do own Miss Universe. I do own Miss USA. I mean, I own a lot of different things. I do understand beauty, and she’s not.’

19387,Monday Newspaper Headlines Assert Administration Line: Hillary Exonerated!,"November 7, 2016, 2:45 pm   
FBI Director Comey’s weekend decision not to pursue crooked Hillary for her mishandling of secret government emails was a startling acquiescence to the White House position: In a letter to Congress, Comey said that Clinton should not face criminal charges on the basis of newly discovered State Department emails on a non-secure device. 
One can imagine that the FBI Director was ferociously pressured to back down from his earlier accusations. And the switch created the desired headlines one day before the election that concerned voters could safely choose Hillary: she won’t be dragged from the Oval Office to be tried as a criminal! 
The Sacramento Bee had a nicely artistic presentation: 
The liberal press all headlined with the same not-so-subliminal message — Vote Democrat: 
FBI SAYS REVIEW CLEARS CLINTON IN EMAIL INQUIRY — New York Times 
FBI won’t pursue charges against Clinton — Washington Post 
FBI Affirms No Clinton Charges —Wall Street Journal 
FBI clears Clinton but Anger Persists — Los Angeles Times 
Clinton cleared in late twist — Chicago Tribune 
FBI clears Clinton in email case — Houston Chronicle 
Again, no FBI e-mail charge — Denver Post 
So five out of eight newspapers (chosen by me as being typical major publications) used the verb “clear” which is broad and has the air of finality. 
However, the truth is more complex than a brief headline can convey: Hillary may get a temporary reprieve on the email case now, but that doesn’t mean she is off the hook. As Congressman Trey Gowdy (a former prosecutor) remarked on Sunday, “Investigations are never over unless a statute of limitations has expired or unless jeopardy has attached.” 
So if something more incriminating turns up, it’s game on. 
Plus, the Clinton Foundation remains an object of FBI investigation and is rumored to be a stronger case. In fact, Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer appeared on a Fox Business show Monday and remarked, “The way it’s been explained to me by people in the FBI sphere is that basically they’re going to get one bite at this apple, so if you bring an email case prosecution, or were to do that and were to fail, the Clinton Foundation investigation just politically would be too much.” 
Certainly the Wikileaks story that Chelsea’s deluxe wedding was financed by the Foundation has refocused attention on family’s corrupt slush fund disguised as a do-gooder organization. 
So Hillary in prison orange remains a possibility, albeit an unlikely one.",0
19389,The Retraining Paradox - The New York Times,"When Nathan Kecy graduated from Plymouth State University in New Hampshire a decade ago with a bachelor’s degree in communications, he found himself with about $10, 000 in debt and few clear career options. He first found work as a    salesman (“a pyramid scheme,” he recalls) and then in telemarketing. Finally he landed a job as an infrastructure specialist for Datamatic, a      company. He was traveling across the country installing meters, making a decent salary. But he lost his job after the company restructured in 2012, he said, and soon he found that his skills weren’t easily transferable to a new field Datamatic’s technology was proprietary, and his expertise in the company’s installation program wasn’t appealing to employers outside that particular industry. He tried going into business with a friend, but the relationship soured. By then he had a baby and a fiancée, and he felt stuck. Now 32, Kecy is a few months away from finishing a   certificate program in advanced composites manufacturing at Great Bay Community College in Rochester, N. H. The program operates out of a satellite campus that opened in 2013, with aid from a Labor Department grant meant to help community colleges reach “trade displaced” workers who need help training for new careers. The unemployment rate in southern New Hampshire is low, less than 3 percent. At one state job fair last summer, just 350 people showed up for 1, 200 available jobs. In Strafford County, where Rochester is located, the largest employers include the University of New Hampshire and Liberty Mutual, but also manufacturers like Turbocam and Contitech. Kecy’s classmates include veterans, recent   graduates and older workers whose careers had reached dead ends. All of them are looking for hope and a decent paycheck by acquiring a new set of skills. “Within six months, I’m going to go from regular guy to working in the aerospace community,” says Tommy Florentino, a disabled veteran with a background in construction and automotive manufacturing. He has friends who went to Boston College or Suffolk University, “and they’re waiters and waitresses. ” The college’s    Advanced Technology and Academic Center is at the edge of a nondescript shopping center. The complex also houses a Dollar Tree, a J. C. Penney and a Kmart, where a banner out front reads, “Now hiring. ” Cashiers there earn close to minimum wage. But Kecy expects to earn at least $16 an hour when he graduates and to move up quickly from there. Composites is a broad field in manufacturing, with applications including automotive parts, sporting goods and prosthetics, as well as in the locally prominent aerospace industry. The state’s department of economic development bills its seacoast region as “the emerging composites region,” and it points to Great Bay’s program as a reason for more aerospace and defense businesses in particular to relocate there. “I’ve got some options, which is something I’ve never really experienced before,” Kecy says. There’s a strange disconnect between two of the big narratives about the American   work force right now. In one story, there is a population of unemployed and underemployed   adults for whom   work seems increasingly out of reach their jobs have gone overseas or become automated, and they find themselves working retail, or not working at all. But an apparently conflicting story comes from American employers, which have been insisting for years that they have a hard time finding workers to fill many skilled   jobs. A 2015 report from the Manufacturing Institute, for example, found that seven in 10 manufacturing executives said they faced shortages of workers with adequate tech skills. A high proportion of existing skilled workers is also nearing retirement, which means a bigger gap is looming soon. By 2025, the report warned, two million jobs will be going unfilled. (Health care, also a big focus of retraining programs, is another rapidly expanding field.) The tantalizing promise of   job training is that it can bridge the gap between those narratives in a way that benefits individual workers, employers and the country as a whole.   Americans get good jobs, employers get skilled labor and the economy benefits from their mutual good fortune. The image of that virtuous cycle has made the promotion of training programs appealing for politicians on the left and the right. Hillary Clinton proposed retraining former   workers in new careers as part of a $30 billion package meant “to ensure that coal miners and their families get the benefits they’ve earned and respect they deserve. ” Even as Republicans have voted to cut funding for training in recent years, they have paid it lip service as a way to put Americans back to work. It’s perhaps not surprising, though, that so much of the working class gravitated in the last election to Donald Trump, whose rhetoric about displaced workers was very different: blunt (if unrealistic) promises to stop old careers from disappearing, to “bring back our jobs. ” In its zeal for retraining, the federal government’s approach to the problem has become increasingly byzantine, a dizzying constellation of programs to help struggling workers prepare for new careers. Some of them are intended for employees laid off en masse when their jobs went overseas, and others are for those who are simply unemployed and underqualified for   work. In the 2009 fiscal year, the Government Accountability Office counted 47 different federal   programs administered by nine agencies, numbers Republicans have since used to argue that many of the programs were redundant. In his 2012 State of the Union address, even President Obama criticized the “maze of confusing training programs” unemployed workers had to navigate to get help. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, signed into law in 2014 with bipartisan support, was designed in part to streamline the government’s approach. Critics also say that job training is costly and too often ineffective. Take the primary federal effort specifically aimed at workers affected by global trade, the Labor Department’s Trade Adjustment Assistance program. Through T. A. A. qualified workers can receive free retraining, typically through a   program like Great Bay’s. The program is generous, spending more than $11, 500 on each person who participated in retraining in the 2015 fiscal year. But it serves relatively few people, and recent analysis has shown iffy results: A 2012 evaluation prepared for the Labor Department found that while 85 percent of those who went through T. A. A.  training eventually received a certificate or degree, only 37 percent of them were working in that field four years later. (The program was later amended to include more individualized support.) All too often, skeptics say, publicly funded training programs are a sop to   companies who want taxpayers to foot the bill to train their workers. Critics also point at research suggesting that    training by employers themselves has been declining in recent years. But it simply doesn’t make economic sense for most employers to do all of their own training anymore. In part, this is because of technology: Jobs in advanced manufacturing and health care require intense technological instruction, usually accompanied by classroom time. At the same time, standardization means employers often poach skilled workers from one another, which discourages them from investing a lot of time and money in training their own workers. “It’s unrealistic today to think of traditional, very idiosyncratic manufacturing jobs where you’re going to walk in, get a job, get trained in a bunch of very specific skills, and they’ll hold onto you for decades,” says Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard University. “That’s just not the trajectory of employment anymore. ” After completing the certificate program in April, Kecy will have specializations in “nondestructive testing” and “bonding and finishing,” skills that set him up for specific positions that local employers have been struggling to fill. The simplest description of composites manufacturing is that it is the process of putting two materials together adobe, for example, is a composite of straw and mud. “Advanced” composites manufacturing typically involves adding   resin to woven fibers. The strong, lightweight finished products are replacing metal in many manufacturing areas, including aerospace. Great Bay students further specialize in areas like quality inspection or   molding the goal is that when they graduate, they are ready for     jobs. Advanced manufacturing in general is a strong industry in New England a recent analysis by Deloitte and the New England Council found that in 2012, 59 percent of the region’s 641, 000 manufacturing jobs were “advanced. ” With his certificate, Kecy is confident that he will find a job locally, and he’s probably right. Great Bay’s composites program was developed in a close relationship with Safran Aerospace Composites and Albany Engineered Composites, two companies that opened a shared plant in Rochester in 2014. Safran helped develop the program’s curriculum and stays in touch about which specializations the company will be needing in the coming months. It guarantees interviews to all graduates of the program and has hired about 30 of the more than 170 participants so far. Over all, more than half the program’s graduates have been hired by five large local manufacturers, according to its director, Debra Mattson. That level of coordination with local industry, ideally touching on everything from curriculum to recruitment, is now seen by policy experts as a crucial dividing line between programs that work and those that don’t. The federal government now emphasizes this kind of “demand driven” training in part to ensure that workers aren’t being retrained with new skills as obsolete as their old ones. “A good sign is if the program was   with the firm,” says Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program. “One of the fundamental problems is training divorced from   dynamics  —   people being trained without the presence of jobs they could actually arrive in. ” (The Nordic countries, which spend more on job training in general, have a strong record in developing training with input from both industry and labor.) The evidence in the United States for   training is promising so far. A 2010 study of three such programs found that enrollees were earning almost 30 percent more than a control group two years after they began the program and were significantly more likely to be employed. The Great Bay program has relationships with Safran, A. E. C. and other area employers, including BAE Systems, Turbocam International and the gun manufacturer Sig Sauer, which recently landed a $580 million contract with the Army. The program is short by design, and new cohorts start three times a year to ensure a steady stream of graduates for local employers. “Industry is dying for bodies, just dying for skilled workers,” says Will Arvelo, Great Bay’s president. “They can’t wait two years. ” On a snowy afternoon a few weeks ago, Kecy and his classmates in his Fundamentals of Composites Manufacturing class were at work in the “clean room. ” The setting looked more like a science lab than a factory. A large cooler stacked with   bags of thick fabric pieces stood in the corner, and work tables held clusters of metal tubes. The class instructor, Peter Dow, watched as two teams of students worked on a project they had been planning for several weeks: constructing a     tube with a finished exterior. Later they would have a chance to tweak their plans and try it all over again, a lesson in the manufacturing principle of “continuous improvement. ” For all the ways in which technology has changed the manufacturing industry, one of the most striking to an outsider is the appearance of the work space itself. The students in the clean room wore white coats and safety glasses as they used hair dryers and refrigerant spray to fiddle with the sticky material. Outside their small work area, the facility’s spotless manufacturing lab offered the capacity to build a product from start to finish: a huge,   loom for weaving carbon fiber, a   machining center, an automatic autoclave. Practically every piece of equipment seemed to feature a keyboard or touch screen. But manufacturing’s new     profile is also what makes it daunting for many older workers looking for new careers. The dilemma illustrates some of the broader challenges of retraining later in life. Kerri Uyeno, a    single mother of three who graduated in the Great Bay program’s first cohort in 2014, began working at Safran as a bonding operator three weeks after earning her certificate. It was such a happy ending that she featured prominently in early publicity materials for the program. But she had conflicts with her supervisors and lasted just over a year in the job before quitting. She didn’t work again for six months her house went into foreclosure. An administrator at Great Bay tried to persuade her to come back and work toward her associate degree, but the prospect was exhausting. “It was so hard to get through that six months to my certificate,” she said, “I just didn’t have it in me to get more schooling. ” Today she is an office manager at a flooring showroom nearby. She still exudes pride when she talks about earning her certificate, but she also calls the experience “one of the biggest heartbreaks I’ve ever gone through. ” At 49, Dean Kandilakis is one of the oldest students in the program’s current cohort. He has a master’s degree in international relations, but he spent most of his career doing administrative work. “There’s a really large learning curve for someone who’s just   from a different field,” he said during a break from class. “It’s been a very stressful time for me, because it’s an adjustment in my identity as a human being. ” But he says it’s worth it to feel as if he’s finally becoming a specialist in something. It can take enormous intellectual and emotional efforts to pursue retraining, especially for people who have been rattled by sudden job loss or depressed by declining career prospects. For all his grandiosity, Donald Trump’s approach to   voters was characterized by relentless pessimism: dark visions of “poverty and heartache,” warnings about Mexicans “taking our manufacturing jobs. ” Nostalgia, with its disdain for the present and mistrust of the future, is actually quite a gloomy sentiment. Job training, by contrast, makes the    assurance that starting over is possible with help and time. It takes optimism on the part of both policy makers and workers. Back in the lab, Kandilakis’s team had been having some difficulty with their tube the material was too warm, and it was thickening too quickly as they molded it. “We’re having some problems today,” he said, but he didn’t sound concerned. “Thankfully we’ll have another run. ”",0
19390,Report: NBC Holding ’Crisis Meetings’ Over Megyn Kelly-Alex Jones Interview,"NBC is holding “crisis meetings” as the network has come under intense pressure to pull anchor Megyn Kelly’s upcoming interview with controversial InfoWars founder and radio host Alex Jones, according to a report. [The planned interview  —   in which Kelly questions Jones about his previous assertion that the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary school massacre was a hoax  —   is scheduled to air on Sunday June 18 as part of the anchor’s new show, Sunday Night With Megyn Kelly.   However, NBC has faced pressure from social media users  —   including some relatives of the victims of the Sandy Hook attack  —   to cancel the interview. In the wake of the controversy, J. P Morgan Chase reportedly decided to temporarily pull its advertising from the network. Nevertheless, the network has pledged to move ahead with the interview, with NBC News Chairman Andy Lack saying the interview will be edited to provide sensitivity to the Sandy Hook victims. “No one expected sponsors to pull out, but this is why they hired Megyn. They expect to lose and gain viewers and they want the buzz,” one source told Page Six. Next Sunday, I sit down with conservative radio host @RealAlexJones to discuss controversies and conspiracies #SundayNight June 18 on NBC pic. twitter.   —   Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) June 11, 2017,  However, Page Six reported that the network held multiple meetings Wednesday to discuss its response to the criticism, with some employees urging the network to axe the interview. “It’s a sh*t show. No one wants to withstand a whole week of criticism over this. There are a number of people who want to pull the interview,” an unnamed source told the outlet. In a statement posted to her Twitter account Tuesday, Kelly said: “I find Alex Jones’ suggestion that Sandy Hook was ‘a hoax’ as personally revolting as every other rational person does. It left me, and many other Americans, asking the very question that prompted this interview: How does Jones, who traffics in these outrageous conspiracy theories, have the respect of the president of the United States and a growing audience of millions?” As a result of the controversy, Kelly has agreed to step down as host of a gun violence prevention fundraiser being held Wednesday by Sandy Hook Promise, a group that was founded after the 2012 attack. “What I think we’re doing is journalism,” she said. “The bottom line is that while it’s not always popular, it’s important. I would submit to you that neither I nor NBC News has elevated Alex Jones in any way. He’s been elevated by 5 or 6 million viewers or listeners, and by the president of the United States. As you know, journalists don’t get the choice over who has power or influence in our country. ”   You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com",0
19391,"FBI: MS-13 Is Most Violent, Organized Gang in America","“  is not the largest street gang in the United States it is increasingly the most violent and ” an official with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) told the House Homeland Security Committee Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence on Tuesday morning. The FBI assistant director said the gang had a “propensity for gruesome violence. ”[William F. Sweeney, Jr. the assistant director in charge of the FBI in New York told the committee that street gangs in general “show no signs of decreasing memberships or a decline in criminal activity. ” In fact, according to the FBI’s 2015 National Gang Report, memberships in gangs increased in 2013 to 2015 in 49 percent of jurisdictions. Sweeney told the members of Congress that the FBI estimates there could be up to 10, 000 members of the   gang living in the United States.  Although the leadership of the notorious   gang is based in El Salvador and Honduras, the clique leaders in the U. S. coordinate not only with each other in this country, they work with leaders in El Salvador, Sweeney said. “They frequently discuss targets, members who have fallen out of favor, and ways to expand their operations. ” This makes the   gang “atypical in their approach to crime and organizational structure. ” “Members also capitalize on the ability to extort individuals living in the United States who still have family in Central America, threatening to harm family abroad. Using fear as a method of extortion, the gang often targets small business owners and restauranteurs, individuals who don’t want to join the gang, and gang members who no longer want to be active,” Sweeney said. The FBI assistant director told the committee that the gang has “gained notoriety” because of their “brutal nature. ” “Their motivation is rooted in a desire to kill for the sake of killing. The attacks on their victims are gruesome, typically up close and personal. They often involve mutilation and dismemberment and are sometimes recorded. ” On May 5, Breitbart Texas’ Managing Director and    Brandon Darby and Ildefonso Ortiz reported: “Five Facts Every American Must Know About the Brutal   Gang. ” For one,   members work as foot soldiers for Mexican cartels on U. S. soil. Two Minnesota teens were kidnapped and tortured by   gang members who were working on behalf of the Mexican Sinaloa Federation cartel. After a Sinaloa Cartel methamphetamine stash house had been robbed in St. Paul, Minnesota, the cartel hired   members from Los Angeles, California to fly to Minnesota to investigate. They tortured two local teens, nearly severing one finger off of one of the teens to try to get information. And although liberals blame deportations for the gang’s creation,   originated from illegal immigrants in California.   members often pose a bigger threat to Border Patrol agents than the Mexican cartels the gangs work for. As reported by Breitbart Texas, the rise of   gang violence has dramatically impacted crime in the nation’s   city, Houston. In April, Governor Greg Abbott announced the creation of a Texas   Task Force to target these criminal alien gang members. Houston is one of the five cities that the FBI has identified to have a large   presence. Darby and Ortiz reported that the State of Texas considers the gang to be a Tier   threat  —   the “most significant” threat level. In March, two   gang members appeared in a Harris County courtroom laughing and waving at news cameras after being charged with the kidnapping and rape of one    girl, and the kidnapping, rape, and murder of another young girl in Jersey Village  —   a city within the Houston metropolitan area. The murdered girl was allegedly killed as part of a satanic ritual. On June 10, Breitbart Texas reported that the numbers of unaccompanied minors (UACs) being apprehended at our southern border with Mexico, particularly from El Salvador, was once again on the rise. Although there had been a   downtrend, 8, 005 UACs from El Salvador have been apprehended after crossing the border illegally since October 1, 2016. There were 1, 493 apprehended in May alone  —   nearly a fifty percent increase from the previous month.   members frequently recruit children who are illegal immigrants. The FBI assistant director from New York told members of the Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence that   members are “typically much younger than those connected to other street gangs. ” They take “cues from the gang instead of relying on a productive family structure. Also, those emigrating from El Salvador to the United States are known to be exposed and desensitized to extreme violence at an early age. ” Sweeney reported that the FBI’s Long Island Gang Task Force (LIGTF) has arrested over 200   gang members since 2010. Over 35 of these gang members were involved in homicides. A majority of those   members have been convicted on federal racketeering charges for participating in murders, attempted murders, and assaults. Moreover,   is believed to be responsible for more than 20 homicides in Suffolk and Nassau Counties just since 2016 he told members of Congress on the committee.

19392,Dave Brat: H-1B Does Not Put Americans First,"Rep. Dave Brat ( ) is singling out the   visa program in a new   for its harmful impact on American workers. [In a piece titled ‘Putting The American Worker First,’ Brat argues that the   visa puts the need of foreign workers first, rather than Americans, by allowing businesses to bring in 85, 000 new foreign workers every year, often taking once   jobs from Americans who are fired and forced to train their replacements.  “One thing is clear: the United States’ immigration policy should serve first and foremost the interests of the American worker,” Brat begins the  : The current system for   visa workers does not put the interests of our country first, and rampant abuses to the system leave the American worker standing on the sidelines and often underemployed. During a time of heightened political divides, this is an issue both Democrats and Republicans in Congress can agree needs to be addressed. Too often, companies capitalize on the loopholes in our immigration system to displace   American workers in search of cheap labor. I applaud the announcement of President Trump’s America First policy to return more American jobs to American workers by rooting out fraud, identifying necessary reforms and punishing companies exploiting the system for their own financial gain. Brat touts his   reform plan introduced with Rep. Bill Pascrell ( ) Rep. Ro Khanna ( ) and Rep. Paul Gosar ( ) where employers seeking foreign workers through the   visa would have to raise the minimum wage for those workers, while also giving “investigative authority” to the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS) and Labor to “find abuses and creates more defined allotment categories to prioritize STEM workers. ” The abuses of the   visa at the expense of American workers have largely been silenced, according to Brat, as fired Americans are forced to sign agreements which mandates they not speak about the termination: The outrage from   American tech workers has been muted because companies frequently require employees to sign nondisclosure forms prohibiting them from criticizing their employers in exchange for severance pay. Last year, employees at Disney filed in federal court to sue outsourcing companies that contracted with American companies to supplant Americans with   workers. And just last month, 60 Minutes aired an episode entitled “You’re Fired” that highlighted how the   visa program is working against the American worker. The episode told the story of Robert Harrison, an engineer at a medical center in San Francisco. Last October, he was told along with 80 of his IT coworkers that they were being fired and replaced with international workers. These American workers were asked to train their replacements and promised generous bonuses. The American worker should be allowed to compete for positions before a company outsources the jobs to a foreign worker with an   visa. The purpose of our immigration laws should be to protect the interests of our country and promote a thriving economy and productive citizens. Instead, the   system has created an entire industry of foreign workers coming to the United States to be trained, and then the role is outsourced back to their country of origin for drastically lower wages. This practice eliminates many traditional   positions for technical professionals in the United States. Brat says that not only does the   visa harm the millions of displaced Americans that it has impacted since its inception, but it “underpays and exploits foreign workers,” writing that the current   Congress and President Donald Trump’s administration must make major reforms to the program. Trump’s newest executive order targets the   visa for its abuses by U. S. companies, calling for a “full legal analysis” of the program by DOJ, DHS, and the Labor Department, as Breitbart Texas reported. If the   visa program had never been enacted, computer science job availability in the labor market would be up 11 percent and wages in the tech industry would have increased by five percent, Breitbart News reported.

19393,"Reading Fake News, Pakistani Minister Directs Nuclear Threat at Israel - The New York Times","A fake news article led to gunfire at a Washington pizzeria three weeks ago. Now it seems that another fake news story has prompted the defense minister of Pakistan to threaten to go nuclear. The defense minister, Khawaja Muhammad Asif, wrote a   Twitter post directed at Israel on Friday after a false report  —   which the minister apparently believed  —   that Israel had threatened Pakistan with nuclear weapons. Both countries have nuclear arsenals. “Israeli def min threatens nuclear retaliation presuming pak role in Syria against Daesh,” the minister wrote on his official Twitter account, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. “Israel forgets Pakistan is a Nuclear state too. ” Mr. Asif appeared to be reacting to a fake news article published on awdnews. com. That story, with the   headline “Israeli Defense Minister: If Pakistan send ground troops to Syria on any pretext, we will destroy this country with a nuclear attack,” appeared on the website on Dec. 20, alongside articles with headlines like “Clinton is staging a military coup against Trump. ” The fake story about Israel even misidentified the country’s defense minister, attributing quotations to a former minister, Moshe Yaalon. Israel’s current minister of defense is Avigdor Lieberman. The Israeli Defense Ministry responded on Twitter to say the report was fictitious. “The statement attributed to fmr Def Min Yaalon re Pakistan was never said,” the ministry wrote in Twitter post directed at Mr. Asif. The Israeli ministry added in a second post: ”Reports referred to by the Pakistani Def Min are entirely false. ” Mr. Asif did not respond to the Israelis on Twitter, and as of Saturday his message had been reposted nearly 400 times. Many of the people reacting to Mr. Asif on Twitter mocked him for his mistake. The proliferation of fake news stories  —   spread on social networks and produced by a variety of sources including pranksters, foreign governments and enterprising individuals who hope to receive advertising revenue by driving traffic to their websites  —   has become an increasingly serious problem. A North Carolina man was arrested on Dec. 4 after firing a gun at a Washington pizza parlor, because investigators said he was investigating claims in fake news articles that the pizzeria was at the center of a child sex slave ring linked to Hillary Clinton.",0
19394,John Bolton: Paris Climate Accord Objective Is ‘Reduction of National Sovereignty’ for ‘Global Governance’,"Former U. N. Ambassador John Bolton spoke to Breitbart News Daily on Thursday about speculation that President Trump will delay his decision to relocate the U. S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem but announce America’s exit from the Paris climate accords. [“I don’t really know one way or the other,” Bolton confessed. “I wish they would move the embassy to Jerusalem. I suspect if they were going to that in the near term, they would have announced it on the president’s trip to the region  —   which was very successful in both its Saudi component and its Israel component. ”  Bolton noted that on the same day the White House is expected to announce the Jerusalem decision, it is also expected to announce withdrawal from the Paris climate accords, a combination he described as “a kind of good   news strategy. ” “I have my fingers crossed that the president will get out of the Paris accords today. We’ll wait and see what happens on that, too,” he said. SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam asked why so many American leaders talk about moving the embassy to Jerusalem but never actually do it. Bolton replied that while there is “strong feeling about moving the embassy” among the general public not just among Jewish Americans, but also among dedicated Christian supporters of Israel, American politicians were given pause by the potential political fallout. He suggested that on the contrary, they should see moving the embassy as a domestic political winner. Another reason the embassy does not get moved is the U. S. State Department’s view that “the status of Jerusalem is a matter for the final negotiations in the creation of a Palestinian state. ” “Therefore, the argument goes, if you do anything to prejudice the outcome of the final status negotiations, you could blow the whole thing up,” he explained. “This is utter nonsense,” he argued. “Number one, the whole premise  —   that is to say, a   solution where a new Palestinian state is created, which we’ve been at now for more than 70 years  —   has proven to be a complete failure. If that’s the premise for the argument about final status, we can dispense with that pretty quickly. ” “I think, even more importantly, just as a practical matter, no one has ever suggested that the U. S. embassy, if it were moved to Jerusalem, would be put in East Jerusalem, which is what the Palestinians claim would be their capital,” he continued. “There has been space made available by the government of Israel in West Jerusalem, west of the ‘green line,’ in territory no one has ever in their wildest dreams claimed would be part of a new Palestinian state. So erecting a U. S embassy there could not conceivably prejudice the final outcome. ” “And then there’s another reason,” he added. “I think when the U. S. decides to have diplomatic relations with a country, it’s between the U. S. and that country alone to determine how they are going to conduct relations. I view this as an analog to dealing with Taiwan, where the mainland Chinese are constantly trying to tell the United States how to behave, and unfortunately, we respond. We don’t allow Taiwanese diplomats into the State Department, if you can believe it, because we don’t want to offend Beijing. I think it’s time for the United States to say, ‘You know, we’re going to conduct U. S. diplomatic relations the way we want, period.’ If that means putting the embassy in Jerusalem, let’s do it. ” Bolton shared Kassam’s dim view of the “hysteria emanating from Europeans” after President Trump’s overseas trip. He noted that the U. S. Embassy in Berlin issued an assessment that German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s negative comments about President Trump were intended to influence domestic politics. “In other words, this does not rise to the cosmic level of affecting the   alliance,” Bolton elaborated. “I remember very well at the beginning of the George W. Bush administration, the Europeans were saying much the same thing: ‘Oh, my God, the United States is going to create a national missile defense system! They’re going to hide behind it! They’re going to go isolation again! They’re going to leave us poor Europeans out here to defend ourselves! ’” “And then President Bush withdrew from the 1972   Missile Treaty so we could create a national defense,” he recalled. “We did withdraw from the International Criminal Court treaty, we unsigned it. We did get out of a hopeless negotiation over an utterly unworkable biological weapons verification protocol. The only thing really we didn’t wrap up was we didn’t unsign the Kyoto Protocol, which we should have done. ” “My point is, it was the same wailing and gnashing of teeth by the Europeans about the end of the   alliance, the decline of American leadership. It wasn’t true then. It’s not true now,” said Bolton. He sized up the Paris climate accord as “an excellent thing to withdraw from. ” “In fundamental terms, it’s basically an utterly meaningless document,” he noted. “Each country involved sets its own targets and then declares its own progress. The world’s two biggest polluters, India and China, don’t even have to begin reducing carbon emissions until 2030. The Europeans have the math rigged in their favor. ”  “The whole thing is a charade, except to this extent: even in effect as toothless as it is, what the Europeans and the Obama administration did when they negotiated the Paris accord was try to take a step forward toward formalizing this global governance structure that they had tried and failed, in the predecessor Kyoto agreement and the predecessor Copenhagen agreement,” Bolton charged.  “Even though it appears toothless in the near term, it sets a foundation that they hope to advance toward a greater multilateral global governance. Forget the environmental aspect for a minute  —   we could be talking about global cooling here, rather than global warming. The advocates of this treaty would propose the same kinds of structures because that’s their larger objective: the reduction of national sovereignty and the pooling of sovereignty as in their favorite institution, their paradigm of the world to come, the European Union,” he warned. “I think it’s important for the United States to say, ‘If you people want to pool sovereignty and reduce your democratic control over governments, which is a very widespread view regarding Brussels and the European Union now, you go right ahead. We’re not going to play any part of it,’” Bolton advised. Kassam amplified Bolton’s point about individual countries playing games with their Paris emission targets by recalling how the French themselves dealt with high   emission targets by simply moving the sensors onto rooftops. “You gotta love the French!” Bolton chuckled. “When they invented the word ‘hypocrisy,’ it came from Paris, and they are great at it, God bless ’em. ” John Bolton is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and head of his own political action committee, BoltonPAC.

19396,At Least 5 Children Die in School Bus Crash in Chattanooga - The New York Times,"CHATTANOOGA, Tenn.  —   At least five children were killed on Monday afternoon when a school bus carrying nearly three dozen elementary school students overturned and crashed into a tree in Chattanooga, according to local officials. About two dozen of the 35 Woodmore Elementary School students on the bus were taken to hospitals here after the accident, which occurred before 3:30 p. m. about a mile from the school, Chief Fred Fletcher of the Chattanooga Police Department said on Monday night. The police arrested the bus driver, Johnthony Walker, 24, on Monday night and charged him with five counts of vehicular homicide, as well as reckless endangerment and reckless driving, the police chief said. “Our thoughts, our prayers and all of our efforts are with the families of these children and others impacted by this tragedy,” said Chief Fletcher, who described the accident as a   crash. Information on the conditions of the children who were taken to hospitals was unavailable. An earlier report from the Hamilton County district attorney general’s office had said at least six children died. Road conditions at the accident site, at Howard Avenue and Talley Road, appeared to be “clear and dry,” Chief Fletcher said. He added that officials were investigating whether speed or alcohol had played a role in the crash. “Certainly speed is being investigated very, very strongly,” he said, noting that the investigation was continuing. The National Transportation Safety Board was sending a team to investigate. Emergency crews worked for hours to remove the children from the bus. Students who were not taken to the hospital walked away “looking dazed with cuts on their faces,” The Chattanooga Times Free Press reported. On Monday night, more than a dozen cars filled the parking lot of Woodmore Elementary School, where school district employees had gathered to prepare the school for a day of grief. Sometime after the accident, a woman went to a nearby store and bought every stuffed animal in stock, about 50. She told employees at Woodmore, where an orange crate of plush Fuzzy Friends sat in the school office after nightfall, that she planned to return with an animal for every student by day’s end on Tuesday. Blood Assurance, a nonprofit regional blood center, extended its hours at three locations in Chattanooga, a city of about 175, 000 in southeastern Tennessee. At 9 p. m. there was still a line out the door at one site. “The response has been enormous,” said Mindy Quinn, a spokeswoman for the center. Representative Chuck Fleischmann, who represents the state’s Third Congressional District, which includes Chattanooga, turned to Twitter to express his condolences to the victims. “I am absolutely heartbroken over this tragedy,” he said, “and I will pray for the children and their families. ”",0
19397,CBS: 800 Churches Nationwide Harbor Illegal Immigrants,"A new report reveals how churches nationwide are harboring illegal immigrants, helping them evade federal immigration orders for deportation. [In a 60 Minutes special report, more than 800 churches are acting as   jurisdictions to hide illegal immigrants from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.  ICE has a   policy in which agents do not detain illegal immigrants at churches, making the facilities an ideal spot to avoid deportation orders. In a Buffalo, New York, church profiled, parish staff confirmed that they recently harbored an illegal alien family of four from Honduras. Since January, the church officials said it protected more than 40 migrants. Rev. Robin Hynicka of Philadelphia’s Arch Street Methodist Church explained how he believes enforcing federal immigration laws are oppressive to illegal immigrants who remain in the U. S. “It’s injustice and oppression, all of which is evil,” Hynicka said. “Yeah, when a human being’s human rights are denied, when they can’t stay with their family, when they can’t work, when they can’t participate in the community in which they have deep roots, all of those apply. ” In one specific case, Hynicka’s church has been harboring Javier Flores Garcia, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who came to the U. S. in 1997. Garcia was arrested and convicted for drunk driving, and despite an immigration judge ordering him be deported, he remains hiding out in Arch Street Methodist Church. ICE’s Deputy Director Daniel Ragsdale did not back down to his agency’s responsibility to enforce federal immigration law and protect Americans, despite  questioning from 60 Minute’s Scott Pelley. Scott Pelley: How much concern do you have about separating families in deportations? Daniel Ragsdale: As a human being, I know it is traumatic for folks. But I will also say that the Rule of Law is something that America is built on. But this seems to be the one area where the narrative about separating families, you know, sort of gets a little bit ratcheted up. Scott Pelley: Well, you can understand why. Daniel Ragsdale: Well, I can. But I would suggest that every person who has, you know, come to the United States illegally, just like if I went somewhere and, you know, resided in violation of law, I could expect at some point that sovereign country to want to remove me. Last month, Attorney General Jeff Sessions sent a letter to 10 sanctuary cities, demanding they stop obstructing federal immigration agents from being able to deport criminal illegal immigrants. Sessions said that if sanctuary cities do not eventually comply with federal law, they could see a loss in federal grant money. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart Texas.

19399,"New Wikileaks emails: Bernie is a Jerk, Megyn Kelly a Bimbo and More","
WikiLeaks has published its 33rd tranche of emails from the hacked account of Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign chairman, John Podesta.
The whistleblowing organization has now published more than 55,600 emails in a series of daily online releases which it said were building towards the November 8 presidential election.
Emails released Sunday included messages accusing Chelsea Clinton of using Clinton Foundation funds for her wedding as well as leaked transcripts of Bill Clintonâ€™s fundraising speeches.
WikiLeaks has claimed its email publishing servers suffered a sustained DoS attack after it released #DNCLeak2 over the weekend.
THERE ARE 2 ADDITIONAL LEAKS ADDED TO THIS STORY COMPARED TO THE STANDARD RT STORY. THEY ARE AT THE BOTTOM.
Goldman Sachs speeches 
In an email from January 23, 2016 Clinton Research Director Tony Carrk quoted the Democratic presidential nominee apparently expressing little appetite for prosecuting rogue Wall Street bankers.
In the mail to Clinton campaign Director of Communications Jennifer Palmieri, Press Secretary Brian Fallon and Podesta, Carrk said he was sending excerpts from Clintonâ€™s Goldman Sachs speeches.
â€œI’m not interested in, you know, turning the clock back or pointing fingers,â€ Clinton is reported to have told Tim Oâ€™Neill, formerly of SJU Wall Street Trading Room and Credit Suisse, following a paid speech.
Clinton apparently then went on to recommend that the financial sector take a leading role in setting out regulations for their own troubled industry: â€œThe people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry. There’s nothing magic about regulations, too much is bad, too little is bad.â€
Less than one year earlier, Democratic media adviser Mandy Grunwald suggested to Podesta in another communication leaked Monday that Clinton should take a conciliatory tone with regard to Wall Street.
â€œI would include something from the Maggie Haberman piece on HRC’s Goldman Sachs speech,â€ writes Grunwald.
â€œSomething like, “When HRC recently spoke to bankers at Goldman Sachs, instead of holding them accountable for their activities that crashed the economy, she told them that banker bashing was foolish and had to stop. She said “soothing” that we all got into our economic problems together.”
â€˜Illegal ivoryâ€™ as leverage on China 
Hillary Clinton directed her now-campaign chair Podesta to use reports of illegal elephant tusk smuggling by Chinese government officials as â€œleverageâ€ during a 2014 White House visit to the nation.
Three days before President Obamaâ€™s visit to Beijing in November 2014, the former secretary of state highlighted a NY Times article on how Chinese delegates reportedly smuggled home poached ivory from Tanzania.
A message from Clintonâ€™s hrod17@clintonemail.com opens by praising Podestaâ€™s â€œteasingâ€ of reporters and â€œflashesâ€ of a smile at a recent press conference before asking the then-White House adviser to raise the ivory story with Chinaâ€™s president directly.
â€œOn China, I know youâ€™ll be in Beijing next week, so am sending a news report about how Xiâ€™s official party on its visit to Tanzania loaded up their planes w poached ivory, likely w full knowledge of [President Jakaya] Kikweteâ€™s government,â€ Clinton writes.
â€œPlease raise this issue directly w XI, both because it is critical on the merits but also because it’s another way you can gain some leverage with the Chinese.â€
The email subject line was, â€œBelow is what I sent POTUS on election and China poaching.â€
A â€˜fact sheetâ€™ provided by the White House regarding Obamaâ€™s visit shows discussions centered on the ebola crisis, economic relations, and a â€œshared vision for Afghanistan.â€ An effort to work together to â€œstop the trade in illegal wildlife productsâ€ is also mentioned.
Clinton â€˜totally blewâ€™ crime question 
New York Mayor Bill de Blasio thought Clinton â€œtotally blewâ€ a debate question about her support for a controversial federal crime bill passed by her husband.
In a March 2016 email , de Blasio was less than impressed with Clintonâ€™s attempt to pass off a question on mass incarceration to her Democratic rival Bernie Sanders back in March.
â€œHillary was fantastic on the gun control answer, then totally blew the mass incarceration question,â€ de Blasio wrote to Podesta.
The question was posed during a live CNN debate by anchor Don Lemon, who asked Clinton why black people should trust her to end a pattern of mass incarceration when she supported a 1994 law which many blame for â€œlocking up a generation of black men.â€
Clinton began her answer by reminding people that Sanders also supported the bill, a tactic which appears to have irked Mayor de Blasio.
â€œWhy on Earth did she say â€˜Are you going to ask Senator Sanders that question?â€™ instead of just addressing the issue,â€ de Blasio wrote.
â€œWhen she makes it about her, she loses the high ground. Stating the obvious, I know, but she keeps doing itâ€Śâ€
Podesta brothers plan to influence India on NGO clampdown 
Podesta sought to enlist the help of his lobbyist brother to influence an Indian Intelligence Bureau crackdown on Greenpeace and a key donor, the Ford Foundation, Mondayâ€™s leaked emails reveal.
Correspondence between John and Tony Podesta from May 2015 show the pair planned a lunch with the Indian ambassador to discuss a â€œvery serious situationâ€ facing Greenpeace in which the Indian government accused the group of financial irregularities. The claims eventually led to the cancellation of its license to operate there.
The bid to influence Indiaâ€™s decision-making came at the request of Karen Sack, managing director of conservation group Ocean Unite, who asked if John Podesta could get in touch with his brother at The Podesta Group.
â€œApparently The Podesta Group has the contract for the Republic of India in the US, but Kumi [Naidoo, Greenpeace executive director] has no way to reach Tony or another principal,â€ Sack writes.
John Podesta forwarded the â€œsmall requestâ€ to his brother, highlighting Kumi Naidooâ€™s large following globally.
â€œWant to talk to the head of Greenpeace? Kumi Naidoo is a very well known South African with a big international following, but I think the GOI [Government of India] likely to stick it to them.â€
He also explained he was trying to use his influence to help the Ford Foundation charity, which had similarly â€œgot on the wrong side of GOIâ€. However, he expressed a belief that their issue â€œcan be more easily resolved.â€
A reply from Tony Podesta proposes a lunch with an Indian ambassador as well as confirmation he would be â€œhappyâ€ to talk to Greenpeace.
A leaked July 2015 email about funding shows Podesta describing global charity the Ford Foundation as a â€œ mainstay â€ for the Center for American Progress think-tank, which he founded in 2003.
Clintonâ€™s emails could â€˜either win 49 states, or lose 49 statesâ€™ 
As previously reported , in March of 2015, Clintonâ€™s camp were debating whether Hillary should make a joke about her â€œemail situationâ€.
Staffers were â€œnervousâ€ about the â€œpotentially nutsâ€ move and, in freshly leaked correspondence, sought advice from Philippe Reines â€“ a former senior adviser from Clintonâ€™s days as Secretary of State and someone who was likely privy to the contents of said emails.
â€œTrust me, most of the email themselves are funnier than any joke we can come up with. Read in total by America she would either win 49 states, or lose 49 states. I go back and forth,â€ said Reines.
â€œBut I would not make a joke just for the sake of making a joke, because email retention = Benghazi,â€ he warned.
â€œWe canâ€™t jam State to release them at this point, but if Dan [Schwerin, Clintonâ€™s speech writer] can think of a light way to say â€œI am proud of the work we did at State and hopefully at some point everyone will be able to read whatâ€™s in them as a way to better understand that workâ€Śâ€ Reines suggested.
Bernie Sanders is a Jerk 
We have previously reported about the agreement between Bernie Sanders and Clinton Campaign. We have also previously reported about Hillary’s others insults about Bernie’s supporters: basement-dwellers, bucket of losers, stupid millennials, etc. but now here’s another one.
This email is part of the DNC Leaks not of Podesta. DNC insider Hilary Rosen was caught emailing Jon Reinish and telling him that “Bernie Sanders is a petty jerk”: yes, she has a statement coming out. he is a petty jerk
Trump is right, Megyn Kelly is a Bimbo 
Another DNC Leak email says that Donald Trump is right about Megyn Kelly. Yes she is a BIMBO! Well well well but you freaks of nature were saying Trump is a sexist for saying that. Then that means you too are sexists you Democrat liars.

19400,"What Muslims Do on Hajj, and Why - The New York Times","JIDDA, Saudi Arabia  —   It is incumbent upon every   Muslim who can afford to do so to travel to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, Islam’s holiest site, at least once in his or her lifetime. The annual pilgrimage is known as the hajj, and it is one of the five pillars of Islam, prescribed in the Quran: This year, 1437 according to the Islamic calendar, I am making my first hajj. I will be joining two million Muslims from around the world  —   though the writer Abu Muneer Ismail Davids joked that it may feel more like 10 million people. During the hajj, we must not swear, cut our hair or nails, have sex or crush a plant. I will be chronicling my journey for The New York Times and on social media. To better follow along, here’s a glossary of terms, names and places that help explain the rites and rituals Muslims will participate in during the six days of the hajj, which begins Saturday. Ibrahim, the prophet who, following God’s commandment, left his wife, Hajar, and their son Ismail in the Arabian desert. (I am using the Islamic spellings for these figures, who also appear in the   Bible as Abraham, Hagar and Ishmael.) It is with Ibrahim that one of the stories of the origin of Islam begins. For Muslims, like Jews, he is considered a patriarch of our faith. Hajar  was Ibrahim’s second wife. After she and Ismail were left in the desert, Hajar ran seven times between two hills, Safa and Marwa, searching for water for her thirsty son. Ismail is said to have kicked his leg in the sand, causing water to trickle out. This became the spring of Zamzam, from which we’ll drink during the hajj. Ismail is considered the ancestor of the Arabs. He was reunited with his father after many years when Ibrahim returned to the desert. Ismail is said to have helped his father build a temple, called the Kaaba, or cube, to honor his one God. To test Ibrahim’s faith, God commanded him to sacrifice Ismail. Three times the devil tried to tempt Ibrahim to abandon his mission, and each time Ibrahim hurled seven stones at the devil to ward him off. We’ll   the stone throwing during the hajj. As the Quranic story goes, God replaced Ismail with a ram, which was slaughtered instead. Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, made the hajj with his followers and wives in 632 A. D. Muslim pilgrims imitate what the Prophet Muhammad did on his journey, which is also called the “farewell pilgrimage. ” The Kaaba, which is also known as Bait Allah, or the House of Allah, is in the Grand Mosque of Mecca. It houses     or black stone, which is believed to have descended from paradise whiter than the color of milk, but was later stained by the sins of humans. At the start of the hajj, pilgrims dressed in white circle the Kaaba seven times, trying to kiss the black stone. This is one of the most iconic images of the hajj and is known as the tawaf. Safa and Marwa, the two hills where Hajar searched for water, are now part of the Grand Mosque that includes the Kaaba. On the first day of the hajj, pilgrims will honor Hajar by walking seven times between the sites of the two hills, though our journey will be more comfortable than her trek: the   walkways between Safa and Marwa are  . Pilgrims will also drink water from the spring of Zamzam from taps installed in the mosque and sleep in an enormous tent city built three miles east of Mecca in Mina, where Ibrahim was to have sacrificed Ismail. Mount of Arafat, southeast of Mina, is where Muhammad delivered his final sermon on the first Muslim hajj, and it is the commemoration of this event on the ninth day of the Islamic month of    —   the Day of Arafat  —   that is the indispensable part of the hajj. All two million pilgrims are to visit Arafat on the second day of the hajj, before traveling to Muzdalifah, on the way to Mina, to pray and sleep. Meqaat is the entire area in and around Mecca that includes the holy sites of the hajj. Muslims entering the meqaat are required to announce their intention to participate in the pilgrimage. Flights carrying Muslims to Saudi Arabia for the hajj announce when the plane is approaching the meqaat so that passengers can make their intentions known. Men chant loudly, “Here I am, oh Lord, here I am,” and women repeat this phrase audibly, but in a low voice. Jamarat is a ritual that commemorates Ibrahim fending off temptation from the devil. On the third day of the hajj, pilgrims throw stones at three pillars near Jamarat Bridge that are meant to symbolize the devil’s efforts to derail Ibrahim on his way to Mina to sacrifice Ismail. The ritual stoning is repeated daily for three days before pilgrims return to Mecca to circle the Kaaba one last time. Jamarat is a notorious choke point for hajj crowds. It was during the Jamarat ritual last year that hundreds, maybe thousands, of pilgrims died in a crush of people. Hadi is the ritualistic slaughter of a sheep, cow, goat or camel to commemorate Ibrahim’s sacrifice of the ram. Muslims are forbidden from slaughtering animals during the hajj until after the Day of Arafat, when it their duty to do so. Modern pilgrims usually appoint a slaughterhouse near Mecca to do this for them. Ihram is the traditional dress that men wear during the hajj and consists of two sheets of white fabric. Women dress modestly, and must cover their hair and body. Once the hajj is over, men are expected to shave their heads, and women are expected to snip a piece of hair.",0
19401,"For Commerce Pick Wilbur Ross, ‘Inherently Bad’ Deals Paid Off - The New York Times","MEXICO CITY  —   With a panel of senators questioning him, the billionaire investor Wilbur L. Ross stayed on message: If confirmed as President Trump’s commerce secretary, he would protect American workers and tear up bad trade deals that harmed American industry. And yet, for more than a decade, those same trade deals helped Mr. Ross amass a fortune across the globe  —   in countries like Mexico and China, among others. In fact, Mr. Ross has sometimes invested overseas in ways that Mr. Trump condemns. As the head of an auto parts company, Mr. Ross shipped jobs to Mexico, taking advantage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he now says is unfair and must be renegotiated. That company, along with a textile firm he founded, publicly stated that Mexico was central to their growth. To some of his former associates, that history clangs against the persistent message of Mr. Trump, who has called Nafta “the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country” and has excoriated American businesses for sending jobs overseas. But a spokesman for Mr. Ross described his experience as an asset, not a contradiction. “As a private businessman, Mr. Ross made pragmatic decisions based on the rules of the road at the time  and it is precisely his knowledge of how trade deals work that will allow him to be successful in renegotiating bad deals like Nafta,” said the spokesman, James Rockas. The Senate is scheduled to vote on Mr. Ross’s confirmation on Monday. Mr. Ross’s flexible approach to trade is characteristic of many private equity barons focused on the bottom line, his former associates say. After taking over two bankrupt American textile makers more than a decade ago, for instance, Mr. Ross paid a visit to an executive of J. C. Penney Company. The industry was in turmoil, and Mr. Ross needed advice. Fellow mill owners, largely concentrated in the American Southeast, were blaming free trade for destroying their livelihoods. Many felt that sending jobs overseas, even for survival, was tantamount to treason. But for Mr. Ross, who made his name fixing bankrupt companies across a variety of American industries, hiring workers abroad made sense, former associates say. So Mr. Ross inquired about opening a mill with hundreds of workers  —   not in the United States, but in Vietnam. “He struck me as very practical about trade,” recounted Peter McGrath, the former head of product development for J. C. Penney, who offered Mr. Ross advice. “He was on a different part of the curve than a lot of his competitors. ” Just over a year later, in 2006, Mr. Ross announced plans to open an $80 million     cotton plant in Vietnam that would employ 1, 500 workers. It was one of many business decisions Mr. Ross made over the years that seemed to depart from Mr. Trump’s stance against   deals and the migration of jobs overseas. “I don’t think he is a devious person,” Jock Nash, a retired lobbyist for Milliken  Company, a textile manufacturer, said of Mr. Ross. “Anybody that knows how to make money is opportunistic  —   and they have to be to make money. ” Having been tapped by Mr. Trump to lead the charge on America’s worldwide trade relationships, Mr. Ross, 79, has adapted once more. In his new role, if confirmed, he will be tasked with increasing American exports to help create jobs in America. First and foremost, he told members of Congress, he would focus on Nafta. “We cannot afford trade that is inherently bad for American workers and for American businesses,” Mr. Ross said during his testimony. His measured comments have taken a back seat to Mr. Trump’s more vocal broadsides against the auto industry for its investments in Mexico, often via Twitter. Mr. Ross has argued that investment in Mexico hurts American economic growth, bolstering the Mexican economy while reducing investment in the United States. But Mr. Ross has made extensive investments in the auto industry south of the American border. His entry into Mexico began in 2007, a year after he began buying up the global assets of struggling American auto parts makers. He combined them into International Automotive Components, a supplier of auto interiors with factories around the world, including in Mexico and China. Sales in 2015 reached $5. 9 billion. Nearly a decade ago, when his company announced the purchase of a plant in Hermosillo, Mexico, adding $300 million in sales and 1, 700 employees to its payroll, Mr. Ross said the deal “demonstrates our commitment to expansion in   countries. ” Eight years later, just before Mr. Trump began his presidential campaign, the company inaugurated a brand new plant, its eighth operation in Mexico. By then, Mr. Ross’s company had completed expansions at three other plants in Mexico. The future there looked bright: His company cited a forecast that Mexico would account for 25 percent of the world’s growth in auto production. Mr. Ross acknowledged in the hearing that he had moved “a couple of hundred” jobs to Mexico, saying an automaker had demanded the shift. But he began transferring work to Mexico in the early days of his business. When Mr. Ross acquired an auto parts factory in Carlisle, Pa. a decade ago, he took a hard line with the union, demanding cuts in wages and benefits worth between a quarter and 30 percent of workers’ earnings, according to Doug Carey, who was the president of Local 1739 of   which represented many of the workers. When the union rejected the demand, Mr. Ross shut the plant down, moving the work to North Carolina, Canada and Mexico, Mr. Carey said. “Wilbur Ross  —   there’s no way he cares about the worker,” said Stacey Foltz, who worked at the plant for 10 years. “He made billions of dollars taking jobs out of the country. ” In other cases, even when a plant stayed open, Mr. Ross transferred production to Mexico. In 2007, after Mr. Ross acquired 11 plants from Lear Corporation that were represented by the United Automobile Workers, their bargaining committees flew to Detroit to meet him. Over lunch, they said, they listened to his pitch for turning the company around, which involved cuts to their salaries and benefits. “All the U. A. W. plants gave concessions,” said Richie Franklin, the bargaining chairman for Local 2999 in Strasburg, Va. “It was a tough pill to swallow. ” Though grateful to Mr. Ross for turning the company around, Mr. Franklin was frustrated to see jobs vanish. Two years after the workers agreed to the cuts, Mr. Ross’s company moved the production of consoles for General Motors trucks to Mexico, leaving 110 people out of work. “They just did it, and there was nothing we could do,” Mr. Franklin said. In the world of textiles, Mr. Ross used a playbook developed over years. He scoured for companies in distress. Before long, he purchased two textile makers in North Carolina: Cone Mills and Burlington Mills. At the time, the industry was in upheaval. Textile and clothing manufacturers were bleeding money and jobs. Cheaper wages in Asia brought a surge of imports that helped wipe out nearly   of the industry, experts say. Finding a way forward for Mr. Ross’s company, the International Textile Group, would require cheap labor in Mexico and elsewhere. “I think he was one who recognized that Burlington wouldn’t survive without that kind of diversification of production,” said Patrick Conway, an economics professor at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. “It is the same juxtaposition you would see with Trump hiring foreign workers for his casinos while talking about building a wall. ” “It is a compartmentalization of the businessman’s mind,” he added. Mr. Ross began lobbying for another trade deal, one that would essentially incorporate Central America into a   zone like Nafta. According to people familiar with the negotiations, he became one of the biggest proponents of the Central American Free Trade Agreement, or Cafta. He became a mediator of sorts between textile makers like himself and retailers like Walmart and J. C. Penney, whose priority was giving consumers low prices, not using American fabrics. While Cafta has failed to prevent an onslaught of Chinese imported goods, Mexico remains a crucial element of the company Mr. Ross built.   of the International Textile Group’s revenue is generated by two factories in Mexico, and in its 2015 annual report, published when Mr. Ross was still in charge, the company was clear where the future lay  —   not in the United States, but in Mexico and China. “I. T. G. ’s   focus includes realizing the benefits of its global expansion, including reaching full production at the company’s facilities in China,” the company said in its report. As for Mexico, the report stated that because the company was a “resident, diversified textile product manufacturer in Mexico,” it “believes that Nafta is generally advantageous. ” Mr. Ross sold the International Textile Group in October to another private equity firm. For all the choices Mr. Ross made to open factories abroad or lay people off domestically, most who knew him during that era say he was not a heartless Wall Street tycoon. He kept jobs where he could in the United States, including in Greensboro, N. C. where the company maintains a denim mill. Bruce Raynor, a former union leader in the textile and auto parts industries, said Mr. Ross was not   as many of his Wall Street contemporaries were. Over the years, Mr. Raynor sat across the table from Mr. Ross on numerous occasions, whether negotiating contracts for textile workers or for auto parts workers. “It was a low bar to be a decent guy, but as a distressed investor, you buy things that are not doing well,” said Mr. Raynor, who now runs a consulting business. “By definition, if you represent workers, and this is a company in trouble, it’s not like those transactions are fun. ” “Wilbur was always very decent to work with,” he added. “You can’t say that about too many of these guys. ” Perhaps most telling, he said, was the investment Mr. Ross made in the Amalgamated Bank, a nearly    institution founded by the nation’s unions. In the depths of the financial crisis, Mr. Raynor asked Mr. Ross for a bailout. Having worked with Mr. Ross for years, he asked whether the businessman would be interested in making an investment of $50 million, the largest the bank would allow. After months of due diligence, the deal went through, Mr. Raynor said, which he believes was a testament to Mr. Ross’s decency  —   not greed. He said Mr. Ross could have made more lucrative investments, but opted instead to help the unions. “‘I want to make money, but I’m not under any illusions and I’m not in a hurry,’” he said Mr. Ross had told him.",0
19402,Russia Warns US Is Now A Colour Revolution “Active Zone” Due To Trump Victory,"
A grim new Ministry of Defense ( MoD ) report circulating in the Kremlin today states that intelligence analysts of the System of Forward-looking Military Research and Development ( SFLMRD ) have now placed the United States in the “ active zone ” of nations currently undergoing a “ Colour Revolution ” as both US and EU elites have united to topple the soon to come government of President-elect Donald Trump. [ Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]
According to this report, SFLMRD intelligence analysts are tasked with using “ modern/sophisticated ” technologies to ensure and protect the Federation’s national security interests—and of which the MoD has previously identified “ Colour Revolutions ” as being one of the gravest threats, not only to Russia, but the entire world.
During the MoD’s 2014 meeting of the Moscow Conference on International Security , this report explains, Federation military commanders labeled “ Colour Revolutions ” as a new US and European approach to warfare that focuses on creating destabilizing revolutions in other nations as a means of serving their security interests at low cost and with minimal casualties .
The some of first of these Western “ Colour Revolutions ” to be unleashed on an unsuspecting world, this report continues, was in 2003 when the legitimately elected democratic government of Georgia was overthrown in what was called the “ Rose Revolution ”—and that turned this once peaceful nation into a Western military puppet who, in 2008, launched an unprovoked attack against the Federation , but that was quickly and decisively defeated.
Next to be attacked by a Western “ Colour Revolution ”, this report notes, was Ukraine, in 2004, who’s “ Orange Revolution ” resulted in the 2014 overthrow of that nations legitimately elected government in what the powerful American private intelligence agency Stratfor (aka The Shadow CIA ) called “ the most blatant coup in history ”—and like Georgia before it, has, likewise, been used by the West as a military puppet against the Federation .
In 2005, this report continues, the West then launched a “ Colour Revolution ” against Kyrgyzstan called the “ Tulip Revolution ”—but that ultimately failed leading that nation, in 2014, to expel the US military from its territory .
Once the subversive tactics of the West in their using their “ Colour Revolutions ” against other nations was “ deciphered/discovered ”, this report says, both Iran (2009-“ Green Revolution ”) and Russia (2011-“ White (Snow) Revolution ”) were able to be stop them from being successful and causing great loss of life.
To exactly how the West “ engineered/manipulated ” their “ Colour Revolutions ”, this report explains, was through the use of what are called non-governmental organizations ( NGO’s ) using very innocuous sounding names that the United States and European Union would secretly funnel millions-of-dollars into for the purpose of fermenting rebellion—and which, in 2015, President Putin signed a law against preventing their nefarious actions in the Federation .
Heading nearly all of these Western backed and financed “ Colour Revolution ” NGO’s, this report details, is the Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros —who has not only fomented rebellions across the world costing thousands of innocent lives, he was, also, recently exposed as being Hillary Clinton’s puppetmaster controlling all of her actions during her failed bid to become the US president .
Unlike the Federation that has protected itself against a George Soros led, and US-EU funded, NGO “ Colour Revolution ”, this report grimly warns, the United States government has now become the most vulnerable nation in the world to this type of “ rebellion/warfare ” as he funds hundreds of organizations violently opposed to both America and that nations core moral values .
And immediately upon Donald Trump being elected as the 45 th President of the United States, this report states, these George Soros funded NGO’s launched their newest “ Colour Revolution ” intended not only to destroy President Trump, but the entirety of America.
Led by the George Soros funded MoveOn.org NGO , this report continues, this new “ Colour Revolution ” striking American began with tens-of-thousands of protesters striking nearly all of the United States largest cities —and that was quickly followed with thousands of these revolutionaries calling for the assassination of President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence before they can take office .
To the main “ purpose/reason ” behind these protests, this report explains, is to initiate a “ brutal/violent ” response from US government forces seeking to suppress them and reestablish order—which in turn these revolutionaries will use as an example of how the American government is no longer legitimate because it’s killing innocent people, and, therefore, must be overthrown.
Not being understood by the American people about how these “ Colour Revolutions ” work, this report continues, is that they are intended to last for years—like in Ukraine that took a full 10 years before that government was overthrown.
To the most basic reason why this “ Colour Revolution ” is now targeting the United States, this report details, are the US-EU elites fear of President-elect Donald Trump whose choice of nationalism over globalism has left European leftist leaders in “ complete horror ” as the populace revolution he, Trump, is leading is soon to wash ashore in Europe as new elections for nearly all of the continent are nearing—with Holland being the first fall , and France soon to follow , and whose next leader, Marine Le Pen , just proclaimed: “ Congratulations to the new President of the US, Donald Trump, and the American people – free! ”
With the US propaganda mainstream media still in denial of what has happened to them because of President-elect Donald Trump’s victory, and Google now reporting that their top search term is “ How did Donald Trump win? ” , this report further states, it bears notice that the Kremlin and its intelligence analysts were among the only entities in the world who correctly stated Donald Trump would win—and as we had detailed in numerous reports, including Russia Confirms Supercomputer Findings Showing Donald Trump Landslide Victory and Russian Report Warns: American Revolution Has Now Begun, May Last Entire Decade .
But to the most global consequential outcome of Donald Trump becoming the 45 th President of the United States, this report concludes, (and as we had previously alerted you to on 13 May in our report Putin Warns Military Commanders: “If It’s Hillary Clinton, It’s War” ) was President Putin’s advisor Sergei Glaziev stating just hours ago how close to catastrophe our world actually was: “ Americans had two choices: World War III or multilateral peace. Clinton was a symbol of war, and Trump has a chance to change this course .”
Let’s all hope President Trump can, indeed, change this course because the world, literally, now hangs in the balance if he doesn’t.

19403,The Best TV Shows of 2016 - The New York Times,"  lists are stories: They tell the truth by lying. The idea that a critic can watch all the television there is today, let alone isolate the 10 best works among wildly different genres, is a fiction. But play along with it, and you tell a larger tale about what mattered that year and why. To whittle this story down to 10 titles required some little cheats. I left out ESPN’s revelatory documentary “O. J.: Made in America” because this publication reviewed it as a film. “Halt and Catch Fire” is as terrific as when I included it in 2015 I bumped it this year to make room. (Yet I repeated “The Americans,” “Transparent” and “Rectify. ” Life is unfair.) I didn’t number my list. (The best show of the year, if you’re asking, was “Atlanta,” but beyond that the order would have been arbitrary.) An improved “Better Call Saul” barely missed the cut, as did the best season of “Girls” since its first. There are series I couldn’t quite justify putting on this list but were crazy entertaining, like “Stranger Things. ” What remains is a sampler of TV as dizzying and agitated as the year we’ve just lived through. We live in interesting times, and we also get to watch them.  —   JAMES PONIEWOZIK ‘THE AMERICANS’ (FX) The direct heir to “Breaking Bad” may be “Better Call Saul,” but this 1980s spy drama also has a claim to that legacy. It uses a story of double lives (  Soviet spies) to create a sense of impending doom, with the added twist that its married protagonists are acting out of idealism, however misguided, not greed or bitterness. It’s a   view of a Cold War chess match that has deep sympathy for the pawns. ‘ATLANTA’ (FX) For a series about people bumping up against limitations  —   a midlevel   star and his   manager  —   Donald Glover’s comedy was limitless in its possibilities. Sliding from grit to surrealism, from pawnshops to mansions, “Atlanta” created a diorama of   life in its title city and a testament to the weirdness of existence. ‘BOJACK HORSEMAN’ (Netflix) The third season of this animated comedy follows the title character, a     horse voiced by Will Arnett, on the awards circuit for his new biopic, “Secretariat. ” That journey, including a    episode set at an underwater film festival, frames a hallucinatory but heartfelt story of one horse’s search for  . ‘CRAZY  ’ (CW) In a great year for complicated women on TV  —   “Fleabag,” “Lady Dynamite,” “Better Things”  —   this raunchy,   musical did handsprings down the line between infatuated and insane. The   Rachel Bloom started with a premise of lovestruck obsession, added lyrically gymnastic songs (“J. A. P. Battle,” “The Math of Love Triangles”) and dismantled romantic myths while using them as fuel. ‘FULL FRONTAL WITH SAMANTHA BEE’  (TBS) If we judge political comedy by its results  —   and god help us if we do  —   “Full Frontal” has no place here the “screaming carrot demon” (to use one of Ms. Bee’s more printable insults for Donald J. Trump) won the election anyway. But comedically, “Full Frontal” arrived fully formed and furious, establishing an outrageous voice  —   shocking even within the constraints of   language  —   and an outraged sense of purpose. ‘HIGH MAINTENANCE’ (HBO) Along with “Black Mirror” and “Documentary Now!” (both of which nearly made this list) and Netflix’s uneven but adventurous “Easy,” this itinerant comedy of a Brooklyn pot dealer and his clients marked a creative resurgence of anthology TV. A move from the web to premium cable gave “High Maintenance” a production upgrade, but its humane curiosity remains pure and uncut. ‘HORACE AND PETE’ (louisck. net) Louis C. K. released his barroom drama without warning, and it unfolded like a crawl through a dark attic full of musty crates and family secrets. It seemed to exist outside of time, pouring one out for angsty 2016 within the walls of a    dive bar, using   distribution to recall the crackling immediacy of early theatrical television. ‘THE PEOPLE V. O. J. SIMPSON: AMERICAN CRIME STORY’ (FX) With crackling scripts and criminally strong performances, this   made a   story feel new again. Not only did it speak to America’s ongoing racial tensions, but it also ended up foreshadowing an election whose result  —   like the Simpson verdict  —   exposed a country whose two halves saw reality entirely differently. ‘RECTIFY’ (Sundance) Beginning with an  ’s return to his   home, “Rectify” expanded over four seasons into a story of forgotten people  —   in halfway houses, nursing homes,   stores  —   trying to make peace with the unfairnesses of the past and find faith for the future. Its final season had two more episodes yet to air when I finalized this list, but I couldn’t leave it off. Miracles must be witnessed. ‘TRANSPARENT’  (Amazon) You could easily label the story of transgender senior citizen Maura Pfefferman (Jeffrey Tambor) and her extended family as insular   TV. In fact it’s a deeply empathetic show that lets every character  —   from fundamentalist Christians to Jewish radical feminists  —   be flawed and complicated. Messy, diffuse and   it’s like a hippie prayer circle where every congregant gets a turn. Not that long ago, making a list of the best international shows on American television would have been as easy, and pointless, as reprinting the PBS “Masterpiece” schedule. That handful of British imports was essentially the only foreign programming available. But like everything else in TV, that’s changed. My initial list for this first international Top 10 contained more than 80 shows, and that was a small slice of the foreign series available on TV or streaming services in 2016. A few notes. Five of the 11 shows on the list are British comedies. That might seem excessive, but it reflects my feeling that some of the best, most imaginative work in the world is being done in that place and genre. (Also the most energetic. American sitcoms are at a peak, too, but the best ones tend to have a muted, distressed energy  —   the sheer vitality of the Britcoms can be a welcome relief.) There’s also an overall   and Eurocentrism to the list. That’s partly because American programmers still overwhelmingly favor   shows, though streaming services do make a wealth of   series available. So why no Korean or Chinese dramas, for instance? Because as attractive as some of them are, I still can’t reconcile myself to the saccharine and melodramatic formulas that seem to be mandatory in their original markets. Finally, five of the 11 entries were first shown in the United States by Netflix. Whether it’s a matter of taste or of aggressiveness and large acquisition budgets, no one matches Netflix in the breadth and quality of its international offerings, beginning with my No. 1 show.  —   MIKE HALE 1. ‘HAPPY VALLEY’ Britain (Netflix) The writer Sally Wainwright started out in soap opera and domestic drama before shifting into crime, and “Happy Valley” is both a tough, sometimes harrowing cop show and a meticulous, emotionally charged portrait of a community. Season 2 picked up the story of a gruff, weary uniformed officer (the terrific Sarah Lancashire) and her nemesis (James Norton) and found believably frightening and moving ways to extend it. 2. ‘DETECTORISTS’ Britain (Acorn) Mackenzie Crook’s melancholy comedy about the minor triumphs of a pair of friends who share a passion for metal detecting is the most delicate of shows  —   it feels as if it might float away while you’re watching it. In its second season, Mr. Crook and especially Toby Jones continued their marvelous work as   who, most of the time, mask their frustration and rage in hilariously ineffectual diffidence. 3. ‘GOMORRAH’ Italy (SundanceTV) The first season of this series, a traditional Mafia saga set in   Naples, was an addictive blend of speed, tension, desolate atmosphere and stark violence. While it raided the histories of both Italian and American film and gangster mythology for its look and style, it felt distinctly European, with an operatic realism unlike anything on American TV. 4. ‘CHEWING GUM’ Britain (Netflix) The playwright and actress Michaela Coel created and starred in this raucous, filthy, wildly inventive comedy about a young woman in the London projects whose sexual curiosity is in dire conflict with her Pentecostal upbringing. Ms. Coel’s performance as a nerdy wallflower bursting out of repression is matched by those of Susan Wokoma as her angrily devout sister and John Macmillan as her supercilious and curiously asexual boyfriend. 5. ‘CASE’ Iceland (Netflix) This smart and   example of Nordic noir  —   a reboot of an earlier Icelandic series, “Rettur”  —   begins with the apparent suicide of a young dancer. Then it slowly expands into a repellent panorama of exploitation, in which young women are taken advantage of by parents (foster and biological) pimps, lawyers, youth counselors, hackers, classmates, ballet teachers, fellow dancers and just about anyone else you can think of. Magnus Jonsson and Steinunn Olina Thorsteinsdottir, as an alcoholic lawyer and a dour detective, make an art of moody inexpressiveness. 6. ‘FLEABAG’ AND ‘CRASHING’ Britain (Amazon, Netflix) Phoebe   created, wrote and starred in both of these     comedies this year, an impressive achievement. “Fleabag,” about a   often nasty but   young woman negotiating sex, love and family bonds, is the darker and more inventive of the two. “Crashing,” about the   lives of a group of squatters in an abandoned hospital, is a more conventional sitcom. But both are sharp, funny and furiously up to date. 7. ‘MY HERO ACADEMIA’ Japan (Funimation) In the   category of Japanese anime, this shrewdly written and dynamically drawn series posits a world in which 80 percent of humanity has developed some sort of special powers (not all of them super, and not all used for good). But it focuses on a fanboy who obsessively follows the new costumed heroes while having no abilities of his own  —   a perfect   for the anime and manga audience. 8. ‘GLITCH’ Australia (Netflix) Dead people begin to claw out of their graves in a rural Australian town in this series that recalls the French show “The Returned,” but without the     veneer. It’s a solid, straightforward paranormal mystery that left plenty of unanswered questions for its second season (already announced as a Netflix coproduction). 9. ‘IN THE LINE OF DUTY’ Britain (Hulu) Season 3 of this cop drama about an   unit (the equivalent of an American   squad) in the West Midlands may have been slightly below the level of the taut,   previous seasons. But it’s still the closest current analogue for the unadorned procedural pleasures of the early “Law  Order. ” 10. ‘CATASTROPHE’ Britain (Amazon) Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney took their dark comedy of unexpected,     romance into new territory in a second season focused on the inevitable strains of parenthood. The writing wasn’t as seamless this time around  —   there were times when it felt as if the two were trying out   routines on each other  —   but the best bits were still corrosively funny. Who has benefited most from the explosion of television offerings in the last decade or so? I would argue that it has been people whose tastes in humor run toward the bizarre, the scathing and the incongruous. Television had long decades when “out there” meant “My Mother the Car” or “Rowan  Martin’s  . ” Eventually shows like “The Simpsons” began pushing matters of taste, and now, with entire channels and streaming services devoted to outlandish comedy, there are shows unpredictable enough, scalding enough or ribald enough for almost any skewed funny bone. Of the new ones that turned up in 2016, here are my favorite 10.  —   NEIL GENZLINGER 1. ‘BAJILLION DOLLAR PROPERTIE$’ (Seeso) This isn’t the most demented show on this list, but it’s among the sharpest. A workplace comedy in the style of “The Office,” filmed with   flourishes, it’s about a Los Angeles real estate company that deals in   properties. How the company stays in business is a mystery, since the staff is full of misfits preoccupied with personal problems and infighting. The core ensemble clicks beautifully, and   guest stars in ridiculous roles complete the package. 2. ‘STAN AGAINST EVIL’ (IFC) The tiny New England town of Willard’s Mill put scores of witches to death centuries ago, and since then its constables and sheriffs have had very short life spans. The wonderful John C. McGinley plays the only sheriff to have made it to retirement Janet Varney portrays the new one. They reluctantly team to battle the town’s lingering demons. It’s a gruesome, deadpan delight. 3. ‘DEBATE WARS’ (Seeso) There’s a reason that Seeso, the comedy streaming service, is on this list more often than any other outlet: It takes more chances. Who would have thought that a simple series in which comics take on topics like “Cats vs. Dogs” in high school debate style could be so funny? Not many shows make me laugh out loud. This one had me on the floor. It was introduced amid the presidential campaign it has lost its topical aura since, which is the only reason it’s not my No. 1. 4. ‘DREAM CORP LLC’ (Adult Swim) A   company employs some decidedly unorthodox treatments in this daffy series, a mix of live action and animation. When patients nod off, the lead doctor (Jon Gries) inserts himself into their dreams, not always to beneficial effect. A sassy robot voiced by Stephen Merchant adds to the fun. 5. ‘LEGENDS OF CHAMBERLAIN HEIGHTS’ (Comedy Central) The great television tradition of having animated characters voice thoughts that a human actor never could is furthered by this cheeky show about three vulgar freshmen, bench warmers on the basketball team, who are trying to establish themselves at their high school. Fat jokes, racial jokes and sex jokes abound the series requires a high tolerance for raunchiness. But the reward is that it makes points bluntly that other shows can only dance around. 6. ‘FLOWERS’  (Seeso) This comic drama, which turned up on Seeso in May, is almost indescribably off kilter and anchored by a terrific performance by Olivia Coleman. The matriarch of the titular Flowers family, she teaches music and balances on the edge of sanity. Her husband writes children’s books that a drunk Dr. Seuss might have produced. Their    twins, Donald and Amy, still live at home, and both have romantic designs on the female neighbor next door. It’s the kind of domestic tableau you might encounter in “The Twilight Zone,” funny, unsettling and enthralling. 7. ‘BRAINDEAD’ (CBS) Not many network comedies are going to turn up on a list like this, but the summer series “BrainDead” was one of the oddest shows of the year. A bug infested Washington: not the flu, but an actual bug that crawled into people’s ears, took over their brains and turned them into   automatons. The thing was, inside the Beltway it was hard to tell the infected politicians and staff members from the regular ones. The show was delightfully cast  —   Aaron Tveit, Nikki M. James, Danny Pino, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Jan Maxwell, Tony Shalhoub  —   and everyone embraced the zaniness. Alas, they will not assemble for an encore the show wasn’t renewed. 8. ‘MR. NEIGHBOR’S HOUSE’ (Adult Swim) This was a   special, but it was a small masterpiece of unsettling ideas and imagery. It was a parody of “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood,” joining Mr. Neighbor (Brian Huskey) on his kiddie TV show as he prepared to celebrate his “31st annual fifth birthday party. ” It soon became clear that this was a gentleman with an extreme case of   . 9. ‘WRECKED’ (TBS) This summer series, a humorous version of “Lost,” hasn’t received much attention, but it’s a   show with a sly sense of incongruity. A plane crashes on an island the survivors try to, well, survive. Among the major issues they face: where to go to the bathroom and what movie to watch with the last bit of DVD battery. It’s broad, sometimes gross comedy, delivered with verve. 10. ‘VICE PRINCIPALS’ (HBO) To like this series, you need to be able to tolerate two very unlikable lead characters. They are vice principals played by Danny R. McBride and the great Walton Goggins, enemies who band together to take on their new boss. The humor is often crass, and the lead characters have exceedingly foul mouths, but over all the series is an amusingly caustic variation on both the teenage comedy and the bromance genre.

19405,Trump Rejects Neocon Turncoats - Russia Launches Aleppo Campaign,"Wikipedia: Eliot A.

He has been a member of the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee, a committee of civilians and retired military officers that the U.S. Secretary of Defense may call upon for advice, that was instituted during the administration of President George W. Bush. He was put on the board after acquaintance Richard Perle put forward his name. Cohen has referred to the War on Terrorism as “World War IV”. In the run-up to the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, he was a member of Committee for the Liberation of Iraq, a group of prominent persons who pressed for an invasion.

Cohen in The American Interest on November 10 2016 (immediately after Trump won): Trump may be better than we think. He does not have strong principles about much, which means he can shift. He is clearly willing to delegate legislation to Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell. And even abroad, his instincts incline him to increase U.S. strength—and to push back even against Russia if, as will surely happen, Putin double-crosses him. My guess is that sequester gets rolled back, as do lots of stupid regulations, and experiments in nudging and nagging Americans to behave the way progressives think they should.

I find the above very funny. How could that turncoat think he would be greeted by the Trump organization with anything but derision? Cohen believed he and his ilk would be welcome with candies and roses after insulting Trump in all major media? Who is the arrogant one in the above? 
Oh, by the way. Here is a headline from October 2013: President Obama to Republicans: I won. Deal with it . I do not remember Cohen, or anyone else, calling that ""arrogant"". 
While the papers are full of (badly) informed rumors about who will get this or that position in a Trump administration let's keep in mind that 90% of such rumors are just self promotions by people like Cohen who shill for the rumored job. That is why I will not write about John Bolton or Rudy Giuliani as coming Secretary of State. Both are possible (unqualified) candidates. But others are just as likely to get that position. We will only know who it is after the official release. 
Meanwhile Trump yesterday had a phonecall with the Russian President Putin. They discussed bilateral relations, Syria and fighting terrorism. Today the Russian and Syrian military started the long expected big campaign against the ""moderate"" al-Qaeda in east-Aleppo city and Idleb governate. Air strikes on east-Aleppo had been held back for 28 days. Today missiles and cruise missiles were launched against fixed targets and dozens of carrier and land launched airplanes attacked Nusra position on the various front and in its rear. Long range bombers flown from Russia joined the campaign. Trump seems to have voiced no objections to this offensive. 
The Russian military has upped its air defense in Syria. Additional to the S-400 system around its airport in Latakia seven S-300 systems were deployed as a screen against U.S. cruise missile attacks. These are joined by rehabilitated Syrian S-200 system and Pantsyr S-1 short range systems for point defense. This should be enough to deter any stupid idea the Pentagon hawks, or dumb neocons like Eliot Cohen, might have. Posted by b on November 15, 2016 at 12:13 PM | Permalink",0

19407,Firebombing of G.O.P. Office Jolts Fragile Balance of a North Carolina Town - The New York Times,"HILLSBOROUGH, N. C.  —   The firebomb hurled through the front window of the local Republican headquarters here was one of the uglier manifestations of a sour national mood. It also seemed to shatter something sacred in this small North Carolina town, where residents, in the face of cultural change, have largely found an amicable balance between liberal and conservative, traditional and trendy, in the heart of a swing state that is one of the nation’s most politically and culturally divided. “It’s just reprehensible in so many different ways,” Tom Stevens, Hillsborough’s mayor of 11 years, said on Monday. It was an attack on freedom of expression, he said, and rattled Hillsborough’s sense of safety. But he added, “I don’t think it is representative of the majority of the people in this town, who have faith in our political discourse and our political process. ” The attack, which occurred early Sunday and badly damaged the inside of the political office, remains under investigation by federal, state and local officials. Both Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump swiftly issued denunciations. A group of Democrats created a GoFundMe page that had raised more than $13, 000 by Monday evening for the Orange County Republican Party. The authorities had not announced any arrests as of Monday afternoon. The sense that the attack did not reflect the spirit of Hillsborough was shared on Monday by liberals and conservatives, who said that this town of 6, 000 people, about 40 miles northwest of Raleigh, had found a way to peacefully manage the cultural and political tension that had come to define it. It is a tension between a   Southern conservative faction and a crowd of mostly   artists, authors, tech workers and foodies  —   a mix of people who have reimagined Hillsborough in the past 15 years or so, bringing art galleries, good restaurants and good coffee. Today, it is the kind of North Carolina hamlet where the butter beans come in a thoughtful $27 dish of tortelloni with kale butter and pecorino. In a nation where residents tend to   according to political belief, this is a place where Democrats and Republicans often live cheek by jowl, and more or less agree to disagree amid this year’s tight and agitated races for president, governor and Senate. The two factions in Hillsborough do not live in absolute harmony, however. Mayor Stevens said that someone burned rainbow flags, symbols of the gay pride movement, in April at a church outside town. In August 2015, protesters held a downtown rally opposing the Hillsborough Board of Commissioners’ decision to remove the words “Confederate Memorial” from the doorway of the Orange County Historical Museum. But the idea that the two factions strive to live in peace can feel almost like a defining mythology of Hillsborough. “What might be called New South and Old South not only coexist, atypical in a region where rapid growth and the influx of outsiders have often fomented cultural clashes, but each appreciates the value the other brings to the table,” the local author Bob Burtman wrote in a 2010 anthology about the town. Evelyn   the vice chairwoman of the Orange County Republican Party, who stepped carefully through the glass shards of the blackened office Monday morning, said she had witnessed the cultural change since moving to the area in the early 1980s. She said she was long used to living among Democrats and was friendly with many of them, including members of her garden club. Orange County, with Hillsborough as its seat, includes nearly all of liberal Chapel Hill, home to the University of North Carolina. Nearly half of the county’s approximately 116, 000 voters are registered Democrats, and fewer than 15 percent of voters signed up as Republicans. A substantial number of voters  —   nearly 38 percent  —   are unaffiliated. Ms.   said she could not imagine that a local person was responsible for the attack, given the friendly tenor of the town. But she did not play down the seriousness. She said Mr. Stevens approached her on Sunday and said, “Oh, this is sad, Evelyn. ” “I said, ‘No, it’s not sad  —   it’s evil,’” she recalled. The Hillsborough police said someone had hurled “a bottle containing flammable material” through the front window of the headquarters. The authorities said they believed that the fire extinguished itself after burning furniture and causing “heavy smoke damage. ” Someone also   “Nazi Republicans leave town or else” and a swastika on a nearby building. Federal, state and local officials are involved in the inquiry. The F. B. I. and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said agents were assisting the local authorities. The Republican headquarters are in a section of town that is set apart from the city center and years ago had a Daniel   roadside attraction. A Daniel Boone statue remains, as do a few log cabins and wagon wheels. These days, Hillsborough’s cultural confluence is best evident amid the handsome, historic brick buildings of downtown. One short stretch of King Street includes Purple Crow Books, which shows off works by local authors like Lee Smith and Hal Crowther a community FM radio station that plays, among other things, electronic and   string music Carolina Game and Fish, a purveyor of shotguns,   fishing reels and live bait and Dual Supply Company, a   hardware store. Inside the store, Frances O’Halloran, 55, a local herbalist, was buying a few items from Michael Woods, 56, whose father is the owner. “It just didn’t make sense to me,” said Ms. O’Halloran, who supports Mrs. Clinton. “Here, I hear all sides of every issue, and yet everybody gets along,” said Mr. Woods, an independent who said he voted for individuals, not by party affiliation. Dave Rutter, 68, a musician with an Americana group called the Pagan Hellcats, was outside Cup A Joe, King Street’s coffee shop, with members of his band. He wondered aloud whether Trump supporters had carried out the attack in an effort to earn sympathy for Republicans. “This is weird,” he said. “We have no history of any kind of violence. ” At Carolina Game and Fish, such theories prompted a few snorts of incredulity. “If it was a false flag thing, why would they do it in Orange County?” asked Michael Tulloch, 67, a retired drug abuse counselor who said he had been planning to vote for Mr. Trump until his recent handling of sexual assault allegations. “Most of the people in this area didn’t even know where the Republican headquarters was at,” Mr. Tulloch said. On Monday afternoon, Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican locked in a tight race for   visited the burned building. Hours before, volunteers and local party members had set up tables outside the building, signing up volunteers and giving away yard signs that had not been melted together. Mr. McCrory expressed anger about “an assault on our democratic process. ” “The last thing we need is more types of violence and intimidation as it relates to the political process, not just in North Carolina but the United States of America,” Mr. McCrory said. “Whatever the motive,” he said, “there is no excuse for it. ”",0
19408,"American Dream, Revisited","Pepe ESCOBAR | 30.10.2016 | OPINION American Dream, Revisited Will Trump pull a Brexit times ten? What would it take, beyond WikiLeaks, to bring the Clinton (cash) machine down? Will Hillary win and then declare WWIII against her Russia / Iran / Syria «axis of evil»? Will the Middle East totally explode? Will the pivot to Asia totally implode? Will China be ruling the world by 2025? Amidst so many frenetic fragments of geopolitical reality precariously shored against our ruins, the temptation is irresistible to hark back to the late, great, deconstructionist master Jean Baudrillard. During the post-mod 1980s it was hip to be Baudrillardian to the core; his America, originally published in France in 1986, should still be read today as the definitive metaphysical/geological/cultural Instagram of Exceptionalistan. By the late 1990s, at the end of the millennium, two years before 9/11 – that seminal «before and after» event - Baudrillard was already stressing how we live in a black market maze. Now, it’s a black market paroxysm. Global multitudes are subjected to a black market of work – as in the deregulation of the official market; a black market of unemployment; a black market of financial speculation; a black market of misery and poverty; a black market of sex (as in prostitution); a black market of information (as in espionage and shadow wars); a black market of weapons; and even a black market of thinking. Way beyond the late 20 th century, in the 2010s what the West praises as «liberal democracy» – actually a neoliberal diktat - has virtually absorbed every ideological divergence, while leaving behind a heap of differences floating in some sort of trompe l’oeil effect. What’s left is a widespread, noxious condition; the pre-emptive prohibition of any critical thought, which has no way to express itself other than becoming clandestine (or finding the right internet niche). Baudrillard already knew that the concept of «alter» - killed by conviviality - does not exist in the official market. So an «alter» black market also sprung up, co-opted by traffickers; that’s, for instance, the realm of racism, nativism and other forms of exclusion. Baudrillard already identified how a «contraband alter», expressed by sects and every form of nationalism (nowadays, think about the spectrum between jihadism and extreme-right wing political parties) was bound to become more virulent in a society that is desperately intolerant, obsessed with regimentation, and totally homogenized. There could be so much exhilaration inbuilt in life lived in a bewildering chimera cocktail of cultures, signs, differences and «values»; but then came the coupling of thinking with its exact IT replica – artificial intelligence, playing with the line of demarcation between human and non-human in the domain of thought. The result, previewed by Baudrillard, was the secretion of a parapolitical society - with a sort of mafia controlling this secret form of generalized corruption (think the financial Masters of the Universe). Power is unable to fight this mafia - and that would be, on top of it, hypocritical, because the mafia itself emanates from power. The end result is that what really matters today, anywhere, mostly tends to happen outside all official circuits; like in a social black market. Is there any information «truth»? Baudrillard showed how political economy is a massive machine, producing value, producing signs of wealth, but not wealth itself. The whole media / information system – still ruled by America - is a massive machine producing events as signs; exchangeable value in the universal market of ideology, the star system and catastrophism. This abstraction of information works as in the economy – disgorging a coded material, deciphered in advance, and negotiable in terms of models, as much as the economy disgorges products negotiable in terms of price and value. Since all merchandise, thanks to this abstraction of value, is exchangeable, then every event (or non-event) is also exchangeable, all replacing one another in the cultural market of information. And that takes us to where we live now; Trans-History, and Trans-Politics – where events have really not happened, as they get lost in the vacuum of information (as much as the economy gets lost in the vacuum of speculation). Thus this quintessential Baudrillard insight; if we consider History as a movie – and that’s what it is now – then the «truth» of information is no more than post-production synch, dubbing and subtitles. Still, as we all keep an intense desire for devouring events, there is immense disappointment as well, because the content of information is desperately inferior to the means of broadcasting them. Call it a pathetic, universal contagion; people don’t know what to do about their sadness or enthusiasm – in parallel to our societies becoming theaters of the absurd where nothing has consequences. No acts, deeds, crimes (the 2008 financial crisis), political events (the WikiLeaks emails showing virtually no distinction between the «nonprofit» Clinton cash machine, what’s private and what’s public, the obsessive pursuit of personal wealth, and the affairs of the state) seem to have real consequences. Immunity, impunity, corruption, speculation - we veer towards a state of zero responsibility (think Goldman Sachs). So, automatically, we yearn for an event of maximum consequence, a «fatal» event to repair that scandalous non-equivalence. Like a symbolic re-equilibrium of the scales of destiny. So we dream of an amazing event – Trump winning the election? Hillary declaring WWIII? - that would free us from the tyranny of meaning and the constraint of always searching for the equivalence between effects and causes. Shadowing the world Just like Baudrillard, I got to see «deep» America in the 1980s and 1990s by driving across America. So sooner or later one develops a metaphysical relationship with that ubiquitous warning, «Objects in this mirror may be closer than they appear». But what if they may also be further than they appear? The contemporary instant event/celebrity culture deluge of images upon us; does it get us closer to a so-called «real» world that is in fact very far away from us? Or does it in fact keep the world at a distance – creating an artificial depth of field that protects us from the imminence of objects and the virtual danger they represent? In parallel, we keep slouching towards a single future language – the language of algorithms, as designed across the Wall Street / Silicon Valley axis – that would represent a real anthropological catastrophe, just like the globalist/New World Order dream of One Thought and One Culture. Languages are multiple and singular – by definition. If there were a single language, words would become univocal, regulating themselves in an autopilot of meaning. There would be no interplay – as in artificial languages there’s no interplay. Language would be just the meek appendix of a unified reality – the negative destiny of a languidly unified human species. That’s where the American «dream» seems to be heading. It’s time to take the next exit ramp. ",0
19409,Re: UK Children's Charity: Muslims Are Kidnapping White Girls And Forcing Them Into Sex Slavery,"Print 
Islam and sex slavery are like peanut butter and jelly - you always find the one next to the other. Muslims kidnapping vulnerable white girls in the UK and forcing them to be sex slaves has reached an epidemic level, according to a recent report from the UK Charity Barnados. They say that Muslims are setting up fake businesses, primarily car washes, when, in reality, they are brothels and transit houses for these kidnapped girls: 
Barnardo’s claims girls are being ferried from one unit to another as sex slaves for Kurds[s]. 
It suggests white British girls on the run from the care system in Hartlepool, Stockton-on-Tees and Middlesbrough are being targeted. 
The report said: “There were connections between people that work in car washes and the sexual exploitation of children on Teesside. 
… 
Officers on the immigration-led operation found beds at one. It was suggested staff were living on the premises. 
Cleveland Police said: “It was not confirmed that child sexual exploitation had taken place although enquiries were conducted.” ( source ) 
This is a sad and sickening picture of what the UK has become. Once one of the safest places in the West, it has allowed itself to become little more than a third-world cesspool, where its own women are being sold like slaves in the Muslim bazaars of old, and the government refuses to do its job to stop it, instead allowing it to continue and trying to stop those who want to put a stop to it.

19410,"As French Election Nears, Le Pen Targets Voters Her Party Once Repelled - The New York Times","   France  —   The National Front’s leafleteers are no longer spat upon. Its local candidate’s headquarters sit defiantly in a fraying Muslim neighborhood. And last week, Marine Le Pen, the party’s leader, packed thousands into a steamy meeting hall nearby for a pugnacious speech mocking “the system” and vowing victory in this spring’s French presidential election. “There’s been a real evolution,” Philippe   the retired head of a small manufacturing company, said as he handed out National Front leaflets in the market on a recent day. “A few years ago, they would insult us. It’s changed. ” It has long been accepted wisdom that Ms. Le Pen and her   party can make it through the first round of the presidential voting on April 23, when she and four other major candidates will be on the ballot, but that she will never capture the majority needed to win in a runoff in May. But a visit to this southeastern National Front stronghold suggests that Ms. Le Pen may be succeeding in broadening her appeal to the point where a victory is more plausible, even if the odds are still stacked against her. With a month to go, the signs are mixed. Many voters, particularly affluent ones, at markets here and farther up the coast betray a traditional distaste for the   party. Yet others once repelled by a party with a heritage rooted in France’s darkest political traditions  —     xenophobia and a penchant for the fist  —   are considering it. “I’ve said several times I would do it, but I’ve never had the courage,” Christian Pignol, a vendor of plants and vegetables at the Bandol market, said about voting for the National Front. “This time may be the good one. ” “It’s the fear of the unknown,” he continued, as several fellow vendors nodded. “People would like to try it, but they are afraid. But maybe it’s the solution. We’ve tried everything for 30, 40 years. We’d like to try it, but we’re also afraid. ” French politics are particularly volatile this election season. Traditional power centers  —   the governing Socialists and the   Republicans  —   are in turmoil. Ms. Le Pen’s chief rival, Emmanuel Macron, is a youthful and untested politician running at the head of a new party. Those uncertainties  —   and a nagging sense that mainstream parties have failed to offer solutions to France’s economic anemia  —   have left the National Front better positioned than at any time in its   history. But if it is to win nationally, the party must do much better than even the 49 percent support it won in this conservative Var department, home to three National Front mayors, in elections in 2015. More critically, it must turn   areas of the country in Ms. Le Pen’s favor and attract new kinds of voters  —   professionals and the upper and middle classes. Political analysts are skeptical. Frédéric Boccaletti, the party’s leader in the Var, knows exactly what needs to be done. Last week, he and his fellow National Front activists gathered for an evening planning session in La    a   port town devastated by the closing of   naval shipyards nearly 20 years ago. Mr. Boccaletti, who is running for Parliament, keeps his headquarters here. “I’m telling you, you’ve got to go to the difficult neighborhoods  —   it’s not what you think,” Mr. Boccaletti told them, laughing slyly. “Our work has got to be in the areas that have resisted us most”  —   meaning the coast’s more affluent areas. It is not unlike the strategy that President Trump applied in the United States by campaigning in   Democratic strongholds in   Ohio. No one thought he stood a chance there. Yet he won. “Now, we’ve got doctors, lawyers, the liberal professions with us,” Mr. Boccaletti said. “Since the election of Marine” to the party’s presidency in 2011, “it’s all changed. ” Yes and no. Since then, to broaden the party’s appeal, Ms. Le Pen has worked to buff the National Front’s image and distance it from its founder,   Le Pen, her disavowed   father, even kicking him out of the party in 2015. That strategy has helped make the National Front potentially palatable to some voters who had hesitated before. In the early days, four decades ago, winning 10 percent of the vote was considered a triumph for the party. This year, some polls predict Ms. Le Pen will get as much as 45 percent of the vote.   of her own edge toward the mainstream, Ms. Le Pen now buries her most incendiary proclamations. At a rally in nearby   last week, she pledged to cut taxes and “drastically” reduce immigration  —   well inside generic political formulations. Also last week, the party dismissed an official in the region for Holocaust denial. Still, Ms. Le Pen often emits the dog whistles easily recognized by her cheering crowds, as in a recent speech at Nantes, where she denounced in quick succession “the Rothschild bank,” and the   media and telecom magnate Patrick Drahi, a   businessman with French and Israeli citizenship. Ms. Le Pen and her party still show little compunction over using tried and true National Front strategies that stoke racial fears. A wall at Mr. Boccaletti’s tiny party headquarters here is adorned with a poster showing a hand tearing down a star and crescent, a symbol of Islam, with the slogan “Here, We Are in France. ” Another poster showed a veiled Muslim woman accompanied by the words “No to Islamism. ” When the beaming Ms. Le Pen clambers onstage at her rallies, menacing chords give way to triumphant brassy blasts. At the more elaborate rallies, Wagnerian electric flame throwers dramatically cap her closing vows to “renew the ties of national solidarity. ” In   it was Ms. Le Pen’s thrusts against the “mass immigration” and its supposed link to France’s mass unemployment that drew the loudest roars. “This is our country!” the crowd chanted. “She’s going to send home the immigrants,” said Jean Simon, a grizzled construction worker from Nice, who attended. “There’s way too much unemployment. ” Lashing the two issues together is a ploy straight from a playbook that dates to the National Front’s original doctrine in 1972. It is part of legacy that continues to give a good many French people pause. Some 58 percent of them still consider the Front a “danger” for democracy, according to a poll published in Le Monde this month, 11 percentage points more than in 2013. Yet there is enough uncertainty over whether Ms. Pen has sufficiently softened up traditional resistance that, for the first time, the candidate of a party still considered extremist by many has become the person to beat. The mainstream media is in near hysteria. Last week’s cover headline in the Journal du Dimanche warned of the “Le Pen Menace. ” The cover of this week’s L’Obs predicted in bold type: “If Le Pen is elected: The Black Scenario. ” In L’Express it was “Why Le Pen is advancing  —   again. ” Ms. Le Pen is in the unusual position of seeming like a winner and a loser at the same time. She is a winner because every French poll predicts she will come out on top in the first round. Four major candidates will be competing against her that day  —   two on the left, one in the center and one on the right. None, alone, can beat her. But she is a loser because those same polls all say she will be defeated by a hefty margin in the second round of voting on May 7, whoever her opponent is. “I don’t think she will be elected president,” said Joël Gombin of the University of Picardy Jules Verne, one of France’s leading experts on the Front. “But it’s not impossible any longer. “And even if she’s not elected, there’s a strong possibility that French political life will be turned upside down, and the National Front will play a larger role,” he added. The ambiguous status of winner and loser gives her whole campaign  —   the tone of her voters, her activists, her top lieutenants and even Ms. Le Pen herself  —   an uncertain feel, as if all are floating a few feet above reality. Muriel Fiol, a local doctor who was helping Mr. Boccaletti run the meeting, predicted that the “glass ceiling was going to explode. ” “People don’t want this political class any more,” she said. But Mr. Boccaletti urged prudence. There was still some way to go, as attitudes of many locals showed. Even if buoyed by the feeling that Ms. Le Pen is a player for the first time, volunteers conceded that the going was “difficult,” as was sometimes shown by the reception at the colorful market in this fishing port of pastel houses on the Mediterranean. Certainly, not all were convinced that Ms. Le Pen had outrun the long shadow of her party’s ugly reputation. “Sure, I took their leaflet,” Bernard Cornet, a retired teacher, said, broadly grinning. “Only so that I could throw it into the trash straight away. ”",0
19411,Illegal Immigrants Filing Tax Returns Dropping under Trump,"While Americans are scrambling to meet the 2016 tax filing deadline, the number of illegal immigrants submitting their returns in the present climate are reportedly down significantly. Also, a Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) report exposing significant refund fraud has “most certainly contributed to it,” says the taxpayer advocate department within the IRS. [The Internal Revenue Service stated that millions of people who do not have Social Security numbers (SSN) most of these illegal aliens, filed federal tax returns last year, reported NPR the day before the tax deadline. Many of those who are ineligible for SSN use “ITIN,” or Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers when filing.  The Taxpayer Advocate Service, an independent organization within the IRS, reports that “Without ITINs, approximately 4. 6 million taxpayers would not be able to comply with their annual tax filing and payment obligations, or receive tax benefits to which they are legally entitled. ” The advocate service states that ITIN applications and “associated return filings” “have dropped precipitously, down 58 percent between 2011 and 2014. ” They write that the “general economic climate and immigration trends” explain part of this drop, but the “IRS ITIN procedures have most certainly contributed to it. ” After the TIGTA report “alleging significant refund fraud connected to ITINS,” in 2012 the IRS made what its independent advocacy service calls “sweeping changes that require applicants to submit original identification documents (subject to a few alternatives). ” The IRS has also continued its policy of requiring applicants to apply for an ITIN with a paper tax return. The new requirements led to delays for the ITIN applicants and associated large backlogs, the Taxpayer Advocate Services says. The independent arm charges that “While concerns about refund fraud are legitimate, the IRS’s solutions do not effectively target the fraud nor do they balance the   regime with the taxpayer’s need for a process no more intrusive than necessary, part of a taxpayer’s right to privacy. ” Moreover, NPR reported that tax preparers in the sanctuary city San Francisco area told them there is approximately a 20 percent decline in the number of people filing with ITIN numbers. A tax law professor at the University of Nevada said that tax preparers in other parts of the United States are making similar claims. “Sending in a tax return with your current address and information is very unnerving to a population that wants to comply with the law and is actually leaving significant refunds on the table by not filing tax returns,” educator Francine Lipman said. The IRS is barred from giving information it has obtained to other United States agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security. They may share information only under “limited circumstances” NPR reported. The professor says that those bearing ITIN numbers must decide “whether to trust that firewall. ” “Many of our clients are telling us that in years past they felt more hope and more of ability to have a pathway toward citizenship and lately there’s a lot less hope,” Max   the head of a tax program at the Mission Economic Development Agency told NPR.

19412,Sen. Rand Paul Opposes Trump Airstrikes in Syria: ’The United States Was Not Attacked’ - Breitbart,"WASHINGTON  —   Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul cautioned President Donald Trump about making war in Syria Thursday evening shortly after it was announced that the Pentagon fired more than 50 Tomahawk cruise missiles on a Syrian air base. [“While we all condemn the atrocities in Syria, the United States was not attacked. The President needs congressional authorization for military action as required by the Constitution, and I call on him to come to Congress for a proper debate,” said Paul, who ran for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination against Trump.  “Our prior interventions in this region have done nothing to make us safer and Syria will be no different,” he said. Earlier Thursday, the senator told Brian Kilmeade on Fox News Radio he was skeptical about the President’s ability to change Syria with new attacks. “If he decides to do something in Syria, he would come to Congress and ask for a declaration of war. Short of congress voting on it, I’m opposed to illegal and unconstitutional wars,” he said. “I have the greatest amount of sympathy, I can’t see those pictures, it’s heartrending to see those pictures,” he said. “But going to war we have to decide will it be better or worse? Will we improve our national security? Are we threatened currently by Syria, and if we go to war is Assad likely to use less chemical weapons or more?” Paul argued American attacks could make the situation in Syria worse. “There’s some argument for the more cornered and the more defeated in some ways more likely they are to use chemical weapons and actually for the less defeated they are that they’re less likely to use them,” he said. “The bottom line is it’s horrific. ”",0

19414,Reuters: Largest 10 ’Sanctuary Cities’ May Lose $2.27 Billion in Federal Funding - Breitbart,"The ten most populous cities where local leaders shield illegal immigrants from federal law could lose $2. 27 billion in federal funds, a Reuters analysis has found. [New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and other large cities could lose federal funding for housing, education, airport improvements, HIV treatment, and more. “The [funding] numbers do not include federal money for law enforcement, which was excluded in the executive order, and programs like Medicaid, which are administered by state governments,” Reuters states.  One estimate found 300 “sanctuary city” jurisdictions exist where state or local officials refuse to cooperate with federal law enforcement officers, and which order cops not to discover arrestees’ immigration status. Nationwide, at least 11 million illegal immigrants live in America’s towns and cities. President Donald Trump issued an executive order Wednesday instructing Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly to look at all channels of federal funding for sanctuary cities and determine how they can be changed by the administration. Trump’s actions could shrink local government workforces and indirectly bring some city operations to a grinding halt. The Port of Seattle depends on federal dollars to operate, for example. In response to the threat of lost funding, Democratic mayors like Rahm Emanuel in Chicago and Bill de Blasio in New York have made make declarations about taking the Trump administration to court. But the sanctuary city policies also create risks for local politicians. Under former mayor Rudy Giuliani, New York City forbid city employees from sharing information about immigrants and aliens to defend his sanctuary city policy after losing a Supreme Court battle. “Six days later, several   participated in the most devastating attack on the city and the country in history,” on   conservative commentator Heather MacDonald pointed out. The families of Kate Steinle and Sarah Root lost their daughters when illegal aliens in sanctuary jurisdictions killed them. Trump plans to increase the pressure on local politicians  —   he’s ordered deputies to collect and publicize data about crimes by illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities.",0
19415,Oscar Pistorius Sentenced to 6 Years in Reeva Steenkamp Murder - The New York Times,"JOHANNESBURG  —   Oscar Pistorius, the   sprinter who rose to worldwide fame for overcoming his disability to compete in the 2012 Olympic Games, was sentenced on Wednesday to six years in prison for murdering his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, inside his home in 2013. Mr. Pistorius was taken directly from the courtroom to a prison near Pretoria to start serving his sentence. He will have to serve half of his term before being eligible for parole. Judge Thokozile Matilda Masipa of the High Court in Pretoria cited “mitigating” factors in handing out a sentence that was significantly shorter than the   minimum requested by prosecutors. Mr. Pistorius, the judge said, had shown genuine remorse in trying, repeatedly and unsuccessfully, to apologize in person to the victim’s parents. Mr. Pistorius, 29, who looked down in an expressionless stare while the judge read the sentence, showed no emotion when he was asked to rise and listen to the sentencing. Neither did Ms. Steenkamp’s family react in the courtroom. The sentencing brought to an apparent close a trial that transfixed much of this nation for years, featuring a young, handsome man whose inspiring story once spoke to the youthful hopes of   South Africa. Mr. Pistorius’s fall  —   as well as the unsettling questions the trial raised about violence against women and the racial fears lurking behind the murder  —   occurred in a country increasingly disaffected with the   order and its architect, the   African National Congress. In handing out the   sentence, Judge Masipa surprised many legal experts who had predicted that a term of at least 10 years would split the difference between guidelines that call for at least 15 years in prison for murder but that also allow for a reduction based on other considerations. Both sides can appeal the judge’s sentence, leaving the possibility that the case may not be over. Mr. Pistorius’s lawyers said they would not file an appeal. Perhaps anticipating a challenge by prosecutors, Judge Masipa said in her ruling Wednesday morning that she would be available to receive a request for an appeal that same day. Among other mitigating factors, the judge said she considered the circumstances of the shooting and Mr. Pistorius’s disability. She also noted that Mr. Pistorius was a   offender who had shown himself to be a good candidate for rehabilitation. “I am of the view that a   imprisonment will not serve justice,” Judge Masipa said. In remarks largely sympathetic to Mr. Pistorius, the judge added: “He’s a fallen hero who has lost his career and is ruined financially. The worst is that having taken the life of a fellow human being in the manner that he did, he cannot be at peace. ” Marius du Toit, a criminal defense lawyer, former prosecutor and judge who has closely followed the trial, said the sentence, though “erring on the side of leniency,” clearly reflected the judge’s belief that Mr. Pistorius was guilty of what amounts to an accidental murder, not one with intent. Mr. du Toit said that prosecutors could decide to contest the sentence by asking Judge Masipa to grant leave to appeal or, failing that, by petitioning the Supreme Court of Appeals directly. “But is it something that another court will interfere with? I somehow don’t think so,” he said. “I think we may have reached the end of this matter. ” Gareth Newham, a criminal justice researcher at the Institute for Security Studies in Pretoria, said that it was not unusual for a judge to consider mitigating factors in deviating from sentencing guidelines. But the   sentence, he said, would most likely anger a public that has come to regard Mr. Pistorius much less sympathetically. “The general public feeling about this will be that it was an inappropriately light sentence, and that could lead to the N. P. A. to think that they might have a better chance of getting the sentence extended if they took it to a higher court,” he said, referring to the National Prosecuting Authority. In 2014, Judge Masipa  convicted Mr. Pistorius of the equivalent of manslaughter, sentencing him to five years in prison. Mr. Pistorius served one year before being released to serve the rest of his sentence under house arrest. After prosecutors appealed, the nation’s highest appeals court found that Judge Masipa had erred in her ruling and convicted Mr. Pistorius of murder. Last month, Mr. Pistorius and Ms. Steenkamp’s family appeared in court before Judge Masipa for a new sentencing. Both sides made emotional pleas to the judge who, though working under sentencing guidelines, had the authority to reduce the sentence if she found substantial and compelling reasons. In the courtroom last month, Mr. Pistorius removed his artificial legs and walked on his stumps, resting his hand on a desk for support at one point. His lawyers argued that his disability would make him particularly vulnerable in prison and pleaded for community service instead. The victim’s father, Barry Steenkamp, 73, gave tearful testimony and said that Mr. Pistorius “had to pay for his crime. ” Mr. Steenkamp said his daughter’s killing had contributed to his having a stroke. Mr. Steenkamp, a diabetic, said that his grief has been so severe that he would take his insulin syringe and “shove it into my stomach and my arms to see if I could feel the same type of pain, but no. ” Ms. Steenkamp’s murder occurred only months after the 2012 Games, where Mr. Pistorius, a source of inspiration around the world for the disabled, was selected to carry the South African flag at the closing ceremony. Mr. Pistorius, whose lower legs were amputated when he was 11 months old, became known as the Blade Runner for his use of curved prosthetics. Mr. Pistorius and Ms. Steenkamp  —   a    model and law school graduate  —   had been dating for only a few months when the killing took place, on Feb. 14, 2013. That night, Mr. Pistorius shot Ms. Steenkamp through the locked door of a bathroom in his apartment in a gated community in Pretoria. Mr. Pistorius had said that he had shot his girlfriend in the mistaken belief that somebody had broken into his home, an argument that resonated in a country with high crime  —   and high walls to shield the comfortable against home invasions. Prosecutors argued that he had intentionally killed Ms. Steenkamp in a jealous rage after an argument. In her initial verdict in 2014, after a   courtroom drama that many compared to the O. J. Simpson trial, Judge Masipa sided with the defendant, saying his account “could reasonably be true. ” Acquitting him of murder, she ruled that prosecutors had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Pistorius had shown intent to kill. But as is permitted in South Africa, which does not have a jury system, prosecutors appealed to the Supreme Court of Appeal. In December, the appeals court sided with prosecutors, concluding that the manslaughter conviction, called culpable homicide in South Africa, had been based on a misinterpretation of laws and an erroneous dismissal of circumstantial evidence. The court said that, under a legal principle called dolus eventualis, Mr. Pistorius was guilty because he should have foreseen that his actions  —   firing through his locked bathroom door  —   would kill whoever was inside, and yet he proceeded regardless of the consequences. In describing the case as “a human tragedy of Shakespearean proportions,” the appeals court overturned Judge Masipa’s conviction and found Mr. Pistorius guilty of murder. Mr. Pistorius’s lawyers tried to take the case to the nation’s highest court, the Constitutional Court. But in March, the body, which usually handles constitutional matters, declined to hear Mr. Pistorius’s appeal.",0
19416,6 Places Voter Fraud Has Already Happened… But Don’t Worry,"Remember the last debate when the internet blew up because Donald Trump said he wouldn’t necessarily accept the results of the election ? People were bemoaning him as a fascist and no one in the mainstream wanted to admit that our election process is entirely rigged . The trouble is, voter fraud on a grand scale can be tough to prove . 
As it turns out, voter fraud on a smaller scale has been detected in 6 locations already, according to today’s Drudge Report . But don’t worry. These are just “glitches” or “too few to make a difference.” 1) Chicago 
In the Windy City, the dead have been voting for decades. Two investigators have admitted finding proof of this, but they refuse to say that there is fraud. Relatives of the Voting Dead feel differently. They say that they’ve reported the deaths of their loved ones repeatedly, but that the names have not been removed from the rolls. But that isn’t the worst of it – not only are these people on the rolls – they’ve repeatedly voted since their deaths. 
Don’t worry, though. It’s just a few hundred dead voters that they’ve been able to confirm. No biggie. ( source ) 2) Philadelphia 
Chicago is not alone with the dead folks voting.There are also reports from Philadelphia that people are making their voices heard from beyond the grave. *cough* Local station Action News 6 investigated and found that a stunning number of people have been deemed “active voters” for many years since their deaths. 
Don’t worry, though. The local voting board says these mistakes are simply “human error” and that there aren’t enough dead voters to actually sway the election. ( source ) 3) Hollywood, Maryland 
A woman in Maryland has reported another incidence of “vote flipping.” She voted a straight Republican ticket, then checked after it was submitted. Her vote for Trump had been switched to a vote for Clinton. 
Don’t worry, though. The election officials there told her to just vote again. Of course, this would “undo” the vote for Clinton, but would it really count as a vote for Trump? I’m sure it’s fine. The election officials would want to be scrupulous about something like that. ( source ) 4) Miami-Dade County, Florida 
Two women have been charged with felony counts of tampering with the election. One, a temporary election worker, was caught marking ballots by her co-workers. The other was caught filling out voter registration paperwork for people who did not exist. 
Don’t worry, though. These were isolated incidents that have been dealt with. In the words of State Attorney Katherine Fernández Rundle, a Democrat, “Anyone who attempts to undermine the democratic process should recognize that there is an enforcement partnership between the elections department and our prosecution task force in place to thwart such efforts and arrest those involved. Now we need to move forward with the election.” ( source ) 5) Alexandria, Virginia 
A guy in Virginia who was formerly employed by the New Virginia Majority, an advocacy group aligned with the Democratic party, was caught using fake names to fill out voter registration applications. 
But don’t worry. Commonwealth Attorney Bryan Porter said, “Since the fraudulent applications involved fictitious people, had the fraud not been uncovered the risk of actual fraudulent votes being cast was low.” ( source ) 6) Lots of places in Texas 
Much like the report in Maryland, voters in various locations in Texas have reported that when they chose a straight Republican ticket, the voting machines opted for Clinton/Kaine instead of Trump/Pence . Voters in Amarillo, Arlington, Corpus Christi, San Antonio, Cypress, Mesquite, and El Paso have all reported vote flipping from Trump to Clinton. 
But don’t worry. Election officials in the state say it’s not a problem with the equipment . It’s just those silly voters who don’t know how to use it. ““Typically, we’ve found it’s voter error with the equipment. Sometimes they vote straight party and then click on other candidates … or do something with the wheel….There is not an issue with the equipment.” ( source ) If you’re worried about election fraud… 
You can add a smartphone app by True the Vote called VoteStand to report incidents of fraud. Don’t let anything slide. If you are voting, make sure your choice is accurately recorded.

19417,"Americaâ€™s wars in the Middle East are not â€˜Wars on Terror,â€™ they are conventional Wars of Aggression","November 8, 2016 279 The wars the US is waging in the Middle East fulfil none of the definitions of guerrilla or ""terrorist"" war. The US simply calls them that so that it can deceive the American people and circumvent constitutional safeguards in order to wage wars of aggression. For those fighting and dying there – only Death is real. For the American people, Middle East Terrorism is a total fabrication. A standard definition of War is that it is “a conflict carried on by force of arms” We all know the old face of war in the classical days, where two sides in different coloured uniforms lined up and charged at each other until the sun set. Whoever had the most soldiers standing at the end of the day was the winner and they took over the territory of the losers. It was all about territory and redrawing borders. This kind of warfare held up until around the time of the American Civil War. Since then lines have become blurred. A standard definition of Guerrilla War is that it is “the use of hit-and-run tactics by small mobile groups of irregulars operating within a territory controlled by a regular military”. By the the time of the Anglo-Boer War (circa 1900) the Boers had invented Guerrilla Warfare, where small bands went in and did as much damage as possible using what they had. It was very effective. — An online register lists the names of 293,209 British Soldiers who had to be brought in to wage the war. However, adding in all the other Colonials it was probably closer to 500,000 who were needed to subdue about 30,000 rag-tag South African Boers. Eventually the British found a very workable solution. They rounded up all the women and children remaining on the farms (who had been feeding and sleeping the rebels every night) and put them all in concentration camps. Their suffering was extreme. The men had to give up. Guerrilla warfare is not about capturing Territory, but about demoralisation, damage to infrastructure, and forcing vast numbers of very expensive regulars to guard infrastructure. A standard definition of Terrorism is that it is “the use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims” By the 1960s another form of warfare was emerging. We called it, “Terrorism”. We can all agree that none of the above methods are mutually exclusive. Modern mainstream Media spends a lot of time blurring these lines for the public, but I think we have a reasonably clear understandings of what the differences are. Modern Terrorism is actually more complicated than this definition. It started as aircraft high-jacking; then evolved into small bands shooting innocent people at certain events; and has now evolved into its ‘classic’ contemporary form of suicide vests, suicide vehicles etc. Terrorism is always an “Asymmetric Warfare” (for obvious reasons) where the powerful side, (usually a State or Country) has state of the art military equipment and the other side has very little other than hand held weapons and human bodies. Suicide-vests are the quintessential weapon of terror. Because they are hidden they can have a kill ratio of ten or more to one. They are therefore extremely effective as psychological weapons. Terrorists are almost by definition a very small group of disenchanted radicals who do not have access to modern sophisticated and expensive military equipment, so they have to resort to this sort of asymmetric terrorism. Terrorism has a different aim and a different modus operandi from conventional war. For terrorists time and place of battle or time and place of victory are not a factor. Terrorists choose a target, and then over time slowly start infiltrating the area. They look like regular people. They remain as “sleepers” until called to action. They are unobtrusive and have no visible weapons; they often befriend and mix freely with the local population. Once activated, they make sure that they terrorise the population. Terrorism is not about capturing Territory; it is aimed at destroying economic infrastructure, about killing and wounding the local population in a game of demoralisation, economic destruction, discrediting the existing government, and sapping the morale of the local people, which can then lead to an economic collapse and/or making the State ungovernable. History does not show many (if any) instances of a conventional military winning against Terrorism. The British-Irish insurrection lasted from 1915 until 1998 without a military victory. Finally a political settlement had to be agreed upon. The US’s standard duplicitous propaganda has given the American People a totally false view of what is going on in Syria and much of the Middle East. Most of the mainstream media are in on the game of deceit about America’s war on Terrorism. In Mosul, Raqqa, Aleppo, and all the others, the “terrorists” have magically acquired large numbers of tanks, howitzers, rocket platforms, cannon Vehicles, armoured personnel carriers, etc. They seem to have flags, uniforms, and badges. Somehow they all have the entire range of military equipment. This is absolutely not asymmetric Terrorism, this is genuine conventional war. The US and its surrogates are in a real military war. The American (and allied) politicians should be held accountable. US Politicians and mainstream media have allowed the US government to hide behind a false flag of “Terrorism”. This has fooled the people into supporting a conventional war without realising that that is what it is. When the US announced its ‘War on Terror’, it was creating a subterfuge. When a country is put on a war footing, the powers-that-be understand well that under a condition of war the conventional laws-of-the-and can be modified and sidestepped. Lots of things which would never be acceptable in times of peace can be justified in times of war. In the Middle East (and a few other places) the US cannot ever admit that they (and their surrogates) are in a military war. This would be unconstitutional . By declaring a ‘War on Terror’, the US leadership has been able to legitimise its illegal war making and put its illegal acts in a pseudo- legal framework whilst without formally declaring war placing the nation onto a war footing. The US has developed the habit of declaring anything and anybody they wish to hurt, anywhere in the world, as “terrorists” so that they can the use their loosened set of rules. Somehow the American people have failed to hold their media corporations, or their elected and appointed officials accountable. Instead they routinely allow them to subvert the Constitution by subterfuge and deceit. When the government of a country allows the well being of its people to be compromised in this way, the outcome is usually civil disobedience and/or revolution. In extreme situations, the final refuge of governments wishing to escape responsibility for their failures is War.",0
19418,It’s No Accident: Advocates Want to Speak of Car ‘Crashes’ Instead - The New York Times,"Roadway fatalities are soaring at a rate not seen in 50 years, resulting from crashes, collisions and other incidents caused by drivers. Just don’t call them accidents anymore. That is the position of a growing number of safety advocates, including   groups, federal officials and state and local leaders across the country. They are campaigning to change a    mentality that they say trivializes the single most common cause of traffic incidents: human error. “When you use the word ‘accident,’ it’s like, ‘God made it happen,’ ” Mark Rosekind, the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said at a driver safety conference this month at the Harvard School of Public Health. “In our society,” he added, “language can be everything. ” Almost all crashes stem from driver behavior like drinking, distracted driving and other risky activity. About 6 percent are caused by vehicle malfunctions, weather and other factors. Preliminary estimates by the nonprofit National Safety Council show deadly crashes rose by nearly 8 percent in 2015 over the previous year, killing about 38, 000 people. Dr. Rosekind has added his voice to a growing chorus of advocates who say that the persistence of crashes  —   driving is the most dangerous activity for most people  —   can be explained in part by widespread apathy toward the issue. Changing semantics is meant to shake people, particularly policy makers, out of the implicit nobody’  attitude that the word “accident” conveys, they said. On Jan. 1, the state of Nevada enacted a law, passed almost unanimously in the Legislature, to change “accident” to “crash” in dozens of instances where the word is mentioned in state laws, like those covering police and insurance reports. New York City adopted a policy in 2014 to reduce fatalities that states the city “must no longer regard traffic crashes as mere ‘accidents,’ ” and other cities, including San Francisco, have taken the same step. At least 28 state departments of transportation have moved away from the term “accident” when referring to roadway incidents, according to Jeff Larason, director of highway safety for Massachusetts. The traffic safety administration changed its own policy in 1997, but has recently become more vocal about the issue. Mr. Larason, a former television traffic reporter, started a blog called “Drop The A Word” and has led a campaign to get major media outlets to stop using the term. Last year, he enlisted supporters to join with   groups in urging The Associated Press to clarify how reporters should use the word “accident. ” In April, The A. P. announced a new policy. When negligence is claimed or proven in a crash, the new entry reads, reporters should “avoid accident, which can be read by some as a term exonerating the person responsible. ” (The New York Times’s style guide does not take any position on the terminology.) But use of “accident” has its defenders, as Mr. Larason discovered in 2014 when he posted his thoughts on the word in a Facebook group popular among traffic reporters. “Why can’t human error be an accident even if the error is preventable,” one person wrote. “What is being solved by having this debate? What injustice are we correcting?” And when Mr. Larason suggested to officials at the Virginia Department of Transportation that they stop using “accident,” he received a note saying that drivers are familiar and comfortable with the word. Virginia officials also wrote that drivers might not consider a minor incident to be a “crash,” and so the change could be confusing. Mr. Larason counters that accident is simply the wrong word. “I’m betting it’s one of the most commonly used words that is used inappropriately,” he said. On Facebook, he posted a   definition that describes accident as “an unexpected happening” that “is not due to any fault or misconduct on the part of the person injured. ” The word was introduced into the lexicon of manufacturing and other industries in the early 1900s, when companies were looking to protect themselves from the costs of caring for workers who were injured on the job, according to Peter Norton, a historian and associate professor at the University of Virginia’s department of engineering. The business community even developed a cartoon character  —   the foolish Otto Nobetter, who suffered frequent accidents that left him maimed, immolated, crushed, and even blown up. The character was meant to warn workers about the risks of inattention. “Relentless safety campaigns started calling these events ‘accidents,’ which excused the employer of responsibility,” Dr. Norton said. When traffic deaths spiked in the 1920s, a consortium of   interests, including insurers, borrowed the word to shift the focus away from the cars themselves. “Automakers were very interested in blaming reckless drivers,” Dr. Norton said. But over time, he said, the word has come to exonerate the driver, too, with “accident” seeming like a lightning strike, beyond anyone’s control. The word accident, he added, is seen by its critics as having “normalized mass death in this country,” whereas “the word ‘crash’ is a resurrection of the enormity of this catastrophe. ” These days, the pressure to change the language stems partly from aggrieved families using social media like Facebook clubs and Twitter to lobby for change. Safety advocates often post Twitter messages to journalists and policy makers, urging them to stop using “accident” to describe a crash. When New York City changed its policy in 2014, it did so partly in response to such   efforts, including from a group called Families for Safe Streets. The group is led by parents like Amy Cohen, whose son, Sammy, was run over and killed in Brooklyn in 2013. She helped start a campaign called “Crash Not Accident,” and said that the drivers in deadly wrecks should not be given the presumption of innocence just because they have lived to tell their side of the story. “Whose story do you have at the time of the crash? The driver! The victim is dead,” Ms. Cohen said. “The presumption should be to call it a crash, which is a neutral term. ”",0
19419,The Tao of Matthew McConaughey - The New York Times,"Matthew McConaughey has two movies out this month. In one, he gives voice to an animated koala who organizes a singing contest. In the other, he plays a schlubby dreamer turned jungle adventurer. The details are not important. The main thing is, the movies will keep him in the public eye  —   talk shows, awards ceremonies, magazine covers  —   continuing the    McConnaissance that went into effect when, in a   move, he gave up   for more challenging fare. But if you think of him as a mere movie star, you’re wrong. His work with the directors Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Christopher Nolan, Richard Linklater and Steven Soderbergh has served to provide him cover. Mr. McConaughey has really been a guru all along. Over a period of more than 20 years, almost unnoticed, he has been building a religion of sorts. Call it the Tao of Matthew McConaughey. He preaches to his flock largely through the media of men’s magazines and television commercials. Take the Lincoln campaign. Mr. McConaughey didn’t need a free car when he began pitching the Lincoln MKC in 2014. What he did need was a platform to get his message across. So while other   pitchmen (like Jon Hamm, George Clooney and Jeff Bridges) play the game with just enough enthusiasm to earn the huge paychecks, Mr. McConaughey goes deep. “Sometimes you gotta go back to actually move forward,” he says in an early Lincoln ad while cruising a dark empty freeway. “And I don’t mean going back to reminisce or chase ghosts. I mean go back to see where you came from, where you been, how you got here. ” Perhaps knowing we are weak of spirit and doubting his words, he adds reassuringly: “I know there are those that say you can’t go back. Yes, you can. You just have to look in the right place. ” His work with Lincoln made him a hot enough property in the advertising industry that Wild Turkey signed him not only as the face of its brand but also as the creative director for a new series of commercials. His first spot, “The Journey Begins,” is set, no surprise, in a bar. The lights are low. The mood is mellow. We hear Mr. McConaughey’s voice: “We’re not in a rush to be most popular. ” Pause. “Not in a rush not to be. ” We follow an elegant woman carrying a glass of Wild Turkey deeper into the space. Suddenly, there is an   blast of a tuba. A bar that was quiet only seconds earlier is now a wild roadhouse, filled with the sounds of the Hot 8 Brass Band, whose members mix freely with twirling dancers, and we are reminded that a tenet of the McConaughey worldview is to stay loose, to remain open to any sudden change. Once we have grown accustomed to the new surroundings, the woman leaves the bar behind for the outdoors. The sun is setting behind distant peaks. Mr. McConaughey has led us, in mere seconds, from the noisy pleasures of civilization to the tranquillity of nature. “Real bourbon, no apologies,” he says in the  . “If it’s for you, you’ll know. ” This would seem to be a natural ending. But Mr. McConaughey has one more twist in store: A bright moon appears in a night sky, we hear sweet music, and guess who is sitting at a grand piano situated, incongruously, on an expanse of grass? Mr. McConaughey himself, unshaven,   surrounded by revelers. Through his person, it seems, the untamed and the more refined have come together in a harmonious whole. “Ahhhhh,” he says. “Thank you!” The commercial is a distillation of McConaugheyism disguised as an enticement to drink. Listen to your own inner tune. Go where it takes you. The good things you discover along the way, you were meant to discover. Tomorrow’s hangover? You were meant to have that, too. Readers of men’s magazines are often seeking a guide, a mentor, a hip professor. And Mr. McConaughey comes through in one cover story after another. Not only does he have pectorals that look like “a pair of toasted dinner rolls,” as GQ once wrote, but also a questing mind that cannot be tamed. “Every time you think you’ve reached the end of that long   street, you slip around the edge, past that stopping point,” he said in Esquire in 2011. “And at the end of your life, all the things you thought were periods, they turn out to be commas. There was never a full stop to any of it. ” In a 2012 Men’s Journal interview, he tackled the eternal question of fate versus free will: “Everything we do in life is part of a plan. Sometimes you learn what that plan is today, sometimes you learn about it tomorrow and sometimes it takes you years to figure out. ” Lest he seem too New   he added a dollop of Ayn Rand to his philosophical brew in a 2013 GQ profile: “I’m a fan of the word ‘selfish,’” he said. “‘Selfish’ has always gotten a bad rap. You should do for you. ” He does not shy away from the charged subject of masculinity. “Man is never more masculine than after the birth of his first child,” he said in his most recent Esquire  . “I don’t mean in a macho way. I mean in terms of giving a man strength. ” It goes down easy because Mr. McConaughey remains something of a good ol’ boy who likes his Shiner Bock and comped tickets at the   line. A foundational part of his myth is the 1999 night when he was booked on a charge of suspected marijuana possession after he was arrested at his home in Austin, Tex. where he was dancing naked and playing the bongos at 3 a. m. (Who knew joy was against the law?) Years later, in an Esquire interview, he was calling himself “spiritual,” only to correct himself and say that the word spiritual was “a dodge. ” “I’m religious,” he said. “I like that word. You can use it. ” In his 2014 Oscar acceptance speech, he thanked God explicitly, saying, “He has shown me that it’s a scientific fact that gratitude reciprocates. ” That was before he said his hero is himself, Matthew McConaughey, but 10 years in the future, so that there is always “somebody to keep on chasing. ” His   the first book he says he read cover to cover, is “The Greatest Salesman in the World” by Og Mandino. It tells the tale of 10 ancient scrolls and a trader named Hafid, who reveals their wisdom. Like all sages, Mr. McConaughey can be hard to follow. Confronted with his words, you may feel like Woody Harrelson’s character in “True Detective,” trapped in a car as Mr. McConaughey’s Rust Cohle speaks in riddles. But for all its mystery, McConaugheyism is not a hair shirt religion. In fact, for a number of years now, as his fans and friends have noticed, it has decreed avoiding shirts whenever possible. “I worked hard to live in Malibu, California,” he told GQ in 2014. “I’m going to the beach! I’m gonna go surfing! No, I don’t want to wear a shirt. I want to get a tan and feel the sun on my bones. ” He’s not about abnegating life’s pleasures. He likes the Dolce  Gabbana suits, the Lincolns, the evening glass of bourbon. Trust the universe and it will provide. That seems fundamental to the McConaughey way. He has been saying it one way or another since he burst onto the scene in 1993 as Wooderson in “Dazed and Confused. ” It is said that he improvised Wooderson’s famous line, “Just keep livin’. ” He has since adopted it as a motto and even named his foundation after it. He was a guru from the  . A year before the film’s release, he wandered into the bar of the Hyatt Regency Austin, where he happened to meet a producer. The chance encounter helped win him the role in “Dazed and Confused,” which led to his breakout in “A Time to Kill. ” Soon enough, Vanity Fair was hailing him as the next Paul Newman. “Why did I go to the bar?” he asked a writer from The Austin Chronicle in 1995. “Why did I stay there late that night? Why did this bartender with the same name as me tell me there was a producer in the bar who was working on a movie?” Why did any of us go into that bar? In the McConaughey belief system, it was destiny. He went into that bar in 1992 so that, in 2015, he could sit on a stage inside the University of Houston’s football stadium and offer the graduating class (and all of us, via YouTube) this   utterance: “If there’s one thing that you can depend on people being, it’s people. ” Since he joined with Lincoln in 2014, Mr. McConaughey has dispensed many such nuggets of wisdom. But with the latest Lincoln commercial, which has no   he has gone deeper into the mystic. This is   messaging, and it presents us with a new figure: Silent McConaughey. Like certain Buddhist monks, like Thomas Merton and the Trappists, like Kramer on Season 9 of “Seinfeld,” Mr. McConaughey seems to be reaching for enlightenment through quietude. The ad, titled “Midnight” and directed by J. C. Chandor, opens at night, inside a modern home in the Hollywood Hills with glass walls and jetliner views. Mr. McConaughey, well groomed in a dark suit, looks as if he is back from a catered affair. He walks with purpose through the living room, toward a patio with an infinity pool. We see mountains. A sky full of glowing stars. A twinkling metropolis below. Mr. McConaughey gazes at the paradise he has won for himself. It seems he wants us, his followers, to have it, too. He stops at the edge of the pool. He turns around slowly. Then there is a cut to another McConaughey, who is driving alone at night through a long tunnel. Then we return to the pool. Back to the tunnel. And back to the pool. Is the tunnel scene a flashback to a McConaughey who existed at an earlier moment that same night? Is it perhaps a flash forward to a future McConaughey, similar to the one he chases but is never able to catch? Or do the two McConaugheys exist simultaneously, like Schrödinger’s cat? Tight shot of Mr. McConaughey, still fully clothed, at the pool’s edge. He smiles. What does it mean? He springs into a reverse back dive, and he breaks the water’s surface just as the McConaughey at the wheel of the Lincoln emerges from the tunnel and speeds toward the horizon. In this chaotic world, he seems to be telling us, find a moment to be still. Reflect. But don’t get so caught up in reflection that you cannot make a bold, blind leap of faith  —   into the water, toward the horizon. Mr. McConaughey has been speaking his message long enough. His followers know it by heart. Now he has gone beyond words.",0
19420,"Malia Obama to Attend Harvard, but Not Until 2017 - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   Malia Obama, the older daughter of President Obama, plans to attend Harvard University beginning in the fall of 2017, the White House announced on Sunday, waiting until her father leaves office to begin her college career. Malia’s    decision, announced in a news release after months of official silence from the White House about her college search process, will make her the latest in a long line of presidential children to attend the elite university in Cambridge, Mass. Both of her parents attended law school there. “The President and Mrs. Obama announced today that their daughter Malia will attend Harvard University in the fall of 2017 as a member of the Class of 2021. Malia will take a gap year before beginning school,” the White House said in a statement. In deferring her start date until 2017, Malia, 17, is availing herself of the opportunity to take a “gap year,” a popular option for high school seniors who are seeking experiences outside the classroom  —   some in   parts of the world  —   before they begin pursuing a degree. Harvard actively encourages admitted students to do so. It may also yield a less scrutinized   experience for Malia, whose parents have worked vigilantly to keep her out of the public eye during her years in the White House and hope to shield her from such attention as a college student. “When you’re a presidential   the rest of your life you’re famous, you’re a target, you’re in a security bubble, but it’s not the same,” said Gil Troy, a presidential historian at McGill University and the author of “The Age of Clinton: America in the 1990s. ” “The kids can get to at least some level of irrelevance that they absolutely cannot get when they’re still in the White House. ” Malia visited Harvard and a handful of other Ivy League and liberal arts schools last March on the East Coast, setting off speculation about where she might go. But the White House has steadfastly refused to comment on her college deliberations, even last month when she accompanied Mr. Obama on a trip to California, prompting whispers that she was giving Stanford University a final look before committing herself there. Harvard accepted 5. 2 percent of applicants this year, making this admissions cycle the most selective in its nearly   history. When she arrives at Harvard, Malia will join a long list of presidential children who have attended, including John Quincy Adams and his son, John Adams II Abraham Lincoln’s son Robert the sons of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Theodore Roosevelt Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of John F. Kennedy and George W. Bush, who went to business school there. The university has also long been a popular destination for the children of foreign leaders. Malia, who turns 18 in July, is a senior at the prestigious Sidwell Friends School here. The school sends a handful of students to Harvard most years.",0
19421,Hillary’s crime family: End of days for the U.S.A,"Hillary’s crime family: End of days for the U.S.A Based on the foregoing, SOMEONE got to Comey—somewhere along the line By Daily Coin - November 8, 2016 
An investor in Dave’s fund emailed him asking which way Colorado would vote tomorrow. He replied: “Depends on who counts the votes. I don’t believe this is a fair election. I think the Clinton crime machine, with the help of George Soros and a few others, have everything under their control now.” 
After taking the better part of a year to sift through 55,000 emails in analyzing Hillary Clinton’s behavior with regard to conducting classified Government business on her private server – which apparently was accessible to hackers and, surreptitiously, by Anthony Wieners porn laptop – Jim Comey determined in 8 days that 650,000 emails downloaded from Hillary’s private server were not relevant. 
Sorry Jim, that’s impossible to believe. One highly plausible is that operatives in the Deep State shut down the FBI investigation in order to preserve the treasure trove of material that will give it power over Clinton’s Presidency. The SoT was perplexed by this, so we asked John Titus his take on this. His answer was quite compelling: 
Here’s what I’m reasonably sure of, based on experience. (1) Jim Comey looked sick when, at the conclusion of round one, and having proven beyond all doubt that Hillary violateed 18 U.S.C 793(f), he said no reasonable prosecutor would charge her. He wasn’t acting. Bad acting comes right through camera lens, and that man looked like he was about to vomit when he left that dais; (2) it took the FBI a year to conclude round one of its investigation, which was based on its review of 55,000 emails; (3) Comey had promised to get back to congress should more info arise, and when 650,000 unexpected emails showed up, he made good on his word by letting congress know; and (4) the FBI terminated its investigation LONG before reviewing 650,000 emails. I once reviewed 250,000 documents on a case, Based on the foregoing, SOMEONE got to Comey—somewhere along the line. For all I know, though, the whole thing was scripted from start to finish, and Comey read his script at every point along the way, even when it physically disgusted him in round one. So while you might be right about the time, I think if the Deep State made a move on Comey, it happened awhile ago. That’s wholly speculative on my part. You could well be right that they got to him just recently. I just doubt it. I think he’s the Company Man because he’s a company man. For DAMN SURE you’re right about holding Hillary hostage, but she’s so evil it’s like throwing a pedophile into a daycare center with no supervision, the shades drawn and the doors locked. 
With that as the preface, today’s episode of the Shadow of Truth discussed the latest development in the HRC Crime Family saga:",0
19423,’Women Only’ Screenings of ’Wonder Woman’ to Benefit Planned Parenthood,"Controversy has surrounded special “women only” screenings of the DC Comics blockbuster release Wonder Woman, with proceeds slated to be donated to Planned Parenthood. [“What better way to spend an evening than with Gal Gadot, a vat of rosé and a blissfully   environment?” asked feminist news website Jezebel in an article last month, praising the “no guys allowed” screenings, and adding:  Men, with their preternatural ability to sense that something might not revolve around them, immediately freaked out. Mind you, the screening was initially intended as a   affair, with men having the option to attend literally any other screening at either the Drafthouse or infinite multiplexes around the world. Men make 20 percent more money than women they perform fewer child care duties and household chores (even when their wives are the family breadwinners). They pay less for pants and haircuts, and they are responsible for dictating our abortion laws. The Austin, Texas cinema chain Alamo Drafthouse, where the screenings are set to be held, registered some fierce complaints from men on its Facebook account over what some critics called the “sexist”   showings. In its report about the special screenings, CBS noted a comment from one woman who attended the Brooklyn, New York showing and told 1010 WINS News about the male complaints: “Screw them. I really don’t have a lot to say to them, because their opinion does not matter to me. ” In another twist of the controversy, the charges of sexism led Stephen Clark, a gay Albany Law School professor, to file a complaint. “There was a vibrant argument happening on Facebook,” Clark, 48, told the Washington Post. “But when the theater responded to complaints, they were pretty snide about it and willing to mock anyone who had a complaint and that really struck me. ” “There is also the fact that what they were doing is illegal,” he added. Clark reportedly filed an administrative charge with Austin’s Equal Employment and Fair Housing Office, alleging the Drafthouse’s   showing discriminated against men based solely on their gender. He also claimed that, since the theater emphasized it would be staffing the events with only females as well, it was illegally practicing employment discrimination. “It’s the principle of the thing,” he told the Post. “I’m a gay man, and I’ve studied and taught gay rights for years. Our gay bars have long said that you do not exclude people because they’re gay or straight or transgender  —   you just can’t do that for any reason. ” “We have to deal with the bachelorette parties that come to the gay bar,” he added. “They’re terribly disruptive, but if you forbid women from coming to a gay bar, you’re starting down a slippery slope. It’s discrimination. ” While the theater has reacted to the accusations of sexism by doubling down and promising to expand its   screenings at its locations across the country, the Post says it walked back that sentiment, with this statement: “Obviously, Alamo Drafthouse recognizes ‘Wonder Woman’ is a film for all audiences, but our special   screenings may have created confusion  —   we want everybody to see this film. ” The chain’s latest announcement, however, about its June 6 showing, is as follows: The most iconic superheroine in comic book history finally has her own movie, and what better way to celebrate than with an   screening? Apologies, gentlemen, but we’re embracing our girl power and saying “No Guys Allowed” for one special night at the Alamo Ritz. And when we say “People Who Identify As Women Only,” we mean it. Everyone working at this screening  —   venue staff, projectionist, and culinary team  —   will be female. So lasso your geeky girlfriends together and grab your tickets to this celebration of one of the most enduring and inspiring characters ever created. The   screenings have led the theater chain to expand its   program across the country. “We are very excited to present select,   WONDER WOMAN screenings at Alamo Drafthouse,” Morgan Hendrix, Alamo Drafthouse creative manager said in a statement to the Post. “That providing an experience where women truly reign supreme has incurred the wrath of trolls only serves to deepen our belief that we’re doing something right. ” Jezebel briefly mentioned that proceeds for the special screenings would benefit abortion vendor Planned Parenthood at the very end of its article: The theater did apologize, cheekily, to anyone offended, saying it was “truly, truly, truly sorry sorry. ”) But it needn’t have, especially since the screening’s proceeds are going to Planned Parenthood. The Warner Bros. blockbuster hauled in more than $100 million in its domestic opening weekend  —   a historic feat for a   feature film.",0
19424,Robin Roberts Says While She Was Dying from Cancer a ‘Familiar Voice’ Came From Her Nurse and Brought Her Back,"Share on Twitter 
For Robin Roberts, losing her mother while she was in the midst of her own fight for her life was an especially hard blow. Roberts's mother had always been there for her through every illness and injury. 
When she needed her mom the most, however, Roberts swears that she could hear her voice, encouraging her not to give up on life. Image Credit: Mireya Acierto/Getty Images 
As PopSugar reports, on a recent episode of “ Harry ,” the “Good Morning America” co-host tearfully recounted the days she spent in the hospital after a bone marrow transplant. Famously open about her battles with breast cancer and a rare bone marrow disease, Roberts tells host Harry Connick Jr. that she had reached the point where the fight was too much for her: 
“There was a time when I sent everybody away, and I was in my room, and I just felt like I'm slipping away. I just couldn't.” 
One of the things that had made Roberts feel like giving up was the fact that her mother was no longer there by her side. However, she was soon to find that her mom was closer than she realized. She tells Harry: 
“I kept hearing this voice, 'Robin! Robin! Robin!' And suddenly, I open my eyes, and it's ... my nurse Jenny. She's looking at me. That was my mother's voice. I am convinced, when I was hearing that, even though it was Jenny, it was my mother's voice I was hearing.” 
Roberts believes that at her point of “ greatest isolation ,” her mother used Jenny to call her back, to remind her to keep fighting. 
Jenny, Roberts says, was “invaluable” during this time. Acknowledging the bond between Roberts and her nurse, Harry surprised Roberts by reuniting her with nurse Jenny and another nurse who had cared for her. An emotional Roberts was able to thank them for not only everything they had done for her, but for what they have done for countless others: 
“Thank you for being our lifeline. Thank you for being there— not only for us, but for our caregivers ... for our loved ones.” ",0
19425,Jodie Foster Is Still Afraid of Failure - The New York Times,"CULVER CITY, Calif.  —   Because of the political moment in which it’s landing, the new movie “Money Monster”  —   about a cheesy TV financial guru and the viewer who takes him hostage  —   will almost surely be seen as a parable of income inequality and a rigged economy. Which, in large part, it is. But to its director, Jodie Foster, it covers terrain more intimate than that, and more personal. It’s a meditation on failure: how keenly people fear it, what they do when confronted with it. Its two main characters, captor and captive, inhabit the same purgatory. They’re coming to terms with their own inadequacy. “Failure is a big one for me  —   people in spiritual crisis, in a moment in life of total ” Ms. Foster told me recently, explaining how the movie, to be released May 13, connects to her. Does she often think of herself as a failure? “Oh yeah,” she said. “Oh my God, yeah. If Mother Teresa is propelled to do good works because she believes in God, I am propelled to do good works because of how bad I feel about myself. It’s the first place I go. ‘Oh, what did I do wrong? ’” This is not the direction in which you expect a conversation with a   Oscar winner to turn. But as guarded as so many decades in the spotlight have made Ms. Foster, there’s also something naked about her, a   too fervent to stay hidden. You see it in her best performances. You saw it at the Golden Globes in 2013, when she accepted an honorary award with a raw, rambling speech that set the Internet ablaze: Had she just come out of the closet? Had she even been in the closet? She was asking at once to be understood and to be left alone, still searching all these years later for a resolution to the contradiction of celebrity, and her remarks were so messy in their way that I was stunned when she told me that she’d scripted them carefully in advance. “Every word,” she said, adding that she even had them put on a teleprompter. “I didn’t want to get it wrong. ” But what precisely was she trying to get right? The world was fixated on her allusions to her private life. She was focused on an announcement about her professional one: On the far side of 50, she was pivoting toward less glamorous work behind the scenes. She hasn’t taken a new acting assignment since, instead concentrating on directing. “Money Monster” is her fourth   effort along those lines, after “Little Man Tate” (1991) “Home for the Holidays” (1995) and “The Beaver” (2011) and it’s by far the most ambitious, a New York City thriller with SWAT teams, explosives, George Clooney and Julia Roberts. Mr. Clooney is the financial guru, who loosely evokes Jim Cramer, the host of the CNBC cable show “Mad Money. ” Ms. Roberts is his producer, who’s in his ear throughout the hostage crisis, talking him through it, as steady as he is spastic. (The captor is played by Jack O’Connell.) One striking aspect of the movie is how large Ms. Roberts’s character looms, and I asked Ms. Foster if that would have been the case in a male director’s hands. She said that she hadn’t thought about that, but, in fact, many of the screenplay revisions that she requested involved fleshing out that role. Strong women are her trademark as a performer, the thread running through “The Accused” (her first Oscar for best actress) “The Silence of the Lambs” (her second) “Panic Room,” “Flightplan,” “The Brave One” and more. But not just strong women: women who don’t turn to a man in the clutch women whose strength is inseparable from the walls they’ve built around themselves. They’re “solitary characters who don’t have mothers and fathers and boyfriends,” she told me, and they demonstrate her desire, when acting, “to have an experience that’s all mine, and I don’t really want to share it. ” “Yet I’m totally desperate to communicate it to you,” she said. “It’s a really weird dichotomy. And I think that’s me in life. ” She sat on a couch, legs curled under her and shoes kicked off, in an office here on the lot of Sony Pictures, which is distributing “Money Monster. ” I’d last seen her in downtown Manhattan months earlier, when she was shooting a crucial scene and when she described, within minutes of our meeting, how powerfully the Clooney part spoke to her. “He’s just a guy on TV, but he’s imbued with this sense of power,” she said, adding that he’s forced to ask questions that she has asked herself: “Am I real? Am I a sellout? Is all of this real?” She meant the adulation that comes with fame, which she achieved early. The year she turned 14, she had five movies released, including “Freaky Friday,” “Bugsy Malone” and “Taxi Driver,” in which her precocious turn as an underage prostitute earned her an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress. During her time at Yale University, she acted in another five movies, juggling them with her studies, including a thesis on   literature. Henry Louis Gates Jr. then teaching there, was one of her advisers. She babysat for his two young children, and he recalled arranging an interview for her with Toni Morrison and telling the novelist only that his student Alicia Foster  —   that’s Jodie’s real name  —   was en route. “When she walked in, I think Toni almost had a heart attack,” Professor Gates, now at Harvard, told me. He and Ms. Foster remain friends, and he said that he still marvels at the poise that “allowed her to get through a crisis that probably would have been crushing to most of us. ” He was referring to John Hinckley Jr. ’s shooting of President Reagan, which Mr. Hinckley, who had stalked Ms. Foster, said he did to impress her. She was in her freshman year at Yale. Not long after she graduated, she considered ditching movies altogether and doing graduate work with Professor Gates. “The Accused” was about to be released, and she was convinced that the movie and her performance were no good. Her mother, Evelyn, worried that “The Silence of the Lambs” would be a mistake and, as Ms. Foster remembers it, said to her: “The good part is Hannibal Lecter. Why are you taking the dull part?” The two have always been extraordinarily close  —   her mother was a single mom and carefully steered her career early on  —   so it pained the actress when they had a much bigger tussle over “Nell,” in which Ms. Foster played a wild woman (literally) who spoke a gibberish of her own invention. Evelyn Foster channeled her broader apprehensions about the movie into her daughter’s specific decision to darken her hair for the role. “She was relentless, and she wouldn’t get off it,” Ms. Foster said. “She was yelling at me. Why did I have to dye my hair? She was just like, ‘You’re ruining your image,’ or whatever it was. And I remember sending her this really long letter, and the letter was, ‘I really love you, but I’m not going to talk to you for four and a half months,’” until the movie wraps. “She totally got it  —   she sent me flowers,” Ms. Foster added. “And then I talked to her four months later. That was one of the movies where if I thought for one minute that I was making a fool of myself, I would not be able to perform. ” She made clear to me that she was sharing that story only because it couldn’t embarrass her mother, who has advanced dementia. Ms. Foster is mindful of the privacy of family members, including her two sons, the oldest of whom will leave for college in the fall, and her wife, the photographer Alexandra Hedison. The couple began their relationship soon after that Golden Globes speech and were wed in early 2014. Ms. Foster deflected questions about that. “I never will talk about marriage and friends,” she said. “There are only so many steps I can take to protect people I love. There’s only so much I can do to keep them safe. It’s kind of a horrible feeling to know that if somebody’s close to you, you put them in danger of being hurt, of being sullied  —   trivialized  —   just by virtue of knowing you. ” In the Globes speech, she fleetingly acknowledged a previous relationship to Cydney Bernard, describing her as “my heroic   my   in love but righteous soul sister in life. ” Did she intend that as the kind of declaration about her sexual orientation that some   advocates had long pressed for? “Everything I have to say on that subject, I said that night,” she told me, acknowledging that some people remained puzzled. “I can be vague. Vague is moving to me. ” In recent years, she has directed episodes of “Orange Is the New Black” and “House of Cards,” picking up Emmy and Directors Guild of America nominations. But her chance to helm movies came earlier, even though that opportunity still eludes many women. She was spared such resistance because so many male executives “knew me as the    who showed up on time, and they didn’t see it as a risk,” she said. “They looked at me as if I was a daughter. They’d seen me grow up. They knew my professionalism. ” So did the “Money Monster” producers. “Talk to anyone who has worked with her,” said one of them, Lara Alameddine. “They’ll tell you the same thing. She is the most prepared person. She’s the first one there and the last one to leave. ” Mel Gibson, who starred in “The Beaver,” said that “the way she directs films, the way she does anything  —   it’s just very smart. She attacks it and deals with it and delivers. ” The two formed a deep friendship after making “Maverick” more than two decades ago, though their bond baffles outsiders. “It’s not my job to adjudicate his behavior,” she said. “He’s certainly not sexist and certainly not racist. I know the guy I know, somebody who’s really emotional, who I can have long, long conversations with, who’s trustworthy, who shows up for me. ” Mr. Gibson said: “I just love her, that’s all. You meet people like that sometimes. You just instantly fall in love, and that’s it, and it’s the purest kind of thing. We call each other up all the time and just say, ‘Hey, I love you. ’” Ms. Foster’s current emphasis on directing over acting partly recognizes that at 53, she won’t find as many great roles as she once did. But it also reflects her ceaseless process of   and  . “Everybody in my life said to me: When you stop acting, you’re going to be lost,” she said, meaning that directors don’t quite have the visibility and currency of actual movie stars. “What are you going to do when people don’t take your phone call or when you can’t get a reservation in a restaurant?” I looked for some sign that she was being falsely modest or pulling my leg. Amazingly, she wasn’t. “Maybe I’ll lose my identity,” she said. “But I guess I need to find out, and I’m willing to take that chance. ”",0
19426,Coalition Nations Seek to Put North Korea in a Vise,"Coalition Nations Seek to Put North Korea in a Vise October 27, 2016 Coalition Nations Seek to Put North Korea in a Vise 
Japan, the United States and South Korea agreed on Thursday to work together to put more pressure on North Korea to get it to abandon its nuclear and missile programs , Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Shinsuke Sugiyama said. Tension on the Korean peninsula has been high this year, beginning with North Korea's fourth nuclear test in January, which was followed by a satellite launch, a string of tests of various missiles, and its fifth and largest nuclear test last month, all in defiance of international sanctions.Co ""We reaffirmed the necessity to increase pressure against North Korea to have it give up its nuclear and missile development and realise the denuclearization of the peninsula,"" Sugiyama told reporters. He was speaking after a meeting in Tokyo with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken and South Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Lim Sung-nam. 
(TOKYO) - Russia and North Korea's lone major ally, China, have pushed for a resumption of six-party talks on denuclearization in North Korea. The talks, which also involve Japan, South Korea and the United States, have been on hold since 2008. 
Lim said his government had decided to resume talks with Japan for the conclusion of General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA), a pact that would share sensitive information on North Korea's missile and nuclear activities.

The signing of the agreement was expected in 2012, but South Korea postponed it amid domestic opposition against concluding such a security pact with Japan, a one-time colonial ruler. 
Tokyo's ties with Seoul, plagued by a territorial spat and Japan's past military aggression, have warmed after reaching a landmark agreement last December to resolve the issue of Korean girls and women forced to work in Japan's wartime brothels.

19427,Two liberals on a crusade submit petition for Oregon to secede from the Union,"Two liberals on a crusade submit petition for Oregon to secede from the Union New petition hopes to make Oregon a 'safe space' as bigoted liberals plan State's succession By Shepard Ambellas - November 11, 2016 PORTLAND ( INTELLIHUB ) — Two liberals by the names of Jennifer Rollins and Christian Trejbal, likely offended by the powerhouse personality of the new President-Elect, have filed a petition for the State of Oregon to secede from the Union. 
The petition for a 2018 ballot initiative will require only 1,000 signatures to move forward as the two wish to make the state a liberal safe-space, where robust personalities with vigor can’t encroach on their feelings. 
Trejbal told the Oregonian Thursday, “Oregonian values are no longer the values held by the rest of the United States.” 
“Those values? “Life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.” 
So essentially you have two bigoted liberals who likely crave open borders, more tax, more security arising from false flag attacks like 9/11 and transgender bathrooms. 
Is this what they call “happiness?” 
Ladies and gentlemen, if this is the mindset of Oregonians — then all I have to say is good riddance. 
However, I suspect that it is not the mindset of most Oregonians and that these two crazed loons have their own agenda in which it is okay for them to express their ideology but they do not want others, like Trump, to express his. 
The not so dynamic duo plans to get the 1,000 signatures needed by the end of Thursday.

19428,Ooh Fuck,"Wednesday 9 November 2016 by Lucas Wilde Ooh Fuck 
“Ooh Fuck”, according to reports. 
Not much more is known regarding the statement, although some are speculating that it may have something to do with some kind of earthquake that happened in America last night. 
It is unknown if the earthquake was literal or simply a clumsy metaphor from a lazy satirist. 
“Ooh Fuck,” confirmed Democrat party spokesperson, Jay Cooper. 
“That’s all I have to say on the matter. I think it’s fairly conclusive. 
“You can direct any other questions to my secretary. I have several lines of coke to attend to.” 
“Ooh fuck,” verified Cooper’s secretary, Elizabeth King. 
“This is going to require a lot of alcohol and a fair few enquiries to the Canadian passport office- forgive me, I have said too much. Excuse me, I need to leave the room immediately.” 
Americans nationwide were either weeping while exclaiming “Ooh Fuck” or, in some cases, whooping and hollering and high-fiving while cheerfully exclaiming “Ooh Fuck!” 
A bleary-eyed Donald Trump reportedly awoke from his slumber this morning, remembered what happened last night and exclaimed “Ooh Fuck”; presumably having been hit with full magnitude of some kind of job that lay before him.

19429,Republicans Complain Planned Parenthood Defunding Provision Endangering Obamacare Repeal - Breitbart,"Some Republican lawmakers are complaining the Obamacare repeal bill that contains the provision to eliminate Planned Parenthood’s taxpayer funding will make repeal of the healthcare law more difficult. [“I don’t think it makes sense to have the defunding of Planned Parenthood linked to this issue at all,” said Sen. Susan Collins ( ) according to The Hill. “If the House Republicans want to bring it up, it should be in a separate bill. I would oppose that bill, but it further complicates the negotiations to have it included in this bill. ”  “I think we should also separate out the Planned Parenthood issue from the broader healthcare issue,” Rep. Charlie Dent ( ) also said. “I think healthcare reform is controversial and complex enough without Planned Parenthood. Why put it in? It makes this whole exercise more difficult. ” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in January that the Obamacare repeal bill would also defund Planned Parenthood. With the use of the reconciliation budgetary procedure, Republicans would need 50 votes in the Senate to pass the legislation. In February, Sen. Lisa Murkowski ( ) announced she would not be voting with fellow Republicans for an Obamacare repeal bill that defunds Planned Parenthood. “Taxpayer dollars should never be used to pay for abortions, but I will not vote to deny Alaskans access to the health services that Planned Parenthood provides,” she said. “‪It’s illogical for any senator to claim she does not want tax dollars being used to fund abortion, while at the same time insisting that the federal government continue to lavish money on Planned Parenthood,” Dr. Grazie Pozo Christie, a policy advisor for The Catholic Association, tells Breitbart News. “As long as Planned Parenthood continues to perform abortions, and especially as long as abortion is their core business, they should not receive the   money of American taxpayers,” she adds. “Any tax money redirected to Comprehensive Community Health Centers from the abortion giant will only enhance and increase medical services for   women. ” Members of the   base of the GOP have stood by for years as GOP congressional leaders have explained they would need to wait for a   Senate and a Republican president in the White House to eliminate taxpayer funding for the nation’s largest abortion business. With Republicans in control of both chambers of Congress and a Republican administration now in place in the White House, the expectation is that goal will finally be realized. Trump made four promises to his   constituents: Liberal Republican members of Congress, however, have placed their support for Planned Parenthood ahead of their party’s attempts to pass other legislation in the past. Murkowski joined Collins and former Sen. Mark Kirk ( ) in 2015 to try to remove a provision to end Planned Parenthood’s taxpayer funding from the Obamacare repeal bill. In 2011, Collins received a personal “ ” letter from Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards, who expressed her gratitude that the Maine senator voted to continue funding her abortion business: Thank you for standing up for the millions of Americans who rely on Planned Parenthood for their primary and preventive health care.

19431,DreamWorks Animation Sale Leaves Jeffrey Katzenberg at a Crossroads - The New York Times,"LOS ANGELES  —   For the past decade, Jeffrey Katzenberg’s identity has been indistinguishable from the DreamWorks Animation brand. A relentless advocate for his little studio, he became famous for making 40 phone calls and conducting three breakfast meetings before 10 a. m. (He always orders the same thing: Diet Coke.) Mr. Katzenberg’s campaign to keep DreamWorks Animation afloat, even as a changing film business made that increasingly difficult, came down to one desire: He wanted to be his generation’s Lew Wasserman, the M. C. A. chief who was Hollywood’s big everything  —   biggest political power, biggest cultural force, biggest business mogul. On Thursday, part of that dream ended. DreamWorks Animation, essentially the sole remaining piece of a splashy conglomerate founded in 1994 by Mr. Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg and David Geffen, said it would sell itself to Comcast’s sprawling NBCUniversal for $3. 8 billion. In return for a personal payout estimated at $420 million, Mr. Katzenberg, 65, will reluctantly step aside, having never quite managed to become that kingpin. The deal will provide NBCUniversal with family film franchises like “How to Train Your Dragon,” “Shrek” and “Kung Fu Panda” that it can use in its quest to compete with Disney in the global theme park, consumer products and children’s television businesses. But Hollywood was really only interested in one thing: Why did the intense and bespectacled Mr. Katzenberg, a   animation enthusiast, finally call it a day? For more than two decades, Mr. Katzenberg has been a fixture among Hollywood’s elite, sitting courtside at Los Angeles Lakers games with the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio and Rihanna and reigning over an annual Oscar   that draws every mogul in town. In 2012, he made White House officials blanch by insisting President Obama spend extended time chatting with donors at George Clooney’s mansion he got his way. But as Mr. Geffen has graduated to philanthropy, donating hundreds of millions of dollars and seeing his name go up on the walls of some of the country’s top cultural institutions, when he’s not sailing the world on his   and Mr. Spielberg has continued to make   films, Mr. Katzenberg has had to mostly focus on the grinding task of keeping DreamWorks Animation going. With that chapter closed, Mr. Katzenberg must now decide what to do. Stephen B. Burke, NBCUniversal’s chief executive and senior vice president of Comcast, suggested in a phone interview that Mr. Katzenberg could find a next act in digital media, perhaps following the example of Barry Diller, the former Hollywood executive who built  . (Mr. Katzenberg started his career at Paramount Pictures as Mr. Diller’s assistant.) Others wondered if Mr. Katzenberg was positioning himself for an ambassadorship should Hillary Clinton win the presidency. (After supporting President Obama in 2008, he has recently been one of Mrs. Clinton’s top  .) There is also the possibility that Mr. Katzenberg could follow Mr. Geffen’s example and turn to philanthropy. Mr. Katzenberg seemed unsure how to handle the questions about his future. He initially agreed to speak to a reporter. But that pledge was ultimately reversed, with a spokesman saying that Mr. Katzenberg instead wished the spotlight to shine on Comcast. At a 10 a. m. meeting on Thursday for DreamWorks Animation’s 1, 500 employees, held near a monumental fountain on the studio’s   campus in Glendale, Calif. Mr. Katzenberg struck an upbeat tone, according to attendees. “I rest easy in knowing that the house of dreams that we’ve spent the last two decades building together  —   the stories, the characters, the joy and the laughter  —   has found the best possible home,” he said, standing near two senior Universal executives. He added, “This is not a deal that we needed to do, but it’s the deal I’d always hoped would come along. ” The reality is that Mr. Katzenberg finds himself as both a winner and loser. After years of failed efforts to escape a    cycle driven by sporadic film releases, he finally found a rich solution for his company. Comcast paid more than many people thought DreamWorks Animation was worth. (“Comcast Overpays,” read the headline of a blog post written by Rich Greenfield, a BTIG Research analyst.) DreamWorks Animation shareholders will receive $41 a share in cash. “I think we can take their existing I. P. and do more with it,” Mr. Burke said. The price puts DreamWorks Animation on par with Lucasfilm, the “Star Wars” studio that Disney bought in 2012 for about $4 billion. And Mr. Katzenberg will retain a business platform, albeit a tiny one: Comcast said he would serve as chairman of a new entity, DreamWorks New Media, which will be made up of AwesomenessTV, an online studio and distributor of content aimed at teenage girls, and NOVA, a fledgling unit that uses   animation technology to assist companies like Nike and Burberry with marketing campaigns. (Contrary to reports, NBCUniversal has not decided what to do with AwesomenessTV, which is partly owned by Verizon, a Comcast rival. “You could imagine a situation where AwesomenessTV doesn’t stay as part of the company forever, but it could easily be the other way,” Mr. Burke said. “We don’t know. ”) Even so, Thursday was a day of loss for Mr. Katzenberg. People close to him said he struggled with the decision. In previous sale and merger attempts  —   notably one with SoftBank in 2014, followed by one with Hasbro  —   Mr. Katzenberg intended to come along for the ride by continuing to run the studio. But Comcast made it clear that it was only willing to pay such a high price if it could create synergies by folding DreamWorks Animation into its Universal Pictures unit, and that could happen only if Mr. Katzenberg ceded control. NBCUniversal wanted its own animation chief, Christopher Meledandri, the executive responsible for the “Despicable Me” franchise, to oversee all operations. Mr. Burke acknowledged that the sale was “not an easy thing for Jeff to grapple with,” adding, “It is his baby. ” The deal came together rapidly. Two weeks ago, Mr. Burke said he received a call from his boss, Brian L. Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive. They had heard a whisper that Mr. Katzenberg was considering a maneuver, possibly with a Chinese backer, to take his studio private. They thought that Mr. Katzenberg might instead sell to them. Mr. Roberts placed a call to Mr. Katzenberg, who immediately picked up the phone. Mr. Katzenberg told Mr. Roberts that, depending on Comcast’s price, he would love to talk. Mr. Roberts called Mr. Burke with the news, and the two men, along with a few other Comcast executives, flew to Los Angeles on April 15. The next morning at 7 a. m. the Comcast executives met Mr. Katzenberg and his top lieutenant, Ann Daly, at a downtown law office. The deal making quickly grew fast and furious, to use a term associated with a Universal movie franchise. The end of DreamWorks as a   company  —   Mr. Spielberg in December folded what remained of the company’s   film label into his Amblin Partners  —   reflects a changing Hollywood, where the collapse of the DVD market overwhelmed many independent studios. But the various DreamWorks enterprises also never quite gelled, perhaps because the aims of the company’s founders, despite their personal ties, almost always diverged. Mr. Spielberg, a prolific producer and director, was drawn to his own projects, and seemed often to make the most lucrative among them for companies other than DreamWorks. Mr. Geffen, a financial godfather to his partners, long ago lost interest in movies, and in 2008 withdrew from active involvement in the companies. Mr. Katzenberg, meanwhile, poured himself into DreamWorks Animation, which seemed forever trapped in a creative chase behind its rival Pixar, which often bested it at the box office and on the Oscar circuit. Mr. Katzenberg also got bogged down in an endless fight for positive quarterly earnings news and fresh capital. DreamWorks was founded shortly after Mr. Katzenberg left a senior Disney job amid deteriorating relations with then its chief executive, Michael Eisner. “Times change, the marketplace changes, the original reason the company was founded ceased to exist,” said Terry Press, a former DreamWorks executive who is now president of CBS Films. “The one thing that never changes,” she added, “is Jeffrey’s iron will to succeed. ”",0

19435,"Coming Soon, Economists Hope: Big Spending on Roads, Bridges and Ports - The New York Times","OAKLAND, Calif.  —   The docks at the Port of Oakland are a tangle of cranes, shipping containers, railroad tracks and snaking lines of trucks waiting to load and unload cargo. Streamlining this kind of traffic is one of the few ideas Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton agree on. Mrs. Clinton has said that if she is elected president, her administration  will seek to spend $250 billion over five years on repairing and improving the nation’s infrastructure  —   not just ports but roads, bridges, energy systems and   broadband  —   and would put an additional $25 billion toward a national infrastructure bank to spur related business investments. Mr. Trump said he wanted to go even bigger, saying his administration would spend at least twice as much as Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Trump, taking a page from liberal economists, said he would fund his plan by borrowing several hundred billion dollars, but has offered no specifics. Mrs. Clinton’s more detailed proposal, by contrast, would be paid for by a business tax overhaul aimed at collecting additional revenue from companies that have parked assets abroad. These are only plans, of course. Either would have to get through Congress and the inevitable acrimony over any proposal to raise taxes or add to the national debt. Still, the candidates’ agreement, combined with growing accord among economists that increased spending on infrastructure could invigorate the American economy and raise overall living standards, has led to a cautious optimism that some sort of big public works push is coming, regardless of who is elected. “The next administration will be in prime position to deliver on a comprehensive infrastructure plan,” said Tom Jensen, vice president for transportation policy at UPS. Infrastructure spending, unlike many other forms of government outlays, holds the power to give the economy a sustained lift for decades down the line. First comes the addition of jobs  —   particularly the kinds of     jobs that have been lost in recent years  —   and spending on products like concrete and steel to build new roads and repair   bridges. After that initial jolt, the economy would continue to reap the important but    benefits of fewer delays, faster internet connections and more reliable power. You can see much of that here at one of the nation’s busiest ports, an export hub that sends tons of important California products like Napa Valley wine, Central Valley almonds and Silicon Valley Teslas to China’s growing middle class. Aiming to gain other ports’ market share, Oakland has embarked on a number of projects  —   some big, some small  —   to add cargo and speed things up. There are new   measures, such as an appointment system for trucks picking up cargo and extended hours at its largest terminal. It is also working on several infrastructure projects: This year, the port applied for a $140 million federal grant to build a bridge over a choked intersection where trucks waste time waiting for trains to pass. A   away sit 14 new rail lines that are part of a new operation where shippers can transfer products from one container to another without leaving the port. Shipping companies often make these transfers at   warehouses  —   wasting more time and money. The Port of Oakland, which acts as a landlord, is hoping its investment will entice companies to move more cargo to its docks. This would not just give the port more rent. The economy would also gain additional jobs as private sector shippers added their own money to erect buildings near the port’s rail connection, and fill them with machines. Weakness in those kinds of business investments is one reason the current economic recovery has been so sluggish. Companies’ spending on new buildings and equipment, which depends in part on improvements in the nation’s transportation network and energy and digital pipelines, has been a persistent weak point throughout the nation’s recovery from the Great Recession. The federal government, with its wide latitude to spend on ambitious projects, is in a singular position to make investments no one else will. But the government’s power to act has also set off a robust debate about how much more it should spend on infrastructure and how it should be funded. Spend too little, and the nation’s backbone deteriorates and the cost of future repairs mounts. Spend too much too fast, and the government could crowd out private investment, possibly leading to higher inflation and pushing up interest rates. Today, with maintenance lacking and interest rates low, a host of influential economists, including Lawrence H. Summers, who served as Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, argue that America’s need for better infrastructure is so great that it could increase its debt load and still come out ahead. In a telephone interview, Mr. Summers laid out his case: The federal government can borrow at something like 1 percent interest a year, and through enhanced productivity it would reap something like 3 percent a year in higher tax receipts. “I am as worried about the debt burden on my children’s generation as anybody, but deferring maintenance on the foundation of our economy is a much greater risk to them,” Mr. Summers said. Others argue that any rise in infrastructure spending should be paid for through a tax increase or budget cuts elsewhere. That view was bolstered by a recent report by the Congressional Budget Office, which concluded that while federal investment increased productivity, that did not automatically mean the nation would be better off by borrowing to fund such investment. Decades ago, the federal government spent big. The Interstate System of highways spawned new suburbs, and transportation grants helped build rail networks like the Bay Area Rapid Transit System, whose commuter trains hum past the Port of Oakland as they travel to and from San Francisco. Now the United States has more people and a bigger economy. But relative to its gross domestic product, the nation spends only about half as much on infrastructure as it did during the 1950s and ’60s. The result is that, like the population itself, America’s roads, bridges and power plants are aging. That’s one reason the American Society of Civil Engineers, in its most recent report card on infrastructure, gave the United States a   despite the extra infrastructure spending that flowed from the big 2009 economic recovery act. The costs are substantial, if hard to see. Neglect the water system, and you may have leaky pipes and larger bills, or even lead contamination. Rough roads equal more flat tires. Substandard internet connections add to the isolation of rural communities. Each day, UPS drivers in northern New Jersey and New York City lose an average of 16 minutes  —   often much longer  —   to heavy traffic. Six years ago the company started dispatching an additional 61 drivers to make sure everyone hit their stops, and it would need more drivers if traffic got worse. Of course, even if tens of billions of dollars more were set aside for road improvements, that would not on its own guarantee that traffic congestion would ease. Infrastructure may be among the most bipartisan of federal spending areas, but politics in general can be a problem. One of the persistent criticisms from economists is federal lawmakers’ tendency to spread cash across the country instead of focusing on places where the economic payoff would be greatest. And apart from the debate over how to pay for national upgrades, there is the question of how much can be gained from additional infrastructure spending versus how much can be gained by making better use of what is already in place. Clifford Winston, an economist at the Brookings Institution and a longtime critic of how the government builds and runs the nation’s transportation infrastructure, laid out a long list. An increase in infrastructure spending would still lift the economy, Mr. Winston said, “but my God, wouldn’t it be so much better if we were more thoughtful about what we do with the money we have?” This, at least, is where the nation’s   grade turns out to be good news. Economists say infrastructure’s productivity lift is greatest when investment is being raised from low levels. Put another way: The more broken down the nation becomes, the harder it is to find something that does not need to be fixed. “We’re not talking about bridges to nowhere,” Mr. Summers said. “We’re talking about bridges that are on the verge of collapsing. ”",0
19436,What Does Trump’s Executive Order Against Obamacare Actually Do? - The New York Times,"Donald J. Trump ran on a campaign promise to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. So it should not come as a surprise that he has signed an executive order urging his administration to fight it as much as possible. But that order, alone, won’t allow President Trump to unwind the sprawling health law known as Obamacare. Mr. Trump and Republican leaders in Congress are engaged in negotiations about legislation that might substantially undo or replace the health law. Even before the inauguration, Congress  took a first step toward gutting major provisions. But as that process underscores, major changes to health policy will require new legislation. The Trump executive order should be seen more as a mission statement, and less as a monarchical edict that can instantly change the law. Mr. Trump has sent a strong signal that he intends to fight the health law, but he sent signals that were strong on the campaign trail, too, just in less legalistic language. And the order, crucially, notes that agencies can act only “to the maximum extent permitted by law. ” (How the Trump administration interprets those permissions, of course, is yet untested.) The order spells out the various ways that a Trump administration might fight the parts of the health law until new legislation comes: by writing new regulations and exercising discretion where allowed. Regulations can be changed, but, as the order notes, only through a legal process of “notice and comment” that can take months or years. On matters of discretion, the administration can move faster, but there are limited places where current law gives the administration much power to quickly change course. How much of the order is bluster and how much it signals a set of significant policy changes in the pipeline is unclear. The order was not specific and did not direct any particular actions. “Right off the bat, what do they do  —   something incredibly cryptic that nobody understands,” said Rodney Whitlock, a vice president of M. L. Strategies, a Washington consulting firm. Mr. Whitlock was a longtime health policy aide to Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa. The easiest way for the Trump administration to undermine the health law would be to stop defending a lawsuit brought by the House of Representatives. That suit said  that the Obama administration lacked the authority to pay certain Obamacare subsidies. A lower court ruled for the House, meaning that by simply withdrawing from the appeal, the Trump administration could start a process to eliminate those subsidies and cause a collapse of the insurance market. Mr. Trump’s order said nothing about that policy choice. Another important area of discretion has to do with exemptions to the law’s unpopular individual mandate to obtain insurance. Under the law, all Americans who can afford it are expected to obtain health insurance, unless they have experienced some hardship that would make it impossible. People who feel there has been such a hardship can apply for an exemption, and employees in the Department of Health and Human Services and the Internal Revenue Service can decide on their case. Under a Trump administration, it might become easier to claim hardship and get out of the requirement to buy insurance. But people seeking those exemptions will still have to apply for them, in writing, and can do so only at particular times of the year. Current law requires them to provide documentation supporting their claim that they have recently filed for bankruptcy, for example, or been evicted, and they must legally attest to their honesty. The Trump administration could create new categories of hardship, but that would take time. And rules that effectively eliminate the requirement would almost certainly result in litigation. “It’s not a hardship to have to comply with the law, almost by definition,” said Timothy Jost, a professor of law at Washington and Lee University. Mr. Jost, who supports the health law, has examined the underlying regulations in detail. Defanging the individual mandate could have significant consequences for the individual insurance markets. If fewer healthy people buy insurance, the costs of insuring everyone else will rise, leading insurance companies to raise prices or flee the market. Last week, the Congressional Budget Office published its estimate of what would happen under a law that eliminated the mandate and some other provisions: 18 million people would lose their insurance next year alone. It’s possible that insurers will look at the language of the order and get skittish, setting off a market collapse next year. But the order itself doesn’t yet change any rules. The health and human services department and the I. R. S. will have to take further action. “Is this mostly a symbolic gesture or a signal that they intend to take apart the law piece by piece to the extent they can?” said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group. “At a minimum, this creates a lot of uncertainty for insurers at a pretty critical time. ” The order directs the administration to give states more autonomy in directing health policy. And there’s a clear mechanism for that: Medicaid law provides a process in which states can waive many of the program’s usual rules to attempt “demonstration projects. ” Administrations have latitude under the law to decide what sort of new programs qualify. Mr. Trump’s selection for the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Seema Verma, has been an innovator in pushing this process in more conservative directions. Her selection, even more than the order, was a sign that the Trump administration would become more open to new Medicaid rules, including possible work requirements to obtain coverage, or premiums even for very poor Americans. But, as with the exemptions, there is still a process for such policy changes. States must submit detailed applications for waivers for the rules, and there is a legal review process that typically takes months. Mr. Trump recently promised that his team was developing a health care plan far better than the Affordable Care Act, that would insure more people and lower their costs. For people who heard that and thought Mr. Trump had gone soft on Obamacare, his executive order may come as a shock. But nothing in the order changes the law on its own. Whether Mr. Trump’s intention is a smooth transition or a rapid disruption in current policy will be determined by what comes next.",0
19437,Latest to Quit Google’s Self-Driving Car Unit: Top Roboticist - The New York Times,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   A roboticist and crucial member of the team that created Google’s   car is leaving the company, the latest in a string of departures by important technologists working on the autonomous car project. Chris Urmson, a Carnegie Mellon University research scientist, joined Google in 2009 to help create the   effort. He took over leadership of the team after Sebastian Thrun, the Stanford computer scientist and founder of Google X laboratory, left in 2013. Johnny Luu, a spokesman for Alphabet, the parent company of X, the company’s research division that oversees the car project, confirmed Mr. Urmson was planning to leave. “Seven years ago, the idea that a car could drive itself wasn’t much more than an idea. Chris has been a vital force for the project, helping the team move from a research phase to a point where this lifesaving technology will soon become a reality. He departs with our warmest wishes,” Mr. Luu wrote in an email message. The departures come after Google’s decision last year to hire John Krafcik, the former president and chief executive of Hyundai America, to be chief of the car project, as part of a plan to spin the effort out as a   company under the Alphabet umbrella. The X research group, often called Google’s “moonshot” division, is under increasing pressure to show that at some point the company can expect a financial windfall from its projects. Google’s   car project has been a pioneer in autonomous vehicle technology, but a commercial version of the car is still likely to be several years away. Mr. Urmson has been unhappy with the direction of the car project under Mr. Krafcik’s leadership and quarreled privately several months ago with Larry Page over where it was headed, according to two former Google employees. A spokesman for Google declined to comment on those discussions, but Mr. Urmson disputed they were a reason for his departure. After the dispute, Mr. Urmson decided to take the summer off and only recently decided to leave the company. He told members of the   car team about his decision on Thursday, the former employees said. In a post published on Medium Friday afternoon, Mr. Urmson said he had not decided what he will do next. “If I can find another project that turns into an obsession and becomes something more, I will consider myself twice lucky,” he wrote. “I have every confidence that the mission is in capable hands. ” As a researcher at Carnegie Mellon, Mr. Urmson was a member of a team of engineers that placed second in the 2005 Darpa Grand Challenge contest for autonomous vehicles that was won by a rival team from Stanford, led by Mr. Thrun. In 2007, Carnegie Mellon got revenge when it placed first in the Darpa Urban Challenge, while the Stanford team finished second. Earlier this year, a group of Google employees, led by Anthony Levandowski, former Google Car engineer, and Lior Ron, the product lead for Google Maps, left to found the   truck   Otto, which is based in San Francisco. More recently, two other Google car engineers, Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu, who are considered experts on   machine vision technology, left to found an      according to the two people with knowledge of the Google car project.",0
19438,"Comment on With assets of $½B, pro-Hillary Mariah Carey says women and minorities don’t get a fair deal by DCG","It never ceases to amaze me how, blinded by their narcissism, Hollyweirdos and other pop culture “celebrities” are rank hypocrites, utterly devoid of introspection. 
The latest exemplar: Pop singer Mariah Carey. 
Carey, 46, is the best-selling female singer of all time, with an estimate net worth of $500 million from her preternatural ability to screech like a dolphin in heat (apologies to dolphins). 
Born in New York state, Carey is biracial — her father is of African descent, her mother is of Irish descent — which makes Mariah Carey a racial “minority” in the U.S. 
Beginning at the 0:58 mark in the video below, Carey says she agrees with protests over the lack of women and minorities in “entertainment” because: 
“I don’t think women get a fair deal in anything . . . . [In the music business] it’s obvious that we’ve had to, you know, women and minorities have had to fight for, you know, trying to get equal opportunities for, for ages . . . . There’s not enough diversity . . . . I’m just an entertainer but, um, you know, I’m a fan of Hillary [Clinton] . . . of course I’m a fan of Hillary. Of course I would love to see a woman president.” 
Carey is very much in the news these days because Australian playboy billionaire James Packer recently broke off their engagement. Rumors have it that one of the reasons for the breakup was her “insane spending sprees”. 
According to an account in New York Post ‘s “ Page Six ” on Oct. 27, 2016, the following are examples of Carey’s “over-the-top . . . frenzied spending that may have doomed her engagement to Packer”: Sources say Carey “regularly drops $10,000 to get her hair and makeup perfect — even if it’s all going to last just a single day.” Power 105’s The Breakfast Club radio host Charlamagne Tha God, aka Lenard McKelvey, who knows the singer, told The Post : “Mariah is the last of the divas — she’s got a very old-school approach to stardom. It’s champagne-in-the-morning type stuff. She [once] shared some with the Breakfast Club staff at 10 o’clock in the morning, but she did not pour her own champagne — someone else poured it for her.” In 2014, Carey — who once called overhead lighting “abusive” — showed up to a filmed radio interview on The Breakfast Club over an hour late, with her own lighting crew in tow. McKelvey told The Post : “I remember thinking to myself, damn, what kind of disposable income she has where she has her own lighting director? That was the first and only time that that has ever happened on the radio show.” Carey reportedly drops at least $45,000 a year on spa treatments for her dogs — Jack Russells named Cha Cha and Jill E. Beans — even flying them first class to LA in January, which cost over $2,000 per dog. A close friend of Packer told Woman’s Day last month that Carey “spends $100,000 a month ordering exotic flowers from around the world to where she happens to be.” Carey has her own yacht, the Capri, which costs a cool $340,000 per week plus expenses to maintain, according to “Entertainment Tonight” . She would use a ferry to reach Packer’s boat, the Arctic P, which is the seventh-largest privately owned vessel in the world. Carey’s closet is “the stuff of legends, packed with more stilettos than the Barneys shoe department.” She has a room just to store her shoes. In a recent Instagram showing off part of her vast footwear collection, she calls the room “always my favorite room in the house”. 
But Mariah Carey tells us that women can’t get a fair deal in anything and, in the music business, women and minorities have to fight for equal opportunities. 
If you buy this delusional woman’s music or go to her concerts, you’re contributing to Mariah “Marie Antoinette” Carey’s obscene spending that pollutes the environment and squanders the world’s resources.

Jones was speaking to media for the first time since being his offseason arrest where he was caught on video wishing death on a cop when a reporter asked if he had anything to prove to the fans following his January assault, despite telling reporters he did not want to talk about his arrest. “Didn’t I just tell you don’t ask me that?” Jones replied. “You out   …     Turn around. Go back, go back that way. Bye. See you. Next question. ” “That’s his last interview of the year,” he said as he walked off. “Don’t come over here no more for the rest of the year. ” Per Fox 19, Jones continued to “lash out” at their reporter when cameras were off. He reportedly raised his voice and cursed at him. Teammates and head coach Marvin Lewis reportedly had to speak with Jones at his locker to calm him down. “Pacman,” who has a lengthy history of arrests, entered an   treatment program and anger management following his arrest on charges of harassment with a bodily substance, assault, obstructing official business and disorderly conduct for fighting with a security guard, and later spitting on a jail nurse.

19441,"Donald Trump Assails ‘Rigged’ Delegate System, Saying He Chooses Not to Exploit It - The New York Times","Join us for New York primary live updates. Insisting that the delegate selection process is “corrupt and crooked,” Donald J. Trump offered a vivid example on Sunday to prove his point. Imagine being wooed by Mr. Trump. “Look, nobody has better toys than I do,” he told reporters at a hotel on Staten Island, where he pressed his case that the system was rigged against him. “I can put them in the best planes and bring them to the best resorts anywhere in the world. ” But Mr. Trump said that was unseemly. “You’re basically buying these people,” he added. “You’re basically saying, ‘Delegate, listen, we’re going to send you to    on a Boeing 757, you’re going to use the spa, you’re going to this, you’re going to that, we want your vote.’ That’s a corrupt system. ” Mr. Trump’s comments were the latest salvo in an escalating war against the Republican National Committee over how delegates were being selected in the presidential race. On Sunday, two days before New York’s primaries, Mr. Trump was the only Republican presidential candidate to campaign in the state, where polls showed him with a wide lead. During his visit to Staten Island, a stronghold of his support, he accepted an award from the New York Veteran Police Association and spoke at a party brunch. At a rally in Poughkeepsie, he berated party officials once again. Still, speaking to reporters on Staten Island, Mr. Trump said he hoped that the July convention “doesn’t involve violence. ” “And I don’t think it will,” he said. “But I will say this: It’s a rigged system. It’s a crooked system. It’s 100 percent crooked. ” On the Democratic side, where the primary is expected to be closer, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders spent the day trying to drum up support. Polls have shown Mrs. Clinton with an edge over Mr. Sanders, but Mr. Sanders is hoping for an unexpectedly strong performance that would embarrass Mrs. Clinton on her adopted turf. Both candidates were knocked off balance this weekend when questioned about an issue with particular relevance in New York: a bill that would allow foreign governments to be held responsible in American courts for having a role in terrorist attacks, such as the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The New York Times reported on Friday that Saudi Arabia had told the Obama administration and members of Congress that it would sell off hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of American assets held by the kingdom if Congress passed the bill. The Obama administration has lobbied Congress to block the bill’s passage, The Times reported. In television interviews broadcast on Sunday, Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton said they needed more information to say where they stood on the bill. But after Mrs. Clinton’s interview aired, her campaign released a statement breaking with the Obama administration. The statement said Mrs. Clinton supported efforts “to secure the ability of   families and other victims of terrorist acts to hold accountable those responsible. ” Later in the day, Mr. Sanders’s campaign also issued a statement in support of the legislation. Mrs. Clinton made several stops in New York on Sunday. In Mount Vernon, she spoke at a Baptist church, saying she was the candidate most willing to take stands in favor of gun control, while in Upper Manhattan she danced at a block party in Washington Heights. She also held a rally on Staten Island. At a block party in the   section of Brooklyn, Mayor Bill de Blasio urged New Yorkers to help turn out votes for her, and Mrs. Clinton greeted him with a hug and a kiss on the cheek. “Anybody see the debate?” she asked, addressing the crowd from the bed of a Ford pickup truck and referring to the Democratic debate on Thursday in Brooklyn. “We talked about the greed and recklessness of Wall Street. I take a back seat to no one in taking them on. ” After hosting packed rallies around the state, Mr. Sanders turned his attention on Sunday to courting black voters in New York City, visiting a predominantly black church in Harlem and a Brownsville housing project. Mr. Sanders also had a rally in Prospect Park in Brooklyn, which his campaign said drew more than 28, 000 people, the largest crowd of his presidential bid. In Brownsville, Mr. Sanders toured the Howard Houses along with some local elected officials, and his campaign later released a plan for affordable housing. “This is the wealthiest country in the history of the world,” Mr. Sanders said. “People should not be forced to live in dilapidated housing. ” As Mr. Sanders walked across the complex, several residents happily shouted at him. But others pointedly criticized him for using the apartments for what they viewed as a photo opportunity. Anthony Portis, 34, a construction worker, called the senator’s visit “a political stunt to gain all the black votes in the neighborhood. ” “This area always feels like we are left out,” he said. Mr. Sanders said that he understood that some would be apprehensive about his visit but that he wanted to call attention to the issues faced by people in housing projects. “Believe me, I can understand the cynicism,” he said. “But my understanding is that not too many presidential candidates have come to Brownsville housing projects. ”",0
19442,Video Exposes Hillary Donor: “Blacks Are Seriously Fucked in The Head”,"We Are Change 
In the latest newly released Project Veritas video, James O’Keefe and crew have exposed a disturbing racism inside the Democratic party. Benjamin Barber, one of Hillary Clinton’s major donors, said “Blacks are seriously fucked in the head” for helping “the other side.”
In the video, a Project Veritas journalist talks to Benjamin Barber i nside a Democrat fundraiser for North Carolina U.S. Senate candidate Deborah Ross. In the video, Barber compared black people voting for Republicans to Sonderkommandos Jews who helped kill other Jews for the Nazis.

“Have you heard of the Sonderkommandos? Jewish guards who helped murder Jews in the camps. So there were even Jews that were helping the Nazis murder Jews! So blacks who are helping the other side are seriously fucked in the head. They’re only helping the enemy who will destroy them. Maybe they think ‘if I help them we’ll get along okay; somehow I’ll save my race by working with the murderers.’”
Deborah Ross also makes comments about black voters being less likely to vote if an ID law was passed requiring voters to provide a form of identification.
“Republicans know that African Americans are less likely to have the ID so they won’t vote.” – Democratic Senate candidate D eborah Ross. 
In another segment of the video the Project Veritas journalist says “so it’s like they are voting against their own self interest?” to both Benjamin Barber and Leah Barber.
Both responded agreeing with the journalist’s statement.
“It doesn’t make any sense, You’re voting against your self interest. In the name of change, what is the change that they want to see.” – Leah Barber
Project Veritas showed the comments made by Benjamin Barber and U.S. senate candidate Deborah Ross to several prominent black Americans who were all absolutely disgusted by the comments.
“Wow, so that’s what they think of us? I’m speechless. For the most part it’s wrong, it’s an eye opener but that’s what happens when we as blacks vote for one party,” Robert Foster said after seeing the video.
Pastor William Cooper weighed in when questioned if he was betraying his race as an African American voter voting for a Republican.
Cooper responded “absolutely not I think I’m benefiting my race by voting against the Democrat party that takes the African American vote for granted. They don’t offer us anything.”
Bishop Patrick Wooden added his frustration and disgust saying, “I think that Deborah Ross has showed her true colors, if that’s not racism and condescending and basically calling blacks stupid and ignorant and saying we’re voting against our own self interest if we support any Republican I am appalled.”
Pamela Wooden expressed her disappointment saying she “considered it an insult to see those accusations and hear that type of discussion is insulting to me as an African American.”
Finally, John Amanchukwu said that “It’s not just dark money, it’s racist and evil money filled with venom and you can look at his eyes in the video and you can see there’s a rage there and there’s a deep seeded resentment of African Americans.”

19443,Deep State Gone Wild: Comey Asserts Unprecedented FBI Supremacy - Breitbart,"James Comey asserted in his extraordinary testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee that the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is authorized to override Justice Department oversight procedures, a questionable claim which if true would raise serious questions about   rules aimed at preventing abuses by federal law enforcement officials. [The former head of the FBI told the Senate panel that he believed he had received a direction from the president in February that the FBI end its investigation of Michael Flynn’s alleged involvement with Russia —  a direction with which he and his   of “FBI senior leadership” unilaterally decided not to comply. The Comey cabinet then decided that it would not report the receipt of this direction to Attorney General Jeff Sessions or any other Justice Department superior.  The group decided that it could override standard FBI protocol and possibly legal obligations to report the incident because of its expectations that Sessions would recuse himself from the Russia matter, although that recusal would not come until weeks later. The Comey cabinet also decided that it wasn’t obligated to approach the acting Deputy Attorney General because he would likely be replaced soon. “We concluded it made little sense to report it to Attorney General Sessions, who we expected would likely recuse himself from involvement in   investigations. (He did so two weeks later.) The Deputy Attorney General’s role was then filled in an acting capacity by a United States Attorney, who would also not be long in the role,” Comey said. “After discussing the matter, we decided to keep it very closely held, resolving to figure out what to do with it down the road as our investigation progressed. ” According to three different former federal law enforcement officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, there is no precedent for the director of the FBI to refuse to inform a Deputy Attorney General of a matter because of his or her “acting” status nor to use the expectation of a recusal as a basis for withholding information. “This is an extraordinary usurpation of power. Not something you’d expect from the supposedly    guys at the top of the FBI,” one of those officials told Breitbart News. The closest precedent to the Comey cabinet’s decision to conceal information from Justice Department superiors is likely Comey’s widely criticized earlier decision to go public about the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails. That decision received a sharp rebuke in the May 9 memo by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that formed the basis for Comey’s firing by Trump. Rosenstein criticized Comey’s decision to act without consultation from the Department of Justice as usurping the Attorney General’s authority and an attempt to “supplant federal prosecutors and assume command of the Justice Department. Comey had violated a “  process” for how to deal with situations where to Attorney General faces a conflict of interest, according to Rosenstein. “The Director was wrong to usurp the Attorney General’s authority on July 5, 2016,” Rosenstein wrote. “The Director now defends his decision by asserting that he believed attorney General Loretta Lynch had a conflict. But the FBI Director is never empowered to supplant federal prosecutors and assume command of the Justice Department. There is a   process for other officials to step in when a conflict requires the recusal of the Attorney General. On July 5, however, the Director announced his own conclusions about the nation’s most sensitive criminal investigation, without the authorization of duly appointed Justice Department leaders. ” Comey’s testimony on Thursday seemed to   on this defense, which amounts to a claim that the FBI’s top agents can act outside of the ordinary processes intended to establish oversight and accountability at the nation’s top law enforcement agency. The FBI’s adherence to Department of Justice guidelines and instructions from Attorneys General has been a centerpiece of its ongoing independence, often cited by officials as a reason why the FBI does not need a general legislative charter that would restrict or control by statute its authority. Comey’s assertion that the FBI can override standard protocols could endanger that independence, according to a former   federal law enforcement official. “He’s not only put the credibility of the bureau in doubt, he’s now putting the entire basis for our independence in jeopardy,” the official said. The official pointed to an editorial in the Wall Street Journal as explaining the dangers of an FBI that decides not to inform the Department of Justice of its activities. “Mr. Comey is describing an FBI director who essentially answers to no one. But the police powers of the government are awesome and often abused, and the only way to prevent or correct abuses is to report to elected officials who are accountable to voters. A director must resist intervention to obstruct an investigation, but he and the agency must be politically accountable or risk becoming the FBI of J. Edgar Hoover,” the Wall Street Journal wrote. A 2005 report from the FBI’s Office of Inspector General on the Department of Justice’s guidelines for FBI investigations stated, “Attorneys General and FBI leadership have uniformly agreed that the Attorney General Guidelines are necessary and desirable, and they have referred to the FBI’s adherence to the Attorney General Guidelines as the reason why the FBI should not be subjected to a general legislative charter or to statutory control over the exercise of some of its most intrusive authorities. ”            ",0

19445,CLAIM: Watching scary movies could help boost your immune system and promote weight loss,"CLAIM: Watching scary movies could help boost your immune system and promote weight loss 
  Vicki Batts Tags: scary movies , immune system , weight loss (NaturalNews) Who doesn't love a good horror flick, right? There may actually be some health benefits to be found in watching scary movies, too. Experts say that when you watch something frightening, it engages your fight or flight response. This in turn raises the amount of adrenaline pumping through your veins, which can be pretty good for your body.Psychologist Mark Griffiths, a professor of behavioral addiction at Nottingham Trent University, says that there are a number of reasons why people typically seek out fear-inducing films. While the desire to experience something unusual isn't totally health related, Griffiths also commented on the potential healthy release some people may experience. ""Watching such films 'may also be cathartic, providing an emotional release for pent-up frustrations,'"" he told the UK's Daily Mail .But there could be more to it than just that, at least according to some new research. Evidence indicates that the fear you experience while watching a scary movie could help to temporarily bolster your immune system .Scientists from Coventry University took blood samples from a group of test subjects before, during and after they either watched a scary movie or spent time in a quiet room. Their findings, which were published in the journal Stress , revealed that white blood cell counts were increased in those who saw the horror film . Normally, white blood cells respond in this way when there is a sign of infection.According to Natalie Riddell, an immunologist at University College London, this is all part of our evolutionary process, which has been ""geared to promote the survival of the individual."" Getting scared can engage the ""fight or flight"" response, which in turn, causes the release of adrenaline.The surge of adrenaline then launches the immune system into action – leading to an increased white blood cell count.That's not all adrenaline can do, either. The survival hormone also elevates your heart rate and boosts your metabolic rate – the speed at which your body burns calories. You may think that the number of calories you could burn by watching horror movies is negligible, but studies have shown that you can actually burn a surprising amount of energy just by being scared. That's right, watching horror movies could help support your weight loss efforts.In 2012, researchers from the University of Westminster conducted an experiment to see how many calories volunteers could burn off while watching 10 classic scary films. On average, each film scared the participants into torching about 113 calories – which is equivalent to walking for about 30 minutes. The researchers found that the best horror movie for burning calories was none other than a classic Steven King film. That's right, when people watched The Shining directed by Stanley Kubrick, they burned away a whopping 184 calories.The classic films Jaws and The Exorcist came in second and third place, respectively, for total calorie burning. Dr. Richard Mackenzie, senior lecturer and specialist in cell metabolism and physiology at the university commented that each of the 10 films sent hearts beating and pulses racing. He explained, ""As the pulse quickens and blood pumps around the body faster, the body experiences a surge in adrenaline. It is this release of fast-acting adrenaline, produced during short bursts of intense stress (or in this case, brought on by fear), which is known to lower the appetite, increase the basal metabolic rate and ultimately burn a higher level of calories.""Overall, calorie burning increased by about one-third while the study participants watched the films. Of course, this doesn't mean that you should watch a movie instead of exercising or eating healthfully . But the next time you sit down to watch a movie, you might want to pick one from the horror genre. Sources:",0
19446,"Your Monday Briefing: Bernie Sanders, Dilma Rousseff, Ecuador - The New York Times"," (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Who is the true New Yorker? It’s the day before the New York primary, and Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump are promoting their local credentials. Who has the best case? We judge. Winning a majority of New York’s 291 Democratic delegates could give Mrs. Clinton a chance to claim mathematical victory in the nomination race, or it could deliver a significant lift for Mr. Sanders. We take a look at Mr. Sanders’s past campaigns, which reveal a willingness to play hardball. The Vermont senator, who briefly met Pope Francis at the Vatican on Saturday, also released his 2014 tax return. • In the courts. President Obama’s plan to shield millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation and allow them to work in the country legally was sharply questioned during arguments at the Supreme Court today. An appeals court affirmed today the $1 billion N. F. L. concussion settlement. • Powerful earthquakes. Hundreds of doctors and rescue workers are heading to Ecuador’s   areas after Saturday night’s 7.  earthquake. At least 272 people were killed and 2, 527 were injured. Aftershocks continued in Mashiki, Japan, after two quakes  —   with magnitudes of 6. 2 and 7  —   struck within just over a day last week and left at least 42 people dead. The Ecuador and Japan earthquakes, 9, 000 miles apart, are not related, scientists say. • Impeachment vote in Brazil. Legislators in the lower house of Congress voted on Sunday night to approve the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff, the nation’s first female president. The Senate will vote by a simple majority, most likely next month, on whether to hold a trial on charges that she illegally used money from   banks to cover budget gaps during the worst economic crisis in decades. Many of those accusing her are themselves suspected of fraud and graft. • Health care coverage gains. Hispanics accounted for nearly a third of the increase in U. S. adults with insurance in the first full year of the Affordable Care Act, according to our analysis. Immigrants of all backgrounds  —   including more than a million legal residents who are not citizens  —   had the sharpest rise in coverage rates. • Yahoo is accepting   bids for its core Internet business today. • Citigroup sold more than 60 businesses in the past seven years, and its holdings shrunk by $700 billion, illustrating the changing profile of the biggest U. S. banks. •  Amazon is introducing two monthly subscription options to its Prime membership service, a change that could make the company’s video service a tougher competitor to Netflix. • Today is the last day for most individuals to file their 2015 federal income tax returns to the I. R. S. or to request  extensions. Maine and Massachusetts residents have an extra day. • U. S. stocks are rising. . Here’s a snapshot of global markets. • After a trip to Greece, Pope Francis took 12 Muslim refugees from Syria with him back to Rome, where a Roman Catholic charity will help care for them. • A U. N. report said that nearly 2, 000 Afghan civilians have been killed or wounded so far this year, and that more than 80, 000 people have been displaced, record numbers for the   nation. • Nine Guantánamo prisoners from Yemen were sent to Saudi Arabia. • “The Jungle Book” was the U. S.   winner. • Catching up on TV: Episode recaps for “Outlander,” and the season finales of “Girls” and “Vinyl. ” • Amends for slavery? Members of Georgetown University’s community are pressing the school to confront  part of its history: In 1838, 272 slaves were sold to pay the school’s debts and to secure its financial future. Researchers are seeking their descendants. “Ebony and Ivy,” published in 2013, details the connections between slavery and elite U. S. universities’ beginnings. • Off the charts. Here’s a visual look at the    record of the Golden State Warriors’ Stephen Curry. He’ll be in action tonight (10:30 p. m. Eastern, TNT) in the N. B. A. playoffs. The N. H. L. ’s Stanley Cup playoffs continue, too. • On your marks   …     The 120th Boston Marathon is today, with a field of about 30, 000 runners. Roberta Gibb, the first woman to compete and finish the race, is the grand marshal. • In case you missed it   …     Last week, readers devoured articles about Julie Miller, a triathlete accused of cheating, a   account of life in a   and a cabdriver who’s traveled Rome’s roads for 50 years.

It’s the centennial year for the awards, which were created by the estate of Joseph Pulitzer to honor achievement in journalism and the arts. (Our newsroom has earned the honor 117 times.) Pulitzer, a native of Hungary, was paid by a recruiter to come to the U. S. and join the Union Army during the Civil War. After the war, he acquired and merged two newspapers in St. Louis to form the St. Louis  . In 1883, he bought The New York World, which gained a reputation as a champion of   journalism. He changed American journalism by introducing comics, illustrations and coverage of sports and women’s fashion. But Pulitzer also engaged in the kind of sensationalism that led to the term “yellow journalism,” a phrase inspired by the “Yellow Kid” comic strip that appeared in both Pulitzer’s newspaper and that of its chief rival, William Randolph Hearst’s New York Morning Journal. In one newspaper promotion, Pulitzer crowdfunded the money needed for a pedestal for the Statue of Liberty by offering to print on the front page the name of every person who donated to its construction. You may hear his name pronounced as   today. Pulitzer said his name as    and that’s what the Pulitzer Board follows. Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays at 6 a. m.

19447,Death penalty sought in shooting deaths of 2 Palm Springs cops ambushed by gang member,"Print 
The Riverside County District Attorney’s Office is seeking the death penalty against John Felix, charged with the murders of two Palm Springs police officers earlier this month, according to a press release from the DA’s office. Felix previously pleaded not guilty . 
Felix, 26, allegedly shot and killed officers Jose Vega, 63 and Lesley Zerebny, 27, on Saturday, Oct. 8. Felix, described as “self-admitted and known gang member” in the release, is believed to have ambushed the officers when they were responding to a family disturbance call. 
“This was a heinous crime involving the murders of two police officers who were gunned down simply because they were police officers,” Hestrin said in the release. “The victims in this case were responding to a call for service and died in the line of duty protecting our community.” 
[…] 
Felix also faces three counts of attempted murder involving other Palm Springs officers, including one who was wounded by gunfire before being treated and released. Felix allegedly possessed an assault weapon, armor-piercing ammunition and was wearing a body vest.",0

19449,"Robert Vaughn, Who Starred as Napoleon Solo in ‘Man From U.N.C.L.E.,’ Dies at 83 - The New York Times","Robert Vaughn, the   actor who reached the peak of his fame in the 1960s playing Napoleon Solo, the debonair international agent tasked with saving the world each week on the hit television series “The Man From U. N. C. L. E. ,” died on Friday in Danbury, Conn. He was 83. His manager, Matthew Sullivan, said that the cause was acute leukemia, for which Mr. Vaughn had been under treatment in Manhattan and Connecticut. Mr. Vaughn had numerous roles in film and on television. He played an old boyfriend of Laura Petrie (Mary Tyler Moore) on an episode of “The Dick Van Dyke Show” and a gunman in “The Magnificent Seven” (1960). He was nominated for an Academy Award as best supporting actor for his role as a man accused of murder in “The Young Philadelphians” (1959) and won an Emmy in 1978 for his performance as a White House chief of staff in the   “Washington: Behind Closed Doors. ” But no character he played was as popular as Napoleon Solo. From 1964 to 1968, in the thick of the Cold War, millions of Americas tuned in weekly to “The Man From U. N. C. L. E. ” to watch Mr. Vaughn, as a superagent from the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement, battling T. H. R. U. S. H. (Technological Hierarchy for the Removal of Undesirables and the Subjugation of Humanity) a secret organization intent on achieving world domination through nefarious if   devices like   gas. At the height of the show’s popularity, Mr. Vaughn said he was receiving 70, 000 fan letters a month. The show was a   parody of Ian Fleming’s creation James Bond, who had been played by Sean Connery in two hit movies by the time “The Man From U. N. C. L. E. ” made its debut. (Fleming served as an adviser to the show, and is widely credited with coining the name Napoleon Solo.) “The whole show is a joke. It’s an extension of the Bond joke into a gigantic cartoon in prime time,” Mr. Vaughn told The Saturday Evening Post in an 1965 interview, to which, the magazine noted, he arrived wearing a   Italian suit and a black silk tie. Joke or not, the show was wildly popular and catapulted Mr. Vaughn into overnight fame. It was also a platform for many other acting careers, most notably that of David McCallum, the Scottish actor who played Illya Kuryakin, the enigmatic Russian spy and Solo sidekick who developed a big fan following of his own. Kurt Russell (at age 10) Leslie Nielsen and Joan Collins all appeared on the show. In the first season, William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy, who would   on “Star Trek” two years later, had roles in the same episode. Despite his acclaim, Mr. Vaughn could be a little disdainful about his vocation. “Acting has always been very boring to me,” he told The Post. “Anyone not in television to become a millionaire is a simpleton. ” At the time, Mr. Vaughn was seemingly more focused on politics than show business: He often spoke publicly against the war in Vietnam. “In our fervor to halt the potential spread of totalitarianism, what incredible precedent are we setting in Vietnam?” he asked in an impassioned speech. “By marching our legions through the countryside of foreign continents, burning homes, laying waste to the land and indiscriminately killing friend and foe alike?” Mr. Vaughn became national chairman of an organization called Dissenting Democrats in 1967 and debated the war with William F. Buckley Jr. on Mr. Buckley’s television program, “Firing Line”  —   a bout that Newsday, on Long Island, said Mr. Vaughn had won. “Vaughn suffered no wounds from Buckley’s expert needling,” the newspaper said. Mr. Vaughn befriended Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and was a frequent guest at Hickory Hill, Kennedy’s estate in McLean, Va. where Mr. Vaughn played touch football with luminaries like the writer Art Buchwald and the astronaut John Glenn. The Kennedys, Mr. Vaughn wrote in his   autobiography, “A Fortunate Life” (2008) were big fans. “The house was covered with U. N. C. L. E. posters inside and out,” he reported, “including pictures of me with my Walther P38 at the ready. ” Robert Francis Vaughn was born on Nov. 22, 1932, in New York City into a theatrically inclined household. His father, Gerald Walter Vaughn, was heard on radio series like “Gangbusters” and “Crime Doctor,” and his mother, the former Marcella Gaudel, appeared in a 1931 Broadway production of “Dracula. ” The couple divorced when Mr. Vaughn was an infant and he moved with his mother to Minneapolis, where he was partly reared by grandparents. “I was a complete wreck as a child, emotionally unstable, excessively prideful,” he told The Sunday News of New York in a 1965 interview. When he was with his mother, she pushed his acting career, teaching him to recite the “To be or not to be” soliloquy from “Hamlet” when he was 5. While she was working as a cocktail waitress in a Chicago bar to earn extra money, his mother had young Robert perform the soliloquy for John Barrymore after Barrymore had dropped by. She later helped get her son cast on radio shows like “Let’s Pretend” and “Jack Armstrong, the   Boy. ” Mr. Vaughn headed to Hollywood in 1952. During the day, he studied theater arts at Los Angeles City College and played bit parts, including a Hebrew slave in the movie epic “The Ten Commandments. ” At night he would go to local hot spots and hobnob with other aspirants and the occasional star. He hung out with Johnny Carson, dated Natalie Wood and knocked back Cutty Sark at 2 a. m. with Bette Davis. He also befriended a young James Coburn and took credit for getting him a role in “The Magnificent Seven. ” After he graduated from college in 1956, Mr. Vaughn signed with Columbia Pictures for $15, 000 a role. His career was temporarily waylaid when he was drafted he served uneventfully as a drill sergeant in the Army and was discharged after 18 months. After that, his life was a series of increasingly   parts, and then he landed “U. N. C. L. E. ” The show was such a success at first that he expected it to last for many years, but the ratings dropped, and it was canceled halfway through its fourth season. He kept busy afterward, appearing on numerous TV shows and in movies like “Bullitt” (1968) and “The Towering Inferno” (1974). He also traveled extensively. He was in Prague in 1968 when Soviet tanks rolled into the city to suppress the local reform movement. Mr. Vaughn earned a doctorate in communications from the University of Southern California in 1970. His dissertation, “The Influence of the House Committee on   Activities on the American Theater ” was published as a book, “Only Victims,” in 1972. But the farther away he got from “U. N. C. L. E. ,” the more Mr. Vaughn found himself taking roles that he characterized as “not quality,” among them a millionaire looking to dominate the world through computers in “Superman III” (1983) and a mercenary in “Battle Beyond the Stars” (1980) a   science fiction epic conceived of as “The Magnificent Seven” in space. In the late 1980s he acted as pitchman in an infomercial for the Helsinki Formula, which claimed to be a cure for baldness. The Federal Trade Commission eventually prevented the manufacturers from making this claim, but by then they had sold $100 million worth of the product. In a 1993 interview with The Los Angeles Times, Mr. Vaughn was unapologetic about his work as a Helsinki Formula spokesman. “That was about the most profitable thing I’ve ever done in my life,” he said. “Every call that came in on the 800 number, I got a piece of that. ” During one of his rare returns to stage acting, he appeared in a production of “The Tender Trap” in Chicago in 1970. Also in the cast was the actress Linda Staab, whom he married in 1974 and who survives him. With his Hollywood stature on the decline, they moved to a   stone home in Ridgefield, Conn. in 1981. Mr. Vaughn’s survivors also include a daughter, Caitlin Vaughn a son, Cassidy and two grandchildren. Mr. Vaughn continued to work as an actor into his 80s. He appeared on the British television series “Hustle” from 2004 to 2012 and on another British show, “Coronation Street,” in 2012. He was seen on an episode of “Law  Order: Special Victims Unit” last year. Toward the end of his life, his view of acting, and of his luck in having a long show business career, grew rosier. As he put it in his autobiography, “With a modest amount of looks and talent, and more than a modicum of serendipity, I’ve managed to stretch my 15 minutes of fame into 50 years of good fortune. ”",0
19451,Two Black Women Embrace Their Chance to Be Hockey Role Models - The New York Times,"Three years ago, girls from the Hockey in Newark youth program were invited to meet the Princeton women’s hockey team. During the visit, the girls, many of whom are members of minorities, were drawn to defender Kelsey Koelzer. Like them, Koelzer, who is   played much of her youth in secondhand equipment and was raised by a single parent who struggled to accommodate the costly expenses of hockey. The girls peppered Koelzer with questions. Koelzer was struck by the encounter, too her mother, Kristine, still remembers her daughter talking about the effect the visit had. Koelzer’s influence is expanding in her senior season at Princeton. In June, she was selected first over all by the New York Riveters in the National Women’s Hockey League draft. Koelzer is believed to be the first   player taken No. 1 by a   American professional hockey league. Shortly after the historic pick, Sarah Nurse of Canada, who is also black, was selected in the second round by the Boston Pride. Koelzer and Nurse, a forward at Wisconsin, are two of college hockey’s top players and rising stars in their   programs. With increased visibility, they recognize their capacity to motivate a generation of young girls from similar backgrounds. “I personally don’t know that I’ve played against many   people growing up,” Koelzer said recently after a game at Princeton, where she is captain. “I really do take pride in the fact that I could be a mentor and a model for other young girls, to see it really is possible if you put the work in no matter your situation or where you’re from. ” Other   youth programs like Hockey in Newark have striven to introduce hockey to new audiences, highlighting a sport that has not always been viewed as accessible for financial and cultural reasons. Despite these barriers, women of color have long been instrumental in the emergence of women’s hockey in North America. The Canadians Angela James, whose father is black, and Vicky Sunohara, who is of Japanese descent, were early pioneers. For years, Julie Chu, who is   was a star on the United States women’s national team. Last season, Rachel Llanes, a   and Blake Bolden, an   were key contributors as the Pride won the first Isobel Cup, the trophy awarded to the N. W. H. L. champion. In 2015, they won the Clarkson Cup with the Boston Blades of the Canadian Women’s Hockey League. Koelzer and Nurse expressed a desire to continue that legacy, to help shape women’s hockey as more inclusive as it continues to increase its audience. “Diversity is an important element of the N. W. H. L.,” Commissioner Dani Rylan said in an email. Earlier this year, Koelzer was recognized as one of the nation’s best offensive defenders, earning first team   honors and a spot on the United States   team. According to U. S. A. Hockey, an   player has yet to make the women’s senior national team. Nurse, also a senior, is a lethal scorer, and she led the   Badgers in points entering this weekend’s games. She has already competed in the Four Nations Cup with the Canadian national team and was an alternate captain of the developmental team last summer, when she played against Koelzer. Both hope to eventually compete at the Olympics. John Sanful, the executive director of Ice Hockey in Harlem, said it was “incredibly important” that children from minority groups are able to “see people on the ice who look like them,” particularly at such high levels of competition. Over the summer, girls from his program were assigned to report on an influential figure in their lives, and one chose Koelzer, writing, “I like that she’s a black female that wanted to be a hockey player and she achieved her goal. ” For some players, hockey rinks can occasionally be uninviting. Tarasai Karega, who won a Division III national title at Amherst in 2009, started playing when she saw the film “The Mighty Ducks,” influenced by the character Jesse, the only black player portrayed on the team. Karega said that even entering a rink now can feel unsettling. “It’s tangible that people stare at you like a U. F. O. just landed on Earth,” Karega said. “They’ll speak to you in mannerisms or talk about proper English. ” Karega stressed the importance of the emergence of players like Koelzer and Nurse, to continue raising awareness that hockey is not an exclusive sport. “I think it starts with having that conversation and defying stereotypes,” Karega said. “Then analyzing the nature of access to certain sports. ” In 2012, William Douglas founded a blog named the Color of Hockey after Joel Ward received racist threats when he scored a   goal for the Washington Capitals against the Boston Bruins. Douglas said it was important to not just identify minorities within the sport but to understand they can be resources for exposing “problems with diversity and issues where race can be involved. ” Koelzer, who grew up outside Philadelphia, and Nurse, who is from Hamilton, Ontario, have not been afraid to confront race throughout their careers. In high school, when Koelzer still played on a boys’ team, an opponent directed a racial slur at her. Koelzer responded by hitting the aggressor across the head, showing that his ignorance would not be tolerated. “Usually, the game of hockey has been very good to me,” Koelzer said. “When that does happen, I have an extreme sense of pride for who I am and where I came from. I do have that kind of attitude where I’m not going to let anyone put me down and try to rise above me just based on something like that. ” Nurse comes from one of Canada’s   sports families. Her father, Roger, was a lacrosse star. Her cousin Kia Nurse has won two national titles playing basketball at Connecticut. Kia’s brother, Darnell Nurse, is a top defender for the Edmonton Oilers. Before a game in New York this month, Darnell Nurse said Jarome Iginla was a major influence during his youth. He sees a similar opportunity for Sarah Nurse as she continues her career. Despite her family’s reputation, Sarah Nurse said opponents had sarcastically asked how she discovered hockey or if she was adopted. Recently, black athletes at Wisconsin have unified to address racial injustice on campus. Like many athletes there, Nurse posted a statement this month that condemned a student who wore a mask of President Obama with a noose around the neck to a Wisconsin football game. The statement also referred to episodes in which racial slurs had been used against black athletes and to discrimination in the classroom by students and professors. “Just with the climate of the country right now, it’s a national issue,” Nurse said. “As   we want to make a difference on our campus and in our community if we can. ” Nurse and Koelzer are focused on their senior seasons and have not decided if they will turn pro. The N. W. H. L. is in financial straits, and much of 2017 will be focused on the 2018 Olympics. But wherever their careers lead, they appear comfortable using their influence to effect change, much in the way the United States women’s national soccer team and W. N. B. A. players have addressed social issues. “I definitely take pride in it,” Koelzer said. “I’m happy to have that on my shoulders, and I’m happy to kind of carry that weight. It means that I’ve made something. It means that I’ve done something. ”",0

Yuck!” the other children would shout, teasing Katherine Yuk all through elementary school about her Chinese last name. “When I was a child and a new immigrant in Canada, I longed for the day when I could get married and take someone else’s last name,” she wrote. Ms. Yuk was one of more than 16, 000 readers who responded when The New York Times asked women around the world why they had kept or changed their surnames when they married. By the time she had the chance, Ms. Yuk wrote, her thinking had come around. She decided to embrace and keep her name, despite the teasing. “I hadn’t only survived it, but it had defined me  —   as someone who was different yet proud of those differences, a survivor of childhood bullying, a   immigrant with a funny last name who had found her own skin and found her own opportunities and identity,” said Ms. Yuk, now 45 and living in Toronto. “I didn’t want to lose my identity. ” Women from a variety of nationalities, religions, sexual orientations and ages wrote to The Times about how their names were a core part of who they were. For many, the decision on whether to change their names carried significant weight, and it was shaped by the traditions, the norms and, in some cases, the laws of the societies in which they live. Some looked to their names as badges of cultural identity, others as symbolic links to their fathers that they were eager to preserve, or to sever. Here are some of the responses.

— Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) October 28, 2016 Noting that she had seen reports on the news of votes being flipped, the woman said, “I went in and voted a straight Republican ticket and thank God I went back and checked and they had switched my vote from Trump to (Hillary).” She said that she had to get the vote changed back by alerting election officials, who simply told her to vote for a second time. “I went back the second time and made sure they didn’t change it,” she concluded. As we reported earlier this week, voters in numerous areas of Texas have made a series of complaints that votes are being switched from Trump to Clinton . One election official responded by claiming the problems were caused by voters not understanding how to use the machines properly. “Typically, we’ve found it’s voter error with the equipment,” Frank Phillips, Tarrant County’s election administrator, told WFAA . “Sometimes they vote straight party and then click on other candidates … or do something with the wheel….There is not an issue with the equipment.” However, Trump supporters continue to point to the reports as evidence that vote fraud may be taking place.",0

Please note we will continue to update as this story as new reports surface. 
According to FOX2 Michigan, voters in the cities of Detroit, Sterling Heights, Novi, Holly and Roseville have reported machines being unable to accept their ballots, forcing many to leave their them in the hands of polling location volunteers.
Via Fox2 
FOX 2 has received dozens of calls and emails from voters saying the machine at their polling place isn’t working correctly.
An overwhelming number of voters from several cities report the machine isn’t able to accept the ballot… Many voters are concerned, though, that their vote may not be counted since they won’t be there to physically see it go through the machine.
FOX 2 has also spoken with some election volunteers who are frustrated because they’re not sure who to contact for help getting a new machine.
One voter in Pennsylvania took to Twitter to voice his frustrations, posting footage of a voting machine swapping a vote for GOP candidate Donald Trump to Democrat Hillary Clinton.

19456,Facebook Mounts Effort to Limit Tide of Fake News - The New York Times,"For weeks, Facebook has been questioned about its role in spreading fake news. Now the company has mounted its most concerted effort to combat the problem. Facebook said on Thursday that it had begun a series of experiments to limit misinformation on its site. The tests include making it easier for its 1. 8 billion members to report fake news, and creating partnerships with outside   organizations to help it indicate when articles are false. The company is also changing some advertising practices to stop purveyors of fake news from profiting from it. Facebook, the social network, is in a tricky position with these tests. It has long regarded itself as a neutral place where people can freely post, read and view content, and it has said it does not want to be an arbiter of truth. But as its reach and influence have grown, it has had to confront questions about its moral obligations and ethical standards regarding what appears on the network. Its experiments on curtailing fake news show that Facebook recognizes it has a deepening responsibility for what is on its site. But Facebook also must tread cautiously in making changes, because it is wary of exposing itself to claims of censorship. “We really value giving people a voice, but we also believe we need to take responsibility for the spread of fake news on our platform,” said Adam Mosseri, a Facebook vice president who is in charge of its news feed, the company’s method of distributing information to its global audience. He said the changes  —   which, if successful, may be available to a wide audience  —   resulted from many months of internal discussion about how to handle false news articles shared on the network. What impact Facebook’s moves will have on fake news is unclear. The issue is not confined to the social network, with a vast ecosystem of false news creators who thrive on online advertising and who can use other social media and search engines to propagate their work. Google, Twitter and message boards like 4chan and Reddit have all been criticized for being part of that chain. Still, Facebook has taken the most heat over fake news. The company has been under that spotlight since Nov. 8, when Donald J. Trump was elected the 45th president. Mr. Trump’s unexpected victory almost immediately led people to focus on whether Facebook had influenced the electorate, especially with the rise of hyperpartisan sites on the network and many examples of misinformation, such as a false article that claimed Pope Francis had endorsed Mr. Trump for president that was shared nearly a million times across the site. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, has said he did not believe that the social network had influenced the election result, calling it “a pretty crazy idea. ” Yet the intense scrutiny of the company on the issue has caused internal divisions  and has pushed Mr. Zuckerberg to say he was trying to find ways to reduce the problem. In an interview, Mr. Mosseri said Facebook did not think its news feed had directly caused people to vote for a particular candidate, given that “the magnitude of fake news across Facebook is one fraction of a percent of the content across the network. ” Facebook has changed the way its news feed works before. In August, the company announced changes to marginalize what it considered “clickbait,” the sensational headlines that rarely live up to their promise. This year, Facebook also gave priority to content shared by friends and family, a move that shook some publishers that rely on the social network for much of their traffic. The company is also constantly   its algorithms to serve what its users most want to see, an effort to keep its audience returning regularly. This time, Facebook is making it easier to flag content that may be fake. Users can report a post they dislike in their feed, but when Facebook asks for a reason, the site presents them with a list of limited and vague options, including the cryptic “I don’t think it should be on Facebook. ” In Facebook’s new experiment, users will have a choice to flag the post as fake news and have the option to message the friend who originally shared the piece to tell him or her the article is false. If an article receives enough flags as fake, it can be directed to a coalition of groups that will   it. The groups include Snopes, PolitiFact, The Associated Press, FactCheck. org and ABC News. They will check the article and can mark it as a “disputed” piece, a designation that will be seen on Facebook. Partner organizations will not be paid, the companies said. Some characterized the   as an extension of their journalistic efforts. “We actually regard this as a big part of our core mission,” James Goldston, the president of ABC News, said in an interview. “If that core mission isn’t helping people regard the real from the fake news, I don’t know what our mission is. ” Disputed articles will ultimately appear lower in the news feed. If users still decide to share such an article, they will receive a   reminding them that the accuracy of the piece is in question. Facebook said it was casting a wide net to add more partners to its   coalition and may move outside of the United States with the initiative if early experiments go well. The company is also part of the First Draft Coalition, an effort with other technology and media companies including Twitter, Google, The New York Times and CNN, to combat the spread of fake news online. In another change in how the news feed works, articles that many users read but do not share will be ranked lower on people’s feeds. Mr. Mosseri said a low ratio of sharing an article after it has been read could be perceived as a negative signal, one that might reflect that the article was misleading or of poor quality. “Facebook was inevitably going to have to curate the platform much more carefully, and this seems like a reasonably transparent method of intervention,” said Emily Bell, director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. “But the fake cat is already out of the imaginary bag,” Ms. Bell added. “If they didn’t try and do something about it, next time around it could have far worse consequences. ” Facebook also plans to impede the economics of spreading fake articles across the network. Fake news purveyors generally make money when people click on the false articles and are directed to   websites, the majority of which are filled with dozens of   ads. Facebook will review those   links and check for things like whether the page is mostly filled with advertising content  —   a dead giveaway for spam sites  —   or to see whether a link masquerades as a different site, like a fake version of The New York Times. Such sites would not be eligible to display Facebook advertising on their pages. Articles disputed by the   coalition will also not be eligible to be inserted into Facebook ads, a tactic viral spammers have used to spread fake news quickly and gain more clicks on their websites. Facebook said that in these early experiments it would deal with only fake news content it does not plan to flag opinion posts or other content that could not be easily classified. The changes will not affect satirical sites like The Onion, which often jabs at political subjects through    humor. Facebook must take something else into consideration: its profit. Any action taken to reduce popular content, even if it is fake news, could hurt the company’s priority of keeping its users engaged on the platform. People spend an average of more than 50 minutes a day on Facebook, and the company wants that number to grow. Executives at Facebook stressed the overriding factor right now is not just engagement. “I think of Facebook as a technology company, but I recognize we have a greater responsibility than just building technology that information flows through,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote in a post on Thursday. “We have a responsibility to make sure Facebook has the greatest positive impact on the world. ”",0
19457,Trump Avoids Facts Again: Wind Energy Won’t Kill ‘All The Birds’ (VIDEO),"Trump Avoids Facts Again: Wind Energy Won’t Kill ‘All The Birds’ (VIDEO) By Karen Shiebler on October 27, 2016 Subscribe 
The Republican presidential candidate continues to prove himself too uninformed to be President of these United States. 
In his latest attack on the facts, Republican hopeful Donald Trump went on a rant against renewable energy. As is so typical for the shallow conservative, he seized the handiest and easiest idea to sell his argument. 
In essence, Donald Trump says that we can’t have wind power because it kills all the birds. 
All the birds. Killed by wind turbines. 
Trump was particularly worried about the fate of the eagles. Of course he was. The eagle, the symbol of America. The easiest way to tug on the heartstrings on the uninformed is to threaten the very symbol of our nation. So he did. He claimed that “thousands” of eagles are killed in California by wind energy. 
Trump appeared on a radio show the other day with Republican has-been Herman Cain. He said : “[Wind power] kills all the birds. Thousands of birds are lying on the ground. And the eagle. You know, certain parts of California — they’ve killed so many eagles. You know, they put you in jail if you kill an eagle. And yet these windmills [kill] them by the hundreds.” 
What an image! Hundreds of dead American eagles, all slaughtered by wind turbines. 
And in keeping with the unapologetic shallowness of his position, Trump went on to complain that wind turbines are unattractive. There is no insult in Trump world more powerful than “ugly”. Here are Donald Trump's views on wind power, and Disneyland: https://t.co/mphn1qSbGU pic.twitter.com/ja1j6wltBx 
— Daniel Dale (@ddale8) October 26, 2016 
So wind energy is ugly, inefficient and it kills all of those wonderful noble eagles. 
Except that NONE of that is true. None of it. 
Here is the truth, not that it will matter to the fact averse Donald Trump. 
While it is true that many birds are killed by wind turbines (up to 368,000 annually), that figure looks low when compared to the number of birds killed by cell towers each year (6.8 million). 
The biggest killer of birds is….are you ready? Cats. Cats kill up to 3.7 billion birds a year. 
As for those eagles? The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says that two eagles were killed by wind turbines in Palm Springs since 1997. 
Trump’s rant seems even more deceitful when we consider the fact that climate change is the greatest threat to birds in the world. The Audubon Society says that up to half of the bird species on earth are threatened by rising global temperatures. 
Donald Trump appears to be incapable of understanding or accepting reality. He says that climate change is a hoax created by China. He claims that wind turbines are killing “all the birds.” He mourns the loss of hundreds of eagles who haven’t died. 
Whatever it is that he wants to be true is what he believes to be true. 
He is delusional. He is dangerous. He has to be stopped.

19458,Fitton: Obama IRS Scandal Continues – Judicial Watch Forces IRS to Disclose New Documents,"We have no intention to allow the   activities of former President Obama’s administration to fade into the sunset now that he is out of office. Particularly egregious was his use of the might of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to target groups that disagreed with his political views. [And   at the IRS continues.  Last week, Judicial Watch reported that the agency informed the U. S. District Court that it located “an additional 6, 924 documents of potentially responsive records” relating to our 2015 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit regarding the Obama IRS targeting scandal. The lawsuit at issue sought records about the IRS selection of individuals and organizations for audits based upon applications requesting   tax status filed by Tea Party and other 501( c)(4)   organizations (Judicial Watch v. Internal Revenue Service (No. 1:  )). These newly identified records are presumably not the records contained in the   “Congressional Database,” which the IRS created in 2013 to house records responsive to congressional inquiries into the IRS scandal. The IRS informed JW Monday that it is producing an additional 694 pages of documents and expects to produce an additional batch by March 24, 2017.  However, at this time, the IRS still has not provided an estimate regarding when it will complete its review of the potentially responsive documents. The corruption at the IRS is astounding. Our attorneys knew that there were more records to be searched, but the Obama IRS ignored this issue for years. Remember that in July 2015, we released Obama IRS documents confirming that the agency used donor lists of   organizations to target those donors for audits. The documents also show that IRS officials specifically highlighted how the U. S. Chamber of Commerce may come under “high scrutiny” from the IRS. In September 2014, another JW FOIA lawsuit forced the release of documents detailing that the IRS sought, obtained, and maintained the names of donors to tea party and other conservative groups. IRS officials acknowledged in these documents that “such information was not needed. ” The documents also show that the donor names were being used for a “secret research project. ” The Obama IRS scandal continues, and President Trump needs to clean house at the IRS as quickly as possible. ###",0
19459,Clinton Campaign Circulated Paul Ryan Relative as Possible Supreme Court Pick,"Clinton Campaign Circulated Paul Ryan Relative as Possible Supreme Court Pick Another reason as to why Ryan tried to sabotage Trump's campaign? Paul Joseph Watson - October 27, 2016 Comments Hillary Clinton’s campaign circulated the name of one of Paul Ryan’s relatives as a potential Supreme Court pick, suggesting a conflict of interest that could feed in to the Republican Speaker of the House’s dislike for Donald Trump. An email released in part 19 of the Wikileaks Podesta dump features an article sent by Hillary advisor Sara Solow to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and Hillary’s foreign policy advisor Jake Sullivan on February 29, 2016. The piece draws attention to Ketanji Brown Jackson, a judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. “She was confirmed by without any Republican opposition in the Senate not once, but *twice*. She was confirmed to her current position in 2013 by unanimous consent – that is, without any stated opposition. She was also previously confirmed unanimously to a seat on the U.S. Sentencing Commission (where she became vice chair),” reads the email. “Her family is impressive. She is married to a surgeon and has two young daughters. Her father is a retired lawyer and her mother a retired school principal. Her brother was a police officer (in the unit that was the basis for the television show *The Wire*) and is now a law student, and she is related by marriage to Congressman (and Speaker of the House) Paul Ryan.” Earlier this month, Ryan said that he would no longer defend or campaign for Donald Trump. A poll released this week found that nearly two thirds of Republicans trust Donald Trump more than Ryan to lead the GOP. Many Trump supporters speculated that Ryan was involved in the leaking of the infamous Billy Bush tape, in which Trump made lewd comments about women, as part of a plot to sabotage the Republican nominee’s campaign. Could the fact that one of his relatives is being touted as a likely Clinton Supreme Court pick be another reason as to why Ryan – who has been accused by many of being in bed with the Washington establishment – has abandoned his support for Donald Trump?

19460,China Seeks Tighter Grip in Wake of a Religious Revival - The New York Times,"BEIJING  —   The finances of religious groups will come under greater scrutiny. Theology students who go overseas could be monitored more closely. And people who rent or provide space to illegal churches may face heavy fines. These are among the measures expected to be adopted when the Chinese government enacts regulations tightening its oversight of religion in the coming days, the latest move by President Xi Jinping to strengthen the Communist Party’s control over society and combat foreign influences it considers subversive. The rules, the first changes in more than a decade to regulations on religion, also include restrictions on religious schools and limits on access to foreign religious writings, including on the internet. They were expected to be adopted as early as Friday, at the end of a public comment period, though there was no immediate announcement by the government. Religion has blossomed in China despite the Communist Party’s efforts to control and sometimes suppress it, with hundreds of millions embracing the nation’s major faiths  —   Buddhism, Christianity, Islam and Taoism  —   over the past few decades. But many Chinese worship outside the government’s official churches, mosques and temples, in unauthorized congregations that the party worries could challenge its authority. A draft of the new regulations was published in September, several months after Mr. Xi convened a rare leadership conference on religious policy and urged the party to be on guard against foreign efforts to infiltrate China using religion. “It could mean that if you are not part of the government church, then you won’t exist anymore,” said Xiao Yunyang, one of 24 prominent pastors and lawyers who signed a public statement last month criticizing the regulations as vague and potentially harmful. The regulations follow the enactment of a law on nongovernmental organizations that increased financial scrutiny of civil society groups and restricted their contact with foreign organizations in a similar way, as well as an aggressive campaign to limit the visibility of churches by tearing down crosses in one eastern province where Christianity has a wide following. But the rules on religion also pledge to protect holy sites from commercialization, allow spiritual groups to engage in charitable work and make government oversight more transparent. That suggests Mr. Xi wants closer government supervision of religious life in China but is willing to accept its existence. “There’s been a recognition that religion can be of use, even in a socialist society,” said Thomas Dubois, a professor at the Australian National University in Canberra. “There is an attempt, yes, to carve out the boundaries, but to leave a particular protected space for religion. ” Although the governing Communist Party requires its 85 million members to be atheist, its leaders have lauded some aspects of religious life for instilling morality in the broader population and have issued directives ratcheting back the   attacks on religion that characterized the Mao era. Over the past decades this has permitted a striking religious renaissance in China, including a construction boom in temples, mosques and churches. Christianity is widely considered the   faith there are as many as 67 million adherents now, at least half of whom worship in unregistered churches that have proliferated across China, sometimes called underground or house churches. The new regulations are more explicit about the party’s longstanding requirement that all religious groups register with the government, and the most vocal opposition so far has come from Protestant leaders unwilling to do so. “These regulations effectively push house churches into taking on an illegal character,” said Yang Xingquan, a lawyer who is one of the signatories of the public statement. “This is very clear. ” Many Christians contend that   churches are tools of the state, as sermons are vetted to avoid contentious political and social issues and clergy are appointed by the party rather than congregants or, in the case of the Catholic Church, the Vatican. The new rules call for more stringent accounting practices at religious institutions, threaten “those who provide the conditions for illegal religious activities” with fines and confiscation of property, and require the many privately run seminaries in China to submit to state control. Other articles in the regulations restrict contact with religious institutions overseas, which could affect Chinese Catholics studying theology in the Philippines, Protestants attending seminaries in the United States, or Muslims learning at madrasas in Malaysia or Pakistan. Overseas churches and activists with ties to Chinese Christians have been scathing in their attacks on the new regulations. In its annual report on religious persecution released on Wednesday, China Aid, a group based in Texas, said they violated the Constitution, which guarantees freedom of religious belief. The regulations also say for the first time that religion must not harm national security, which could give security services in China greater authority to target spiritual groups with ties overseas. Chinese officials have already banned residents from attending some religious conferences in Hong Kong and increased oversight of mainland programs run by Hong Kong pastors, raising fears within the city’s vibrant Christian community. For traditional Chinese religions such as Buddhism and Taoism  —   which are practiced by 300 million to 400 million people and which the party views more favorably  —   the regulations appear intended to address a different problem: crass commercialization. Temples are often forced by local governments to charge entrance fees, which mostly go to the state and not the place of worship. About 600 people were recently detained at Mount Wutai, a Buddhist pilgrimage site in a northeastern city, for posing as monks to hustle money by fortunetelling, begging for alms and performing street shows, the state news media reported. The new regulations say spiritual sites should be “safeguarded” from tourism and development. The rules also require local governments to decide on applications to build houses of worship within 30 days and to explain denials in writing. Scholars caution that it is unclear how strictly the regulations will be enforced, noting that local officials have often tolerated and sometimes encouraged religious activity that is formally illegal, including house churches. “Past regulations have not harmed the growth of religion in China,” said James Tong, a   professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has written extensively about religious regulation in China, “and I don’t think these will, either. ”",0
19462,"Article 50 appeal to be heard by Mary Berry, Mel and Sue","November 4, 2016 
The government has caused further controversy this morning by announcing that its appeal against the High Court’s ruling on Article 50 will not be heard by the Supreme Court but by Mary Berry, Mel and Sue, the former stars of The Great British Bake Off. 
The news comes after polling showed that 52% of voters were sick of so-called ‘experts’ being asked to make decisions about the governance of the United Kingdom. A government source said: ‘The ex-Bake Off team were definitely our first choice to make a call on Article 50. They are far more likely to reach a decision that meets with public approval than those boring old farts in the Supreme Court. I mean, what have they got? OK, 265 years’ worth of legal experience between them and significant expertise in relevant fields of constitutional precedent and interpreting centuries of law. But you know, Mary Berry! Mel and Sue! Soggy bottoms! Ha ha! What do you mean, “is that really sufficient”? You’re obviously some kind of rabid anti-democratic elitist.’ 
Berry admitted to being ‘surprised’ but willing to rise to the challenge proposed by the government. ‘Up to now my experience hasn’t really included very much British constitutional law or international jurisprudence,’ she said. ‘But I do know when something is half-baked, impossible to prove, likely to crumble into a mess, or just leaves an absolutely disgusting taste in the mouth. So perhaps I will be able to understand the government’s Brexit strategy after all.’ 
‘There are all sorts of reasons why this is an absolute blinder of an idea,’ said prime minister Theresa May in a Commons statement. ‘It’s great for the employment figures as it keeps these three women in work when they’d otherwise be on the scrap heap. They’re significantly more popular with the public than those fusty old bastards who found against us last week. Although I understand Sue is openly gay, so we’ll have to make sure nobody tells the Mail. She doesn’t fence, does she?

19463,Is President Trump Really Going To Revalue Gold To This Jaw-Dropping Price?,"50 Views November 15, 2016 GOLD , KWN King World News 
After the election chaos of last week, is President Trump really going to revalue gold to this jaw-dropping price? 
Part II of James Turk’s KWN interview: “When I say that the dollar is toast, Eric, I am of course referring to the Federal Reserve dollar (F$), which circulates as a money substitute in place of the Constitutional dollar (C$). The C$ is 11.369 grains of gold ($42.22 per ounce)… Sponsored 
President Nixon “temporarily” – to use his word – suspended the conversion of F$s into C$s back in 1971. 
Trump’s only option to end the clear divisions in the country is to increase prosperity with a level playing field for everyone. And the way to do that is to take away the advantages the 1%ers enjoy as a result of an unconstitutional monetary system. 
The Need To Build A Sound Monetary System So President Trump has to build a sound monetary system. To do this he must end Nixon’s temporary suspension of dollar redeemability into gold. Restoring a Constitutional dollar will provide a solid the foundation for building a new monetary system. The best way to do that is to follow the precepts of the Coinage Act of 1792, which is America’s first and best time-tested law concerning money. 
Back in June, when asked about the gold standard Trump replied: “Bringing back the gold standard would be very hard to do, but boy, would it be wonderful.” 
The “hard” task he is of course referring to is making the gold standard credible after decades of monetary debasement. Rebuilding credibility will indeed be a difficult task, but can be accomplished over time. Initially all that is needed is to make sure that gold flows into the Treasury – and not out from it – when redemption of the dollar into gold is restored. 
Will Trump Revalue Gold To $10,000? To do that Trump will need to make the new monetary system credible by accounting for all the monetary debasement of the F$ since 1971. That means the Treasury will need to be ready to act as required under a gold standard to buy gold and redeem dollars for gold at a credible price, which I calculate to be $10,000 per ounce. 
Some may find $10,000 to be eye-watering, but this amount is based on historical experience. It would simply be repeating what happened in 1934. When President Roosevelt devalued the dollar by 41% from 23.222 grains of gold ($20.67) to 13.714 grains ($35), gold flowed into the Treasury in exchange for dollars. The resulting increase of sound money flowing into the economy enabled it to begin the process of recovering from the depths of the Great Depression. 
So to make a new gold standard credible by getting gold to flow into the Treasury, we need to repeat what FDR did. It is easy to calculate. 
After the 1934 devaluation, the weight of gold in the Treasury was 15% of the total quantity of dollars in M3. Today M3 is $17.6 trillion, and supposedly there are 261.5 million ounces of gold in Treasury vaults. Which equates to $67,304 per ounce. So 15% of that is $10,095. For simplicity, let’s round it to $10,000, meaning that one C$ would be defined as 0.048 of one grain of gold. At that $10,000 rate of exchange, gold will flow into the Treasury from the far reaches of the planet, benefitting global economies as well as the US economy. 
We need to ask ourselves, won’t this resulting increase in the money supply be inflationary? Answer: No more than it was during the Great Depression. In one year after FDR’s devaluation, M3 increased by 10.2%, but there was little inflation. The bulk of the new money was not put into speculation, but rather, used in productive purposes that began rebuilding the US economy. 
What’s more, commodities and other goods that were being hoarded as an alternative to bank deposits flowed into circulation, helping keep inflation under control. The same thing will happen today. But let’s not forget, what happens to the federal government’s debt mountain? I suspect some government promises will be broken – like changing Social Security to reduce payouts – to enable the debt to be brought back under control, which brings up one last point. 
A credible national currency and creditworthy government are different things. They do go hand-in-hand, but you need the former to achieve the latter. The reason of course is that governments cannot create gold out of thin air, like they do paper dollars. That is the wisdom the framers enshrined in the Constitution. Let’s hope Mr Trump values their wisdom and re-establishes the monetary legacy they left for us. A sound dollar helped build a great country where everybody was given the opportunity for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
As president with a Republican controlled Congress, Trump can change everything. America’s best hope is he rescinds Nixon’s “temporary” suspension of the dollar’s redeemability into gold and puts the dollar back on a credible gold standard at $10,000 per ounce.” For those who are interested in hearing more about the gold market and the Trump shocker, KWN has just released   gold,   more. and you can listen to this extraordinary interview   Legend Art Cashin On A Trump Presidency, The New World Order, Gold, Brexit, The Great Depression And Why We Will See Panic  ",0
19464,"Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher, a Mother-Daughter Act for the Ages - The New York Times","For anyone who loves the spotlight, mothering can be an ideal role  —   for a while. The mother is a singular star to her baby, whose gaze follows her around the room with the watchfulness of an obsessive fan. For the stars Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds, that dynamic seemed to linger well into Ms. Fisher’s childhood: Ms. Fisher was the reverent observer, her mother the adored and observed. “When my mother was at home on weekends, we stayed with her as much as possible, which frequently meant we were very involved in watching our mother,” wrote Ms. Fisher in her memoir “Wishful Drinking,” including her brother, Todd Fisher, in her recollections. Sometimes, they watched her sleep often, they watched their mother transform into someone “not of this world,” a trick carried off with makeup and glitter and silk. “When our mother dressed,” Ms. Fisher wrote, “the man behind the curtain became the great and powerful Oz. ” Over the years, Ms. Reynolds and Ms. Fisher had a relationship as conflicted and layered as any other   story in show business, but with an ending that they might think implausible, or even sentimental, had they read it in a script. First Ms. Fisher died on Tuesday, of heart attack at 60 a day later, her mother, 84, succumbed to heart failure of her own, although technically she was likely felled by a stroke. There is something about celebrity   acts like the one lived by Ms. Fisher and Ms. Reynolds that capture the imagination in a way that famous   simply do not. Think of Kris Jenner and the Kardashian sisters, Joan and Melissa Rivers, Judy and Liza. Even the most narcissistic of   mothers seem to have enough psychic energy to love a child passionately, or at least to include the daughter, a younger version of herself, in the realm of things emotionally essential. As glitzy or extreme as their lives are, those   represent, in the push and pull of their relationship, something familiar to so many other mothers and daughters, something they recognize in their own lives: the   in the role of caregiver, the pleasure and suffocation that comes with being worried over. Whose turn is it to watch? Whose turn is it to be watched? Ms. Fisher characterizes her memoir as just one more “pathetic bid” for the attention she did not receive as a young child. Ms. Fisher, it turns out, has plenty of distracting sparkle of her own: With humor, her writing tap dances around her relationship with her mother, whom she describes (twice) as “eccentric” and whose troubled marriages Ms. Fisher mines for comic material. She and her mother were both clever,    victims of those laughably imperfect men. But the public’s impression of the   pair was probably more fully formed, fairly or not, by the film “Postcards from the Edge,” the script of which Ms. Fisher adapted from her autobiographical novel of the same name. The daughter in that film, played by Meryl Streep, clearly resents her     mother, who infantilizes but also cares fiercely for her while she is in recovery. In one complicated scene, the mother, played by Shirley MacLaine, steals the show at a party supposedly thrown in her daughter’s honor. We see a momentary flash of loathing on her daughter’s face, which gives way  —   quickly  —   to admiration, even pure joy, in the song her mother performs for the crowd. She is her mother’s biggest fan, as only a child can be. When they are offstage, she is also her toughest critic, as only a child can be. Ms. Reynolds and Ms. Fisher took their   show on the road, performing together in nightclub acts from the time Ms. Fisher was very young, and then performing again, in some version, on “The Oprah Winfrey Show,” in 2011. In a lengthy interview, they spoke of their trials, including a   period in which Ms. Reynolds claimed, dramatically, that they did not speak. “We talked, really badly,” Ms. Fisher clarified. She explained that at the time, she needed to separate  —   “to forge some kind of character out of   …     nothing,” she said, her famous wit momentarily leaving her. In “Postcards from the Edge,” the   actress is still asking her mother: “Why do you have to completely overshadow me?” But on Oprah, and also in her own life, Ms. Fisher more than held her own, playing a tough,   princess in “Star Wars”: She, too, was an icon of her time, and she, too, was not quite of this world. If her mother was forever an ingénue, albeit one who could land a wicked zinger, Ms. Fisher was a blazing comic, a teller of truths with little patience for costume and  . From what she called “nothing,” she forged something big and bold and every bit as brilliant as the woman who raised her, less glittering, more glaring. Mothers and daughters who watched them on Oprah saw a mutuality in their regard for one another, and reconciliation in their rapport. There was humor and acceptance  —   not so much a   ending as a loving truce, bound by devotion. For the entirety of her childhood, Ms. Fisher had to endure the public’s fascination with her mother, an experience she felt most keenly when they went out in public. “I did not like sharing her,” Ms. Fisher wrote in “Wishful Drinking. ” But toward the end of her mother’s life  —   Ms. Fisher did not know it was toward the end of her own life, as well  —   she wanted to show the world the person whom she saw, the mother and human, the Oz behind the curtain whom she loved. That was one reason, Ms. Fisher said, that she consented to having a documentary made about them both, called “Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds,” which will be broadcast on HBO on Jan. 7. At times, one of the documentary’s directors, Fisher Stevens, was frustrated by just how hard it was to capture the real Ms. Reynolds  —   sometimes, he told The Washington Post, she asked for her lines, and seemed incapable of dropping a performer’s pretense in front of the camera one interview concludes with her throwing a kiss, as if she were ending a telethon. Ms. Reynolds, offstage, was a gift she reserved for her daughter and family alone. On the Oprah special, Ms. Reynolds said of her daughter, “I always feel, as a mother does, that I protect her. Who will do that when I’m gone?” she asked. And yet at the end, it was the daughter who protected the mother, hovering over her, in the documentary, when Ms. Reynolds insists on performing despite obvious frailty. Ms. Fisher brings her mother meals, begs her to rest, agonizes over logistics so Ms. Reynolds could comfortably accept a lifetime achievement award she was receiving from the Screen Actors Guild in 2015. When her was daughter was unexpectedly gone, on Tuesday, Debbie Reynolds perhaps felt, at some level, that the show that mattered most was over. When she exited the stage a day later, it was her last and most exquisite bit of showmanship  —   a performance surely of love.",0
19465,WikiLeaks: Look Who The Clinton Camp Most Wants to Please,"Pinterest 
Who does the Clinton camp want to make “happy”? Not the American people, of course, but none other than billionaire left-wing globalist George Soros. 
Soros has donated around $25 million to the Clinton campaign as of July, according to Politico , and that clearly buys a great deal of influence. WikiLeaks has recently released emails from the account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta that show the lengths the campaign went to keep Soros “happy” and the huge amount of influence he exerted. 
In an Oct. 7, 2014 email from top Clinton aide Huma Abedin to now-campaign manager Robby Mook, Abedin discussed a dinner Clinton was going to have with Soros. Abedin said in the email that she expected that Soros would eventually ask Clinton to attend a fundraiser for one of the numerous groups Soros helps bankroll, the liberal America Votes organization. 
Mook replied to the email: “I would only do this for political reasons (ie to make Soros happy).” 
Fox News reported : 
During her time as secretary of state, Clinton was forwarded from Soros’ aides on Jan. 23, 2011 a message he wrote specifically for her addressing “a serious situation” in Albania. Soros even included two actions that “need to be done urgently.” One of the suggestions was appointing “a mediator such as Carl Bildt, Martti Ahtisaari or Miroslav Lajcak…” 
Clinton received the email the next day. On Jan. 27, Lajcak met Albanian leaders for a mediation effort. 
In another instance, just hours after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia on Feb. 13, 2016, Chris Stone, president of the Soros-founded Open Society Foundations, emailed Podesta and asked: “Remember our discussion of Wallace Jefferson, [former] Chief Justice in Texas?” Podesta simply replied, “yup.” 
An adviser and spokesman for Soros, Michael Vachon, did most of the corresponding with Podesta related to Soros. Vachon scheduled phone calls and meetings along with making sure that the campaign knew Soros’ position on a variety of policy issues. 
Fox News reported: 
On March 7, 2016, Vachon sent Podesta a memo regarding “TPP and Malaysia’s Corruption Crisis.” The document criticized President Obama for making “visible compromises” in his quest to get a deal for the Trans Pacific Partnership completed. Podesta was ostensibly set to discuss the memo with Soros and his son, Alexander, during a dinner later that month. Six days later, Vachon got even more specific. 
“In general I think George is more interested in talking about policy than the campaign per se,” Vachon wrote. “In a separate email I will send you George’s latest thinking on the migration crisis, which he is spending a lot of time on. His other big preoccupation these days is Ukraine.” 
Refugees/migration, the Supreme Court, global warming, Ukraine, etc., are surely just a sampling of policy issues on which the globalist Soros has and will continue to influence Clinton. 
Clinton is dangerous enough as it is, but as the man who could be directing policy decisions if Clinton is elected president? That is a scary thought.",0
19466,Comment on Trump considering a military general for VP by marblenecltr,"| July 10, 2016 at 4:05 pm | Reply 
Michael Flynn is more than a valued adviser to the presumptive GOP nominee. He’s also a potential VP candidate. 
The growing chatter about his key role in the Trump campaign coincides with his new book, “The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies,” scheduled for release July 12. A vice presidential trial balloon certainly would drive interest in the text, and possibly juice sales. 
He teamed up on the book with Michael Ledeen, a prominent member of a group of scholars and former government officials that helped shape the views of many top national security leaders in the George W. Bush administration. 
Follow us: @politico on Twitter | Politico on Facebook 
Michael Ledeen 
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 
Work in the United States[edit] 
In the early 1980s, Ledeen appeared before the newly established Senate Subcommittee on Security and Terrorism, alongside former CIA director William Colby, author Claire Sterlingand former Newsweek editor Arnaud de Borchgrave. Both Ledeen and de Borchgrave worked for the Center for Strategic and International Studies at Georgetown University at the time.[6]All four testified that they believed the Soviet Union had provided for material support, training and inspiration for various terrorist groupings.[7] Ledeen was involved in the Iran–Contra affair as a consultant of National Security Advisor Robert C. McFarlane. Ledeen vouched for Iranian intermediary Manucher Ghorbanifar. In addition, he met with Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, officials of the Israeli Foreign Ministry and the Central Intelligence Agency to arrange meetings with high-ranking Iranian officials, whereby U.S supported Iranians would be given weapons by Israel, and would proceed to negotiate with Hizbollah for the release of hostages in Lebanon.[8] Ledeen’s own version of the events is published in his book, Perilous Statecraft.[9] 
Yellowcake forgery allegations[edit] 
Main article: Niger uranium forgeries 
According to a September 2004 article by Joshua Micah Marshall, Laura Rozen, and Paul Glastris in Washington Monthly:[10]“The first meeting occurred in Rome in December, 2001. It included Franklin, Rhode, and another American, the neoconservative writer and operative Michael Ledeen, who organized the meeting. (According to UPI, Ledeen was then working for Undersecretary of Defense Douglas Feith as a consultant.) Also in attendance was Ghorbanifar and a number of other Iranians.” 
Colleagues Andrew McCarthy and Mark R. Levin have defended Ledeen, writing[11] 
Up until now, the fiction recklessly spewed by disgruntled intelligence-community retirees and their media enablers—some of whom have conceded that the claim is based on zero evidence—has been that Michael had something to do with the forged Italian documents that, according to the Left’s narrative, were the basis for President Bush’s “lie” in the 2003 State of the Union Address that Saddam Hussein had obtained yellowcake uranium (for nuclear-weapons construction) in Africa. 
Iraq War advocacy[edit] 
Regarding the “pre-emptive” invasion of Iraq, in 2002 Ledeen criticized the views of former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, writing:[12] He fears that if we attack Iraq “I think we could have an explosion in the Middle East. It could turn the whole region into a cauldron and destroy the War on Terror.” 
One can only hope that we turn the region into a cauldron, and faster, please. If ever there were a region that richly deserved being cauldronized, it is the Middle East today. If we wage the war effectively, we will bring down the terror regimes in Iraq, Iran, and Syria, and either bring down the Saudi monarchy or force it to abandon its global assembly line to indoctrinate young terrorists. 
That’s our mission in the war against terror. Ledeen specifically called for the deposition of Saddam Hussein’s regime by force in 2002: So it’s good news when Scowcroft comes out against the desperately needed and long overdue war against Saddam Hussein and the rest of the terror masters.[12] and: Question #2: Okay, well if we are all so certain about the dire need to invade Iraq, then when do we do so? Ledeen: Yesterday[13] Ledeen’s statements prior to the start of the Iraq war such as “desperately needed and long overdue war against Saddam Hussein” and “dire need to invade Iraq” caused Glenn Greenwald to label his later statement that he “opposed the military invasion of Iraq before it took place” to be an “outright lie”.[14] However, Ledeen maintains these statements are consistent since: “I advocated—as I still do—support for political revolution in Iran as the logical and necessary first step in the war against the terror masters.”[15] 
Views on Iran[edit] 
Although Ledeen was in favor of invading Iraq, he also believes that Iran should have been the first priority in the “war on terror.”[16] The New York Times describes Ledeen’s views as “everything traces back to Tehran”.[16] Ledeen’s phrase, “faster, please” has become a signature meme in Ledeen’s writings (it is currently the title of his blog on the Pajamas Mediawebsite) and is often referenced by neoconservative writers advocating a more forceful and broader “war on terror.” In 1979, Ledeen was one of the first Western writers to argue thatAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was a “clerical fascist”, and that while it was legitimate to criticize the Shah’s regime, if Khomeini seized power in Iran the Iranian people would suffer an even greater loss of freedom and women would be deprived of political and social rights. He presently believes that “No one in the West has yet supported Iranian democratic organizations” and that “aggressive support for those Iranians who wish to be free” would most likely work in ending the clerical government.[17] 
According to Justin Raimondo, Ledeen “holds up Bill Clinton and Madeleine Albright as patsies for Khomeini—who supposedly believed that the Ayatollah overthrew Shah Reza Pahlavibecause the Iranian government was ‘excessively repressive and intolerant.’ While it would not do to come right out and deny the savagery of the Shah’s legendary SAVAK secret police, Ledeen informs us that, under the monarch’s beneficent rule, ‘Iran had become too modern, too tolerant—especially of women and of other religious faiths—and too self-indulgent. The shah had Westernized Iran’—except, perhaps, in his prisons, where the ancient methods of torture were routinely employed on dissidents of all sorts.”[18] 
Ledeen is currently against both an invasion of Iran or air-strikes within the country.[17][19] He has argued that the latter may eventually become necessary if negotiations with the Iranian government fail, but it would only be the least bad option of many options and it would lead to many negative unforeseen consequences.[19] The New York Times has called Ledeen’s skepticism towards military action against Iran surprising given his opposition to the regime.[16] In October 2007, Ledeen argued that:“Those who believe that I am part of some “hawkish gang” just haven’t noticed that I am opposed to invasion or bombing the nuclear facilities. My fear is that, by failing to promote a non-violent democratization of Iran, we make large-scale violence much more likely.” 
“In any event, time will tell, and I share the fear of most commenters [sic] that we will indeed arrive at a horrible choice between Iran with the bomb, or bomb Iran, as Sarkozy and Kouchner have put it. And if that happens, it will demonstrate a terrible failure on the part of the West, including the United States, to craft a serious Iran policy lo these many years.”[17]",0

Officials inside the Democrat party have begun a party-wide search for a candidate who knows how to use email. 
Party strategists have decided that an inability to use email properly has cost them the White House, and that an aptitude for email will be a real vote winner in 2020. 
As one DNC insider explained, “Trump has won the presidential election off the back of our inability to convince the American public we can set up and use a modern email service. 
“If we can just address that one hurdle we can win back the White House in four years time. 
“You wouldn’t happen to know anyone who is good with email, would you? Anyone?

19468,Elaine Chao Confirmed as Secretary of Transportation - Breitbart,"The U. S. Senate approved Elaine Chao’s nomination to serve as the new secretary of transportation in Donald Trump’s administration by a vote of   on Tuesday. [Chao, who served in the cabinet of George W. Bush as secretary of labor in two successive administrations, will oversee important changes in transportation over coming years, such as the development of   cars, as well as Donald Trump’s $1 trillion plan to comprehensively upgrade the country’s transportation infrastructure.  In her hearing, Chao said that excessive regulation “dampens the basic creativity and innovation of our country,” and promised to avoid a “patchwork” of regulation in the rollout of   cars. “The Department of Transportation has a key role to play in modernizing our transportation systems, strengthening our country’s competitiveness, and improving our quality of life. I look forward to working with you to rebuild, refurbish and revitalize America’s infrastructure, so our economy can continue to grow, create good paying jobs for America’s working families and enhance our quality of life,” Chao said at her first confirmation hearing last week. However, financial disclosure forms released last week showed Chao could collect up to $5 million in Wells Fargo preferred stock after assuming her new role in the Trump administration. Chao, who was born in Taiwan, is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. She becomes the fifth member of Donald Trump’s cabinet to be confirmed.

19469,Crimean and Donetsk leaders comment on US elections,"November 10, 2016 - Fort Russ News -  PolitRussia - translated by J. Arnoldski - 


Crimean leader Sergey Aksenov welcomed the choice of the American people in the US presidential elections despite what he called “numerous” violations in the electoral process. 
Aksenov stated: “The American people have made their choice. Our president was clear: the Russian Federation is not interfering in or even making any attempts to influence the will of the American people. In my opinion, the elections were held with numerous violations. If this had happened in Crimea or Russia, then the elections would have been assessed differently by American politicians. They would say that everything was wrong and illegitimate. But the Americans did not allow Russian diplomats near polling stations and prevented the formation of an objective view of what was happening at polling stations and overall how the elections were being held in the US.” 
Commenting on Trump’s pre-election promises in regards to Russia and the Republic of Crimea, Aksenov said: “Before elections, politicians usually make some statements, and then their program can radically change. Time will tell. I am sure that our president will make sufficient efforts so that Crimea will be recognized throughout the world.” 
This summer, Trump stated that he would be ready to “look into” the question of recognizing Crimea as Russian territory and lifting the sanctions against Russia if he won the elections. He remarked that Crimeans want to be with Russia and that this should be considered by the international community. These words caused great anxiety in Kiev. 

The leader of the Donetsk People’s Republic, Alexander Zakharchenko, was cautious in being optimistic towards Trump’s election as US president. Zakharchenko expressed concern that after Trump moves into the White House, he will become part of the American political system and there is no guarantee that he will be able to resist this system. For the DPR, Trump’s suggested policies could signal a change in attitude towards the Ukrainian crisis.

19472,"Israel, Kim Jong-un, Andrew Puzder: Your Evening Briefing - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump said he could “live with” a   solution to the   conflict, backing away from a   of American policy in the Middle East. The remarks, delivered at a news conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, spurred anger and bafflement among Palestinians, some of whom said the policy change would undercut the already slim chances of progress toward reconciliation. “This is going to give Israel a free hand to do what it wants,” said one man in Gaza City. _____ 2. Russia denied a New York Times report that senior Russian intelligence officials had repeated contact with Trump campaign staff members in the year before the U. S. election. But the resignation of Michael T. Flynn as national security adviser underscores lingering uncertainty about the relationship between the Trump administration and Russia. Seeking to shift the narrative, Mr. Trump focused on the leaks from American intelligence agencies to the news media. “Very  !” he wrote on Twitter. Today’s episode of The Daily podcast reviews what is known about Mr. Flynn’s contacts with Russia. Listen from a computer, an iOS device or an Android device. _____ 3. Andrew Puzder, Mr. Trump’s nominee for labor secretary, withdrew from consideration after growing Republican doubts that he could be confirmed. It was a rare moment of cheer for Democrats, who had hammered Mr. Puzder  —   the chief executive of the CKE Restaurants   chain, which owns Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr.  —   for his treatment of workers and opposition to the minimum wage. His personal life had also been scrutinized. Senators had been shown a tape of his   incognito on Oprah Winfrey’s television show in 1990, detailing her claims of abuse against him, which she later recanted. _____ 4. Our reporters are tracking the case of Jeanette Vizguerra, a mother of three who has lived in the U. S. for 20 years. She had to make a harrowing choice: check in with the immigration authorities, risking deportation and separation from her children, or bunker down inside a church for what could be months or years. U. S. citizens are also feeling pressures, as activists report an increase in requests by border agents to examine travelers’ digital devices. Here’s a guide to your rights if an agent asks you to unlock your phone. _____ 5. Throughout the country, independent bookstores have taken on a new life as centers of resistance to the Trump administration. Besides hawking George Orwell’s “1984,” they are handing out lawmakers’ contact information and hosting events to gather protesters. There are also some defections from the opposing camp. The @Trump_Regrets Twitter account has amplified the second thoughts of people who once supported the Republican president. “I voted for you but you’re still acting like a baby,” one wrote. _____ 6. The police in Malaysia detained a woman holding Vietnamese travel documents and were looking for other suspects in what appears to have been a lethal poison attack on the half brother of North Korea’s leader, Kim   at the Kuala Lumpur airport. The brother, Kim   had pleaded for his life in a letter to the leader in 2012, but a South Korean official said there had been “a standing order” for his assassination since Kim   took power in 2011. Researchers say Mr. Kim has ordered more than 300 executions. _____ 7. For the second straight year, traffic deaths were up in the United States. Fatalities increased 6 percent to 40, 200 in 2016, according to preliminary estimates from the nonprofit National Safety Council. If the estimates are confirmed, it would be the deadliest year since 2007. There’s no single cause for the increase, but activists have pointed to more lenient enforcement of traffic safety laws and increasing numbers of distracted drivers. _____ 8. “When all eyes were on her, she didn’t decide to make herself more palatable to white viewers.

19473,Artificial intelligence ‘robot’ says Trump will win,"Other Writers 
An Artificial Intelligence (AI) system that correctly predicted the last three US elections says Donald Trump will win 
“If Trump loses, it will defy the data trend for the first time in the last 12 years since internet engagement began in full earnest.” — Sanjav Rai, Indian inventor of the MogIA artificial intelligence system in 2004 
According to a report in the International Business Times (IBT) , the artificial intelligence (AI) system that accurately predicted the outcomes of the last three U.S. presidential elections has put Trump ahead of Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House. 
The AI system called MogIA was created in 2004 by Sanjiv Rai, founder of Indian IT company Genic.ai. 
The system works by processing 20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, the IBT explained. 
It then analyzes the information to generate predictions, taking into account data such as engagement with tweets and viewership of Facebook Live videos. 
“If Trump loses, it will defy the data trend for the first time in the last 12 years,” developer Rai was quoted as saying. 
Having already correctly predicted the winners of the Democratic and Republican primaries, the system found that people are 25 percent more engaged with Trump than they were with Barack Obama at his peak in 2008—the year he was elected president. 
“While most algorithms suffer from programmers/developer’s biases, MogIA aims at learning from her environment, developing her own rules at the policy layer and develop expert systems without discarding any data,” Rai said. 
In September this year, Professor Allan Lichtman from Washington D.C.’s American University , told the Washington Post that Trump is most likely to win based on a system of true/false statement that he calls “Keys to the White House.” 
Professor Lichtman, who, the newspaper added, had correctly predicted the winner of every presidential election since 1984, said he based his predictions on “13 true/false questions, where an answer of ‘true’ always favors the reelection of the party holding the White House.” 
“If six or more of the 13 keys are false — that is, they go against the party in power — they lose. If fewer than six are false, the party in power gets four more years,” he said. 
These “keys” include questions about who holds the most seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, the lack of a significant third party campaign, the economy, the extent of a real policy change should a challenger win, the level of social unrest, foreign, and military policies. 
“The keys have nothing to do with presidential approval polls or horse-race polls,” Professor Lichtman said, going on to make it evident that he personally dislikes Trump a great deal. However, on his system the Democratic party has definitely “lost” five of the “keys,” and is well on course to lose a sixth, which, he said, would give the election to Trump by default. 
The New Observer has long predicted that Trump can only win if at least 70 percent of whites turn out to vote, and that he takes at least two-thirds of the white vote. Anything less than that will see a liberal minority white vote team up with the block nonwhite vote to grant Clinton victory—which was exactly how Obama was twice elected. 
Trump’s only hope therefore, lies in previous non-voters turning out, a fact to which he alluded in a recent speech, where he mentioned that reports coming in from the early voting figures revealed a massive surge in people who had never voted before.",0
19474,Comment on Sweden Bans Christmas Street Lights; To Avoid Offending Muslim Migrants? by jaded,"Posted on October 26, 2016 by Paul Joseph Watson Authorities claim it’s for “security” reasons Towns across Sweden have banned Christmas street lights in the name of “security,” but the real reason is almost certainly because the country has completely capitulated to Islam after importing countless Muslim migrants over the last two years. According to an SVT report, The Swedish Transport Administration (Trafikverket) will not allow municipalities to erect Christmas street lights on light poles that the authority manages, meaning that many towns will have no festival lights at all on major streets. According to Speisa , “The change is a victory for those who want to tone down the reminder of the country’s Christian traditions, but according to the Swedish Transport Administration, the decision for the drastic change is “security”. “Poles are not designed for the weight of Christmas lights, and we have to remove anything that should not be there,” said Eilin Isaksson, national coordinator at the Swedish Transport Administration. The argument that the lights are too heavy and pose a safety risk sounds like complete baloney. Swedes are being asked to believe that lights normally held up by tree branches are now too weighty to be supported by metal poles. Despite there being no safety issue with the street lights for decades, this new rule has been instituted right after record numbers of Muslim migrants flooded into the country – just a coincidence I’m sure. In reality, the Christmas lights ban is almost certainly an effort to avoid offending Muslim migrants who are causing chaos in cities like Malmo , where the firebombing of cars and businesses in or near Muslim ghetto ‘no-go areas’ is becoming a routine occurrence. As we previously reported , a top Swedish Bishop advocated removing crosses from a Christian church and replacing them with Islamic symbols in order to please Muslims. Last Christmas, it was also announced that a Christmas Eve special broadcast on public television would be hosted by a Muslim woman. Some areas of Sweden are even capitulating to returning ISIS terrorists by offering jihadists free driving licenses and housing benefits to help them “reintegrate into the job market”.",0
19475,Arrests for Cannabis Possession Outnumber Arrests for All Violent Crimes Combined,"Arrests for Cannabis Possession Outnumber Arrests for All Violent Crimes Combined Nov 5, 2016 1 0 
As the U.S. government continues to fight its futile war on drugs , marijuana possession arrests have now become more common than all other crimes combined , according to a new report focused on showing the human toll of criminalizing drug use and published by Human Rights Watch ( HRW.org ). 
The war on drugs in the U.S. is a palpable failure. Drug-possession arrests more than doubled between 1979 and 2016. The prison population now includes more than half a million Americans jailed for drug offenses , in comparison to only 41,000 in 1980. Over the last four decades, the war on drugs has restricted individual rights and created an environment of violence and inequality, but it has done almost nothing to solve the problems associated with drug abuse. 
“Evaluations of specific tactics, such as raids on crack houses and crackdowns, suggest that their effects on drug availability are minimal, decay rapidly, and may displace drug activity to other areas and increase drug-related violence.” ~ 2016 study published in by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, entitled War on Drugs Policing and Police Brutality Shocking Rise in Cannabis Possession Arrests 
Despite the ongoing war, cannabis usage is becoming more acceptable and even legal, proving that opinion and policy vary wildly. In fact, a study conducted by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism found that the number of Americans who use marijuana has doubled from 2001-02 to 2012-13. The 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health estimates that over 22 million Americans use the plant either for medical purposes and/or recreationally. 
Americans have become accepting of cannabis, even though it is still illegal under federal U.S. law. Over the last decade, immense amount of research has shown the medical benefits of the cannabis plant . Legalization of the plant in several U.S. states has demonstrated that it is not a threat to public safety. It seems that the most dangerous aspect of cannabis use is the possibility of police confrontation, arrest and incarceration. 
Regardless of the trends showing an increase in cannabis popularity, the report by HRW.org found that policing of marijuana-possession laws continues to be quite aggressive when compared to the enforcement of other laws. 
“Despite shifting public opinion, in 2015, nearly half of all drug possession arrests (over 574,000) were for marijuana possession. By comparison, there were 505,681 arrests for violent crimes (which the FBI defines as murder, non-negligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault). This means that police made more arrests for simple marijuana possession than for all violent crimes combined.” 
Through the evaluation of court data for the state of Texas, HRW discovered that many of those prosecuted “were prosecuted for small quantities of drugs—in some cases, fractions of a gram—that were clearly for personal use.” Other sources reveal that 8 in 10 drug arrests in 2013 were for drug possession rather than sale and manufacturing. Drug Crimes and Prisons 
Every 25 seconds, someone in the U.S. is arrested for drug use or possession. More than one of nine arrests by state law enforcement are for drug possession, amounting to more than 1.25 million arrests per year. 
As a result of this aggressive enforcement of drug laws, on any given day at least 137,000 people sit in local and state jails on drug possession charges awaiting their day in court. Drug possession offenders in general will soon make up 25% of the prison population. Because federal law mandates a sentence of life without parole for anyone whose third strike is a federal crime (such as drug possession and, in many states, marijuana possession), 10 times as many third-strikers are serving time for drug possession as a second-degree murder. 
It’s clear that people from all demographics wish to have safe access to cannabis , both for recreational purposes as well as for a growing list of medical benefits. While access opens up in U.S. states where legalization continues to gain steam, safe access to cannabis is still an issue for many, which is why people are creating businesses like Buy Weed Online Canada , and until the government fully decriminalizes cannabis, our prison system, court system and police forces will continue to be bogged down with the persecution and prosecution of non-violent offenders.

19476,Clinton Vs. Trump: Latest Electoral Prediction [Greg Laden's Blog] | Science and Technology,"(Before It's News)
It is fun to look at polls, and using such data, decide which candidate will win which state, and ultimately, which candidate will win the electoral college. A lot of people and organizations do that, and for this reason, I don’t. I do not have access to polls that no one else sees. Were I to use polling data to directly predict outcomes per state, I’d use a method like that used by FiveThirtyEight, and probably come up with similar results. How boring. It would be a waste of my time to try to replicate the excellent work done by Nate Silver and his team.
Back during the Democratic Primaries, I decided that I wanted to get a handle on which candidate was likely to win, fairly early on. The polling based estimates were inadequate because most states simply didn’t have polling data that early in the process. So, I invented an alternative method, which made certain estimates of how voters with different ethnic identities would vote. That method accurately predicted several primary outcomes, outperforming the poll based methods such as those used by FiveThirtyEight.
After a while, enough primaries had been carried out that I could switch methods slightly. Using the same exact model, but primed with the results of prior primaries (that year) rather than my estimates of voter behavior, I used the ethnic distribution data for each state to predict the outcome of upcoming primary contests.
Once again, my method was very accurate, and once again, it out performed the polling based methods.
So, recently, I’ve tried to apply a similar method to estimating the electoral outcome for this year’s presidential race. But, it is impossible to use the same exact method because the entire thing happens all on one day. I can’t use the election results from a handful of states to estimate the likely future outcomes in other states.
I recognize that polling data is very limited on a national level. Things happen during an election season that probably change people’s likely voting behavior, especially among independents. Solid states are rarely polled, and small states, swing or not, are rarely polled. Many polls are of low quality. Right now, for instance, fewer than half of the states have polls that were a) taken fully after the final POTUS debate and b) have an A- or better rating from FiveThirtyEight. If I allow the use of B and occasional C ratings for recent polls, and allow a few polls to include periods of time prior to the last POTUS debate, but only in states that are very strongly in favor of one candidate or the other (and thus likely to not move anyway), I can find 32 states that have sort of usable polling data. Interestingly, states with some of the more controversial changes happening, like Utah and Iowa, are not adequately polled.
In order to apply a model like the one I used in the Primaries to the current election, I used the 32 states for which there was somewhat acceptable recent polling data to inform the model (to calculate the regression coefficients) in order to then, separately, predict the likely voting behavior (Trump vs. Clinton) in all of the states.
Before I show you the map, however, I need to discuss something else.
About a week ago the press, especially the somewhat more left leaning press, and various commenters, seeing much reaction to a series of events beginning with the NYT release of Trump’s tax return and ending with the final POTUS debate, events which sandwiched the sexual assault tapes and accusations, collectively decided that a huge gap between Clinton and Trump was rapidly opening up and the race would end with a double digit spread, an electoral rout, and a big party.
Soon after, I pointed out that this may not be correct. That polling data seemed to show, rather, that there was an expansion of the difference between the two candidates followed by a re-closing of the gap, with Clinton still leading but by about as much as before this temporary shift. To this I added a concern. If too many people assumed that the race was over and in the double digit range, perhaps there could be a GOTV backlash effect, or a funding effect, that would shift things to within shooting distance for Trump.
I was not alone in thinking this, and I was probably right. The GOP sunk, via pacs, 25 million dollars into Senate races in response to the Democrats shifting from the national race to the Senate, which was followed by the Democrats shifting back to the national race in certain states, presumably recognizing that the polls were artificially spread. Indeed, some who criticized (arguing mainly from incredulity and good wishes) my admonition noted, correctly, that some of that narrowing was because a bunch of right-leaning polls had come out all at once. This is true, but it ignores that a bunch of left-leaning polls had made the formation of the Great Gap of GOP Defeat look a lot bigger than it ever really was.
I say all this as part one of my preparation for what I’m going to tell you below, which is not the news you want to hear. Part two is some logic I’d like to bludgeon you with.
Consider these points:
1) True Trump supporters could give a rat’s ass about sexual assault, poor debate performance, or tax forms. Donald Trump was correct when he said, weeks ago, now forgotten, that he could gun someone down on the streets of Manhattan and he would not lose support form his base. These people did not abandon him when he was heard to talk about sexual assault. If anything, they were energized by it. And, I’m talking about something just shy of 40% of the voters. We live in a barely civilized asshole country.
2) Please tell me exactly which Hillary Clinton supporters, who were going to vote for Clinton over Trump all along, are NOW going to pick Clinton (if polled or on voting day) that change from not being Clinton supporters to being Clinton supporters? In other words (this is a somewhat subtle point) which people who hated Trump became True Haters of Trump after the sexual assault thing? Almost none. They were already there.
3) The third category of people, the undecideds (who are only lying about being undecided, in most cases) and the so-called “reasonable Republicans” (of which there are very, very few), who could conceivably shift from Trump to Clinton are going to divide their voting activities between Johnson, a write in (as they are being advised by Republican leaders in some cases) or simply staying home.
In other words, over the last few weeks, no source has emerged that hands Secretary Clinton more electoral votes than she probably had about a month ago, and Trump is not going to have any, or at least not many, electoral votes go away.
Those observations (part one) and that logic (part two) cause me to be utterly unsurprised to find out that an analysis of the electoral map I did on October 16th and one I did today do not show Clinton pulling farther ahead. In fact, the two analyses have Clinton being less far ahead than Trump now than ten days ago. The difference is in Ohio (shifting from Clinton to Trump) which is almost certainly going to happen, and North Carolina (which shifted from Clinton to Trump in this analysis) which seems much less likely to happen, and Arizona shifting from Clinton (that was probably wishful thinking) to Trump.
The point here is this, plain and simple. An analysis using a technique that has worked very well for me in the past shows that the difference between that moment of Maximal Clintonosity and today is plus or minus a couple of state. In other words, not different. Maybe a little worse. Really, about the same.
Here’s the current map:
Obviously, I will be watching for more data over the next few days. I assume there will be a spate of polls as we approach November 8th (the day Democrats vote. Republicans vote on the 28th of November). If so, then there will be convergence between my method of calibration and my method of calculation, and the model will consume itself by the tail and become very accurate at the same time.
But between now and then, perhaps that very small number of polls that are both recent and high quality will grow a bit more and I can do this again and resolve those closer states.
By the way, the “swing states” according to my model, the states where things are close, are Ohio, North Carolina, Arizona, and Georgia of those now in the Trump column. Those are indeed swing states. Numerically, the close states that are in the Clinton column are Virginia, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania.",0
19477,Comment on Links 11/6/16 by susan the other,"by Yves Smith 
Dear patient readers, 
Lambert and I recognize that the caliber of reporting from both the MSM and independent news outlets has in many cases moved in a crazypants direction as Election Day nears. Unfortunately, the commentariat has taken far too much of this up, as in has featured links to dodgy stories and theories and has treated them with far more dignity than they warrant. 
We have shut down comments entirely when the quality has decayed too far or they have become too fractious. We hope not to have to do that, but in the last week alone, we’ve had to rip out two entire comment threads, something we are extremely loath to do. That sort of thing should happen at most once a year, not with anything approaching this frequency. 
This site has policy impact. We have spent far too many years building that to put it at risk. We lose credibility with some of the discussions that have been taking place recently. Please use better discernment as to whether the topic you’d like to chew over really belongs here, as opposed to Facebook or Zero Hedge.

19478,COVFEFE LIVEWIRE: Comey Crazy Sweeps Washington... Breitbart Live From Union Pub - Breitbart,"COVFEFE from Union Pub on Capitol Hill! [Former FBI Director James Comey, who was fired by President Donald J. Trump, will testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday morning —  and Washington, D. C. elites are gathered at their favorite watering holes throughout the city to watch the giant   testimony.  Breitbart News will be covering the political class celebration from here, with this livewire including updates on Comey’s testimony and the reaction of the crowd of Washington elites. Union Pub, a landmark Washington, D. C. bar across the street from the Heritage Foundation on Capitol Hill, is offering all patrons who come here to watch the testimony free drinks whenever President Trump Tweets about the Comey hearing throughout its duration until 4 p. m. UPDATE 12:54 P. M. President Trump did not Tweet throughout the entire event, but Union Pub is still giving out a few round of   Budweisers to everyone here! The specialty Budweiser cans, which servers are passing out now, have the special “America” name in place of “Budweiser” on the label and a camouflage design instead of the traditional red cans. Here’s a photo from Breitbart’s Kristina Wong: . @UnionPub giving out free America Budweisers at #ComeyHearing #Covfefe: pic. twitter.   —   Kristina Wong (@kristina_wong) June 8, 2017,  And another from Breitbart News’ Penny Starr: Cheers! Comey reveals he’s a leaker and New York Times pushes FAKE NEWS! @BreitbartNews #comey pic. twitter.   —   Penny Starr (@PennyStarrDC) June 8, 2017,  That’s all folks, we’ll leave it there for today. COVFEFE to everyone and thanks for tuning in! UPDATE 12:50 P. M. As the public part of the hearing adjourned, and Comey has completely vindicated Trump ahead of a later closed session hearing where he and senators are likely to discuss classified information he could not bring up during the televised hearing, the whole thing turned out exactly like Breitbart News Network told you it would: A giant  . Except for the fact that Comey admitted he is a leaker, has a network through which he has leaked information designed to harm President Trump. Oh, and that former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and other Obama administration officials may have engaged in serious misconduct worthy of further investigation —  which Comey testified about today. Meanwhile, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders —  from the podium at the press briefing —  has told reporters that President Trump is not, despite what the leaker James Comey says, a liar. . @SHSanders45: ”No, I can definitively say the president is not a liar. It’s frankly insulting that that question would be asked.”  —   Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) June 8, 2017,  And, of course, nevertheless President Trump persisted. He’s right back out there fighting for American workers while Democrats waste their time on   nonsense.

M. Sen. John McCain ( ) a grumpy old   Republican, made no sense during his questioning of Comey. Breitbart’s own Curt Schilling, the host of Whatever It Takes, questions whether everyone else had trouble following along with McCain’s nonsensical line of questioning: Am I the only one not able to follow along with senator McCain’s line of questioning? ???  —   Curt Schilling (@gehrig38) June 8, 2017,  Even the New York Times’ people questions whether McCain is losing his mind: McCain seems to be confusing the Clinton email case with the Russia investigation.  —   Peter Baker (@peterbakernyt) June 8, 2017,  Trump, who has not Tweeted during the hearing at all, apparently made the decision to avoid Tweeting last night. Politico’s Tara Palmeri has the scoop of why the President would not Tweet today, infuriating all the Union Pub   who did not get any free drinks since President Trump did not Tweet. Trump decided the night before #comeyhearings that he would not   his rebuttal https:  .   —   Tara Palmeri (@tarapalmeri) June 8, 2017,  “Why would I?” Trump apparently told White House aides about   Comey’s appearance before Congress, according to a “senior White House official” who spoke with Politico’s Palmeri. Read the whole thing, including the details on how the president’s mood is “light” during the Comey testimony. UPDATE 12:37 P. M. Their hopes and dreams dashed by Comey completely vindicating Trump in this open hearing, and instead implicating   administration officials like Loretta Lynch —  and implicating himself as an   leaker with a network through which he has leaked damaging information against the president —  the left and media are pinning everything on a last ditch line of questioning from Sen. Kamala Harris ( ). This line of questioning from @SenKamalaHarris regarding the Attorney General is extraordinarily important  —   not to be overlooked,  —   Matt House (@mattwhouse) June 8, 2017,  Here’s video of her comparing Trump to an armed robber though, so take whatever she says with a grain of salt: Sen. Kamala Harris seems to compare Trump to an armed robber saying ”I hope you will give me your wallet” #ComeyTestimony pic. twitter.   —   Mike Ciandella ن (@MikeCiandella) June 8, 2017,  But MSNBC leftist media star Andrea Mitchell loves Kamala Harris, heavily highlighting the rookie Democrat Senator’s questions: . @KamalaHarris asks series of q’s about possible secret contacts between Trump camp and Russia #Comey declines to answer in open hearing,  —   Andrea Mitchell (@mitchellreports) June 8, 2017,  Meanwhile,   Never Trumper Max Boot is in an alternate reality, saying Comey was fantastic as a witness. Bottom line for #ComeyDay: Comey a highly credible witness. Trump isn’t. Comey makes damning accusations. Trump denials unconvincing.  —   Max Boot (@MaxBoot) June 8, 2017,  Flashback, though, to when Comey was fired and Boot with some bold predictions back on May 9: Congress needs to ask Comey to testify  he needs to tell all he knows about Kremlingate. If he does Trump may regret firing him.  —   Max Boot (@MaxBoot) May 10, 2017,  Don’t tell Max Boot about the black helicopters coming for him. Seriously. “KREMLINGATE”? What is wrong with these people? Anyway, another wonderfully fantastic flashback of this Never Trumper from when Comey was fired in May: Prediction: If Democrats take control of Congress in 2018, the firing of Comey will form one of the articles of impeachment.  —   Max Boot (@MaxBoot) May 10, 2017,  UPDATE 12:24 P. M. Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz is calling for the Senate to officially subpoena the documents James Comey ordered leaked through his network of leakers. Senators should ask Comey the name of the Columbia professor and then subpoena the memos from him.  —   Alan Dershowitz (@AlanDersh) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 12:21 P. M. Loretta Lynch is in serious trouble right now. Looks like the Democrats’ efforts may have backfired. Loretta Lynch is having a surprisingly bad day in the Comey testimony,  —   Chris Cillizza (@CillizzaCNN) June 8, 2017,  If it wasn’t for Trump becoming president, the corruption with Obama’s Department of Justice would be a major story. https:  .   —   Josh Kraushaar (@HotlineJosh) June 8, 2017,  Comey also just testified that he did not believe that Lynch could “credibly deny” the Hillary Clinton email scandal investigation, and that she had a serious conflict of interest. He also testified in exchange with Sen. John Cornyn ( ) the Senate Majority Whip, that it is possible a special prosecutor was needed for the email scandal. He said he considered calling for appointing a special counsel in the scandal, but decided against it. UPDATE 12:08 P. M. Oh my. Now confirmed leaker James Comey’s leak network has been outed, or at least part of it has: Only in Washington: Someone nursing a pint of beer shouts out to a crowded bar: ”Daniel Richman of Columbia” https:  .   —   Alexander Panetta (@Alex_Panetta) June 8, 2017,  So the collusion involves former FBI director, mainstream media, and the   academy to bring down the elected president #ComeyHearing https:  .   —   Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) June 8, 2017,  And now Comey’s   leak network is confirming to the media that Comey is a leaker: Columbia Law Prof Daniel Richman confirms to @ZCohenCNN that he is the friend that provided excerpts of the Comey memo to reporters.  —   Ryan Nobles (@ryanobles) June 8, 2017,    UPDATE 12:05 P. M. There are now serious questions being raised as to whether Loretta Lynch, the former Attorney General from the Obama administration, will be subpoenaed to testify after this hearing where Comey has implicated her. Legit question: is Loretta Lynch going to be subpoenaed as a result of this testimony?  —   Mike Shields (@mshields007) June 8, 2017,  Meanwhile, Comey’s admission he is a leaker serious hurts him. Jonathan Turley of George Washington University Law School makes the case Comey may be in serious trouble: Comey admits that he leaked the internal memo through a Columbia law professor in order to force Special Counsel. Yet, that raises questions,  —   Jonathan Turley (@JonathanTurley) June 8, 2017,  Comey is doing well but leaking info runs against Comey’s image, particularly in light of the leak controversy hoiunding the Administration,  —   Jonathan Turley (@JonathanTurley) June 8, 2017,  The memos could be viewed as gov’t material and potential evidence .  Leaking to a friend for disclosure can raise serious questions.  —   Jonathan Turley (@JonathanTurley) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 12:02 P. M. Donald Trump, Jr. highlights an excellent question from Sen. Roy Blunt ( ) to Comey. Comey did not have a great answer. Sen Blunt: If you told Sessions you didn’t want to be alone with Trump again, why did you continue to take his calls?  —   Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 12:01 P. M. From our RNC friends, here’s video of Sen. Rubio crushing another leftist media narrative during his questioning of Comey.  Basically, Comey was so concerned about President Trump’s conversations with him that he alerted exactly nobody who could do anything about it. In other words, this whole thing is a giant  . Except for Comey implicating himself as a leaker. UPDATE 11:58 A. M. Comey is in big trouble after this hearing. He admitted he’s a leaker, and has an actual network through which he leaks information to the press. In addition, he withheld from leaking information that would have vindicated President Trump weeks ago. White House social media director Dan Scavino captures it clearly and concisely on Twitter: Because if it was leaked that @realDonaldTrump was personally not under   it would have crushed the entire narrative. pic. twitter.   —   Dan Scavino Jr. (@DanScavino) June 8, 2017,  President Trump still has yet to Tweet, so no free drinks yet here at Union Pub. Looks like the owners here made a smart decision since this place is standing room only right now. UPDATE 11:54 A. M. Oh, man, this keeps getting better and better. Comey just shredded the Democrats AND now the fake news media. Oh Boy. Comey says there have been many many stories based on classified information about Russia that are just ”dead wrong”  —   Maeve Reston (@MaeveReston) June 8, 2017,  I wonder if any of the media outlets that have printed repeated stories on these matters will check their reporting again or correct it if they’re wrong. Not holding my breath. UPDATE 11:50 A. M. Comey has emerged throughout this hearing before the American people looking very much like a drama queen. One of the more memorable lines is when he says when Trump called him to ask him if he was free for dinner, he had to break a date with his wife. Comey says Trump called him at his desk. ”Free for dinner tonight? ””I said yessir  …    I had to call my wife and break a date with her.”  —   Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) June 8, 2017,  That’s not the only   Comey testimony: COMEY JUST QUOTES HENRY 11 on what he thought Trump meant: ’Will no one rid me of this toublesome priest”  —   Trip Gabriel (@tripgabriel) June 8, 2017,  Meanwhile, even CNN’s Jim Acosta —  a vehemently   media figure in the heart of the opposition party’s mothership CNN —  is joining in on the   fun. Giving info to media ”like feeding seagulls at the beach?” Fact check: True.  —   Jim Acosta (@Acosta) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:48 A. M. The leaky Capitol Hill GOP swamp aides are attacking Trump, despite the fact Comey has vindicated the president and implicated himself in potentially illegal leaks. Senate R aide: Holding nose and defending Trump is taking a lot out of these GOP senators  —   and they will demand some kind of repayment  …      —   Glenn Thrush (@GlennThrush) June 8, 2017,  The fact that Swamp Creatures on the “Republican” side on Capitol Hill are throwing shade on their own president, and party, as the GOP and Trump likely emerge from today’s masquerade mostly out of the woods is simply incredible but unsurprising. Swamp Things are going to Swamp. UPDATE 11:45 A. M. Comey’s open admission he orchestrated a potentially illegal leak puts him in serious potential trouble, the New York Times people note. That’s the story folks. He vindicated Trump, and implicated himself. Wow, what a day. Can’t remember the last time someone in DC openly acknowledged orchestrating a leak  —   and without any senator having even asked.  —   Peter Baker (@peterbakernyt) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:39 A. M. CNN’s Dan Merica says that President Trump’s personal lawyer Marc Kasowitz will make a statement at the end of Comey’s public testimony. Marc Kasowitz, Trump’s lawyer outside the White House, will make a statement at the end of James Comey’s Senate testimony,  —   Dan Merica (@danmericaCNN) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:35 A. M. As Comey continues vindicating Trump and throwing Democrats like Lynch, Obama, and Clinton under the bus —  presumably accidentally —  the Washington, D.

M. While obstruction is now off the table for Trump, as Breitbart’s Joel Pollak detailed, Breitbart’s John Hayward notes that obstruction is back on the table for several leading officials from now former President Barack Obama’s administration. Hayward says Congress needs to investigate Loretta Lynch, the former Attorney General, as well as Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton —  the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee —  for obstruction of justice. Big takeaway from the Comey hearing: urgent need to investigate Loretta Lynch, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton for obstruction,  —   John Hayward (@Doc_0) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:29 A. M. Our very own Joel Pollak is out with another bombshell piece detailing how this hearing has shattered the media’s and the Democrats’ efforts to taint President Trump with “obstruction of justice. ” “Democrats have hinged their hopes for impeachment  —   and reversing the 2016 elections  —   on the idea that Trump committed obstruction of justice. That case has now been smashed beyond repair,” Pollak writes, pointing to a Comey exchange with Sen. Jim Risch ( ). Read his whole story here. UPDATE 11:26 A. M.

And he called the special counsel “wasteful. ” If Robert Mueller, the special counsel, comes up with nothing as every one of his contemporaries has before him, it will be the biggest waste of taxpayer dollars —  and of Americans’ time —  in a long time.

This is probably the first time ever that people in Washington, D. C. —  the Swamp —  are upset that President Donald Trump is NOT Tweeting. UPDATE 11:10 A. M.

Breitbart’s Joel Pollak has an excellent piece up already on how Comey’s opening statement to the Committee this morning is all about him. “Former FBI director James Comey opened his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday by complaining about ‘shifting explanations’ for why he had been fired, and by attacking the Trump administration,” Pollak writes. “Comey said that he had originally intended to accept his firing quietly, but then found that the administration’s statements about the matter ‘confused me and increasingly concerned me.’ He said that President Donald Trump had assured him that he was doing a good job, and that he had assured the president in return that he intended to stay. ” Read the whole thing. Also, it’s worth noting that even the Wall Street Journal —  not some rightwing blog by any stretch —  even says that Comey’s written opening statement proves that President Trump should have fired him. Which is exactly what President Trump did. Read the Journal’s editorial board piece here. UPDATE 11: 00 A. M. The GOP war room is up and running. Our friends over at the Republican National Committee are cutting videos that shows Comey’s testimony actually fully vindicates President Trump, despite whatever the opposition party media and congressional Democrats say:  Politico has an RNC talking points document circulated this morning. Read the whole thing here. Politico also has a story on how the RNC is taking the lead on pushing back on the highly discredited Comey’s testimony. “The RNC’s role is to support and defend the president and this White House and this week is no different,” Ryan Mahoney, the RNC communications director, told Politico. “And we prepare for everything, and we’re prepared for the hearing this week. ” Read the whole piece here.

Feinstein tells Comey he’s “big” and “strong,” then asks him if he was overwhelmed by the Oval Office and wonders why he did not tell the president he was wrong when he brought this subject up with him. He questions whether he would have handled himself the same way if given a second chance. “I hope there are tapes,” Comey also said of his meetings with Trump, noting he has seen the president’s Tweet about the possibility of tapes. UPDATE 10:55 A. M. Comey, under questioning from Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( ) says his relationship with Trump got off to a rocky start. He also embarrasses her when she asks him if the reason he was fired had anything to do with the Russia investigation, and he said “yes, because the President said so. ” Here in Union Pub, the   crowd broke out into laughter. UPDATE 10:53 A. M. Comey just killed the case against Trump over “obstruction of justice” that the media is building, as fast as they began building it. He said Trump saying he hopes Comey lets the investigation of Flynn go was not an order to drop the investigation. UPDATE 10:51 A. M. The media is highlighting two separate things early on in the Comey bonanza: The fired former FBI director’s use of the word “lie” twice, and him being concerned about meetings with President Trump.

19479,CNN’S Tapper: Trump ’Empirically Worse and More Opaque’ Than Obama - Breitbart,"Tuesday on CNN’s “The Lead,” host Jake Tapper said on transparency issues President Donald Trump’s administration is “empirically worse and more opaque. ” than President Barack Obama’s administration was.  Tapper said, “Let’s turn to our politics lead now. This afternoon, Press Secretary Sean Spicer held an   briefing and took reporters’ questions. That is something that in and of itself should not be news, but in this case, it is because the Trump administrators have been keeping reporters at bay for more than a week. In many ways, the Trump administration has been less transparent than its predecessors. Even those who thought the Obama administration never lived up to its ballyhooed promises of transparency, President Obama released his taxes, and President Trump has not released his. ” “President Trump shares literally nothing about who is coming to see him,” he continued. “President Obama golfed quite a bit, as does President Trump, but the Obama house would tell the public when he was hitting the links and with whom. This White House, for whatever reason, keeps that information private. Even the White House briefings are now shorter, with more   and a new trend of not allowing cameras or even audio recordings of what your White House is saying on any given day. People in power like to hide things from the public. We called it out under President Obama, and now it is empirically worse and more opaque. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0
19480,"Trump’s Most Important Quotes From His Times Interview, and Why They Matter - The New York Times","Donald J. Trump sat down on Tuesday with reporters, editors and columnists of The New York Times for an exclusive interview. Times reporters have annotated portions of the interview. The full transcript is available here. The personal interactions between President Obama and Mr. Trump have so far been pleasant, but it’s not clear that the kumbaya moment will last. Mr. Obama has already indicated that he may weigh in against Mr. Trump once the new administration takes over, especially if the new president attacks Mr. Obama’s legacy achievements. Here is our story on the cordial   meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama in the Oval Office.   D. Shear Mr. Trump is working to reset his mercurial relationship with the media as he looks toward assuming office, starting with this meeting at what he branded the “failing New York Times” during his presidential campaign. But he still nurses intense grievances toward news outlets in general and The Times in particular. Here is more about Mr. Trump’s relationships with the news media and The Times.   Hirschfeld Davis Mr. Trump is hinting that even though federal law does not require him to do anything specific to separate himself from his vast business empire, he is inclined to submit to some sort of voluntary standard of ethics that would avoid conflicts of interest or their appearance. But he leaves open the possibility that there may not be a way to accomplish it. This story has more about Mr. Trump’s business ties.   Hirschfeld Davis Mr. Trump is correct that federal law, for the most part, exempts the President from conflict of interest rules, meaning he is allowed to take actions that could benefit his financial holdings. But in modern times, most presidents have voluntarily put their financial assets into blind trusts. Mr. Trump has said he does not intend to take such a step, instead will turn his companies over to his children. Read this story for more on Mr. Trump’s potential conflicts of interest.   Lipton The Wall Street Journal editorial board, among others, has suggested that the only solution to Mr. Trump’s potential conflicts of interest is to sell off all of his assets, and then have a blind trust reinvest the proceeds. Mr. Trump suggests that this is not practical.   Lipton Mr. Trump’s crowds at rallies frequently targeted Hillary Clinton, chanting “Lock her up!” and referring to her as a criminal. In July, Mr. Trump himself encouraged a crowd in Colorado, telling them “I’m starting to agree with you” as they chanted “Lock her up!” In addition, despite Mr. Trump’s remarks here, the F. B. I. and the Justice Department, which have investigated Mrs. Clinton’s email server and the Clinton Foundation, conduct criminal inquiries largely independently of the White House. A president attempting to intervene in those kinds of inquiries, in any direction, would be a major scandal. Here is our full story about Mr. Trump’s reversal on prosecuting Mrs. Clinton.   Ryan Mr. Trump has been criticized for not specifically denouncing bigotry and groups that spread bigoted views. His statements about such conduct tend to be vague, including here, when he says “I disavow the group. ” That nonspecific language has been comforting to leaders of the   a rebranded white nationalist movement, including Richard B. Spencer, who led a  gathering at a federal building near the White House last weekend that included some audience members offering a Nazi salute.   Ryan Mr. Trump here acknowledges, perhaps for the first time, that being president will perhaps help enrich his family. He also concedes that the arrangement might fairly be called a conflict of interest.   Lipton Back in February, when he was still a candidate, Mr. Trump said definitively that torture was effective. “Don’t tell me it doesn’t work  —   torture works,” he told an audience in South Carolina. “O. K. folks? Torture, you know, half these guys: ‘Torture doesn’t work.’ Believe me, it works. O. K.?” So Mr. Trump’s answer on Tuesday offered a revealing insight into his willingness to shift or rethink a position, especially after talking with someone he respects. Gen. James N. Mattis may well be Mr. Trump’s secretary of defense, and his rejection of torture clearly had an effect on the  .   D. Shear The reality is more complicated. The number of factories and the number of Americans who work in factories both have declined sharply in recent decades. But the nation’s manufacturing output is at the highest level in history. The   production of   goods, like socks, has been replaced by the largely automated production of   goods, like circuits.   Appelbaum In 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed a landmark law that prohibited the hiring of illegal immigrants, provided new resources for enforcement along the Mexican border and offered legal status to several million illegal immigrants. Experts say the law did little to slow migration to the United States, but made crossing the border more difficult and dangerous.   Pear Premiums for many health plans under the Affordable Care Act are increasing 20 percent to 40 percent or more, but increases of 100 percent are extremely rare. Deductibles for many plans are high, but not $16, 000. For a family plan in 2017, the maximum    cost, including the deductible, is $14, 300.   Pear Mr. Trump’s comments about his fellow Republicans had a sharp edge and an implicit message: They owe their congressional majority to him, and he expects to be treated accordingly. Whether this is true, and to what extent, will be one of the pivotal stories of the new Trump administration, and crucial to figuring out how much or how little he can get done. He needs Congress to achieve many of the campaign promises he made, including the deep tax cut and large infrastructure spending package, not to mention  —   and it is an open question how “in love” with his policies Republicans will prove to be. Read these stories for background on Mr. Trump’s relationships with Republican leaders in Congress, and the “Never Trump” stalwarts who are pondering the future of the conservative movement.    Hirschfeld Davis Mr. Trump suggests here that he may name Jared Kushner, his    as a special envoy to the Middle East, charged with making peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Buried in this answer is an assertion by Mr. Trump that the federal government’s   law does not apply to him as president, but he also says he would want to avoid the appearance of conflict. Installing Mr. Kushner as a special envoy could have that effect, essentially giving him an important task that would allow him to be involved in   national security deliberations without hiring him outright. This is a role that was often discussed as a potential landing spot for Bill Clinton if Mrs. Clinton had won the White House.   Hirschfeld Davis",0
19481,"Hillary Clinton Hits Unfavorability High of 60%, Higher Than Trump","Hillary Clinton Hits Unfavorability High of 60%, Higher Than Trump October 31,   
Remember last week when Hillary Clinton was shopping around for White House drapes and the ""popular"" wisdom was that she was inevitable? That was fun. Wasn't it. Now she hit an unfavorability rating high of 60 percent. That's higher than Trump. 
It also means that the candidate who claims she's going to bring Americans together is disliked by most of the country . 
Clinton is seen unfavorably by 60 percent of likely voters in the latest results, a new high. Trump is seen unfavorably by essentially as many -- 58 percent. Marking the depth of these views, 49 percent see Clinton ""strongly"" unfavorably, and 48 percent say the same about Trump –- unusual levels of strong sentiment. 
The extent of partisan antipathy in this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates, is remarkable: Ninety-seven percent of Trump supporters see Clinton unfavorably; 90 percent, strongly so. Ninety-five percent of Clinton supporters see Trump unfavorably -– again, 90 percent strongly so. 
But remember Hillary is ""inevitable"". 
Now the Clinton campaign has decided to go after the FBI under the assumption that people like Hillary more than the FBI. That may be a slight misjudgment. And by slight, I mean huge. Because not only is the FBI more popular than Hillary, so are major landfills, UFO cattle mutilations and a number of international war criminals.",0
19482,Dem Candidate Accused of 'Revolving Door' Career Tries to Avoid Literal Revolving Door at All Costs,"Getty - Saul Loeb/AFP 
Pennsylvania's incumbent Republican Senator Pat Toomey and his supporters have regularly accused Democratic challenger Katie McGinty of leading a “revolving door” career in politics and government. 
Toomey's campaign released an ad in April accusing McGinty of allocating “millions of tax dollars to benefit corporations” during her time in the state government. 
The Club for Growth PAC also used the “revolving door” line of attack against McGinty, calling out her career of maneuvering between lobbying and public service. 
So when McGinty attempted to enter a building that only had literal revolving doors while being followed by a tracker for the conservative Super PAC America Rising, she tried to find a way around a potentially bad photo op. 
McGinty can be seen in the video uploaded Tuesday pausing at multiple entrances and attempting to look for another way in the building. 
But after pacing back and forth to look for an alternative entrance, McGinty ultimately caved and entered through the revolving door.

19484,A Father-Son Bonding Mission in the French Alps - The New York Times,"On a clear winter morning in the French Alps just over a year ago, Sascha, my    son, and I stood at the top of our first run at the Serre Chevalier ski area. I stamped to knock the snow from my skis, then pushed off, carving easy turns in the groomed track that spilled through groves of larch trees, Sascha following behind. “Help, Daddy!” he cried. I jammed to a stop, looked back and saw a tangle of limbs, skis and poles. “I’m stuck!” Sascha had taken a fall and lost his poles, but his skis had stayed on his feet, which were pinned underneath him. “It hurts. Help!” he said, the panic rising in his voice. “I want to go home. ” Ugh. Our first   trip wasn’t supposed to start like this. I sidestepped to him, released his skis and gently untwisted his legs. After a few comforting words and a suggestion that we take it easy, we set off side by side. “Sascha wants to spend more time with you,” my wife, Lori, had said to me late one night that fall. “He and I were talking on the way home, and he said, ‘I really want to do something with Daddy. ’” Ouch. Since we’d moved to Paris from New York three years earlier, I had been working Sundays and evenings. I knew abstractly that Sascha and his younger sister were feeling my absence. We had dropped them into the neighborhood school, and within months they were fluent in French and had made new friends. Everything was fine, or so I thought. Our interactions were limited to frantic mornings hustling them off to school and fleeting   kisses when I returned from work. Before I knew it, three years had passed  —   and how well, really, did I know them? Something told me that an afternoon at the playground wasn’t going to cut it. Sascha was old enough to travel with me by himself, I decided. I had a few days of vacation, and winter was coming up: ski trip. But the thought of driving seven hours to the Alps, skiing for two days, then driving back seemed grim and expensive. I wondered: Could we go by train? It would add an element of adventure  —   and be considerably cheaper. A little research revealed that one of the few remaining   routes would take us from Paris to the Southern Alps town of Briançon, the gateway to the sprawling ski station of Serre Chevalier, which bills itself as the largest resort in the southern French Alps. Rolling the dice, I booked tickets on the train, found a promising   pension, the Hotel de l’Europe, in the nearby town of Le     —   and immediately started worrying about the lack of snow, anxiously watching as webcams revealed a brownish, parched landscape. The week before we were due to leave, it started to snow, dumping a glorious 20 inches in a few days. We packed carefully, one duffel for me and a small wheelie for Sascha. I noticed, happily, that along with comic books and adventure stories he had packed Joe, the   bear he has kept close since he was a baby. Our train clattered into the Gare d’Austerlitz, looking dowdy compared with the sleek   trains that are replacing the night routes across Europe. We wedged ourselves into our compartment, in the lowest of the three bunks on either side. Sascha was happy in his nest with a reading light, a thin sleeping sack and a water bottle, and plunked himself on his stomach so he could look out the window. Slowly, our train chugged out of the station, swaying as the lights of Paris gave way to the suburbs and finally the darkened fields and woods. “Tuck me in, Daddy,” he asked after a while, gripping Joe tightly. Awaking at the station in Briançon, we hopped on a shuttle bus that would take us to Le   . Just past the first signs for Le Monêtier we got our first glimpse of the high mountains. We clambered off at the edge of town and walked a few hundred meters up the rustic Rue St. . At the Hotel de L’Europe, a cheerful woman with a British accent took one look at our bedraggled state and asked, “You’ll be wanting breakfast, then?” Yes, indeed. After a restorative meal of yogurt, granola,   pastries and coffee (for me) and a hot cocoa (for Sascha) we checked out our room, which turned out to be a bright, newly renovated suite with one bedroom for each of us and two bathrooms. Before fatigue took hold we changed into our gear and walked to a nearby ski shop to get some intelligence about Serre Chevalier. “Keep to the middle of the mountain,” we were told  —   up high it would be windy and foggy later in the day, possibly stormy, and down below the snow cover was a little thin. Booted and suited, we caught a free shuttle bus to the new base lodge a few minutes away. It was surreal to be riding a chairlift in the bracing air a little more than 12 hours after leaving Paris. On the advice of the ski shop, we started with an intermediate run, Rochamout, where Sascha fell. By the bottom, helped by creamy, forgiving snow, we had our ski legs again. After lunch in the base lodge we headed back up as flurries began. Around 2 p. m. we decided to take the long chairlift from the middle of the mountain to a natural, treeless pass with the jolly name of Cucumelle. A few minutes after boarding, we were in a   blizzard, pelted with stinging hail and buffeted by     wind. I tucked Sascha’s neck warmer into the base of his goggles, took his poles and told him to keep his head in his lap. “We won’t be able to get down,” he said in a panicky voice. Clearly, this was test No. 2. I pushed him off the lift, pointed him downhill and told him to grab one of my poles. We inched into the teeth of this unexpected storm and after a few agonizing minutes, found ourselves back among the calm of the trees. Feeling that was enough adventure for one day, we went back to the hotel, and to a dinner of pasta carbonara speckled with rich lardons, prepared by the hotel’s proprietor and chef, Pascal Finat. (Sarah Finat, his wife, had greeted us in the morning.) Eleven hours of sleep later, we awoke to a blindingly sunny, crisp day, and cut first tracks on freshly groomed cruising runs through the larches and a few fir stands. Traditional chairlifts predominate in Serre Chevalier, so we had plenty of time to talk on the way up. I started out with softball questions: school (he didn’t much like math) friends (all boys, he said, but with a little prodding admitted to liking two girls) favorite sports (soccer, of course). He was 9, after all introspection could wait. I focused on observing his actions and moods, how school and sports like skiing came easily to him, how he stubbornly refused to ask for help until it was the only course of action left, how he was extremely sensitive to physical pain and discomfort. One of the joys of skiing in Europe is lunch, and I’d been told that the elusive restaurant L’Echaillon was the place to go. After a bit of up and down, we found a side trail that seemed to lead only to the restaurant. There, I washed down an escalope de veau milanaise with fresh tagliatelle with a hearty Savoyard red. Sascha went with a burger and a    Coke, noting mischievously that he was eating the mother and I was eating the baby. Suffused with   we skied as the French do after lunch, sticking to the sunniest runs and heading down early. Our destination was Le Monêtier’s other attraction: mineral baths dating to Roman times. The modern bath complex includes indoor and outdoor pools, as well as three plunge rooms  —   cold, tepid and scalding. By 5 p. m. we were soaking in a warm, bubbly pool, gazing up at the gathering dusk on the slopes. We treated ourselves to fondue at dinner, and fell into conversation about inventions throughout history. Sascha argued for the computer I explained the story of the printing press, and how innovation had accelerated in the past 100 years. I took the opening to segue into a quick primer on early American history, since Sascha had been learning only French history. Our luck held the next morning, another bluebird day. We headed straight up to explore more of Serre Chevalier, which has 102 marked trails, 61 lifts and nearly 10, 000 acres within its boundaries. I let Sascha take the lead. His call was to ski the terrain park, eliciting a silent groan from my arthritic left hip. I watched as he flew whooping over the jumps and grind rails, heedless of the aches, pains and worries of adulthood. On Saturday, our last day, we felt confident enough to take on some of the nearly empty expert slopes, which overnight had been draped in fresh powder. After another decadent soak in the thermal baths, we grabbed dinner at the excellent Pizza Nono, then took the shuttle back to the Briançon train station. There were no complaints from Sascha, no dawdling. He was becoming a travel partner, and I was already looking forward to our next trip. As we left the Paris station the next morning, our trip already seemed like a memory, a flash of sun and snow in a gray and drizzly Parisian winter. I sensed that Sascha was feeling some of the same melancholy. I stopped in the middle of the street and said “hug”  —   our code for comforting him when he was younger. He squeezed me with strength that felt more like an adult’s than a boy’s.",0
19485,Politico: Liberal Media Bubble Even Worse Than You Think,"In a report for Politico Magazine, Jack Shafer and Tucker Doherty analyzed the geographical data of where journalists work and determined that the   liberal “media bubble” is even worse than suspected. [The liberal bubble has only grown worse as the news business has transition from print media to online publications. As Shafer and Doherty report, “Today, 73 percent of all internet publishing jobs are concentrated in either the      corridor or the West Coast crescent that runs from Seattle to San Diego and on to Phoenix. ”  From Politico Magazine: As the votes streamed in on election night, evidence that the country had further cleaved into two Americas became palpable. With few exceptions, Clinton ran the table in urban America, while Trump ran it in the ruralities. And as you might suspect, Clinton dominated where internet publishing jobs abound. Nearly 90 percent of all internet publishing employees work in a county where Clinton won, and 75 percent of them work in a county that she won by more than 30 percentage points. When you add in the shrinking number of newspaper jobs, 72 percent of all internet publishing or newspaper employees work in a county that Clinton won. By this measure, of course, Clinton was the national media’s candidate. Resist —  if you can —  the conservative reflex to absorb this data and conclude that the media deliberately twists the news in favor of Democrats. Instead, take it the way a social scientist would take it: The people who report, edit, produce and publish news can’t help being affected —  deeply affected —  by the environment around them. Former New York Times public editor Daniel Okrent got at this when he analyzed the decidedly liberal bent of his newspaper’s staff in a 2004 column that rewards rereading today. The “heart, mind, and habits” of the Times, he wrote, cannot be divorced from the ethos of the cosmopolitan city where it is produced. On such subjects as abortion, gay rights, gun control and environmental regulation, the Times’ news reporting is a pretty good reflection of its region’s dominant predisposition. And yes, a   ethos flourishes in all of internet publishing’s major cities —  Los Angeles, New York, Boston, Seattle, San Francisco and Washington. The Times thinks of itself as a centrist national newspaper, but it’s more accurate to say its politics are perfectly centered on the slices of America that look and think the most like Manhattan. Something akin to the Times ethos thrives in most major national newsrooms found on the Clinton coasts —  CNN, CBS, the Washington Post, BuzzFeed, Politico and the rest. Their reporters, an admirable lot, can parachute into Appalachia or the rural Midwest on a monthly basis and still not shake their provincial sensibilities: Reporters tote their bubbles with them. In a sense, the media bubble reflects an established truth about America: The places with money get served better than the places without. People in big media cities aren’t just more liberal, they’re also richer: Half of all newspaper and internet publishing employees work in counties where the median household income is greater than $61, 000 —  $7, 000 more than the national median. Commercial media tend to cluster where most of the GDP is created, and that’s the coasts. Perhaps this is what Bannon is hollering about when he denounces the “corporatist, global media,” as he did in February at the Conservative Political Action Conference. If current trends continue —  and it’s safe to predict they will —  national media will continue to expand and concentrate on the coasts, while local and regional media contract. Read the rest here.

19486,FS1’s Whitlock: ESPN Has Gone Political to Try to ’Perfect’ the World - Breitbart,"During the Wednesday “Outkick the Coverage” broadcast on Fox Sports Radio, FS1 personality Jason Whitlock weighed in on his former employer ESPN’s increase in political coverage, saying the company has gone political in attempt to turn the world into more of a controlled safe space where everybody gets along.  Partial transcript as follows, starting at the 18:16 mark: They believe in the experiment. If you really understand the far left, the Marxists, it’s like they want to take the jungle and turn it into a zoo. The world is a jungle. They want to turn it into a zoo. In a zoo, everybody gets along, everybody stays in their little safe spaces, cages, no one gets killed, there is no real competition, everybody gets fed the same stuff, and so, I think the people at ESPN think, “We can perfect this jungle if we just make it a zoo. No one will get killed. The lions and the giraffes, they’ll look at each other from across their cages and they’ll get along  …    ” But at the end of the day, I think there are people that rightfully believe, “God created a jungle and we can be nice and play along, but there is going to be some competition here. And if you’re weak, you’re going to get left behind. And if you’re not careful, a lion’s going to come over here and ravage you. That is what the world is. ” Again, do we need some parameters within the jungle to make things fair? Absolutely, but turn it into a zoo? No dice. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent",0
19487,Why Do Health Costs Keep Rising? These People Know - The New York Times,"DANVILLE, Pa.  —   The Geisinger Health Plan, run by one of the nation’s   health care organizations, foresees medical costs increasing next year by 7. 5 percent for people buying insurance under the Affordable Care Act. So when Geisinger requested a rate increase of 40 percent for 2017, consumer advocates were amazed. And Kurt J. Wrobel, Geisinger’s chief actuary, found himself, along with other members of his profession, in the middle of the health care wars still raging in this political year. Actuaries normally toil far from the limelight, anonymous technicians stereotyped as dull and boring. But as they crunch the numbers for their Affordable Care Act business, their calculations are feeding a roaring national debate over insurance premiums, widely used to gauge the success of President Obama’s health care law. Health plans around the country have just filed proposed rates for 2017. State insurance commissioners are still reviewing them. But questions about the proposed increases are reverberating through the health care system and into the political campaign. “Historical experience is the lifeblood of what we do,” Mr. Wrobel said, in an interview at Geisinger’s headquarters here. “We take that experience, adjust it for the underlying growth of health costs and project it into the future so we can estimate the expected costs for a particular insurance policy. ” Such niceties may be lost in this scorching campaign season. “There is panic and anger as health care costs explode!” Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, wrote in a recent Twitter post, seizing on increases of nearly 60 percent sought by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas. Obama administration officials are more sanguine. Consumers, they say, should not worry. Proposed rate increases are often reduced by state officials. Federal subsidies will generally rise along with premiums, offsetting much of the additional costs, and consumers can, in any event, switch to cheaper health plans next year. But as they prepare for the fourth year of coverage under the Affordable Care Act, many insurers are struggling to find the best ways of providing care to their new customers. The giant UnitedHealth Group, having lost money on individual policies under the federal health law, is pulling out of many insurance exchanges next year. A number of health insurance cooperatives created under the law have shut down. Geisinger is different. During debate on the 2010 health care law, Mr. Obama and members of Congress repeatedly hailed it as a model providing “  care at costs well below average,” in the president’s words. Geisinger serves residents of rural central and northeast Pennsylvania, and its roots in the community are as deep as the coal mines that once flourished here. Dr. David T. Feinberg, the president and chief executive of the Geisinger Health System, said its health plan was losing $30 million a year on coverage sold on the federal exchange in Pennsylvania. But leaving the market here would be unthinkable. “For its shareholders, United made the right decision,” Dr. Feinberg said, “but we don’t answer to shareholders. We answer to the nice people of Danville, Shamokin and Bloomsburg. ” It would be difficult to find a health plan more aligned with the goals of the federal law. The Obama administration recruited a former chief executive of the Geisinger Health Plan, Dr. Richard J. Gilfillan, to be the first director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, created by the health law to test ways to improve care and cut costs. Geisinger has been a pioneer in the use of electronic health records and genomic medicine, recruiting 100, 000 patients for DNA sequencing studies in the last two years. It has embraced “pay for performance,” offering a warranty for major surgical procedures and promising not to charge extra if complications occur. But innovation has been no match for the actuarial surprises dealt out by the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Wrobel said Geisinger had simply underestimated how much care its new customers would need. “Our rates for Medicare, Medicaid and   insurance have been relatively stable, but those products have to bear the cost of our losses on exchange business,” Mr. Wrobel said. Last October the Pennsylvania Insurance Department, headed by a former Obama administration official, approved a 20 percent increase in Geisinger’s rates, about half of what the company had requested. “But based on experience,” Mr. Wrobel said, “the 2016 premium rate is too low, so we want to correct it in 2017. ” Julia T. Philips, an   actuary who worked 19 years for the state of Minnesota, said insurance regulators generally do not let a company make up for past losses with future rate increases. “But regulators often allow companies to catch up,” she said. “If you assumed that claims would average $400 per member per month in 2015 and the actual cost was $440, you can use the higher number as a starting point in predicting claims costs for 2017. ” Obama administration officials suggest that insurance companies seeking big rate increases have been slow to adapt to the new law. But Geisinger executives welcome innovation, and they have celebrated the reduction in the number of uninsured under the Affordable Care Act. Geisinger is not alone. The Pennsylvania Insurance Department says insurers have proposed premium increases averaging 23. 6 percent for individual coverage for 2017. “People with   conditions are now getting treatment,” said Antoinette Kraus, the director of a statewide consumer group, the Pennsylvania Health Access Network, “and it’s more expensive because they were shut out of the market for many years. ” But, she added, “we expect that they’ll eventually become healthier, so we won’t see these huge rate increases every year. ” Kevin J. Counihan, the chief executive of the federal insurance marketplace, acknowledged that “  demand for health care is greater than people expected and is lasting longer than expected. ” In April, before most insurers had filed their rate requests for 2017, the Obama administration began a campaign to play down their significance. “Proposed rates aren’t what consumers pay,” the Department of Health and Human Services said. “Most people receive tax credits and can buy a plan for less than $75 per month. ” Moreover, the administration says that the health law created a competitive market in which consumers can shop for the best deal. As evidence that this market is working, the administration boasts that more than 40 percent of returning consumers switched to different plans for 2016. However, Mr. Wrobel said, such turnover is making it more difficult for insurers to predict costs. “The whole point of what we do, the foundation of good health insurance,” he said, “is to develop   relationships with our members and to make   investments in their health. It’s not like buying a book on Amazon. ” Besides, he said, substantial numbers of consumers do not receive subsidies. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 12 million people will receive subsidies, in the form of tax credits, next year. But it says that an equal number  —   three million on the exchanges and nine million buying insurance outside the exchanges  —   will have to pay the full unsubsidized price. “When we developed rates for 2014,” Mr. Wrobel said, “we had no historical data. It was basically an educated guess. ” Mr. Wrobel said rates were still being affected by a federal policy, adopted in late 2013, that allowed some people to keep and renew insurance that did not meet standards in the Affordable Care Act. “Healthier people chose to keep their plans,” he said, “so the collective cost of care for people buying insurance on the exchange was higher than expected. ” Many insurers hope to profit from the Affordable Care Act, but for Geisinger, the calculus is a little different. “Geisinger has been here for 100 years, and we expect to be here another hundred,” Mr. Wrobel said. “We are going to be taking care of the people in this community one way or another. So it’s really important for this program to be financially stable and sustainable. ”",0
19488,Strict Gun Control Impotent as Terrorist Opens Fire in Quebec,"Canada’s strict gun control, including license requirements for gun ownership and complete bans on certain categories of firearms, proved impotent as a terrorist opened fire inside a Quebec mosque Sunday night. [Reuters reports that “six people were killed and eight wounded when [a gunman] opened fire   …     during Sunday night prayers. ”  According to The University of Sydney’s GunPolicy. org, “only licensed gun owners may lawfully acquire, possess or transfer a firearm or ammunition [in Canada]. ” Those seeking a license to own a gun “must pass a background check which considers criminal, mental health, addiction and domestic violence records. ” Additionally, applicants for a gun owner’s license must give “third party character references” and demonstrate “an understanding of firearm safety and the law. ” Those who are able to acquire a license “must   and   for their firearm licence [sic] every five years,” which basically means the background check is ongoing. Also, the ownership of certain categories of firearms is prohibited and “records   …     of individual civilians licensed to acquire, possess, sell or transfer a firearm or ammunition” are maintained. As law enforcement officials continue to divulge to journalists more information on the Quebec mosque attack, there is no indication gun laws had an effect in keeping the perpetrator from acquiring the weapons needed to conduct the shooting. The attack was similar to those in other European countries with restrictive gun control laws. For example, twelve people were shot and killed on January 7, 2015, when terrorists opened fire on Charlie Hebdo headquarters in   Paris. Just months later, on November 13, 2015, more terrorists in Paris opened fire and killed 130 innocents. These transpired despite France’s ban on entire categories of weapons, and it requires the kind of expanded background checks that the Obama administration, Senators Chris Murphy ( ) and Joe Manchin ( ) and gun controller Gabby Giffords pushed as a way to make Americans safe. More recently, on July 22, 2016, a   attack in Munich, Germany, was successfully executed despite similar background checks, gun bans on entire categories of weapons, and licensing requirements for gun ownership. Nine innocents were killed in the Munich attack. Strict gun control failed to protect innocents in Paris and Munich, and it has now failed to protect them in Quebec.

19489,Nation Could Do With Uplifting Story About Puppy In Love With Balloons Or Something,"0 Add Comment 
AFTER reading a near never ending parade of news items relating to unfathomable, tragic loss and death, the Nation agreed that if the media could find a video of a puppy madly in love with balloons or something, it would be greatly appreciated. 
The jolting and harrowing push notifications delivered by countless Irish news apps over the last few days has seen a huge surge in a desire for something to smile or laugh at, as it’s looking like it’s going to be a tough week. 
“I know we slag you for posting stories about cat gifs and how you think it’s ‘journalism’ somehow, but we could really do with that now, thanks,” office worker Elaine Curran said in an appeal to the Irish news media, shortly after she sent an ‘I love you’ text to all three of her children which probably had something to do with absorbing some of the regrettable news populating newspaper front pages. 
The Nation has requested that a video of a happy-go-lucky pug, preferably a chubby one, completely losing his mind at the sight of some balloons, giving the impression that his heart could explode from joy, be immediately found and uploaded to all online news sites. 
“And maybe if he could fall over as well, in a funny way, like we don’t want him to get hurt. God, that’s all we need; a video of an adorable pug hurting itself,” parent Dermot Ferry shared with WWN, only making himself upset. 
The Nation said that if a video of a suitably uplifting dog couldn’t be found, it was willing to settle for a video of baby laughing at its own hiccups or just a hug from someone.",0

19491,5 things you need to know about the Dakota Access Pipeline protests,"VIDEOS 5 things you need to know about the Dakota Access Pipeline protests Early reports of protesters being armed and violent have proven to be misinformation spread to demonize the opposition By Nick Bernabe - October 28, 2016 
A small Standing Rock Sioux site in North Dakota called the Sacred Stone Camp has been propelled into the national news narrative following their stand against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Due in part to independent media coverage of the ongoing standoff, the Sacred Stone camp has grown into a formidable opposition against the $3.8 billion, 1,200-mile long pipeline. 
Due to misinformation coming from law-enforcement, political favoritism toward the pipeline builders, and the media’s blatant reluctance to report on the pipeline, it’s hard to tell truth from fiction. Anti-Media , along with our partners in the independent media and our embedded journalist at the opposition encampment, have been covering the unfolding standoff continuously. Here are five things you need to know. 1. Who is opposing the pipeline — and why 
The Standing Rock Sioux tribe is leading the opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline. They have been joined by the largest tribal coalition in over 100 years in their stand against the pipeline. The coalition is also comprised of activists, allies, and environmentalists, collectively known as “water protectors,” at the Sacred Stone Camp, an encampment close to the location where the pipeline is planned to cross the Missouri River in North Dakota. According to the Sacred Stone camp website , they are opposing the pipeline because “[t]he Dakota Access threatens everything from farming and drinking water to entire ecosystems, wildlife and food sources surrounding the Missouri .” 
The Standing Rock Sioux also say the pipeline is violating treaty land , Sioux territory that was established many years ago by the federal government. “We will not allow Dakota Access to trespass on our treaty territory and destroy our medicines and our culture.” 
The opposition to the pipeline spreads across several states and is not opposed solely by Native Americans. Farmers, ranchers, and landowners are also opposed to the pipeline. Many of them have had their land taken from them against their will and given to the pipeline via eminent domain. 2. The U.S. government and the pipeline corporation are continuing a long tradition of disrespecting Native Americans 
The United States has a very bad reputation for treating Native Americans, the original inhabitants of this land, as less than human. In many instances in the past, the land where Native Americans lived was deemed to be of higher value than the Natives’ lives. 
Such has been the case in North Dakota — not only now, but in the past as well. According to The Atlantic : 
“The land beneath the pipeline was accorded to Sioux peoples by the Treaty of Fort Laramie in 1868. Eleven years later, the U.S. government incited and won the Great Sioux War, and ‘renegotiated’ a new treaty with the Sioux under threat of starvation. In that document, the tribe ceded much of the Laramie land, including the Black Hills of South Dakota, where many whites believed there to be gold.” 
After the federal government relegated the Sioux people to the “Great Sioux Reservation” in 1851 , the treaty was re-written and “renegotiated” by force whenever resources were discovered or when the U.S. government wanted land. Essentially, the Sioux people were victims of U.S.-sanctioned murder, and their land was stolen because gold was discovered on it. 
Fast forward to 2016 and the Sioux people are once again making a stand on land that was once — and still is, according to the tribe — theirs. How is the government reacting to this stand? By brutally arresting the Native American water protectors for trespassing . If that is not a miscarriage of justice, I don’t know what is. 
Further, Energy Transfer Partners, the company pulling the strings behind the DAPL, has deep pockets, and its lobbyists have cozied up to federal, state, and local governments with jurisdiction over the pipeline route. This could explain why the company began its construction of the pipeline on Army Corps of Engineers land without even securing an easement , which is required by law. Dakota Access LLC, a subsidiary of Energy Transfer Partners, has also used the strong-arm of government to force farmers and landowners to hand over their land to the pipeline against their will. 3. Violent acts are being carried out in North Dakota, but not by the water protectors 
Violence is breaking out at the Dakota Access Protest site, but the protesters have nothing to do with it. Pipeline police, bolstered by the North Dakota National Guard and sheriffs imported from around the country, have turned the standoff into a war zone. Water protectors are regularly pepper sprayed, tear gassed, and violently arrested. Over the weekend, 127 people were detained in the biggest mass arrest to date. 
Militarized police at the Dakota Access Pipeline site are decked out in riot gear, armed with military grade weapons, use armored cars or MRAPs with snipers on top of them, and have regularly used LRADs, a type of mass crowd dispersal weapon that uses a high pitched noise to hurt people’s ears — sometimes permanently . 
Early reports of protesters being armed and violent have proven to be instances of misinformation spread by law enforcement apparently seeking to demonize the opposition. No credible reports of violence by the protesters have been confirmed or prosecuted. Nearly all arrests stem from trespassing charges or crimes of journalism. 
When protesters initially began using civil disobedience to physically shut down the Dakota Access Pipeline site, they were confronted violently by security guards from British mercenary firm G4S. The mercs sicced dogs and used pepper spray on the protesters in an assault that went viral and helped catalyze even more support for the water protectors. 4. Independent media is under attack at the Dakota Access Pipeline — and the corporate media is ignoring it 
Independent media’s broadcasts over the Internet are basically the only reason people around the country and the world now know about the struggle at Standing Rock. Unfortunately, journalists are not immune to the police crackdowns in North Dakota. Dozens of journalists have now been arrested, and an arrest warrant was issued for high-profile journalist Amy Goodman. One independent media outlet, Unicorn Riot , saw four of their journalists arrested in one day in North Dakota. One filmmaker is facing up to 45 years in prison for filming acts of civil disobedience against the pipeline. 
Anti-Media ’s journalist on the ground, Derrick Broze, was tased by law enforcement while covering the protests on Thursday as this article was being written. 
Meanwhile, the national corporate media ignored the battle against the Dakota Access Pipeline as long as they could. For months, despite the DAPL emergence into the national narrative, ABC and NBC refused to air any coverage about it. A woman was arrested for protesting the pipeline on her own farm after Dakota Access LLC gained access to it against her will via eminent domain — yet there was still no corporate media coverage on the incident. 5. How you can help the opposition 
Now that you see what water protectors are up against in North Dakota, here’s what you can do to help. Get yourself to the Sacred Stone Camp. The water protectors need reinforcements as people are regularly arrested. The bigger the stand, the more likely the pipeline’s construction will be halted. Here’s how to get there .

19493,"L.I.R.R. Train That Crashed Was Going Over Twice Speed Limit, Inquiry Finds - The New York Times","A Long Island Rail Road train that crashed in Brooklyn on Wednesday was going more than twice the speed limit when it slammed into a train station, injuring more than 100 people, federal investigators said on Thursday. The train was traveling at more than 10 miles per hour when it hit the end of the tracks at Atlantic Terminal, where the speed limit is 5 m. p. h. said Ted Turpin, an investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board. He said that federal officials were investigating the crash and had not yet determined the cause. The train rammed into a bumping block during the morning rush, striking a room beyond the track and causing the first two cars to derail. The accident was reminiscent of a deadly crash in September in which a New Jersey Transit train plowed into Hoboken Terminal, killing a woman and injuring over 100 people. (That train was also traveling over twice the speed limit there when it crashed.) On Thursday, Mr. Turpin said the engineer who was operating the Long Island Rail Road train told investigators he could not remember the crash. “He does recall entering into the station and controlling the speed of the train,” Mr. Turpin said at a news conference. “But then the next thing he realized was after the collision. ” Investigators have not released the engineer’s name, but Mr. Turpin said that he was 50 and had started as an engineer at the railroad in 1999. The engineer had started working around midnight on Tuesday and was nearing the end of his shift at the time of the crash, Mr. Turpin said. In the Hoboken crash, the engineer, Thomas Gallagher, also said he did not remember the crash. His lawyer later said that Mr. Gallagher had an undiagnosed sleep disorder and discovered after the crash that he had severe sleep apnea, which disrupts sleep and may cause excessive daytime sleepiness. The engineer of the Long Island Rail Road train has been tested for drugs, but the results were not available, federal investigators said on Thursday. The engineer told investigators that he was not using his cellphone at the time of the crash. Federal investigators said they planned on Friday to interview a conductor and an assistant conductor who were also on the train. They also intend to interview two railroad employees who witnessed the crash. Mr. Turpin noted that a safety technology, known as positive train control, was not in place on the tracks where the crash happened, even though it was possible that the technology could have slowed the train. Officials from the safety board have long called for railroads to install the system to help prevent train accidents, though Mr. Turpin noted it was not required in train terminals. Nearly two years ago, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority secured a nearly $1 billion loan from the Federal Railroad Administration to install positive train control on the Long Island Rail Road and   Railroad. Officials at the authority are working to meet a 2018 deadline to install the technology.",0

F. C. with a boring victory. More good news for the Patriots: they probably won’t have to face Denver in the playoffs because the Broncos’ season is unraveling quickly. ■ For the first time, fans can post on social media that the Oakland Raiders have qualified for the playoffs. It was 2002, long before Facebook, Twitter or even MySpace, when the Raiders last played a playoff game, but with a win over the San Diego Chargers on Sunday they secured a trip to the playoffs, have a lead in their division, and still have a chance at home field advantage throughout the playoffs. More importantly, the team’s defense secured the victory, which could portend good things going forward. ■ The A. F. C. South is still the ugly duckling division of the N. F. L. with the underwhelming Houston Texans continuing to lead the way (by virtue of a tiebreaker over Tennessee) after Sunday’s win over Jacksonville. The Titans may not be much more fun to watch than Houston, but their upset victory over Kansas City would seemingly indicate that they are the superior team. ■ Green Bay might just do this thing. In a   start to the season, the Packers seemed incompetent on both sides of the ball and were quickly falling out of postseason contention. But with four consecutive wins, and Ty Montgomery’s emergence helping to balance out the team’s offense, Green Bay will win the N. F. C. North if they win their two remaining games. A single loss after an   winning streak led to a mass exodus from the Dak Prescott bandwagon last week. But the rookie quarterback of the Dallas Cowboys was apparently not willing to go off quietly into the night, having a big first half against Tampa Bay, and then holding off a valiant   comeback attempt by the Buccaneers in a   Dallas victory. The game was a return to form for Prescott, who threw two interceptions in last week’s   loss to the Giants. For some doubters, that loss had restarted the quarterback controversy between Prescott and Tony Romo, which had seemed settled after Prescott and his fellow rookie, Ezekiel Elliott, led Dallas to the N. F. L. ’s best record with a mix of big plays and relatively few mistakes. Against Tampa Bay’s formidable defense, both Dallas rookies showed why the league has come to fear them. Prescott completed 32 of 36 passes for 279 yards, and nabbed his sixth rushing touchdown of the season, breaking a tie with Don Meredith for the franchise record, which Meredith had held since 1966. Elliott was also a driving force, carrying the ball 23 times for 159 yards and a touchdown, and he played to the home crowd in the first half by leaping into an oversized Salvation Army bucket after scoring. He increased his N. F. L.  total to 1, 551 rushing yards, becoming just the seventh rookie to run for more than 1, 500. If there was a criticism of Dallas to be made it was that they had to rely on Dan Bailey to make four of his six field goal attempts to secure the win, but the team showed a great deal of resilience after Tampa Bay reeled off 14 unanswered points in the third quarter. Overall, the game was a mixed bag for Jameis Winston, who looked dominant in the third quarter but also personally accounted for four turnovers in the game, including three interceptions. He also had a costly unsportsmanlike penalty potentially cost his team a touchdown in the first half. Given the ball with a chance to win it as time was running out, Winston threw an interception on    that effectively ended the game. With the win, Dallas continues to be the No. 1 seed in the N. F. C. and the team has a   lead in their division over the Giants. Tampa Bay, meanwhile, was knocked out of the second   position in the N. F. C. with the Washington Redskins at    having a narrow lead over the   Buccaneers. The   Oakland Raiders have risen to the top of the standings this season thanks to a   offense. But it was gutsy work in the trenches by the team’s   defense that led to a   victory over the San Diego Chargers, putting the Raiders back in the playoffs for the first time since 2002. Struggling offensively for much of the game, the Raiders were down   in the fourth quarter when Kenneth Farrow of the Chargers ran the ball up the middle. He was stopped two yards short of the line of scrimmage and as he went down, Perry Riley of the Raiders stripped the ball away. After the officials had pulled enough players off the pile, Malcolm Smith came up with the ball, giving it back to the Raiders’ offense on the   line. Oakland only came away with a field goal off the turnover, but the Raiders’ defense came through yet again, forcing the Chargers to punt. Given the ball with 6:27 left in a tie game, Derek Carr engineered a     drive that ended with a   field goal by Sebastian Janikowski that put the Raiders in the lead to stay. The defense then came through yet again on San Diego’s last drive, intercepting Rivers so Carr could kneel on the ball to seal the win. It was a slow day for Carr, who is considered by many to be a candidate for Most Valuable Player. He completed 19 of 30 passes for 213 yards and 1 touchdown, but he did just enough to let Janikowski, the only remaining member of the last Raiders playoff team, seal the victory. With the win, the Raiders have a   lead over the Kansas City Chiefs in the A. F. C. West with two games remaining. Oakland closes out their season with a home game against the Indianapolis Colts and then travel to Denver for a   division matchup against the Broncos. Tom Brady wasn’t perfect, but he didn’t need to be against the struggling Denver Broncos. Brady started the game 0 for 6 on passing attempts  —   tying a career high  —   and he completed just 50 percent of his passes for the game, but with the help of LeGarrette Blount’s 15th rushing touchdown and Stephen Gostkowski’s three field goals, the New England Patriots beat the Broncos  . With the win, the Patriots locked up their eighth straight A. F. C. East division title. While the Patriots’ offense played things conservatively, with Brady completing just 16 of 32 passes for 188 yards, they got 95 rushing yards from Dion Lewis and the only true highlight of the game was when Blount ran in yet another   score, breaking Curtis Martin’s franchise record for   rushing touchdowns, which Martin set in 1995 and equaled in 1996. New England has a home game against the Jets next week and then finishes its season on the road against the Miami Dolphins. If the Green Bay Packers fulfill Aaron Rodgers’ promise to “run the table” after a   start, which would secure the team the N. F. C. North title, it may be because the team finally found a reliable running back in the form of an unknown young wide receiver. Ty Montgomery’s big first half, and a   of a second half in which the Chicago Bears erased a   Packers lead, resulted in a   victory for Green Bay. In the end it was Aaron Rodgers who saved the Packers. On    with 40 seconds left in regulation, he threw a perfect deep ball (60 yards) to Jordy Nelson to set up the   field goal by Mason Crosby. The win came in spite of Chicago having the biggest comeback in the team’s history, which dates back to 1920, and it went a long way to opening up Green Bay’s postseason chances. The Minnesota Vikings and Detroit Lions both lost, which means if the Packers, who face Detroit in Week 17, win the team’s two remaining games, they will win the division.   temperatures in Chicago did not prevent either team from scoring, with Montgomery, who still wears No. 88 after being drafted as a receiver last season, having the best game of his young career. He has carried the ball 16 times for 162 yards, including 2 touchdowns and a   scamper in the second quarter that showed off his development at the position as he spun out of a tackle at the line of scrimmage, shed another tackler down field, and then turned on the jets on the long run. Later in the second quarter, a   run that helped set up a   field goal was perhaps even more impressive as Montgomery carried a pile of players several yards down the field at the end of the play, showing off a power aspect of his game that had thus far been missing. The   fourth quarter comeback by Matt Barkley and the Bears’ offense was the biggest by either team in 194 games against each other, but a brutal third quarter, that included a fumble on a sack and two interceptions by Barkley proved too much to overcome when all was said and done. The Packers will look to extend the team’s winning streak next week in a home game against the struggling Vikings, and could get some help in terms of a division title if the Lions lose in a tough matchup against the Dallas Cowboys. ’u200b So often already in his young N. F. L. career, Odell Beckham Jr. has seemed to pull the Giants to victory with his     receiving gifts. It has almost come to be expected. And the Detroit Lions still could not stop him.

19495,High School Forced to Change Mascot over Accusation ’Stallions’ Is ’Sexist’ - Breitbart,"A school district in Kentucky has canceled the school’s “Stallions” mascot after a petition from the community argued that the mascot was “inappropriate and sexist. ”[The petition, which garnered just over 200 signatures, was successful in its efforts to have the Fayette County school district changed the new Frederick Douglass High School’s mascot from the “Stallions” to something more appropriate for female sports teams.  This is inappropriate and sexist when you consider the definition from “YourDictionary”   …    ”The definition of a stallion is a male horse that has not been castrated, used for breeding or is slang for a powerful and virile man who has a lot of lovers” and from Wikipedia  …    ”because of their instincts as herd animals, they may be prone to aggressive behavior, particularly toward other stallions, and thus require careful management by knowledgeable handlers. However, with proper training and management, stallions are effective equine athletes at the highest levels of many disciplines. ” Superintendent Manny Caulk announced on Tuesday that the high school would get rid of the stallion mascot in favor of a more   horse mascot, which he believes will be more appropriate as a symbol for the several female sports teams that Frederick Douglass High School will field. Despite the seemingly harmless nature of the mascot, Caulk felt it necessary to claim that the never intended to offend any members of their community with the choice: “Since the public announcement of the mascot Monday, we have received feedback from some community members who have concerns about the mascot and we want assure our constituents that there was absolutely no intent to offend or upset anyone. We also recognize that there is support from others in our community to honor the former stallions of Hamburg Place farm,” Caulk said. Caulk declared that the students of Frederick Douglass High School will have the opportunity to choose their mascot from a slate of   options: “Moving forward, we will keep the Keeneland green and orange colors and horse image in the school logo to pay homage to Lexington’s rich history in the horse industry, but we will allow the incoming students of Frederick Douglass High School to choose their mascot,” Superintendent Caulk said in a statement late Tuesday. “We’ve already received suggestions of Thoroughbreds or Racers as possible alternatives to Stallions and we will solicit additional ideas from our students before they choose a   mascot grounded in the land’s equestrian heritage. ” Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about social justice and libertarian issues for Breitbart News.

19496,MILO: ’America Has a Problem With Fake Hate Crimes’ - Breitbart,"Breitbart News Senior Editor MILO declared that “America has a problem with fake hate crimes,” during his talk at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs tonight, citing numerous news stories that turned out to be false.[  “The left didn’t learn anything from the beatdown they suffered on election night. In fact they are   on their identity politics,” claimed MILO. “Conservatives aren’t just deplorables and racists, we’re ‘white nationalist hatemongers’. And white women and the working class who voted for Trump are too. They’ve ramped up their fake news activities to prove how wrong we all are, and their top weapon is fake hate crimes. ” “America has a problem with fake hate crimes. The left is always searching for the next big outrage, and sometimes when the pressure gets too high, they just decide to make them up,” he continued. “That is basically how the UVA rape fantasy that ran in Rolling Stone came about by the way. This trend has just accelerated since the election. Fake attacks on Muslim women seem to be in vogue right now. But it isn’t a new trend. I wrote an article in May 2016 that documented 100 fake hate crimes in the last decade. 100 of them! And surely there were more that just didn’t make it into the public eye. ” “I bring this up because Colorado Springs is part of the list. In 2015, threats were left outside of a predominantly black church referencing the KKK and a second one says ‘Black men beware, you are the target’,” MILO declared. “There’s just one problem  …    . This is the evil racist local police found behind the messages. ” In Scooby Doo unmasking fashion, MILO displayed the image of the black perpetrator onto the projector. “Woops, it’s a black guy!” he announced. “Sadly, this is part of an increasing trend in the US towards sensational but untrue stories. Fake hate crimes are the original fake news. ” “I mentioned the UVA rape case, which was a complete fabrication happily carried by the leftist media.

19497,Hillary Clinton Is Brilliantly Forcing Broke Trump To Spend Money Defending Arizona,"By Jason Easley on Fri, Oct 28th, 2016 at 1:02 pm If Donald Trump wants to keep Arizona in the Republican column, he will have to spend some of his very limited time, money, and resources there, because Hillary Clinton is campaigning in the red state next week. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
If Donald Trump wants to keep Arizona in the Republican column, he will have to spend some of his very limited time, money, and resources there, because Hillary Clinton is campaigning in the red state next week. 
The Clinton announced that the Democratic nominee would be spending part of the last week of the campaign in Arizona, “On Wednesday, November 2, ‎ Hillary Clinton will campaign in Phoenix, Arizona, days before Election Day. Clinton will lay out what is at stake in the election. With more people voting in this election than any in history, Clinton will urge Arizona voters to take advantage of in-person early voting. Voters can check their registration status and early vote location at iwillvote.com.” 
The fact that Clinton will be in usually reliably red Arizona in November during the final week of the presidential campaign tells voters all they need to know about the state of the presidential race. 
Hillary Clinton is in such a good position that she can afford to spend some time during the last week of the campaign trying to turn red states blue. 
The Trump campaign already deployed VP nominee Mike Pence to Utah in a bid to save that dark red state from falling, and it looks like they will have to devote resources to saving Arizona to prevent Clinton from winning a state that has been a given for Republicans in previous elections. 
The Trump campaign is broke. The nominee had to give his campaign $10 million so that they could afford to buy air time in battleground states for their ads. 
The Clinton campaign is trying to stretch Trump past his breaking point by making a serious play for Arizona. It is a brilliant move from a campaign that has outwitted its Republican opponent at every turn.",0
19498,"After Trump’s Prediction Was Brushed Off Over A Year Ago, It JUST Came TRUE","After Trump’s Prediction Was Brushed Off Over A Year Ago, It JUST Came TRUE Posted on October 30, 2016 by Dawn Parabellum in Politics Share This 
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump made a prediction over a year ago that many brushed aside. Most people, even those on the right, didn’t believe the billionaire and real estate mogul at the time, but now that his prediction has been proven correct, many are changing their tune about Trump and actually listening to what he has to say. Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump 
Donald Trump doesn’t always say things in the most eloquent of ways. He often speaks what’s on his mind with no filter and doesn’t seem to care much about who he offends. His politically incorrect way of speaking causes too many to disregard what he has to say, but that’s all about to change after what just happened. Trump called this one over a year ago, and now, thanks to Hillary’s email scandal, he’s been proven accurate. 
The FBI announced Friday that it had uncovered new emails relating to its investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s handling of classified information. This was discovered while conducting a separate investigation into the perverted and disgusting sexting habits of former Democratic Congressman Anthony Weiner, who is the estranged husband of Hillary’s closest aide, Huma Abedin, who is also front and center in Hillary Clinton’s email scandals. 
Donald Trump saw this coming from a mile away, pointing fingers at Weiner as a potential national security threat all the way back in August of 2015. “It came out that Huma Abedin knows all about Hillary’s private illegal emails,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “ Huma’s PR husband, Anthony Weiner, will tell the world. ” Trump has been now been proven right. It came out that Huma Abedin knows all about Hillary’s private illegal emails. Huma’s PR husband, Anthony Weiner, will tell the world. 
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 3, 2015 
It looks like the Donald does know a thing or two about politics and corrupt Democrats. In July, Trump said he didn’t like the thought of “Huma going home at night and telling Anthony Weiner all of these secrets.” Trump also sounded the alarm about Weiner as early September 2013, when he wrote that Huma should “dump the sicko Weiner” because he was “a calamity who is bringing her down with him.” Trump in July: “I don’t like Huma going home at night and telling Anthony Weiner all of these secrets” pic.twitter.com/ksqWCQ4iAd

Donald Trump’s accurate prediction is sure to make waves in the political scene. It turns out that Weiner may bring down himself, his wife, and Hillary Clinton all at once. It never pays to be a perverted and corrupt Democrat. 
Hillary Clinton cannot seem to surround herself with anyone who is not neck deep in scandals and disturbing behavior. It’s kind of funny that it’s now been revealed that she should have listened to Donald Trump long ago. I bet that doesn’t make her very happy at all.",0
19499,5 Things You Need to Know About the Dakota Access Pipeline Protests,"By Nick Bernabe at theantimedia.org
A small Standing Rock Sioux site in North Dakota called the Sacred Stone Camp has been propelled into the national news narrative following their stand against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Due in part to independent media coverage of the ongoing standoff, the Sacred Stone camp has grown into a formidable opposition against the $3.8 billion, 1,200-mile long pipeline.
Due to misinformation coming from law-enforcement, political favoritism toward the pipeline builders, and the media’s blatant reluctance to report on the pipeline, it’s hard to tell truth from fiction. Anti-Media , along with our partners in the independent media and our embedded journalist at the opposition encampment, have been covering the unfolding standoff continuously. Here are five things you need to know.
1. Who is opposing the pipeline — and why The Standing Rock Sioux tribe is leading the opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline. They have been joined by the largest tribal coalition in over 100 years in their stand against the pipeline. The coalition is also comprised of activists, allies, and environmentalists, collectively known as “water protectors,” at the Sacred Stone Camp, an encampment close to the location where the pipeline is planned to cross the Missouri River in North Dakota. According to the Sacred Stone camp website , they are opposing the pipeline because “[t]he Dakota Access threatens everything from farming and drinking water to entire ecosystems, wildlife and food sources surrounding the Missouri .”
The Standing Rock Sioux also say the pipeline is violating treaty land , Sioux territory that was established many years ago by the federal government. “We will not allow Dakota Access to trespass on our treaty territory and destroy our medicines and our culture.”
The opposition to the pipeline spreads across several states and is not opposed solely by Native Americans. Farmers, ranchers, and landowners are also opposed to the pipeline. Many of them have had their land taken from them against their will and given to the pipeline via eminent domain.
2. The U.S. government and the pipeline corporation are continuing a long tradition of disrespecting Native Americans
The United States has a very bad reputation for treating Native Americans, the original inhabitants of this land, as less than human. In many instances in the past, the land where Native Americans lived was deemed to be of higher value than the Natives’ lives.
Such has been the case in North Dakota — not only now, but in the past as well. According to The Atlantic :
“The land beneath the pipeline was accorded to Sioux peoples by the Treaty of Fort Laramie in 1868. Eleven years later, the U.S. government incited and won the Great Sioux War, and ‘renegotiated’ a new treaty with the Sioux under threat of starvation. In that document, the tribe ceded much of the Laramie land, including the Black Hills of South Dakota, where many whites believed there to be gold.”",0
19500,Tancredo - The Republic at Risk: Deep State Opponents Seek to End the Trump Presidency by Leaks and Sabotage - Breitbart,"We are witnessing the unraveling of the fabric of constitutional government, and only a fool can believe it will end well. [The nastiest opponents to President Trump inside and out of government apparently feel justified in using “any means necessary” to defeat and remove him. Every day sees more evidence of a desire not only to block his policies but to drive him from office. While it does not yet rise to the level of an organized conspiracy, it does raise serious issues of constitutional fidelity.  First, in the weeks following the November election, we saw street protest and marches, followed by lawsuits, then leaks from inside government, and then talk of “impeachment” over crimes for which no evidence exists. And folks, in the words of Al Jolson, you ain’t seen nothing yet. It’s probably going to get worse. The seeds of this “cultural embarrassment” over Trump’s victory were planted in the days immediately following the November 8 election: These efforts have at least three obvious things in common: desperation born of utter shock at Trump’s election victory   elitist arrogance and the active participation and support from the nation’s major media organizations. Yet, there is another novel element interwoven in these events that is even more dangerous  —   dangerous not simply as a political obstacle to Trump’s agenda, but inherently dangerous to the survival of our country. That novel element is the active, conscious subversion of lawful Presidential orders and initiatives by the permanent civil service apparatus called the “senior bureaucracy. ” It is also being called the “Deep State,” meaning the part of the government that is immune to political appointment and political accountability. And most dangerous of all is the involvement of our nation’s intelligence agencies in the leaks aimed at embarrassing the President. The earliest news stories about an alleged “Russian connection” openly named America’s intelligence operations as the source. Now comes this month’s FBI testimony that the agency has been conducting an investigation of the Trump campaign, and yet the FBI still has not cited any evidence of any   that justifies the investigation. This involvement of intelligence agencies and the FBI in   investigations  —   and the subsequent leaking of information gathered in the surveillance —   puts into question the President’s ability to trust the information provided to him by those agencies. And THAT, my friends, can seriously impair his ability to manage national security policy and any international or   crisis that occurs. The theme of an “illegitimate presidency” provides a veneer of moral justification for seemingly disconnected acts of political sabotage.  If resistance to Trump’s policies is resistance to “tyranny” by a “usurper,” then nothing is out of bounds or off limits. This “ ” arrogance is what makes the   campaign potentially lethal for constitutional government.  The effort to paint President Trump as a usurper who deserves to be thrown out of office is unprecedented in its scope and intensity, and it will have unintended consequences for the Republic. This week there were revelations from the House Intelligence Committee supporting Trump’s allegation of Obama regime surveillance of the Trump campaign and transition. Intelligence gathered by lawful wiretaps of foreign agent activities recorded “incidental” conversations involving persons inside or close to Trump campaign. Those “intercepted” conversations reportedly had nothing to do with alleged “Russian hacking” of the election, nor did they reveal any “collusion” with Russian agents.  Yet, contrary to law, the conversations were shared with Obama White House staff and then with the media. How do we explain the bizarre obsession of Democrat leaders and the media with the “Russian connection”? Not one tiny shred of evidence has been produced by anyone to show any Trump campaign collusion with Russian activities connected to the 2016 election. And yet, the media and Democrat opponents (sorry, I repeat myself) continue to raise that specter to keep alive the myth of a “stolen election. ” In the last days of the Obama administration, new rules were signed into law by Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the NSA Director as administrative amendments to Executive Order 12333, rules allowing the distribution of certain raw intelligence data to 16 additional government agencies at home and abroad. It may have been those new rules which facilitated the leaking of information concerning conversations Trump’s nominee for   Mike Flynn, had with the Russian Ambassador —  conversations which the FBI later said broke no laws. What this week’s revelations show is not any Russian collusion with Trump to influence the election but nearly the exact opposite: elements of the Obama government colluded with intelligence agencies to spy on the Trump campaign —  or at a minimum, to use information gathered by surveillance to attack and undermine the Trump campaign team’s transition plans for an orderly changing of the guard. Opposition to Trump policies is to be expected, and   by hostile bureaucrats was not unknown in the first year of the Reagan administration and other governmental changeovers. But there are legitimate and lawful means of opposition and illegitimate ones —  even illegal ones, like the leaking of classified information. If the   saboteurs inside government expect the American public and tens of millions of Trump supporters to tolerate organized, incipient treason against constitutional government, they are mistaken.",0
19501,Russia and Iran Warn U.S. ’Crossed Red Lines by Attacking Syria’,"A joint statement issued by Russia, Iran, and their allies in Syria denounced the U. S. missile strike on a Syrian airbase said to have launched a chemical weapons attack on Syrian civilians and threatened retaliation if further such attacks occur. [“The United States crossed red lines by attacking Syria, from now on we will respond to anyone, including America if it attacks Syria and crosses the red lines. America knows very well our ability and capabilities to respond well to them, [and] we will respond without taking into consideration any reaction and consequences,” read the statement, as transcribed by ABC News.  “Rest assured that we will liberate Syria from all kinds of occupying forces, it does not matter from where they came to the occupied part of Syria,” the statement added. “Russia and Iran will not allow the United States to be the only superpower in world. ” According to the statement, Syria and its patrons are “closely and deeply following American forces’ moves and presence” in both Syria and Iraq and “consider them an occupying force. ” Russia and Iran stated, “we, as Syria’s allies, will increase our military support toward Syria and support its people in many other ways. ” On Friday, Russia suspended military cooperation with the United States in Syria, including an end to the “deconfliction” agreement that was meant to prevent accidental hostile encounters between Russian and American pilots. “Amid the missile strikes, it is hardly reasonable to talk about any more increase in the risk, as the risk has increased considerably,” said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Over the weekend, Iranian president Hassan Rouhani urged “the Syrian people and army” to “give a response that makes Americans regret their attack. ” “Americans have never acted within international frameworks, and one instance is the sanctions they impose against Iran, unreasonably considering themselves as the world’s leader,” complained Rouhani, who was hailed as a “moderate” leader by the Obama administration.   notes that Lebanon’s Hezbollah, designated a terrorist organization by the U. S. State Department, was a signatory to the   statement.",0

19503,Report: Huma Abedin ’Working Hard’ to Save Marriage with Anthony Weiner - Breitbart,"Former Hillary Clinton operative Huma Abedin is reportedly “working hard” to save her marriage with former Democratic congressman Anthony Weiner, just months after the pair separated as a result of his multiple sexting scandals. [Sources close to the Abedin family told the New York Post that “Huma has been working hard on her relationship with Anthony. He has been spending 80 to 90 percent of his time at the [Irving Place apartment] they share. If there is a disagreement, he goes to his mother’s apartment in Brooklyn. ”  “Both [his and her] families are hoping they will reconcile,” the source continued. Another source supported this story, saying that the couple’s separation was “more for optics for the campaign and pressure from Hillary’s camp. ” The potential reconciliation is perhaps surprising given Weiner’s multiple sexting scandals. The first, exposed in 2011 by the late Andrew Breitbart and dubbed ‘Weinergate,’ led to Weiner’s resignation from Congress and the issuing of a public apology. In 2013, having declared himself a candidate to be mayor of New York, other photos were published of Weiner sexting another woman under the name ‘Carlos Danger.’ Despite the revelation, Weiner did not pull out the race and eventually finished fifth with just 4. 9 percent of the vote. In August last year, Abedin revealed that she was separating from Weiner after yet another sexting incident, although she said the pair would continue to work together to raise their son, who could even be seen in one of Weiner’s photos. EXCLUSIVE: Anthony Weiner sexted a busty brunette while his son was in bed with him https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   New York Post (@nypost) August 29, 2016,  Last October, Weiner checked into a sex addiction facility to overcome his urges, although he was reportedly forced to leave early having run out of money to pay for it. He was also investigated by the FBI over claims he had been sexting a    girl. A laptop examined in that investigation reportedly contained emails from Hillary Clinton’s private email server, as both Weiner and Abedin used the device. This development led FBI Director James Comey to announce that the bureau   its investigation of Clinton’s handling of classified information. The Clinton campaign to this day claims the Comey announcement caused significant damage to her candidacy. The girl claimed that Weiner sent her nude photos, shared pornographic videos with her, discussed his “rape fantasies,” and requested that she undress and masturbate during video calls. In January, media reports revealed that federal prosecutors were looking into potential charges against Weiner for child pornography, However, despite all this, Abedin is apparently “still in love” with Weiner, blaming the “pressures of the campaign and presidential race and him drifting off into obscurity” for his latest relapse. “A lot of [their] friends believe this is an illness, that he is sick. [But] Huma takes it into consideration that there’s been no affair, or physical contact that anybody is aware of. He never met [the women],” the family friend added.

19504,How The Elites Are Using “Divide And Rule” To Control Us,"It wasn’t long ago that the Left represented the anti-establishment wing in politics. They used to fight against globalism (remember the anti-globalization movement?) even if their motives were different from those of today’s anti-globalists, as well as being against censorship, imperialist wars, and the expanding powers of governments and corporations. But today, you see leftists protesting against Brexit, attacking and censoring anyone who disagrees with the establishment (using Twitter on their Apple products while sipping on their Starbucks coffee), and are calling for war in Syria to challenge the Russians. So, just how the hell did did they end up becoming the patsies for the elites?

To understand, we must go back to 2011 when the Occupy movement was ongoing. The Occupy protests, which now seem like ages ago, came about as a response to the economic downturn with the people realizing that they were being screwed by the system. We can debate endlessly about exactly who these people were and the motives behind them, but the important fact is that, to the elites, it was a sign that the people were waking up and challenging their power.
The elites were in a panic as this was the first time in post-war history that the people of West mobilized in mass to threaten their rule. So, the cabals decided that they needed to act fast before the whole movement evolved to a full-blown revolution. And they already had a plan in mind: the never antiquated strategy of divide and rule.
The Diversion 
When the people are discontent and angry from being powerless and dispossessed, the pressure will mount and it won’t go anywhere. The people want to vent out their frustrations. The elites know that responding directly with repression only inspires greater desire to rise up, so instead of fighting it, they prefer to re-channel that pent up energy elsewhere.
On February 2012, with the Occupy movement still raging, the elites were given that golden opportunity—or, rather, they created one—when a black teenager was shot dead in Florida: the none other than the infamous Trayvon Martin case. The shooter wasn’t even a full white, but the elites jumped at the chance and used their control of the media to throw everything they had on it; anything to divert the public attention away from them. With their efforts, it quickly became the biggest story of America.
But they didn’t stop there. Police shootings, which have always been happening and to all races, were also highly publicized by the mainstream media to stoke liberal outrage and racial tensions that led to the creation of Black Lives Matter movement—a movement that is financed by George Soros and others to stir up unrests across America.
Did the elites convert Occupy protesters into SJW patsies?
The diversion was complete as the people were now more interested in racial issues than the “1%” who were dictating their lives. The Occupy movement faded away and the people were now venting out their anger elsewhere. Although I don’t have as much proof as with the rise of BLM movement, I strongly suspect that the resurgence of social justice warriors around the same time is also the work of the elites who want the Leftists to target fellow citizens over asinine cultural issues rather than the established order.
The Strategy 
Back in 19th century, Karl Marx claimed that religion and nationalism was being used to distract the masses from the fact that they were being oppressed under capitalism. If we were to apply this concept to the world today, the culture wars going on now are distractions to keep the masses from undermining the power of the elites.
The goal the elites is simple: divide the masses and let them fight each other so that they will never come together to topple those in power. Meanwhile, they themselves focus on expanding their own wealth and continue to implement institutional control to further their globalist plans. The worst case scenario the elites want to avoid is to have the common people unite as one, so they must do everything they can to fragment them by creating as many divisions as possible.
My understanding of their modus operandi is this: 1) Use hot-button issues to stir up controversy (something that doesn’t affect them like gay marriage, race issues, and all other politically correct nonsense). 2) Have the Leftists either get outraged or do something that will provoke a reaction from the Right. 3) Let the people vent out their anger onto each other and get at each other’s throats. 4) When the issue fades away, foment a new controversy to repeat the whole process. By cycling through them over and over again, the elites are able to maintain the status quo and keep the people from uniting against them.
Thus, we have our current situation where the masses are divided with blacks against whites, women against men, Islam and atheism against Christianity, Left against Right, and so on, but no more anti-globalization, Tea Party movement, or Occupy Wall Street.
As long as those on the left continue berating the right as racists, sexists, and bigots who are controlled by corporations and the right in turn accuse the left of being degenerate, socialist slackers who just want freebies from a nanny government, nothing will change. As long as the two sides see each others as enemies who are stupid and ignorant, and getting in the way of creating a decent society, the people will remain divided. As long as the rest of the population go berserk over wedding cakes for homosexuals, the latest “misogynist” outrage, or how a lion named Cecil got shot, the elites will continue to win.
A Couple More Points To Consider I know they look like an occupying army, but there’s nothing to be alarmed about. They’re just your friendly neighborhood police doing their jobs to protect you from the “terrorists.”
First, while this article has been focused on how the Left has been toyed by the globalist elites, let’s not forget that the Right are not totally immune to their influence either. Remember how Neo-cons ( globalists puppets disguised as conservatives ) effectively lured the conservatives in America through faith and patriotism? The support they got from that base was the impetus to launch their war against Iraq based on bullshit evidences of WMD’s and Saddam–Al-Queda link. While the Right has changed a lot since then, there are still “conservatives” today who are itching for a war with Russia because… USA! USA! USA! .
Second, it is crucial to remember that although the main goal is to maintain divide and rule, it is not the end of it. The elites have far more sinister aims. By raising hell in societies through demographic conflicts and terrorism, the elites are preparing for a total social control. I get the feeling that the elites are letting the chaos and violence run its course so that the people from the two opposing camps will join together in their approval of new government measures for social control.
No matter their differences, when the people get terrified of savagery and disorder, they’ll welcome the state to intervene in the name of security. Europe is already getting used to large military presence on their streets while the US government is seemingly preparing for a war against their own citizens . A leaked Soros memo also reveals that the BLM movement is potentially being used to federalize the US police . While many people seem to be concerned about violence and terrorism, it seems those are just tools used by the elites to justify a totalitarian state in the near future.
The Culture Wars: Necessary Fight Or Engineered Distraction? 
The issue of culture wars is not an easy one as they are important in many ways, but are still forms of distraction implemented by the elites.
On one hand, we are playing into the hands of elites by raging against social justice and feminist pigshits instead of trying to stop the globalists, Zionists , bankers, mega-corporations , and the governments from undermining our existence. Really, do the issues of politically-incorrect Halloween costumes and whatever bathroom trannies use matter more than the fact that the middle-class is being destroyed, revelations of massive corruption in the DNC, the coming police-state, and the globalist wars that are causing death and destruction around the world? All the drama of outrage and counter-outrage is silly when the elites are snickering as their new world order is taking shape.
On the other hand, culture does matter in many ways. Uncontrolled immigration, anti-male laws, and censorship are all very relevant issues. And as much of the Leftists are now serving as pawns of the establishment, the situation isn’t exactly the divide and rule model I described above. In a way, we are now forced to fight the Left and everyone else who are getting in the way of fighting the globalist elites.
So, does this mean we should ally with those who scorn us? Or should we continue playing the elite’s games and bicker with their SJW drones? I don’t have a good answer, but whatever we choose to do, I believe it is crucial for us to focus our battles and not get trolled into petty issues that the mainstream media wants us to focus on. We should always keep in mind that it is always those at the top who are the true enemies of mankind.
Conclusion: Is There Still Hope? 
Although we no longer see grassroots movements and popular mobilization, the current US election has shown that the people are still awake and sick of the establishment. To me, that alone is a hopeful sign that people are still willing to challenge the ruling class.
With Bernie Sanders brought down by the establishment and his supporters scattered into different camps, the only anti-establishment movement now is the presidential campaign led by Donald Trump. This is why we are seeing unprecedented efforts by the elites to bring down Trump and use disgruntled Leftists against his supporters.
I have my doubts about Trump , but he is thousand times preferable to the certain nightmare that Hillary Clinton will bring to America and the world if she gets elected. But besides voting, I believe that it is more important for the people themselves to wake up and be aware of the methods of control that are being implemented upon us. We can’t constantly expect some knight in shinning armor to come rally us; we must take the initiative ourselves and be willing to fight for our own destiny.

19505,The Set-Up For Gold & Silver: CARNAGE in the Bond Market Pre-Cursor to Market Crash? | Eric Sprott,"October 28, 2016 at 11:28 AM 
Reflecting on the WMD called ZIRP, I conclude that ZIRP is the best evidence of the “New World (dis)Order WORL” weapon of mass destruction in which we’ve lived for the last 8 years. This represents the equivalent of having no sheriff in town. 
A simple Occam’s Razor view of ZIRP clearly shows interest rates are the equivalent of a sheriff making sure we adhere to the Constitution, both a document that helps insure that monetary rules are followed while being protected against undue harm via the Sheriff’s color of authority. 
When rates reflect reality we have a monetary Sheriff watching over our fiscal safety. When rates are zero we see a total absence of law in the world. 
Interest rates are the monetary rule makers and law enforcement that drive the reality of risk and reward. If a person, company or country follows the rule and obeys the normal laws of economics, finance and investment and adheres to some reasonable variant of Say’s Law, they are rewarded with reasonable rates that helps them create value,wealth and worth by accessing some form of debt that aids in that growth. The investor is rewarded with a return commensurate with risk. If the same entity runs rampant, disregarding the restraints of interest on their investments, they are called to account and forced to pay for their transgressions. 
When ZIRP drives out the rule of law; the equivalent of the interest rate Sheriff being driven out of town; put out to pasture, the potential for high crimes and misdemeanors ramps upward exponentially. Is it an accident that we have seen the ascension of crime family actions that now brings us to ZIRP and its attendant insanity. The last 60 years has seen the constant unrelenting actions against real money and the reality of interest rates as one of the strongest arbiters the world of finance. ZIRP has replaced the rule of law. 
Is it an accident that we see the criminal rentier class rolling in with heavy weapons, tanks and bombs, whether in a hard kinetic form that destroys entire countries, cities and neighborhoods (banks now have their own armies) or rolling in with their interest rate WDMs? 
This ultra wealthy rentier class strip mines the little wealth remaining in the hands of We, the People with hard force, demented interpretations and variations of good Constitutional law or simply no law except that which they create on the fly, with the aid of a DOJ and FBI complicit i these crimes ( reference our criminal justice system). 
The penumbra of destruction that weighs against the rule of law extends to politics, from the lowest to the highest levels and begets the likes of the Clinton, Bush and Obama Kriminal Klans; AJs like Lorretta Lynch and Holder and bankers like Bernanke, Yellen, Draghi, Blankfein and Dimon, all of whom go on to form new age oligarchies that steal from the people with not a single substantive charge levied or day spend in prison. 
The system is rigged. There is no justice. There’s Just Us. 
None of these people suffers the consequences of their predations because they not only have unlimited access to interest free capital, they own the banks that provide them with tens of trillions in capital with which to engage in war against us. They own the armies to hold us in bond and bondage if we raise a challenge to their rapacity and theft of our substance 
If they win a bet against us they make billions or trillions. If they lose a bet against us, we, the tax payers, are forced to make up the losses. Their capital has no cost. Their losses are never charged against the house. Unless it’s your house and you’re forced to move or are thrown out by some variation of their army or Praetorian guard. 
I’m guessing that these financial rapists will never stop because there is never enough for them. Pitchforks, torches, molotovs and the weight of humanity pressed against our oppressors will win the day and it will take some serious sacrafices and lives to win against these new age feudalists

19506,Strategist Now Backing Donald Trump Previously Called Him a Danger - The New York Times,"A veteran Republican strategist now helping lead a “super PAC” in support of Donald J. Trump argued in a confidential memo last year that it would be dangerous to give Mr. Trump the power to launch a global war. The strategist, Alex Castellanos, has acknowledged that he had been publicly critical of Mr. Trump, but said on Sunday that he now considered Mr. Trump a superior choice to Hillary Clinton. In a private document presented to top Republican donors last fall, however, Mr. Castellanos suggested that Mr. Trump could be a threat to American security as president. He and another strategist, Gail Gitcho, drew up plans for a group named ProtectUS, and proposed to spend heavily against Mr. Trump in the Republican primaries. In the memo, Mr. Castellanos proposed to urge voters not to put Mr. Trump “in the Big Chair in the Oval Office, with responsibilities for worldwide confrontation at his fingertips. ” He also intended to highlight Mr. Trump’s past bankruptcies and predicted that his nomination would be ruinous for Republicans. Republican voters, Mr. Castellanos wrote, must be made to “see the danger and risk of a Trump Presidency. ” “Once these doubts are raised, Trump’s business record of bankruptcies, as well as his support of   health care and other positions he shares with Hillary Clinton, can begin to pry GOP voters away,” the memo said. By nominating Mr. Trump, it continued, Republicans would be “assured that we lose the White House. ” “If Trump wins, everyone loses,” the memo said. “We not only lose the White House in 2016, but we also lose the Senate, competitive gubernatorial elections and moderate House Republicans, making Speaker Ryan’s job exponentially more difficult. ” Mr. Castellanos won no takers for his pitch, and the plans for ProtectUS were discarded. The New York Times first reported the existence of the   memo in late February. On Monday, Mr. Castellanos did not respond to an email and a phone call seeking additional comment on the evolution of his views about Mr. Trump. But the original battle plan Mr. Castellanos drew up against Mr. Trump was strongly reminiscent of some of the tactics Democrats are now using against the presumptive Republican nominee. Mrs. Clinton argued in a speech last week that Mr. Trump could not be trusted with the powers of the commander in chief. And several Democratic leaders have called for a revival of the “Daisy” ad Lyndon Johnson produced to attack Barry Goldwater in the 1964 campaign, warning that Mr. Goldwater could trigger a nuclear war.",0

Madeleine Beth McCann should have celebrated her 13th birthday with her family in England this year, but she vanished from her bed during a family vacation to Portugal in 2003. The case gripped the entire world, becoming one of the most high profile missing persons cases in history. Coverage of her kidnapping was comparable to the press interest in the death of Princess Diana. 
Her parents had been out with friends at the hotel restaurant approximately 200 feet from where the child had been sleeping. When her mother Kate McCann went to check on her around 11 pm, but she was gone. 
“We go to bed every night with the agonising feeling that just maybe tomorrow we will find something to lead us back to Madeleine. To let us know what happened. To give us hope,” Kate McCann, who is now an ambassador for Missing People, said at the launch of a new nonprofit organization called Find Every Child, in London this week . 
Though it has been nearly a decade since their little girl vanished, the family has continued the search, and believe that there is a possibility that she may still be alive. 
“When my little girl first disappeared, on that horrendous night that changed our lives forever, I could never have imagined that nearly 10 years later we would still be in the same position,” she continued. 
In 2013, five years after Portuguese police had closed the case, they reopened it and revealed two new police sketches. It was believed that they were supposed to be of the same man, but from two different witnesses. Reddit and others on social media are now asking, what if it was actually two different men, and what if it was the Podestas?

Shortly after the rumor began to go viral, Twitter went offline for over 20 minutes, which helped to fuel the theorists even more.

19509,Cheryl Strayed: A Close Encounter at Badlands - The New York Times,"Over 300 million people visited the national parks system in 2015  —   and many left with indelible memories. In anticipation of the park system turning 100 in August, we asked five writers  —   three novelists, a memoirist and a poet  —   to recount times when a national park left a mark on their lives. I would have opted to give the bison a wide berth even if the man who worked the entrance gate at Badlands National Park had not handed me a flier warning me to do so. Bison have charged several people, the flier exclaimed in bold text beneath an illustration of a man somersaulting into the air above a figure of an enraged bison. It was 1994, before selfies and cellphones  —   but not before people were idiots in the wild. I was 25 and plenty idiot too, though not in this one regard. I had grown up in northern Minnesota, where I’d learned early to respect the boundary between humans and undomesticated animals. Bison  —   their scientific name is, emphatically, bison bison bison  —   are the largest terrestrial animal in North America. The biggest weigh upward of 2, 000 pounds. Faster and more agile than their bulk would indicate, they can run about 35 miles an hour. They’re   too. Shaggy,   beasts with curved horns that frame their huge angular heads, American bison have always struck me, at least outwardly, as the heavy metal rockers of the animal kingdom. It’s an impression that only intensified when I had my first look at them up close a   after my friend Aimee and I had entered the park. A few grazing near the road raised their grand heads to watch us as we passed in Aimee’s Honda: their faces, primordial their dark eyes, indecipherable their ability to flatten our little car if they felt like it, absolute. To see them so close felt like a lucky stroke. Millions once roamed the continent, but by 1900 their numbers had dwindled to the low hundreds in the wild. Because of conservationists  —   indeed, because of the existence of the national parks  —   the bison had persevered. To catch a glimpse of them on the prairie was to bear witness to their survival. The sun was setting by the time we reached the Sage Creek campground, a waterless patch near the park’s designated wilderness area at the end of a gravel road. All around us the world was magic, the way the world is always magic at sunset in wild places, but it seemed especially so that night, the grasslands giving way to the ancient hills and rocky buttes beyond. We pitched our tent in the fading light. When I stepped out of our tent the next morning, there was a bison grazing about 50 feet away. He lifted his head in my direction and  —   for a reason I do not know except to say I have always been friendly to a fault  —   I said, in a tone altogether too cheery, “Good morning, Mr. Buffalo. ” At the sound of my voice, the bison began to walk toward me. He did not run, but neither did he dally. His gait had the determined and mildly seething air of a teacher who was marching you straight to the principal’s office, except in this case, the bison was marching himself. To me. I bolted into the tent and zipped the mesh door closed, whispering frantically to Aimee, who shushed me. In silence we knelt    in the center of the tent and looked into each other’s eyes beseechingly. Soon, the bison appeared in close profile out the mesh window at the back end of the tent. He was so near we could hear his breath and the dull thump of his hooves. He began to circle, passing by our door, then disappearing, then reappearing. It seemed clear this circling was the preamble to something worse. Though we were both near weeping, we were also suppressing laughter, each of us horrified by the grim possibility not only that we’d be trampled to death by a bison bison bison, but that we would also forever be known as those dumb people who do dumb things at national parks and then end up being referred to in categorical terms on informational fliers handed out to visitors. It just so happens that Aimee was wearing a pen on a cord around her neck. I had the maddest urge to use it to write at least a line in my own defense  —   to say I hadn’t done anything wrong. All I had done was say “Good morning, Mr. Buffalo!” I’d wanted only to pass through this beautiful place and leave the wild things undisturbed and unperturbed. I hadn’t meant to cause any trouble. Instead I took the pen, still attached to Aimee’s neck, and wrote “I’m sorry” on my hand and showed it to her. She nodded, apology accepted, the tears from her suppressed   terror still pooling in her eyes. We waited in silence many more long minutes, until we mustered the courage to peek out of our tent to see the bison was gone, somewhere in the midst of those ancient hills. We gathered up our things and ran to the car.",0
19510,Leaked Memo Exposes Shady Dealings Between Clinton Foundation Donors And Bill’s “For-Profit” Activities,"Leaked Memo Exposes Shady Dealings Between Clinton Foundation Donors And Bill’s “For-Profit” Activities   Zero Hedge 
We have written frequently in recent weeks about a feud that erupted between Chelsea Clinton and Doug Band back in 2011 after Chelsea raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest between Band's firm, Teneo, the Clinton Foundation and the State Department (see here , here, here and here ). The feud ultimately resulted in Band being forced to draft a memo spelling out, in vivid detail, the many entangled relationships between himself, Teneo, the Clinton Foundation and the State Department. Fortunately, today's Wikileaks dump included that memo which reveals, for the first time, the precise financial flows between the Clinton Foundation, Band’s firm Teneo Consulting, and the Clinton family’s private business endeavors. 
The memo starts with a brief background on Teneo, which was created in June 2011, shortly after Declan Kelly resigned from his position as ""United States Economic Envoy to Northern Ireland,"" a position to which he was appointed by Secretary Clinton. 
In June 2009, DK Consulting was founded by Declan Kelley. Mr. Kelly served as COO of FTI Consulting until June 2009, when he stepped down and established DK Consulting. At that time, he also became the United States Economic Envoy to Northern Ireland . Pursuant to the terms of his exit agreement with FTI and consistent with the ethics agreement of his uncompensated special government employee appointment at the State Department, Mr. Kelly retained and continued to provide services to three paying clients ( Coke, Dow, and UBS ) and one pro bono client (Allstate) . In late 2009, Declan retained me as a consultant to DK Consulting to help support the needs of these clients. 

In May 2011, Mr. Kelly resigned his Envoy position at the State Department. In June 2011, Mr. Kelly and I founded Teneo Strategies ; simultaneously, Mr. Kelly closed DK Consulting and shifted its clients to Teneo. 

Throughout the past almost 11 years since President Clinton left office, I have sought to leverage my activities, including my partner role at Teneo, to support and to raise funds for the Foundation . This memorandum strives to set forth how I have endeavored to support the Clinton Foundation and President Clinton personally. 
In a subsequent section of the memo entitled ""Leveraging Teneo For The Foundation,"" Band spells all of the donations he solicited from Teneo ""clients"" for the Clinton Foundation. In all, there are roughly $14mm of donations listed with the largest contributors being Coca-Cola, Barclays, The Rockefeller Foundation and Laureate International Universities. 

The donations from Dow Chemical are particularly notable for several reasons. First, because of other emails revealed by WikiLeaks and other FOIA requests, we now know that Dow Chemical CEO, Andrew Liveris, was granted special access to then Secretary Clinton back in July 2009 at the same time he was embroiled in ongoing litigation with another Clinton Foundation donor, Kuwait, over a failed joint-venture that would have netted Dow $9BN in cash . As Band notes in his memo, 1 month after being granted special access to Secretary Clinton, Liveris invited President Clinton and Band out for a day of golf. Moreover, shortly after his meeting with Secretary Clinton and golf outing with President Clinton, Liveris decided to donate $500,000 to the Clinton Global Initiative ...very convenient timing for all involved. 
In August of 2009, Mr. Kelly invited Mr. Liveris to play golf with President Clinton and me. Mr. Kelly subsequently asked Dow to become a CGI sponsor at the $500,000 level, which they did , as well as making a $150,000 donation to the Foundation for President Clinton to attend a Dow dinner in Davos. 
The story gets even more bizarre when Band reveals in the following footnote that Liveris provided the Dow Chemical plane to fly President Clinton and his staff from New York to California and then California to North Korea for their golf outing . We would assume this is a simple typo by Band and/or he's just geographically challenged...if not, this certainly raises a whole other set of questions for Bill. 
Mr. Liveris provided the Dow plane to fly President Clinton and his staff to and from California for our trip to, and from, North Korea . As a private trip, the Foundation had to pay the costs of airfare; Mr. Liveris’ in kind contribution saved the Foundation in excess of $100,000 . 
According to the Dialy Caller , Dow Chemical paid Teneo $2.8 million in 2011 and $16 million in 2012 for a variety of ""consultancy services"". Of course, Bill Clinton was an honorary chairman of Teneo and, as such, was set to be paid $3.5 million for that position even though he ultimately only kept $100,000 because of the scandals that erupted around the firm, including their advisory relationship with MF Global. 
Finally, Band also offers the following commentary on the ""$50 million in for-profit activity"" he was able to secure for Bill Clinton (as of November 2011) as well as the ""$66 million in future contracts, should he choose to continue with those engagements."" 
Independent of our fundraising and decision-making activities on behalf of the Foundation, we have dedicated ourselves to helping the President secure and engage in for-profit activities – including speeches, books, and advisory service engagements . In that context, we have in effect served as agents, lawyers, managers and implementers to secure speaking, business and advisory service deals. In support of the President’s for-profit activity, we also have solicited and obtained, as appropriate, in-kind services for the President and his family – for personal travel, hospitality, vacation and the like. Neither Justin nor I are separately compensated for these activities (e.g., we do not receive a fee for, or percentage of, the more than $50 million in for-profit activity we have personally helped to secure for President Clinton to date or the $66 million in future contracts, should he choose to continue with those engagements). 

With respect to business deals for his advisory services, Justin and I found, developed and brought to President Clinton multiple arrangements for him to accept or reject. Of his current 4 arrangements, we secured all of them; and, we have helped manage and maintain all of his for-profit business relationships. Since 2001, President Clinton’s business arrangements have yielded more than $30 million for him personally, with $66 million to be paid out over the next nine years should he choose to continue with the current engagements. 
A big part of those ""for-profit"" activities was a $3.5mm annual payment from Laureate...

19511,Report: Barron Trump ’Panicked’ after Seeing Kathy Griffin ’Beheading’ Photo,"Barron Trump, President Donald Trump’s    son, reportedly “panicked” and became distressed after seeing Kathy Griffin’s   “beheading” photograph because he didn’t know who Griffin was or understand the context of the photo. [According to TMZ, Trump’s youngest son was watching television Tuesday when he saw the image of Griffin holding a fake, bloody decapitated head meant to resemble the president’s head.  Sources told the gossip outlet that Barron “panicked” and began calling for his mother, First Lady Melania Trump. “He’s 11. He doesn’t know who Kathy Griffin is and the head she was holding resembled his dad,” the source told TMZ. The photo of Griffin holding up Trump’s severed head  —   taken during a photo shoot with L. A.  artist Tyler Shields  —   was first published Tuesday morning by TMZ and sparked a firestorm online, with backlash coming from both sides of the political aisle and thousands of people calling for a boycott of Griffin’s national comedy tour. The president responded Wednesday morning, saying the photograph had been particularly difficult for his children, including Barron. “Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!” Trump tweeted. Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2017,  Griffin apologized in a video posted to her Twitter account Tuesday, in which she said she “crossed the line” and that the photo had gone “too far. ” The Secret Service has reportedly opened an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the photo shoot. Meanwhile, the fallout from the incident has continued CNN, where Griffin has   a live New Year’s Eve broadcast with Anderson Cooper since 2007, announced it was “evaluating” her future role in the program, while the comedian’s scheduled performance at the Route 66 Casino in Albuquerque, New Mexico has been cancelled.

19513,How Hedonistic Game Became The Gateway To Virtuous Truths,"When people ask me about my current position fighting in the culture war, years after starting my writing career with “Bang” books, I simply say, “I just wanted to get laid.” From these hedonistic beginnings opened a path that I find myself in today. A reviewer of my new book Free Speech Isn’t Free also noticed this transformation:
I’ve been following the ‘Red Pill’ community for a a few years now. The members therein have been engaging in some of the most relevant conversations anywhere on the net. Roosh is one I’ve only recently become familiar with as I tend to appreciate and relate more to the more traditionalist members like Vox Day, Dalrock, and Roissy.
What is so fascinating about guys like Roosh is how their journey to acquire more sex and attention from highly attractive women has led them stumbling across uncomfortable truths about the world that we men of the West find ourselves living in.
This book is a very straightforward account of an encounter that an iconic Red Pill pillar had with the traditional media community that exposes a truly shocking level of laziness and corruption on the part of an institution that we are supposed to respect for some reason. I remember watching from a social media distance as these events went down and I had no idea just how bad it was.
I really admire the stones on this kid and I hope he stays motivated and encourages more people to be bold with the truth (which is always unPC). I’m not a fan of lotharios but I appreciate intellectual honesty and bravery. I hope Roosh’s Neomasculinity gets legs. I really do.
How did game serve as the gateway drug? Simple: I kept asking why, as if I was an annoying 8-year-old child.
Why are woman attracted to me when I dance and act like an entertaining clown ? Why did my father not have to act like a clown to attract my mom? Why has society changed to encourage women to pursue exciting “bad boys” and clowns over good men? Why are institutions like the media and universities pushing women into behaviors which harm them and the family unit? Why is there a concealed group of elites who seem to control politicians and the most important institutions? Why are those institutions attacking me for speaking the truth? There wasn’t only one step from having fun into the nightclub to fighting back against social justice warriors and the media, but several steps that had to take place over the past 15 years. My path weaved through sex and gender relations, but there are other paths as well, which I describe in The 5 Paths To Realizing Truth . For example, minimalism is another point of entry:
When you live below your means, you begin to see that most people are unnecessarily living above theirs. That leads to the conclusion that they were trained to live a life of excess by corporations with the complicit help of a government that wants to keep society in a neverending state of indebtedness and distraction so they ignore everyday injustices while losing any will or desire to fight the establishment. The easiest stepping stone out of The Truman Show is to realize that consumer lifestyles are not the path to happiness, and those those who chase material possessions are misguided.
Many other men have also had a similar path as myself, whereby promiscuous sex was a device for understanding the world and deciding on behaviors that are more sustainable to the male soul. While not every man gains wisdom during the stage of his life where he wants to sow his royal oats, many do, and they use that wisdom to devise solutions that can solve our modern problems. I do not at all regret engaging in shallow sex with many dozens of women throughout the world, because it has developed my thinking into what you read now, even though the sex itself wasn’t especially memorable and didn’t give me much except momentary pleasure.
From my current vantage point, it really does feel like it was all pre-determined, as if I was supposed to participate in shallow intimacy in order to arrive at true understanding, but that would imply some sort of divine providence. Whatever the mechanism, it’s clear to me that many of the behaviors and ideas we hold now could be mere way-stations for a grander, more universal truth. Whatever individual journey you’re a part of, I hope we’ll find out soon enough.

It has a balanced mix of narrative and ideology that will also give you actionable advice to help defend yourself against establishment attacks.

Yahoo, under fire over this week’s revelation that it helped the federal government spy on its users, has applied for two related patents describing a camera-equipped billboard that can spy on drivers. 
The patent applications, submitted in March 2015 and made public by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Thursday, describe a billboard that has sensors including cameras, microphones and even retina scanners built in or positioned nearby. 
“Image or video data may be processed to determine whether any individuals looked directly at the advertising content (e.g., using image recognition and/or eye tracking techniques),” said the patent documents , which use much of the same language in describing the technology. 
Verbal reactions by passersby could be collected via microphones. “Audio data captured by one or more microphones may be processed using speech recognition techniques to identify keywords relating to the advertising that are spoken by members of the audience,” the documents said. “Image data or motion/proximity sensor data may be processed to determine whether any members of the audience paused or slowed down near the advertising content, from which it may be inferred that the pause or slowing was in response to the advertising content.”",0

19516,Clinton’s Potential Attorney Gen Pick Mocks Missing Child Alert: 'Amber Is Going To Vote For Hillary!',"Share on Twitter 
U.S. Secretary of Labor Tom Perez stumped for Hillary Clinton in North Carolina Tuesday, addressing a crowd of her loyal supporters in Winston-Salem. 
But according to a video obtained by Need to Know (NTK) Network, Perez's speech was interrupted as an Amber Alert sent to multiple phones created a chorus of noise. 
As Fox 46 Charlotte reports, the Amber Alert was about an endangered 2-month-old infant. 
When Perez noticed the noise coming from the crowd, he said: 
“I don't know who that is...” 
As a Hillary supporter told him it was the emergency response system letting Americans know when a missing person or child is missing, Perez chuckled and said: 
“ Amber Alert. Oh yeah? Well, Amber is going to vote for Hillary! I talked to her the other day."" 
Fortunately, deputies located the baby, who was with his parents, and the alert was canceled. 
Perez had reportedly joined local officials earlier that day at Winston-Salem State University, speaking out against the National Rifle Association and calling for stricter gun-safety laws. 
His name was also on the VP shortlist prior to Clinton selecting Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, and has been tossed around the ring as Hillary Clinton's potential pick for Attorney General, should she win the election. ",0
19517,Hybrid Wars 8. In The Horn Of Africa (IIA),"Please read Introduction, Part IA and I B before this chapter. 
The Horn of Africa has the second most globally geostrategic location on the continent behind North Africa, straddling the commercially vital Red Sea and providing international access to the world’s fastest-growing economy of Ethiopia. In this sense, the coastal states acquire a dual maritime and mainland importance through which their territories can be simultaneously used to exert influence along the waterway and the regional interior. Furthermore, as it relates to the Red Sea, this body of water occupies a crucial role in China’s grand strategy because it serves as the most geographically convenient route for facilitating the transit of goods between the East Asian state and the EU, which is particularly expected to climb with the completion of the Balkan Silk Road in a few years’ time. Due to the importance that China places on the One Belt One Road grand strategy and the need that it has for maintaining and strengthening its overseas markets (especially the large and ever-promising EU one) in order to sustain domestic stability and long-term growth, it logically has an inherent interest in preserving stability in the Horn of Africa so as to safeguard its Sea Line of Communication (SLOC) to Europe. For similar reasons, it also wants to tap into the allied Ethiopian economy and assist in the maximization of its potential so as to acquire a strategic presence there that allows it to deepen its presence further inland into the continent’s resource-rich interior. 
It should be no surprise then that the Horn of Africa is the focal point of international military attention, as evidenced by the previous part of the research which described the vast array of foreign non-African military bases in Djibouti, the recent GCC presence in Eritrea, and the Turkish and Emirati plans for building a base in Somalia. Quite naturally and in accordance with its obvious interests, China is opening its first overseas military base in Djibouti in order take advantage of the country’s dual role in exercising maritime and mainland influence. It’s clear how and why the tiny coastal state can be used by Beijing for flexing its maritime muscles, but it’s less obvious how it plans to do this in the opposite mainland direction. It’s therefore relevant to recall the Ethiopia-Djibouti Railway that China is building between the coastal city and the inland capital, since this large-scale infrastructure project will serve as the umbilical cord between the Chinese and Ethiopian economies and also allow the later to finally and reliably access the global market in general. Moreover, the connective vision that China is pursuing is complemented by the Kenyan-originating LAPSSET project that it’s also helping to finance , which eventually plans to connect Addis Ababa with the Indian Ocean port of Lamu by rail . Suffice to say, the completion of both transnational railways and the Djibouti-based military facility will catapult China into being the most influential country in the Horn of Africa region, although this seemingly inevitable reality will expectedly be opposed by the US using the methods of Hybrid War. 
This part of the research therefore endeavors to explain all of the ways in which the US could apply Hybrid War strategy in order to conceivably offset China’s grand designs in the Horn of Africa region. It begins by offering a general overview of regional relations that sets the appropriate context for deeper analysis. After having established the state of affairs and provided a solid understanding of each examined countries’ interactions with the other, the second portion of the work then delves into a summary of these states’ strategic situations, focusing primarily on their most influential determinants. Finally, the last part of the regional study looks at the most realistic Hybrid War scenarios that the US could possibly provoke against China’s Horn of Africa interests. Thorny Relations In The Horn 
The four states that occupy the Horn of Africa region – Eritrea, Ethiopia, Djibouti, and Somalia – don’t all have pristine relations with one another, with the most obvious problems being between Eritrea & Somalia on one side and Ethiopia on the other. 
Ethiopia-Eritrea 
To explain the reason behind the abysmal relations between these two states, it’s necessary to begin by talking about Eritrea’s bloody three-decade-long secessionist war against Ethiopia which only ended in 1993. The roots of the conflict are many, but they can be summarized as starting during the imperial period when the Kingdom of Italy annexed Eritrea from the larger civilization-state of Abyssinia in 1890, thenceforth giving it a sense of identity separateness from Ethiopia and planting the seeds for future conflict after the two entities were reunified following the end of World War II. Addis Ababa’s unilateral 1962 abolishment of the ten-year-old Federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea sparked the separatist war that raged throughout the proceeding decades, and even after independence, the two countries remained at tense odds with one another over the expectation that there would eventually be a continuation war sometime in the future. 
This came to pass from 1998-2000, and despite ending in what has been described as a lingering stalemate , it killed over one hundred thousand people and undermined the economic development potential of these two dramatically impoverished states. In the years since, Ethiopia and Eritrea have still remained each other’s primary nemesis, with the two sides regularly accusing the other of attempting to subvert its stability and supporting various anti-government forces. Just like in the immediate years after independence, there still exists the very real possibility today that the two countries will go to war with one another at a moment’s notice, and this atmosphere of heightened militant tension is the most destabilizing interstate factor in the Horn of Africa. In fact, it will later be argued that this situation is being exploited by the out-of-regional powers inside the GCC as a means of acquiring leverage over Ethiopia and potentially pushing Eritrea into instigating a renewed round of debilitating violence. 
Ethiopia-Somalia 
Although not as bad as its ties with Eritrea, Ethiopia’s relations with Somalia are objectively pretty poor. Granted, on the surface of things there is positive and pragmatic interaction between both states at the government-to-government level, but the primary issue between them has always been the enticing idea of “Greater Somalia” that has captivated some Somalians on both sides of the border and even led to the Ogaden War between 1977-1978. This conflict is notable as being the last conventional attempt to create “Greater Somalia” and also as being the only time when the Soviets and Americans switched sides during a proxy war. The issue was over the status of Somalians in Ethiopia’s sparsely populated eastern region which has now been revealed to be rich i n oil and natural gas deposits, with Addis Ababa claiming that this is an integral part of Ethiopia’s territory and a native people to the multiethnic country while Mogadishu and Somalian nationalists assert that it’s an occupied region whose people must be united with their namesake nation-state. While Somalia has no realistic means of ever reattempting another Ogaden land grab anytime again in the foreseeable future, the appeal of Somalian nationalism is dangerous for Ethiopia and can easily be used by the US and others in order to engineer destabilization inside of Africa’s second-most populous country. 
Complicating matters even further is Ethiopia’s 2006 anti-terrorist intervention in Somalia which aimed to overthrow the extremist Islamic Courts Union (ICU) that had seized control of most of the country. Covertly supported and egged on by the US, Ethiopia invaded its neighbor and succeeded in expelling the militia from the capital, however its subsequent three-year occupation of the country generated a lot of hostility against it and led to a surge in Somalian nationalism. This in turn was taken advantage of by Al Shabaab, an Al Qaeda- and Daesh-linked terrorist group that grew out of the ICU’s youth wing, which blended anti-Ethiopian sentiment, Somalian nationalism, and Islamic extremism in creating a lethal cocktail of hate that has made the group one of the most feared in all of Africa. The Somalian government’s inability to appropriately combat Al Shabaab and the sympathy that misguided Somalians (especially the youth) have to the organization’s twisted message has made it a major regional threat which has the very real potential of actively causing chaos inside of Ethiopia’s Somali Region (formerly called Ogaden). In response, the authorities have been compelled to implement harsh security measures as an anti-terrorist precaution to any Daesh-like attempts to create a transnational territorially administered “Islamic State” within the region, though this has had the inadvertent effect of drawing the ire of some Somali locals and cyclically leading to the same type of anti-government attitudes that Addis Ababa has sought to avoid. 
Ethiopia-Djibouti 
Perhaps the most fruitful and positive relationship in the region is between Ethiopia and its northern Djiboutian neighbor. Demographically and geographically mismatched, the two are inherently tied to one another due to regional circumstances. Ethiopia lost all of its coastal territory with Eritrea’s independence and thereafter became a landlocked state, and the sky-high tensions between it and its former province have precluded any possibility of pragmatic economic cooperation. Similarly, because of the anarchic instability and terrorist threat in Somalia, Ethiopia has been unable to use its territory in acquiring reliable access to the sea (although it has made some positive steps in this direction with the autonomous self-proclaimed and de-facto independent state of Somaliland via the port of Berbera). For the most part, Ethiopia’s economic potential was bottled up inside the Horn of Africa interior and unable to reach the global markets, but China’s visionary and proactive initiative in building the Ethiopia-Djibouti railroad changed all of that. The project essentially turned Djibouti into the ‘cork’ which controls the flow of economic riches into the Ethiopian ‘bottle’, making it a literal bottleneck state in pivotally opening up the massive economic possibilities of its southern neighbor. 
Along the same lines, however, this breakthrough infrastructure development means the tiny country is disproportionately important to Ethiopia and can be used indirectly as a means of destabilizing the much larger and expanding economy of former Abyssinia. Domestic disturbances such as Color Revolution unrest or possible Afar separatism in Djibouti could disrupt access to the railroad and indefinitely cut Ethiopia and its partners off from one another, thus making it totally dependent on the LAPSSET corridor to its south which runs through Oromo-populated territory and could quickly become a tantalizing target for ethnic-affiliated rebel and terrorist groups. With this in mind, it becomes even more apparent why China chose Djibouti as the location of its first overseas military base, since it’s substantially easier to exert positive influence on small Djibouti in safeguarding the viability of its prized railroad investment than in doing so inside of Kenya or anywhere else, and plus, there’s of course the added maritime advantage in being located on the Red Sea. As for how China could predictably protect its railroad, it might either employ the direct use of its military as hinted at in its first-ever 2015 white paper on military strategy in order to protect its foreign interests, or it could end up utilizing private military corporations (PMCs) to indirectly do this instead. 
The bottom line is that Djiboutian stability is absolutely integral for Ethiopia’s strategic security, and it’s for this reason that bilateral relations are extraordinarily close and will foreseeably remain so for the future. Djibouti benefits from this relationship by profiting off of its transit state status in facilitating access to and from the Ethiopian economy, so it has a vested self-interest in protecting the railroad as well. Therefore, it’s expected that it would use its military forces to safeguard the line in the event of any domestic troubles, likely applying the training that they acquired from their Chinese counterparts inside the country and probably even doing so under the supervision of Chinese advisors as well. By functioning as Ethiopia’s critical link to the outside world, Djibouti could also end up being targeted by Eritrea or by Somalian-based terrorist groups as a means of indirectly offsetting the regional hegemon, so this is of course a factor that must be considered. 
Eritrea-Djibouti 
In reference to the previous, Eritrea does not have positive relations with Djibouti and actually fought a brief border war with its neighbor in 2008. As per UN agreement, Qatar has deployed its troops to both countries in order to mediate the conflict and has remained in the region since 2010, presenting another factor of instability vis-à-vis Ethiopia which will be discussed later on. To continue with the state of bilateral relations between the two coastal countries, it’s worthwhile to also mention that Eritrea has actually had problems with all of its neighbors, and this includes Sudan and Yemen (the latter via the Hanish Islands conflict ), which together demonstrates a distinct pattern of Eritrean behavior. Therefore, the 2008 conflict with Djibouti mustn’t be seen in isolation, but rather as a continuation of long-standing Eritrean policy which regularly resorts to militant means to achieve its goals. It can’t be discounted that Qatar and Eritrea might conspire together in supporting Al Shabaab attacks inside of Djibouti in order to inflict strategic harm on Ethiopia, since not only has the Gulf state been convincingly linked to the terrorist organization, but Eritrea is actually under UNSC sanctions for allegedly aiding it in the past (although the latest findings indicate that this relationship may no longer be in effect). Therefore, Eritrea’s relations with Djibouti absolutely must be seen in the prism of its regional proxy war with Ethiopia which conceptualizes the neighboring state between them as a potential asymmetrical battleground. 
Djibouti-Somalia 
On the other side of things, Djibouti’s relations with Somalia are warm and friendly, despite Mogadishu having no de-facto control over the bordering region with the autonomous and self-proclaimed independent state of Somaliland. While there isn’t anything substantial to speak of in this regard, it’s worthwhile mentioning the latent threat that non-state-actor-promoted militant Somali nationalism might pose to Djibouti (including the perverted version espoused by Al Shabaab). The country is mostly populated by the Issa clan, which itself is regarded as a subsect of the Somalis and thus places them within the within the purview of “Greater Somalia”. While this ideal may have had some sway in the Cold War-era past and in the years before and immediately after the former French Somaliland’s independence, it no longer has much of an appeal in Djibouti after Somalia descended into failed state status in 1991, although that isn’t to say that there might not be some people who are still attracted to the romanticized version of this ideology. What’s most threatening, however, isn’t the possibility of passively sympathetic Djiboutians supporting “Greater Somalia” slogans, but Al Shabaab and other terrorist groups violently targeting the country’s nationals and infrastructure projects in order to ostensibly support this vision. 
The varied deployment of so many international non-African military forces in Djibouti makes it unlikely that the terrorists would succeed in inflicting long-term harm to the country or the Ethiopia-Djibouti railroad, but their extremist ideology and willingness to die for their cause makes them very dangerous and leads to the impossibility of discounting this scenario. Still, the relatively better policed and more closely administrated Somaliland region serves as a stop gap in inhibiting Al Shabaab’s direct movement to Djibouti, although it’s of course possible that the organization could infiltrate its coastal target through more conventional means such as covertly entering it by means of the world-famous port and under an assumed cover instead of illegally sneaking across the international border. In any case, the only relevant factor of Djiboutian-Somalian affairs that’s applicable to the Hybrid War research is Al Shabaab and the ideology of “Greater Somalia”, neither of which are promoted at the state level but both of which could lead to serious problems for the targeted country. For this reason, the Djibouti-Somalia axis is the least relevant factor in the Horn of Africa’s regional political arrangement, at least on the official level, although it does have the potential to unconventionally become a major destabilizing issue in the future among certain non-state actors. 
Eritrea-Somalia 
Just like Eritrea views Djibouti, it also holds the same proxy battleground mentality for Somalia as well. If the UNSC’s suspicions about Eritrea’s support of Al Shabaab are to be believed, then it’s clear to see that Asmara is simply employing whatever tool it can get its hands on in order to destabilize Addis Ababa. Whether reckless or justified depending on one’s political disposition, it’s unmistakable that Eritrea’s burning hate for Ethiopia has spread the proxy conflict between them from the joint border all the way to the Somalian frontier, thereby engulfing the region in this turmoil and turning their rivalry into the single most important driver of the Horn of Africa’s geopolitical destabilizations. It’s likely that the Eritrean leadership is no longer as close to Al Shabaab as it was suspected of being before, partly due to increased international stigma and awareness of this relationship, but that doesn’t remove the fact that Asmara may have played a key role in the group’s early development and consequently makes the country responsible to an extent for the organization’s present existence and violent rise. 
Accordingly, the only logical way to view Eritrean-Somalian relations is through the prism of the greater Eritrean-Ethiopian proxy war in the region and the relative benefit that each respective actor gets from Somalia’s stability or insecurity. With that being considered, it can be argued that Eritrea benefits more from Somalia’s instability and the prevalence of militant non-state actors there (including Islamic-affiliated terrorists and “Greater Somalia” nationalists) than it does if normalcy were to return to the country. The arrival of stability would preclude Somalian territory from ever again being used by Eritrea as an asymmetrical springboard against Ethiopia, and it would correspondingly limit Asmara’s strategic flexibility in dealing with its larger and better equipped rival. Since Somalia is gradually becoming more stabilized over the past couple of years, Eritrea’s strategy might shift from allegedly working with terrorist groups to harnessing its new yet unofficial GCC military partnership in order to make inroads with the autonomous and self-proclaimed de-facto independent state of Somaliland. The strategic fusion of Eritrean and GCC capabilities on Ethiopia’s northeastern border might portend a more concerted destabilization sometime in the future, whether of an Islamic terrorist, “Greater Somalian”, or blended nature thereof.

19518,"In Afghanistan’s Farm Belt, Women Lead Unions and Find New Status - The New York Times","SHIBAR, Afghanistan  —   In this lush farm belt deep in central Afghanistan, women have been the organizing force behind a new wave of small village farm unions. That seems to have brought some changes. In a reversal of tradition, husbands tend to walk after their wives, trailing a couple of steps behind with   sleeves and   faces. And critically for this impoverished region, the unions have established modest supply chains at the market in the center of Bamian Province. Over just a few years, they have introduced new vegetables to their humble dinner plates. “In the old days, only potatoes and wheat were grown here,” said Zainab Husseini, a   high school biology teacher and the   farming union leader in the village of  . “Now we introduced cabbage, cauliflower, tomatoes, beans and other vegetables. ” The unions, in updating   agricultural traditions, have helped ensure a more reliable and diverse food supply in an often   region. In the process, the women who run the groups are finding new status and empowerment. They are no longer greeted as the mother of Ahmad or the wife of Mahmoud, but rather “union leader Gul Bahar” or “deputy union leader Reza Gul. ” The unions have put the women of Bamian on the front line of a critical struggle: the effort to shape a sustainable Afghan economy, away from dependence on foreign aid. Agriculture must surely be a crucial part of the program if that is to happen. Close to 40 percent of the population remains below the poverty line of $1. 35 a day, Afghan officials say. According to the World Bank, more than 80 percent of the Afghan population  —   and about 90 percent of the poor  —   live in rural communities. Agriculture is therefore central not just to countering widespread malnutrition in remote areas, but also to creating sustainable jobs. Assadullah Zamir, Afghanistan’s minister of agriculture, says one area that requires focus is linking farmers to local and national markets, and helping their crops compete with cheap imports by imposing tariffs on, for example, Pakistani vegetables. “The production has increased with programs and training, and the market is not enough it is not sufficient,” Mr. Zamir said. If Afghanistan can better manage its water resources and establish decent connections between farms and markets  —   a critical problem in the middle of a war where battles are fought with roadside bombs and security checkpoints  —   the agriculture sector could create two million to five million sustainable new jobs, or even double the industry’s percentage of the country’s gross domestic product, according to Afghan officials and economic analysts. But here in remote Bamian, the terrain itself poses a huge challenge to bringing crops to market. To get to Shibar, one must drive from the provincial capital of Bamian for about an hour, up a narrow dirt track carved along the mountains. The car slowly winds its way so high along the mountaintop that the clouds hang nearly at arm’s length. Then, even more slowly, as the path descends in spiraling bends, the car splashes through sudden creeks of snow melt that run through narrow gorges. After the Taliban destroyed giant Buddha statues in 2001, Bamian Province became associated mainly with one thing: potatoes. Lots of potatoes. In 2015, Bamian produced nearly 350, 000 tons of potatoes, about 60 percent of Afghanistan’s total consumption, according to the country’s Ministry of Agriculture. But an overabundance of that single product became a headache for farmers in Shibar, leaving them vulnerable to trader exploitation and struggling to meet their own basic food needs for most of the year. During harvest season, the potatoes are sold wholesale at   prices: roughly $150 a ton. The farmers have no way of holding on to the potatoes for the winter months, when wholesale prices double. The approximately 500 cold storage facilities built in Bamian with the help of the Afghan government in recent years are simply not enough. (The smaller facilities hold about 15 tons, and the larger community ones about 60 tons.) That realization forced the Afghan government and its international partners a few years ago to encourage growing new crops, and women like Ms. Husseini took the lead in Shibar. About five years ago, Ms. Husseini tapped into a local women’s rights group she was leading to form small farmers’ unions and seek help from the Afghan Ministry of Agriculture. The ministry, which formally recognized the unions in 2013, provided sample plots where farmers could plant improved seeds and learn new techniques from visiting trainers, like using different plant spacing or drip irrigation systems. “In the old days, the potatoes were this small,” Ms. Husseini, the union leader in   said, picking up a tiny rock. “When traders would come, they would set aside half of it as not good. Now they want all of it. Each potato weighs one kilogram on average. ” There are now eight village farmers’ unions in Shibar, each comprising about 30 women. In addition to improving potato production, they have turned to new vegetables and, more recently, even started fruit orchards. In her small vegetable plot, Najia, the deputy union leader in   grew lettuce, cabbage and tomatoes last year. The lettuce brought her about $70, the tomatoes about $80 and the cabbage about $40. Najia is also in charge of the unions’ relations with the market in Bamian’s provincial capital, supplying fresh vegetables to six shops that they have established deals with  —   a very small market, but a start. Every time other union members have crops to sell, they all bring their produce to Najia, who arranges for a vehicle to take them to the market. But getting to the market is incredibly costly: Renting a small truck to take the goods there on the bumpy, narrow road out of Shibar costs about $20  —   a large sum, considering how little the farmers currently make. The Afghan government, which often uses nongovernmental organizations as implementing partners, prioritizes the extremely poor for many of its agricultural projects. So even a small grant like giving a family a sheep or a cow, as well as teaching them ways to grow and sell their products, makes a big difference. “When we go back two years later, for example, each of them have expanded that to at least three or four sheep, or sold some of the sheep to buy a cow,” said Dr. Mariam Habib, who ran one of these   programs in Bamian. With their increased economic activity and their handle of the cash flow, women say they also notice a change in their standing in the community. “Everyone invites me to parties, and they even consult me on matters now,” one gaptoothed older woman, waving her hands, told a visiting delegation of officials recently. She could not be reached for identification afterward. But in Shibar, as they increase production and earn more, some of the female union leaders bemoan a compromise that is forced on them: The new potatoes taste different. “The new potatoes are now white in the middle and have a great market, but they don’t taste the same,” said Asma, the deputy chief of one union. For her own cooking, she grows the old seeds.",0
19519,Will The Deep State Win The Election?,"Written by Daniel McAdams Monday October 31, 2016 Most of the country is on the edge of its seat over next week's presidential election. Will it be Hillary? Trump? We don't know. One thing we do know is that the real winner will be a public/private hybrid known as the ""deep state"" that ensures Washington's policies do not significantly shift out of its favor. They will come out on top regardless of who wins next week. There are more ""private"" contractors with top secret clearances than government employees. A recently released FBI memo referenced the ""7th Floor Group"" or ""Shadow Government"" made up of very high-ranking State Department officials and perhaps others. This not conspiracy, it is conspiracy fact. What can be done about it? Plenty.

Even Clinton’s campaign chair John Podesta blasted Hillary’s use of a private email server in violation of numerous laws. 
“Do we actually know who told Hillary she could use a private email? And has that person been drawn and quartered?” He asked campaign staffer Neera Tanden in a 2015 email . “Like whole thing is fucking insane.” 
The comment stemmed from a discussion on Hillary’s failure to pull away from then-candidate Bernie Sanders in the polls.

19521,Modest to Majestic: A Look at Hillary and Bill Clinton’s Homes Over the Years - The New York Times,"Hillary and Bill Clinton’s shift over the years from middle class to multimillionaires has been perhaps most pronounced in the places they have called home. For 18 consecutive years, the Clintons lived in   housing, from the Arkansas governor’s mansion to the White House. Should Mrs. Clinton win the presidency in November, they would become the first “first couple” to swap roles and return to the White House. Here’s a look at the Clintons’ homes over the years: When They Were There:   What They Paid For It: $17, 200 What Was Going On in Their Lives: On Oct. 11, 1975, Bill and Hillary, then both law professors, were married in the living room of this Tudor revival home. The building, now a museum, is one of the four stops on the “Billgrimage” tour of Mr. Clinton’s   House life. _____ When They Were There:    What Was Going On in Their Lives: Mrs. Clinton had a hard time adjusting to life in Little Rock, which was more conservative than the college town of Fayetteville. The        home where they lived while Mr. Clinton was attorney general was a pit stop on the way to the governor’s mansion. _____ When They Were There:   What They Paid For It: $112, 000 What Was Going On in Their Lives: Mrs. Clinton partly used the proceeds from her investments and her savings to put a $60, 000 down payment on the home, in the city’s Hillcrest district, purchased in the dark days after Mr. Clinton lost his   bid for governor. She built wooden bookshelves in a sunny office (which locals joke was the first Clinton Library) and converted the attic into a room for Chelsea, who celebrated her first birthday and learned to walk there. _____ When They Were There: 1999 to present What They Paid For It: $1. 7 million What Was Going On in Their Lives: Laden with debt from legal bills while they were in the White House, the Clintons initially accepted help from their friend and   Terry McAuliffe to secure the mortgage on the home, but turned down the offer amid criticism. The   Dutch colonial in a wooded New York suburb in Westchester County gave Mrs. Clinton a perch from which she could run for a Senate seat from New York. The Clintons spend most of their downtime here,   “The Good Wife” and “Downton Abbey” and hosting Thanksgiving meals with Chelsea and her friends. _____ When They Were There: 2000 to present What They Paid For It: $2. 85 million What Was Going On in Their Lives: With Mrs. Clinton set to represent New York in the Senate, the Clintons needed a home in Washington. The    home, in an area known as “Embassy Row,” takes up a third of an acre on a   lot, and has seven bedrooms, a den, a pool and a terrace. The relatively secure location makes it a favorite place for the Clintons to entertain and hold meetings away from prying reporters’ eyes. _____ When They Were There: 2004 to present, on and off What Was Going On in Their Lives: Perched atop the Clinton library (which locals joke looks like a glass trailer park) is a tastefully decorated private residence where the Clintons stay when they’re in Little Rock. The apartment has a sprawling terrace overlooking the Arkansas River and the aptly named Clinton Presidential Park Bridge. Mr. Clinton, famously a night owl, is known to tap into the archives to frequently redecorate with memorabilia from his presidency.",0
19522,Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump Give More Details on Their Health - The New York Times,"With less than eight weeks until Election Day and pressure mounting for the candidates to give details about their health and medical histories, Donald J. Trump acknowledged on Wednesday that he was overweight and taking a   drug, and Hillary Clinton elaborated on the circumstances that led to her contracting pneumonia and the medicine she was taking to recover. Mrs. Clinton’s doctor said she “continues to improve” after contracting a “mild, noncontagious” form of pneumonia diagnosed on Friday, two days before she grew dizzy and was seen losing her footing while leaving a ceremony for the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. In a letter released by the Clinton campaign, the physician, Dr. Lisa R. Bardack, said she had evaluated Mrs. Clinton several times since Sunday, including on Wednesday. “She is recovering well with antibiotics and rest,” Dr. Bardack said. “She continues to remain healthy and fit to serve as president of the United States. ” After Mrs. Clinton left Sunday’s Sept. 11 ceremony early, a spokesman initially said only that she had felt overheated. But after video shot by an onlooker showed Secret Service agents helping a wobbly Mrs. Clinton into a van, her campaign released a statement from Dr. Bardack saying that Mrs. Clinton had pneumonia. Since then, Mr. Trump’s campaign has urged supporters to refrain from talking about Mrs. Clinton’s health, a frequent topic of speculation among some Republicans before her pneumonia diagnosis. But at a rally in Ohio on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump said he hoped Mrs. Clinton was improving but added that she was “lying in bed. ” He also noted his ability to keep standing in an overheated room. “I don’t know, folks,” he said. “Do you think Hillary would be able to stand up here for an hour?” Despite fanning conspiracy theories about Mrs. Clinton’s health, Mr. Trump provided scant information about his own. On Wednesday, he taped an appearance on Dr. Mehmet Oz’s daytime television show in which he discussed his health to some degree, including the results of a physical last week, according to people present for the taping and a clip released by the show’s publicists. But little information was available about what was said on the show, which will be broadcast on Thursday, other than that Mr. Trump, 70, said he was taking regular doses of a statin, a drug that lowers cholesterol, and gave his weight as 236 pounds. At about    Mr. Trump would have a body mass index of 30. 3. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute defines obesity as a B. M. I. of 30 or more, and overweight as 25 to 29. 9. NBC News reported that Dr. Oz pronounced Mr. Trump “slightly overweight. ” Democrats have seized on Mr. Trump’s weight this week, with Harry Reid, the Senate minority leader, noting Tuesday that he was hardly “slim and trim,” and David Plouffe, a former senior adviser to President Obama, suggesting on Twitter that he would rival William Howard Taft in portliness. Mr. Trump has yet to make public as much personal medical information as Mrs. Clinton has. Earlier this week, he said he would soon release new medical records, and he was expected to discuss the results of his physical on Dr. Oz’s show. During the taping, he theatrically produced what he described as the results and allowed Dr. Oz to review them, according to the brief clip released. Until this week, the latest medical information about Mr. Trump had come in December in a letter from his longtime physician, Dr. Harold Bornstein, which included a few numbers  —   Mr. Trump’s blood pressure and PSA test score  —   and little else aside from superlatives and boasts. The letter also said that Mr. Trump had lost 15 pounds over the previous year, though it did not give his weight before or after. In the letter released by the Clinton campaign, Dr. Bardack said that she had examined Mrs. Clinton, 68, on Friday for a prolonged,   cough, discovered “small right   pneumonia,” put her on antibiotics and advised her “to rest and modify her schedule. ” At the Sept. 11 ceremony, she said, Mrs. Clinton “became overheated and dehydrated,” but was “rehydrated and recovering nicely” later that day. Criticized for concealing Mrs. Clinton’s illness, her aides apologized on Monday and promised to release more information about her medical history. Mrs. Clinton canceled trips to California and Nevada this week to rest, but she planned to return to the campaign trail on Thursday. Dr. Bardack’s letter also cast some new light on the persistent cough that Mrs. Clinton complained of before she was found to have pneumonia. Dr. Bardack said she had examined Mrs. Clinton on Sept. 2, a week before the pneumonia diagnosis, after Mrs. Clinton experienced a   fever, congestion and fatigue. She prescribed antibiotics and rest, but Mrs. Clinton continued to travel, and over several days, “her congestion worsened and she developed a cough,” Dr. Bardack wrote. That Monday, Mrs. Clinton had an extended coughing attack while trying to deliver a Labor Day speech in Cleveland. The details released Wednesday included that Mrs. Clinton has been taking the antibiotic Levaquin, “as well as   as needed. ” Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University, said that the information suggested Mrs. Clinton may have had the pneumonia for a longer period, and that she needed a   examination and   to make sure it was responding well to the antibiotics. Dr. Bardack wrote that “the remainder of her complete physical exam was normal, and she is in excellent mental condition. ” Her letter did not include Mrs. Clinton’s height or weight. It did note, however, that in January, Mrs. Clinton developed a sinus and ear infection that caused “progressive pain in her left ear. ” She was treated with antibiotics as well as the placement of a myringotomy tube in her ear, and her symptoms resolved by March. Before Sunday, Dr. Bardack’s last public comment about Mrs. Clinton’s health had come in a   letter in July 2015 describing her as a “healthy female with hypothyroidism and seasonal allergies” who was in “excellent physical condition. ” Mrs. Clinton has expressed frustration with what she says is a double standard, in which she is expected to adhere to traditional levels of transparency but Mr. Trump is not penalized for ignoring them. She has quickly shifted from questions about her medical records to criticizing Mr. Trump for not releasing his tax returns. “It’s really past time for him to be held to the same standards,” she told CNN on Monday night. Mrs. Clinton’s running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, also released a doctor’s letter Wednesday, saying he was in excellent health and worked out three times a week. Dr. Brian Monahan, the attending physician to Congress, said Mr. Kaine’s cholesterol and blood lipids were elevated, but made no mention of a statin drug. The upper chamber of the left side of Mr. Kaine’s heart is enlarged, but Dr. Monahan noted nothing else unusual about his heart or major arteries. Mrs. Clinton’s disclosures may help her campaign bat down rumors about her health that have been driven by conservative news outlets with Mr. Trump’s encouragement. After her coughing fit in Cleveland, Mrs. Clinton casually told reporters on her campaign plane that she was taking more antihistamines. “It happens like twice a year, in the spring when the pollen comes, and it happens in the fall,” she said. “It lasts a couple days, and then it disappears. ” “There is a long video recording that someone is compiling right now, going back decades,” she added jokingly. Mrs. Clinton has tried to bounce back quickly from medical issues in the past. In 2009, she slipped in a State Department garage and fractured her elbow, but traveled to India and Thailand a few days later with her arm in a sling and her joint held together with wire and pins. She took longer to recover after dehydration brought on by a stomach virus led her to faint and hit her head on a toilet at her home in 2012. She sustained a concussion and was later found to have a blood clot in her head. Among the things she had to delay was an appearance before Congress to testify about the Sept. 11, 2012, attack in Benghazi, Libya. The timing led to widespread speculation by Republicans, who accused Mrs. Clinton of faking an illness. One Fox News contributor called it an “acute Benghazi allergy. ” Some have expressed concern about a similar politicizing of Mrs. Clinton’s current diagnosis. “They’re hitting each other on the heads with stethoscopes to try to earn points,” said Arthur L. Caplan, a professor of medical ethics at New York University. But Dr. Caplan said both candidates needed additional scrutiny, given their ages. “You’ve got older candidates, so you’re going to see health problems and risks detected in both of them,” he said. “Seventy is still the new 70. ”",0
19523,"Jeremy Corbyn, Leader of Britain’s Labour Party, Loses No-Confidence Vote - The New York Times","LONDON  —   Britain’s opposition Labour Party, already reeling after voters defied its advice and chose to leave the European Union, was plunged further into crisis on Tuesday when its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, overwhelmingly lost a   motion among his fellow lawmakers. The measure, which passed by a vote of 172 to 40, opens the way for a challenge to Mr. Corbyn’s leadership. It technically changes nothing, as Mr. Corbyn has refused to step down, though it underscores his loss of authority among colleagues in Parliament. “I was democratically elected leader of our party for a new kind of politics by 60 percent of Labour members and supporters, and I will not betray them by resigning,” Mr. Corbyn said after the vote by Labour members of Parliament. “Today’s vote by M. P. s has no constitutional legitimacy. ” He added: “We are a democratic party with a clear constitution. Our people need Labour Party members, trade unionists and M. P. s to unite behind my leadership at a critical time for our country. ” In the aftermath of Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, Mr. Corbyn has been hit by the mass resignation of most of his leadership team. About   of Parliament members opposed leaving the union, including the overwhelming majority of Labour members and a smaller majority of members from the governing Conservative Party. Prime Minister David Cameron announced on Friday, the day after the referendum, that he would resign, and a power struggle has begun within the Conservative Party over who will succeed him. Given the disarray in British politics, many Labour lawmakers are worried that a general election may be held soon, and they fear that, with Mr. Corbyn at the party’s helm, they will face even bigger losses than they did in the May 2015 election. A   Mr. Corbyn was elected last year by an overwhelming majority of party members and supporters, but his support was very shallow among lawmakers. Discontent at Mr. Corbyn’s performance was crystallized by his campaign in the referendum on European Union membership, in which the party’s policy was to remain within the bloc. While Mr. Corbyn, a lifelong euroskeptic, did urge Labour supporters to vote to remain, critics regarded his campaign as lackluster, and his message as lukewarm. Mr. Corbyn’s staunch ally John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor of the Exchequer and the party’s top spokesman on economic issues, has said that Mr. Corbyn is “not going anywhere,” and even vowed to run Mr. Corbyn’s campaign if there were a new election among Labour Party members. Supporters of Mr. Corbyn have called on his critics to either shut up or challenge him in a formal leadership contest. Under the Labour Party system, the final choice lies with party members and supporters, and Mr. Corbyn’s allies, who include influential   activists, are confident that he would win   despite some indications that support for him is weakening.",0
19524,Chris Christie Becomes Powerful Figure in Donald Trump Campaign - The New York Times,"Defeated by Donald J. Trump in the 2016 primaries and derided by fellow Republicans for his subsequent embrace of Mr. Trump, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey has quietly emerged as one of the most influential advisers to his party’s presumptive presidential nominee and one of the leading contenders to be his running mate. Four months after endorsing Mr. Trump, Mr. Christie remains one of the few major figures in the Republican establishment to align himself entirely with Mr. Trump’s candidacy. In public, he has defended Mr. Trump’s freewheeling and sometimes offensive pronouncements, vouching for him even after Mr. Trump attacked a federal judge for his Mexican heritage. (Mr. Christie said he knew from personal experience that Mr. Trump was not a racist.) Mr. Christie is among those being vetted as Mr. Trump’s possible running mate, according to people briefed on the process, and Mr. Trump has said in interviews that Mr. Christie would have a prominent place in a Trump White House. Already, Mr. Christie has begun the task of designing a government on Mr. Trump’s behalf. Chosen to lead Mr. Trump’s transition efforts, Mr. Christie has taken a role that some of his allies liken to that of a White House chief of staff, soliciting views on what a potential administration should look like. Mr. Christie has taken the transition process firmly in hand, according to people familiar with his activities. He has enlisted his former top aide in Trenton, Richard H. Bagger, to help manage the transition team. On a conference call with several dozen of Mr. Christie’s political allies on Thursday afternoon, he and Mr. Bagger said they aimed to have a long list of possible appointees drawn up for Mr. Trump by the time of the election. And they outlined plans to fund their early preparations through a nonprofit group, people briefed on the plans said, and asked for help raising money until they receive government support after the July conventions for their transition efforts. Behind the scenes, Mr. Christie has prodded his fellow governors and Republican political donors to line up behind a candidate many view with distaste. He has made only modest headway in the last few months: Mr. Trump has struggled badly with   and Mr. Christie has pleaded with donors in personal phone calls and at   events to give him a second look. At a breakfast   in Manhattan last week, Mr. Christie cajoled reluctant donors to back Mr. Trump, arguing that giving anything less than enthusiastic support would be a de facto vote for Hillary Clinton. And he has prodded Mr. Trump, too, to shift direction at key moments: Mr. Christie was among the senior Republicans who privately urged Mr. Trump to dismiss his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who was widely distrusted by national party leaders and other members of the Trump inner circle. Mr. Christie’s new role is a stark transformation from a boastfully independent   politician determined to win over female, Hispanic and Asian voters, to the   man of the most culturally polarizing presidential candidate in a generation. Politically, it represents a drastic gamble for Mr. Christie, a wager that he will be better off as a loyal and   footman for an unpopular nominee than as a sulking former opponent plotting his eventual comeback. Should Mr. Christie seek the presidency again, he would probably be identified  —   for better or worse  —   not as a leader of the mainstream Republican Party, but as a champion of Mr. Trump’s faction. Mr. Christie has also acknowledged to friends that Mr. Trump seized much of the political space Mr. Christie had hoped to occupy in his own presidential run  —   that of a blunt leader with an expansive media profile and a forceful message on terrorism. But some Republicans are disheartened by Mr. Christie’s integration into the Trump machinery, seeing it as a lost opportunity to build a more inclusive Republican Party this election year. Joel Maiola, a New Hampshire strategist who helped steer Mr. Christie’s campaign in the state, said he had been “confused and not overly happy” about Mr. Christie’s involvement in the Trump operation. “I think he’s been diminished by the way the Trump organization has used him, and I think that’s really unfortunate,” Mr. Maiola said. He described Mr. Christie’s efforts to unite the party behind Mr. Trump as largely futile because of Mr. Trump’s divisive approach to the presidential race. “He just seems to blow up the efforts that Governor Christie has been making to sort of form those alliances and form those bridges,” Mr. Maiola said. A spokesman for Mr. Christie declined to comment on his involvement with the Trump campaign or to make Mr. Christie available for an interview. Mr. Trump has been outwardly receptive to Mr. Christie’s coaching. The two men describe each other as friends with an acquaintance dating back 15 years, to early in Mr. Christie’s political career. Even during their clash in the Republican primaries, Mr. Christie spoke warmly of Mr. Trump as a friend as an endorser, Mr. Christie has shown loyalty that has been noted with appreciation by Mr. Trump and his children. And Mr. Trump has given credit to the governor for helping him win the Republican nomination. Addressing a   in Manhattan last week, Mr. Trump thanked Mr. Christie for his political advice and his sophisticated grasp of government  —   and, perhaps most of all, for his part in demolishing Senator Marco Rubio’s presidential campaign. The New Jersey governor, Mr. Trump said, gutted Mr. Rubio so thoroughly in a February debate that he was content simply to sit back and enjoy the show. He kidded Mr. Christie, “Thank you, Chris, for being the bad guy,” according to some in attendance who paraphrased Mr. Trump’s remarks. But Mr. Christie’s proximity to the possible next president has come at a price. And as a Trump advocate, he has also run up against the limits of his own influence. Shortly after backing Mr. Trump, Mr. Christie visited one of his close friends in politics, Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, in Annapolis. Over breakfast in the governor’s mansion, Mr. Christie and Mr. Hogan discussed the presidential race, and Mr. Hogan made it clear that he did not share Mr. Christie’s enthusiasm for Mr. Trump. Mr. Hogan is one of several Republican governors, including Charlie Baker of Massachusetts and Rick Snyder of Michigan, who have said they will not support Mr. Trump. “They’ve agreed to disagree on this particular issue, and there’s no kind of confrontation,” said Matthew A. Clark, a spokesman for Mr. Hogan. “Governor Christie did not make any attempt to change Governor Hogan’s mind. ” In New Jersey, Mr. Christie’s already low approval ratings slipped further after he endorsed Mr. Trump. And on a more personal level, Mr. Christie has been routinely taunted by Democrats and more than a few fellow Republicans for his perceived obsequiousness around Mr. Trump. A gregarious politician who routinely refers to other officeholders by their first names, Mr. Christie was pilloried in late February for referring to his friend as “Mr. Trump” in announcing his support. Soon after, Mr. Trump was caught on a microphone in Arkansas curtly telling Mr. Christie that he should go home after having finished his remarks. On the night of the March 1 primaries, Mr. Christie became the subject of internet memes featuring his seemingly vacant expression as he stood at Mr. Trump’s shoulder during his victory speech. In June, Mr. Christie’s staff flatly denied an account in The New Yorker that Mr. Christie had been captured on video fetching fast food for Mr. Trump. Mr. Christie has shrugged off any hard feelings about the mockery he draws on the campaign trail, but he has also recently stepped away from the stump and opted for a more discreet role. Thomas H. Kean, a former New Jersey governor, said Mr. Christie had described himself as deeply involved in Mr. Trump’s activities. “He was advising him on speeches he’s advising him on policies,” Mr. Kean said. Mr. Kean added: “He’s in a position to be a good adviser. Whether Trump will listen to him or not, I don’t know. ”",0

19526,Americans' health deteriorating under Obamacare as life expectancies plunge,"Americans' health deteriorating under Obamacare as life expectancies plunge 
Wednesday, November 02, 2016 by: Ethan A. Huff, staff writer Tags: Americans , life expectancy , plummeting health (NaturalNews) For many years, the assumption has been that the United States leads the world as an advanced civilization, dominating in categories like education, quality of life, and life expectancy. But a new study released this year by the Society of Actuaries (SOA) paints a much different picture, suggesting that Americans are less healthy and will more than likely live much shorter lives compared to those in previous generations.The 36-page report reveals that the average 65-year-old American man today will most likely die just short of his 86th birthday, while the average 65-year-old American woman only has about two years longer until she dies, on average, around age 88. This might not sound like anything out of the ordinary, except that these figures are actually down compared to last year's report using the same criteria.Over the past several years, the report explains, American health has taken a major downturn. Life expectancy amongst 65-year-olds is down by about six months, on average. It's also down for younger Americans, who are likewise expected to live about six months less than in previous generations. In nearly every generational category, including ""Baby Boomers,"" ""Generation X,"" and ""Millennials,"" life expectancy is down, and will likely continue to go down.This is especially the case among middle-aged, non-Hispanic whites, who a recent study by Princeton University found are increasingly succumbing to the detrimental effects of bad habits like alcohol and drug abuse, unhealthy diet, and lack of exercise. This report also highlights increasing rates of suicide within younger populations, a sad state of affairs that says even more about the current state of our society.Mortality rates are still rising, the data suggests, but at an increasingly lower rate. And if things continue on the current trajectory, eventually overall life expectancy will be on the downturn – that is, unless the factors contributing to this decline are addressed and brought to bear. If they aren't, the average American life will likely continue to decline into the future. Pension payers, insurance companies see dollar signs as people die earlier While the study's findings have many applications in terms of social science research , the one area where they're making the biggest ripples involves employee pensions. By looking at this new life expectancy data through the lens of post-retirement disbursements, employers can determine whether or not their liabilities will increase or decrease – and based on the most current data, it appears that a decrease is on the way.""The updated scale provides the latest information to help accurately measure pension obligations,"" says Dale Hall, managing director of research at the SOA. ""However, it is up to pension plan sponsors, working with their plan actuaries, to determine how to incorporate emerging mortality improvement data into their plan valuations.""With the growing popularity of 401k accounts as opposed to pensions , the new data can also help employees who handle their own retirement affairs better ascertain how much they need to make, and how much they need to save, to live comfortably until their deaths. All of this information makes a difference when determining the price of annuities and insurance contracts whereby insurance companies are obligated to pay out until the time a person dies.Year-over-year changes in mortality are very volatile,"" Hall adds, noting that something as simple as a bad flu season can disrupt the death rate averages.At the same time, some experts claim that longevity rates in the long-term are still on an upward trajectory, and that soon-to-be retirees and younger folks alike need to take into account the fact that they could live much longer than the latest figures suggest, and to plan accordingly.

19527,"New York Tonight: A Fatal Blast in the Bronx, and a Bullet in Brooklyn - The New York Times","Updated, 7:48 p. m. Good evening on this   Tuesday. This is New York Tonight, a   evening roundup of the day’s most important New York stories. We are running it for a week as an experiment, so tell us what you think at nytonight@nytimes. com or in the comments. Forget the debates. It’s been quite a busy news day in New York and across the river. An   explosion destroyed a home in the Kingsbridge neighborhood of the Bronx, killing a fire chief and injuring at least a dozen other people. Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered flags to be flown at   to honor the fallen battalion chief, Michael J. Fahy, a   veteran of the Fire Department who was the father of three young children. The site of the blast is being investigated as a possible drug den. But now, it’s little more than rubble. Soon afterward, a    man was shot in   Brooklyn, by a police officer. The shooting, which did not result in   wounds, is under investigation. In Newark, the trial continued over the 2013 lane shutdown at the George Washington Bridge. David Wildstein, the confessed mastermind of the scheme, returned to the stand to tell all. Takeaways from his testimony: Gov.

[RSVP@thedooronline. com] ‘Talking Parades With the Police’ Dear Diary: On my first Halloween in Gotham City, an old boyfriend and I retreated to the warmth of a deli on 50th Street. We had tried to go to the parade, but I was too cold in my flowy, black,       skirt. We were dressed as Batman and Batwoman. I had spent hours perfecting a Batwoman mask painted onto my forehead and cheeks. When I was two bites into my deli cheeseburger, three police officers approached the section where we were seated. One of the officers nonchalantly invited himself to our table, pulling up a chair. He asked us what seemed like 20, 000 questions: how old we were, how we met, our plans for the night and so on. I felt confused, nervous and slightly ridiculous in my costume. The officer’s female partner, sitting a few tables away, laughed. She eventually yelled at him to leave us alone. The tension broken, we talked with the three officers for a while. We asked if they knew the best spot if we wanted to try another parade come Thanksgiving. They got a call on their radios and had to rush away. Just when I thought I had survived my first New York Police Department questioning, the woman officer pulled out her notebook and asked for names and phone numbers. My heart skipped a beat. Were we being given a ticket? Detained? For what? She smiled and said they would give us a call if they had any leads on good viewing spots for Thanksgiving morning. We never heard back, and left the Macy’s parade early because of the cold, too.",0

19529,"New Law Now Charging All Protesters With Terrorism, Lawmakers URGING Americans To Share This | Conservative Daily Post","
Posted by Matthew Bernstein | Nov 17, 2016 | American Strength These Protesters Are Going To Be Charged 
The United States is one of the best places to live. You have rights that are given to you from the Constitution, you have the freedom to do what you want (within reason of course), and you have the ability to live in one of the strongest nations in the world. 
At least it is supposed to be like that. Unfortunately there are people called liberals that want to completely destroy everything that the Constitution gives you. They want to take away your free speech because it might offend them. They want to take away your ability to have a gun because they don’t like it. And finally they want to make the country into a globalist area. 
Despite the fact that the United States was founded with the Constitution being the document that gives people power, the liberals have decided that they don’t like that anymore. They are literally doing what they can to destroy any evidence of that. These Two Have Proven That They Don’t Follow The Constitution 
The most prominent example would be the fact that after the election was held, in which Donald Trump was the winner, entitled liberals were so angry that they decided they would go out and protest the results. Yes they were protesting the results of a FAIR election, despite the fact that there was still three million illegal votes cast. 
And what do the Democratic leaders have to say about all of this? They have kept their mouths shut on the entire thing. Despite all summer long of having the liberals and their friends in the media saying that Trump needs to talk to his supporters for their “damages” caused, they haven’t done that either. 
But it isn’t just the fact that the Democratic leaders are staying silent on the whole issue. There have been numerous reports that these protesters are actually getting paid by George Soros in order to create enough of a disturbance that something would get done. What the liberals want to do is stop the transfer of power. 
That way Trump wouldn’t be the person in charge of the entire country. It would still be underneath President Obama. But that is what the liberals want; instead there is a new bill that is coming out that is sure to make liberals everywhere cry. 
A Republican lawmaker has just come up with the perfect solution to make sure that these protesters stop acting like entitled liberals. The bill in question would allow authorities to charge protesters with committing “economic terrorism.” Washington state Senator Doug Ericksen is the one that is responsible for coming up with the bill. 
“I respect the right to protest, but when it endangers people’s lives and property, it goes too far. Fear, intimidation, and vandalism are not a legitimate form of political expression. Those who employ it must be called to account. We are not just going after the people who commit these acts of terrorism. We are going after the people who fund them. Wealthy donors should not feel safe in disrupting middle-class jobs.” People Who Protest Like This Are Going To Get A Rude Wake Up Call 
The proposed bill, which is going to pass through considering that the Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the Presidency, would make protesting a class C felony if they create any sort of “economic disruption” or “jeopardize human life and property.” 
It would also mean that people that have been discovered to be in violation of this would face up to five years in prison, or a $10,000 fine, or both. Not only that, but any group that organizes a protest that is considered disruptive would also be charged with “economic terrorism.” 
That means that these precious snowflakes that think they can get away with causing damage because they’re upset would have to think twice. But the saddest part about this whole thing is the fact that it was forced to be created. That was because the liberals that were protesting have a difficult time being peaceful. 
They honestly think that the best way to go about this whole thing is to make sure that they cause as much damage and destruction as possible. And their defense for it is to say that they have a right to protest. The last time I checked, protesting didn’t involve lighting trashcans on fire or smashing car windshields. That isn’t a protest; that’s a full-blown riot! 
And this is what we have been seeing from the numerous protests that have been going on since the election. There are people doing whatever they can to cause as much damage and destruction as possible. And these people need to learn that they can’t get away with this any longer. 
Of course the other sad part is that a vast majority of these protesters didn’t even vote in the election. They had a prime opportunity to make sure that their voices were heard and they completely ignored that. And now they decided that they want to have their voice heard by causing as much damage as possible . 
But that wasn’t the worst thing that they did. There was a report on CNN that had one of the protesters promising actual DEATH just to make sure that they got what they wanted. Yes these people are so crazy that they want to have people killed just to make sure that they get what they want. It’s people like this that had the bill created in the first place. 
Share this article with your friends and family to show that people that are going to be protesting and causing damage and mayhem where they go are about to get a rude wake up call. A bill is going to be passed, thanks to an all Republican Congress, which is going to make sure that these protesters face justice for causing destruction. 
This is just a way to ensure that we are stronger as a country under Trump. The past eight years have taught children that it is okay to be whiny and complain about everything. That time has past. We no longer have to accept the Band-Aid generation that was seen underneath Obama. This is just the first step into making this country stronger and it is going to continue. We WILL Make America Great Again! ",0
19530,"Poor, Displaced and Anxious in North Carolina as Floods Climb After Hurricane - The New York Times","KINSTON, N. C.  —   At a community college turned hurricane shelter, Frednesa Pope, 37, wondered on Wednesday if the floodwaters from Hurricane Matthew, which are expected to crest here on Friday, would force her and her family out of an apartment they could barely afford. This week, Gregory   58, who lives on a fixed income and was taking shelter from the flooding in Fair Bluff, N. C. to the southwest, knew that the truck he had just bought was flooded. And over the weekend, Ethel and Austin Chavis of Lumberton, N. C. ripped the carpets out of their flooded home and wondered how much it would cost to make things right again and where they would find the money. “We’ve got to find some assistance,” Ms. Chavis, 66, said as she looked at the floorboards buckling around her, “because we definitely need it. ” Hurricane Matthew spawned ferocious wind and rain across North Carolina, dumping more than a foot of water in parts of the state and touching off a creeping disaster that had killed 22 people in the state by Thursday. Day after day, in town after town, swollen rivers have transformed thoroughfares into canals and homes into sodden islands, in some cases with only the roof or the windows peeking above the water. And the water has risen in some of the state’s poorest areas, upending the lives of many already living on the financial edge. “The poorest of the poor in North Carolina are the ones who are being hurt the most by these floods,” Gov. Pat McCrory said at an otherwise upbeat news conference on Thursday. “These people have nothing,” he added, urging people to donate to a state disaster fund. By Thursday, $2. 6 million in aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency had been disbursed and 14, 000 people had applied for aid. Individual assistance from FEMA, which has averaged about $2, 000 a family in recent years, is designed to help with immediate needs  —   like temporary rental housing, repairs not covered by insurance, and the replacement of critical personal items  —   but those grants are somewhat limited. “It’s not designed to make survivors whole again,” said Rafael Lemaitre, a spokesman for the agency. “It’s more of a life vest, rather than a lifeboat. ” Mr. McCrory’s administration said that disaster unemployment assistance, which can cover wages lost because of a storm, would be available in 20 counties. But even when state and federal officials work to disburse flood aid, experts said, it is often harder for families living on the margins to bounce back. The Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina estimated that 356, 000 people in the 21 counties it was monitoring for storm and flood effects did not have access to enough healthy food, even before the floods. Floodwaters have left downtown Lumberton, a city where a third of residents live in poverty, underwater. They crested at more than a foot above the record on Tuesday in Goldsboro, N. C. where the poverty rate is 25 percent. And in Kinston, residents waited in shelters for the Neuse River to crest on Friday. “Sometimes, you just have to think that God is piling on with these storms,” said Gene Nichol, a law professor at the University of North Carolina who researches poverty. Poverty in the region, he said, goes back to the time of slavery, but he added that the state’s   Legislature had further eroded the social safety net by winnowing unemployment benefits, cutting the state’s   tax credit and largely refusing to expand Medicaid. “There are challenging legacies,” Professor Nichol said. “The want of investment and opportunity in eastern North Carolina is made only more difficult by tragedies like this. ” Some natural disasters, like tornadoes, seem genuinely indiscriminate, as likely to damage wealthy neighborhoods as to damage poor ones. But in Kinston, the pain from the floods  —   which were preceded by days of warning  —   seem to a certain extent linked to economics. Those with cars have been able to take their valuables, or even their furniture, and leave town for hotel rooms or to stay with family. Those who earn more are more likely to have paid time off, and to have savings to cushion the financial blow from a storm. And floods often play out in   areas where the residents are disproportionately poor. The shelter here at Lenoir Community College, which by Thursday had become a temporary home for about 200 people, was full of residents with no money to spare  —   even among those working full time  —   and a sense of dread as the water rose. Ms. Pope, a cabinet sprayer in a local plant, evacuated her home in Kinston this week when fire officials told her it was almost certain to flood when the river crested. “I put my clothes up as high as I could,” she said. “I don’t have a car I wasn’t able to get a   like everyone else in the neighborhood. I live from paycheck to paycheck. ” Ms. Pope’s apartment had flooded during the devastation from Hurricane Floyd in 1999, and her landlord had told her it was unlikely to withstand a second event that forecasters said could be even worse. “I’ll have to start all the way back over,” said Ms. Pope, who already pays her $400 rent in two installments so she can pay the bills in the middle of the month. “Everything in there, it’s paid for. If it floods, I’m through. ” Wesley Turner, 71, a Vietnam veteran who retired from a rubber stopper plant in town, said his home seemed close to flooding even before the river’s crest. “I worked for years and years to make money for a   which I thought would be home for the rest of my life,” Mr. Turner said. “I can’t afford another trailer. I can’t afford a pup tent. ” Inside the shelter, LaVonda Hamilton, 42, was wondering whether she would need to take on a     loan to make ends meet. She had been unable to get to her job as an account specialist at an outsourcing firm near the coast for a week. “I have two kids, you know, in high school,” Ms. Hamilton said. “It sets you back. ” And in Lumberton, where floodwaters were just beginning to recede, Billie Thompson, 36, returned to her home to take stock of what she had lost  —   “It’s in a shamble right now,” she said  —   and scrambled to get to her job at the Butterball factory for the first time since last week. A single mother, Ms. Thompson tried to figure out how to replace ruined items, like school clothes that she bought in August for her daughter. “My daughter has started planning a birthday party next month I might have to cancel that,” Ms. Thompson said, adding, “She needs clothes more than she needs the party. ”",0
19532,Police warn of eviction 'at any time' as Dakota Access protesters refuse to leave private land,"Police warn of eviction 'at any time' as Dakota Access protesters refuse... Police warn of eviction 'at any time' as Dakota Access protesters refuse to leave private land By 0 101 
Despite officers threatening to clear private land, Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) protesters are refusing to leave. As tensions have built up, police handling of the protest has reportedly cost nearly $6 million in just one month. 
“We have the resources. We could go down there at any time and we are trying everything we can to not have to do that,” Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney told reporters on Wednesday. 
Protesters have been occupying private land known as Cannonball Ranch, which belongs to the Dakota Access Pipeline’s developer, the Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners. 
Since the weekend, both the company and law enforcement have been asking dozens of protesters to leave the area and move to public land. The occupation began Sunday, when demonstrators set up a new camp of at least 15 tents and 100 teepees. They have also blocked State Highway 1806, putting themselves directly in the path of the planned 1,172-mile pipeline, which will span four states. 
“Just come off the private property, go back to the big camp and let’s talk and try figure out the solution for this. Their message was absolutely not, we are standing here,” Laney said, adding that “at some point rule of law has to be enforced.” 
Energy Transfer Partners also said in a statement that “all trespassers will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and removed from the land.” More than 125 people were arrested over the weekend, but the message had no effect on the protest. 
Demonstrators have refused to vacate the land or leave State Highway 1806, keeping traffic and local residents from using the road. Dozens of protesters formed a human blockade, enforced with horses and hay bales. 
“No surrender, no retreat!” protest organizer Mekasi Camp-Horinek, of Oklahoma, reportedly yelled to the people as he left negotiations. 
“We’ve got to make our bodies a living sacrifice,” John Perko, a protester from South Dakota told The Bismarck Tribune. “This is the most honorable thing I could be doing right now.” 
Last week, the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which has been leading the protest since August, agreed to provide its land to relocate the unauthorized camp from the US Army Corps of Engineers property for the winter. 
As police try to abstain from using force, even the peaceful handling of the protests appears to be draining the budget at high speeds. 
According to the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services, authorities have spent $5.8 million since early September. This is nearly all of the $6 million the state borrowed from the Bank of North Dakota in emergency funds to deal with the protest against the $3.78 billion pipeline. 
Meanwhile, an investigation into a September 3 confrontation between protesters and private security guards has revealed license violations. It says that officers who deployed dogs on protesters were not properly licensed and could face criminal charges.

19534,Uber Under Criminal Investigation for Law Enforcement-Evading Software - Breitbart,"Uber is currently under criminal investigation over the company’s “Greyball” software, which allegedly allowed them to hide cars from regulators and law enforcement. [“Uber used the software tool to hide cars from regulators who were attempting to conduct sting operations on drivers in areas the company was not yet licensed to operate, such as Portland, Oregon,” reported The Verge. “The company claims it was developed as a way to cut down on fraud and protect drivers from violent taxi union protestors, and it claimed at the time that it still uses Greyball primarily for this purpose. ”  “The program worked by identifying suspicious users either based on credit card information, location, or the type of device being used to access the Uber app,” they explained. “The company went so far as to check credit card data against popular credit unions used by law enforcement and mining public social media data to determine the suspected person’s employment. Once a user was ‘Greyballed,’ so to speak, Uber would show a different version of the its app with fake cars that would not respond to call requests. ” The software was first revealed by The New York Times in March, prompting the investigation. In April, The New York Times also reported that Uber was nearly kicked off of the Apple App Store after they were caught breaking privacy rules. “For months, [Uber CEO Travis] Kalanick had pulled a fast one on Apple by directing his employees to help camouflage the   app from Apple’s engineers,” reported The Times. “The reason? So Apple would not find out that Uber had been secretly identifying and tagging iPhones even after its app had been deleted and the devices erased  —   a fraud detection maneuver that violated Apple’s privacy guidelines. ” The article painted Kalanick as a serial   who would frequently push the lines in an effort to advance his company. “In a quest to build Uber into the world’s dominant   entity, Mr. Kalanick has openly disregarded many rules and norms, backing down only when caught or cornered,” The New York Times claimed. “He has flouted transportation and safety regulations, bucked against entrenched competitors and capitalized on legal loopholes and gray areas to gain a business advantage. In the process, Mr. Kalanick has helped create a new transportation industry, with Uber spreading to more than 70 countries and gaining a valuation of nearly $70 billion, and its business continues to grow. ” Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

19535,"‘Space Wars are Likely in the Future’ as US, Russia Developing Satellite Weapons","Russia has long opposed the militarization of space. If the United States keeps ignoring Moscow’s calls on the issue the risk of a military confrontation in space could significantly increase. Recently, the Russian space agency Roscosmos kicked off tenders for three GLONASS satellites to be launched in 2017-2018. The company is expected to spend over one billion rubles ($16 million) on the program.
The first launch is scheduled for December 25, 2017, the other two – for November 25, 2018. The satellite will be carried by a Soyuz-2.1b rocket from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome spaceport.
In February and May 2016, two Glonass-M satellites were added to the GLONASS system. Currently, the system involves 27 satellites, 23 of which are in operation, two are put in orbital reserve, one is undergoing flight tests, and the last is undergoing maintenance.
In the event of a military conflict, communication satellites would be an important target, military expert and observer Viktor Baranets said.
“The current situation in space is that no satellites are protected, no matter at what orbits they are. The reason is that alongside with development of space systems, the US is running on all cylinders developing space weapons,” Baranets told Radio Sputnik.

Moreover, China already joined the game, with an anti-satellite missile test in 2007.
“Russia has its own plans too. I think that if Washington keeps ignoring Russia’s calls for the demilitarization of space, the so-called ‘combat cosmonautics’ would become reality,” Baranets pointed out.
His words were echoed by Russian defense expert Vasily Kashin. In an interview with Sputnik China, Kashin said that modern satellites are almost devoid of any opportunity to protect themselves from the impact of interceptor missiles.
In 2008, the Russian and Chinese governments proposed an international agreement to prevent the deployment of weapons in outer space but the US government under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama has consistently rejected launching negotiations to conclude such a treaty.
Before Barack Obama became president, during his presidential campaign, he called for talks with Russia on anti-satellite weapons which started back in the 1970s but then was terminated by Washington. However, no progress has been made on the issue.
Baranets said it could not be ruled out that in the future space might be militarized which would pose a threat to the entire world.
“Mankind will have to decide whether to militarize space or not. There are very difficult negotiations in process. Moreover, the US wants to pass a bill to declare certain orbits exclusively American,” Baranets said.
According to him, the defense industries of both Russia and the US are working to develope space combat systems. If the process is not stopped “space wars may be possible.”
The expert stressed that the 1967 Outer Space Treaty between the US, the USSR and Britain should be revised. The document represents the legal framework of international space law, including prohibition of weapons of mass destruction in orbit.
“The treaty should be revised as soon as possible. This will prevent militarization of space. Now, space is becoming a place for effective strikes against the enemy,” the expert concluded.
In turn, Kashin assumed that anti-satellite weaponry is a new reality that should be considered while planning a possible military operation.
In this new reality, Russia, China, the US, as well as India and Iran will most likely possess domestically-made sophisticated anti-satellite weapons, according to him.

19536,Report: Ex-Baylor President Ken Starr Looking for Spot in Trump Administration - Breitbart,"Ken Starr, who until just last year was president of Baylor University, is looking to land in the Trump administration, according to reports. [A report now says that Starr is in the running for a job at the Department of State as an    for international religious freedom, according to Foreign Policy magazine.  Indeed, the magazine found a source that said the job is Starr’s “if he wants it. ” Starr lost his job at Baylor last year amid an investigation into sexual abuse charges against several of the school’s football players. As the sex charges grew, Starr eventually resigned his position leading the college. According to a school newspaper report on Starr’s resignation, Baylor removed Starr because he refused to act on several reported rapes going back as far as 2009, a year before he even assumed office. Of course, Ken Starr most famously headed up the independent investigation into President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Starr investigated the death of Clinton operative Vince Foster, looked into the Clintons’ shady investment dealings, and led the inquiry into Bill Clinton’s sexual harassment of White House aide Monica Lewinsky. Starr’s investigations eventually led to Bill Clinton’s impeachment in the House of Representatives. The Senate did not convict Clinton, and he was able to complete his presidency.

19537,Officials Release Sketch of Possible Witness in Queens Jogger’s Killing - The New York Times,"Four weeks after a woman was strangled while on an evening jog through a stretch of wetlands near her home in Queens, the police released a sketch on Wednesday of a man who had been seen in the area and might be a witness with information about the killing. Police officials said the man was not considered a suspect, or even a person of interest, in the Aug. 2 killing of the jogger, Karina Vetrano, 30. Investigators said they were hoping to question him in the hopes that he could help them find the killer. “We want to speak with this person because we feel he was there,” Robert K. Boyce, the New York Police Department’s chief of detectives, told reporters. “I’d never want to tell you he’s wanted for this crime, because he’s not. We have no evidence to say that. ” The police said the man had been spotted by a utility worker on a path running by the Belt Parkway, which is on the northern end of Spring Creek Park. Ms. Vetrano was found face down in the park, about 15 feet from a trail, by her father and police investigators, hours after she had left her home in the Howard Beach neighborhood to run. The man is believed to be between 35 and 45 and about 5 feet 10 inches tall. He was seen with a beard and wearing a red shirt, dark pants and a wool cap. Investigators have been in possession of the sketch for just over a week, Chief Boyce said, but officials decided to release it after investigators scoured the video evidence collected from the area and found no trace of the man. He said it was unclear if the man depicted had gone from the walkway into East New York, Brooklyn, or Queens. Based on video evidence, investigators do not believe the actual assailant fled the scene into Howard Beach. Instead they think he either went north into Queens or crossed over into Brooklyn. In the weeks since Ms. Vetrano’s killing, investigators have received more than 80 tips all but about nine of them have been vetted, Chief Boyce said. Investigators had also collected DNA evidence from Ms. Vetrano’s phone, which had been discarded in the park, as well as from her neck and under her fingernails all of it had come from the same person, he said. But the DNA evidence did not match with that of offenders whose profiles were in police databases. “We don’t believe this has anything to do with Karina’s background at all,” Chief Boyce said in a separate news conference held on Tuesday. “We still maintain it’s a random attack. There’s nothing to suggest than anyone in her past would do this to her. ” The authorities have put up a $35, 000 reward for information leading to Ms. Vetrano’s killer, and a separate, private effort online has raised more than $267, 000.",0
19538,Donald Trump Says He’s Not Surprised by Meryl Streep’s Golden Globes Speech - The New York Times,"  Donald J. Trump dismissed Meryl Streep as “a Hillary lover” early Monday morning after the actress, in a speech at the Golden Globes award ceremony, denounced him as a bully who disrespected and humiliated others. Mr. Trump, in a brief telephone interview, said he had not seen Ms. Streep’s remarks or other parts of the Globes ceremony, which were broadcast on NBC, but he added that he was “not surprised” that he had come under attack from “liberal movie people. ” [ Read Meryl Streep’s Golden Globes speech ] The Globes were the last   Hollywood event before Mr. Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, a transfer of power that many in the entertainment industry have bemoaned. While   comments at the Globes were relatively restrained, Ms. Streep, one of the most outspoken progressives in the film world, mounted a powerful critique of Mr. Trump’s abilities as a performer, complimenting in a backhanded way a style of showmanship that she all but called insidious. “There was one performance this year that stunned me  —   it sank its hooks in my heart,” Ms. Streep said. “Not because it was good there was nothing good about it. But it was effective and it did its job. It made its intended audience laugh, and show their teeth. “It was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter,” she said, referring to a speech by Mr. Trump in 2015 when he shuddered and flailed his arms, seeming to mock a disabled reporter for The New York Times. “It kind of broke my heart when I saw it, and I still can’t get it out of my head, because it wasn’t in a movie. It was real life. ” Mr. Trump, as he has done many times before, grew heated in the interview as he flatly denied that he had intended to make fun of the Times reporter, Serge F. Kovaleski. “I was never mocking anyone,” Mr. Trump said. “I was calling into question a reporter who had gotten nervous because he had changed his story,” arguing that the reporter had been trying to back away from an article he wrote in September 2001 about the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and elsewhere that month. “People keep saying I intended to mock the reporter’s disability, as if Meryl Streep and others could read my mind, and I did no such thing,” he said in the interview. “And remember, Meryl Streep introduced Hillary Clinton at her convention, and a lot of these people supported Hillary,” Mr. Trump said, referring to Ms. Streep’s remarks at the Democratic National Convention last summer on behalf of his opponent, Mrs. Clinton. Later Monday morning, Mr. Trump, in a series of tweets, called Ms. Streep “one of the most   actresses in Hollywood,” and “a Hillary flunky who lost big. ” He also reiterated his argument that he had not mocked the reporter “but simply showed him ‘groveling. ’” Ms. Streep’s artful denunciation of Mr. Trump  —   whom she never mentioned by name  —   drew applause from many other actors at the Globes ceremony, but also attacks online from the  ’s allies, like Sean Hannity, as well as some Republicans, like Meghan McCain, who are critical of Mr. Trump but see Hollywood liberals as only emboldening his supporters. Ms. Streep’s speech did not seem intended to win people over  —   she spoke dismissively of football and mixed martial arts at one point  —   but rather to voice frustration and anger before Mr. Trump’s inauguration. “This instinct to humiliate, when it’s modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybody’s life, because it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same thing,” she said in her remarks. “Disrespect invites disrespect, violence incites violence. And when the powerful use their position to bully others we all lose. ” Mr. Trump said that, Ms. Streep and her allies aside, he was confident that celebrities and others would turn out in strong numbers for his inauguration. “We are going to have an unbelievable, perhaps   turnout for the inauguration, and there will be plenty of movie and entertainment stars,” Mr. Trump said. “All the dress shops are sold out in Washington. It’s hard to find a great dress for this inauguration. ”",0
19539,Philipp Plein Wants to Blow Your Mind - The New York Times,"On Saturday, two and a half days before his first show in New York, the German designer Philipp Plein sat behind a long table crowded with Starbucks coffee cups, Red Bull cans and Atkins energy bars in a rented office space on Madison Avenue and 55th Street. To his left sat Carine Roitfeld, a former Tom Ford collaborator and former editor of French Vogue, and the creator of CR Fashion Book. To his right was his girlfriend, the Romanian model Andreea Sasu, whom he calls “Poof. ” Members of his inner circle, like the photographer Dylan Don, the publicist Karla Otto, and Mr. Plein’s sister Gloria Dieth, rotated through the chairs behind them over the course of several hours, chatting quietly or observing. Everyone’s attention was on the fit models who stood patiently as Mr. Plein and Ms. Roitfeld debated how to style each of the show’s 80 or so looks. Ms. Roitfeld’s two assistants, the label’s heads of design for men and women, and various others also offered opinions. The stakes, after all, were high. Mr. Plein would have to top the increasingly ostentatious shows he has thrown in Milan since 2011 (with Jet Skis, swimming pools, roller coasters and performers like Snoop Dogg and Rita Ora). The decision to swap cities was part of the brand’s expansion into the United States, a new frontier for the label, which counts Asia and Eastern Europe as its top markets. As part of the push, last year Mr. Plein hired Graziano de Boni, who had previously held   positions at Giorgio Armani and Prada USA, to be his chief executive of North and South America. “I tried to avoid it for a very long time because the American market is very developed and the consumer is very spoiled,” Mr. Plein said. “Markets like Russia and China are much more open to new brands and much easier to enter. They’re hungry to consume. ” But after 18 years in the business and 120 store openings, Mr. Plein decided it was time. ”We didn’t want to lose money,” Mr. Plein said. His company has no investors and he owns it  . “We had to wait until we were a little bit more mature, and I had some gray hair, as you can see, to come here and start this experience. ” Experience is one way to put it. Mr. de Boni began looking for a show venue in August and considered both the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and the Statue of Liberty, but the New York Public Library won out. Next, Mr. Plein recruited Ms. Roitfeld to help him style the show. Their partnership was in some ways an unlikely one: Ms. Roitfeld is the consummate fashion insider, and Mr. Plein considers himself an outsider, in part thanks to the refusal of Milan’s Camera Nazionale della Moda to include him on its official fashion week calendar until 2013. Still, they agreed on the show. Mostly. Ms. Roitfeld was not persuaded about a top, arguing that it looked too much like a dress. “The long sweater is more European,” Mr. Plein countered. “O. K. put it long,” Ms. Roitfeld said. “Can you walk? Maybe it is good. ” The model strode across the room. “That’s lit,” Mr. Plein said. “I learned one word today,” Ms. Roitfeld said, referring to Mr. Plein’s frequent use of “lit,” the slang term for something amazing. “That’s a rapper look,” Mr. Plein said. “Like for Desiigner or something. Have you ever styled Desiigner?” “No,” Ms. Roitfeld answered, seemingly confused by the reference. “‘Panda, Panda, Panda,’ ” Mr. Plein said, chanting the lyrics of the rapper’s hit song. “He’s going to walk the show. It was the song of summer. I wore a panda mask in the club, in Jimmy’z in Monte Carlo. ” Mr. Plein began scrolling through his Instagram account in search of an image to illustrate what he meant. As she waited, Ms. Roitfeld considered the concept, then said: “Next time I go with you and I wear a mask, too. I love a masked ball. ” Before Mr. Plein was able to find the photo  —   he sometimes posts as many as 20 Instagram photos in one day, so there were hundreds to get through  —   the two forgot the topic and returned to the outfit. “I like the long sweater because it’s more new,” Mr. Plein said. “It’s fresh. ” Ms. Roitfeld nodded in agreement, and the model headed off to have the look photographed. Ms. Roitfeld and Mr. Plein continued forth, often requesting that the seamstresses, most of them     women working diligently in a quiet room a few feet away (lryna Velychko, the head seamstress, is from Ukraine and speaks only Italian and Russian) alter one detail or another. Around midday, the rapper Willie Maxwell II, known as Fetty Wap, swept in with his entourage. Fetty Wap will be walking in Monday’s show along with the rappers Young Thug and Desiigner the singer Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy and Jeremy Meeks, the model who was referred to as “the hot felon” after his mug shot, taken after he was arrested on federal weapons charges, went viral in 2014. Their casting is the third crucial component of Mr. Plein’s big New York show, and is in large part the work of Eli Mizrahi, a    man about town who counts the models Sofia Richie and Irina Shayk among his friends. “We want you to look like a king,” Mr. Plein told Fetty Wap. He pulled out a long    fur coat covered with the Philipp Plein logo and skulls. “I call it the   coat. ” As his hit song “Trap Queen” played in the background, Fetty Wap tried on the outfit, took a quick walk to show it off and posed for photos. Before leaving, he made a promise: “I’ll bring my bling bling. ”",0
19540,Top Trump Adviser: UK/U.S. Deal Could Be Ready in ’Six Months’,"Donald Trump expects to be in a position to offer the United Kingdom a free trade deal within the “first six months or the first year” of his administration, says Anthony Scaramucci, the noted entrepreneur and host of the Wall Street Week programme who will serve as the incoming president’s Director of Public Liaison and Intergovernmental Affairs. [Speaking to ITV News, the SkyBridge Capital founder confirmed that the current plan is to “get in the White House and get the president inaugurated and then take the steps necessary to make sure the UK is at the front of the line, as opposed to at the back the line, on trade deals”.  Scaramucci’s reference to “the back of the line” was a call back to outgoing president Barack Obama threatening that the British would be at the back of the queue for a trade deal if they voted to leave the European Union (EU) which does not allow its members to strike trade deals on their own. Obama’s use of the word “queue” which is uncommon in   raised suspicions that he had been fed lines by the   former prime minister, David Cameron, and Scaramucci’s decision to use the more traditional “line” may have been significant. Scaramucci’s positive comments come shortly after the   himself pledged to get a trade deal “done quickly and done properly” after Brexit in an interview with The Times of London, while congratulation the British public on their decision to leave an EU which is “basically a vehicle for Germany“. “We see the unique, special relationship bond and love that these countries and people have for each other,” Scaramucci told ITN, echoing sentiments expressed by Trump himself. “I’m a big fan of the UK” said the Republican leader, reminiscing about his Scottish mother’s pride in the Queen. Asked how he thought the   would get on with the EU in office, Scaramucci was upbeat. “Way better than the EU thinks. I know him very, very well, and I understand exactly what he’s thinking, and I understand his kindness and his gregarious nature and his charm  —   he really wants to get along with the rest of the world. ” Earlier in the week, however, Scaramucci warned attendees of the ongoing Davos conference in Switzerland that “the European leadership and the European elites   …     had better pay much closer attention to the working class families and the middle class”. He also reiterated the  ’s view that European NATO members must start “paying their bills” and refocus their efforts on “radical Islamic terrorism” rather than the former Soviet Union.",0
19541,"Obama Admin Targets Soldiers’ Bonuses, Lets Bad VA Employees Keep Theirs","Obama Admin Targets Soldiers’ Bonuses, Lets Bad VA Employees Keep Theirs Pentagon asks troops to repay bonuses, VA rewards employees after widespread problems Morgan Chalfant | Free Beacon - October 26, 2016 Comments 
The federal government is trying to recoup enlistment bonuses given erroneously to thousands of California soldiers despite routinely allowing poor-performing VA employees to keep their bonus checks. 
The Los Angeles Times reported last week that the Pentagon demanded that thousands of California soldiers repay bonuses they were given to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Defense Department asked the soldiers to repay the bonuses, which amounted to $15,000 or more each, after audits revealed they were overpaid by the California National Guard. 
But the practice stands in contrast with that of the Obama administration’s Department of Veterans Affairs, which has failed to take back hundreds of thousands of dollars paid to high-ranking bureaucrats who have been scrutinized for bad behavior or poor management. 
For instance, the VA said last year it would not collect over $400,000 in bonuses paid to two senior executives who manipulated the agency’s hiring system to take new jobs with less responsibility and receive relocation benefits. The VA, which acknowledged that the employees abused the system, said it did not have the legal authority to recoup the money.",0

In the last few years, many Russian developers and startups have moved to Silicon Valley in the hopes of conquering global markets. But only a select few have had any success. 
Despite the illusion many Russians have that in such a place, in such a productive ecosystem, with so much talent, it will be easier to gain success than in their own country, the reality is much more complicated. Russian entrepreneurs and investors face a particular set of challenges breaking into the market, and perhaps not the ones they would expect. 
“One of the difficulties for Russia’s post-Soviet startups is the culture shock, when they try to use techniques from the old country in new environments and expect the same results,” says Igor Shoifot, founder of the “Happy Farm” business incubator. Read More Related Posts",0
19543,Ancient Quasars Cast Light on Mysteries of the Cosmic Web,"An international collaboration of astronomers, led by a group at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich, Switzerland, has used the unrivalled observing power of MUSE on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) at ESO’s Paranal Observatory to study gas around distant active galaxies, less than two billion years after the Big Bang. These active galaxies, called quasars, contain supermassive black holes in their centers, which consume stars, gas, and other material at an extremely high rate. This, in turn, causes the galaxy center to emit huge amounts of radiation, making quasars the most luminous and active objects in the Universe.
The study involved 19 quasars, selected from among the brightest that are observable with MUSE. Previous studies have shown that around 10% of all quasars examined were surrounded by halos, made from gas known as the intergalactic medium. These halos extend up to 300 000 light-years away from the centres of the quasars.This new study, however, has thrown up a surprise, with the detection of large halos around all 19 quasars observed — far more than the two halos that were expected statistically. The team suspects this is due to the vast increase in the observing power of MUSE over previous similar instruments, but further observations are needed to determine whether this is the case. “It is still too early to say if this is due to our new observational technique or if there is something peculiar about the quasars in our sample. So there is still a lot to learn; we are just at the beginning of a new era of discoveries”, says Elena Borisova, from ETH.
The original goal of the study was to analyse the gaseous components of the Universe on the largest scales; a structure sometimes referred to as the cosmic web, in which quasars form bright nodes. The gaseous components of this web are normally extremely difficult to detect, so the illuminated halos of gas surrounding the quasars deliver an almost unique opportunity to study the gas within this large-scale cosmic structure.
The cosmic web (shown at top of the page) is the structure of the Universe at the largest scale. It is comprised of spindly [filaments]– of primordial material (mostly hydrogen and helium gas) and [dark matter]– which connect galaxies and span the chasms between them. The material in this web can feed along the filaments into galaxies and drive their growth and evolution.
The 19 newly-detected halos also revealed another surprise: they consist of relatively cold intergalactic gas — approximately 10 000 degrees Celsius. This revelation is in strong disagreement with currently accepted models of the structure and formation of galaxies, which suggest that gas in such close proximity to galaxies should have temperatures upwards of a million degrees.
It is the first time that MUSE and its unique observing capabilities have been used for a survey of this kind. The discovery shows the potential of the instrument for observing this type of object [2]. Co-author Sebastiano Cantalupo is very excited about the new instrument and the opportunities it provides: “We have exploited the unique capabilities of MUSE in this study, which will pave the way for future surveys. Combined with a new generation of theoretical and numerical models, this approach will continue to provide a new window on cosmic structure formation and galaxy evolution.”

19544,"Pro-American, Non-PC ESPN Host Sage Steele Removed from NBA Countdown Show in Favor of Michelle Beadle - Breitbart","Remember that time an ESPN employee criticized a player for disrespecting the anthem, while   leftist protesters, and got to keep her job without suffering any professional consequences whatsoever? [Yeah, me neither.  Word came down on Tuesday that ESPN removed Sage Steele from the NBA Countdown show, making Michelle Beadle the   host. Beadle and Steele had split   duties until recently. The move is kind of a shocker, with less than two weeks away from the start of the NBA playoffs, when you would think most networks would be consumed with postseason broadcast preparations, and not making lineup changes to their broadcast teams. However, the move seems much less of a shocker when you consider who Sage Steele is, and who she works for. Steele committed the cardinal sin of daring to challenge the liberal orthodoxy that racism can only come from whites. While speaking at a conference on race in February, Steele said, “The worst racism that I have received [as a biracial woman married to white man] and I mean thousands and thousands over the years, is from black people, who in my mind thought would be the most accepting because there has been that experience. But even as recent as the last couple of weeks, the words that I have had thrown at me I can’t repeat here and it’s 99 percent from people with my skin color. But if a white person said those words to me, what would happen?” And, why had Steele become subject to such insults? Steele spoke out against leftists who delayed flights while protesting President Trump’s executive orders on immigration. She also criticized Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans for kneeling in protest during the national anthem. For those stances, Steele was excoriated on social media. Of course, no one at ESPN would actually say that Steele was taken off her show due to her political beliefs, nor could such a thing be definitively proved from the outside looking in. However, while no one can prove Steele’s political views are the reason for her removal from NBA Countdown, it’s perfectly reasonable to claim that the reaction to her firing has everything to do with her political views. After all, here we have a black woman replaced by a white woman, on a show that covers a league which is overwhelmingly black. And yet, where has the sports media outrage gone? Who is accusing ESPN of racism, for pulling one of the relatively very few black voices in sports broadcasting in exchange for just another white person? Who’s talking about Steele’s ability to understand the culture of the sport which she covers much better than Beadle, because she’s black and can identify with their story? If Steele had established herself as a hardcore lefty, like Jemele Hill and others have, would she be getting that kind of outpouring of sympathy? It’s very reasonable to believe she would. Still, Steele’s time at ESPN isn’t over. She signed a   deal with the company and will likely be put on several new assignments, in addition to her   SportsCenter duties. Nonetheless, like Curt Schilling and Rush Limbaugh before her, Steele has once again shown that if anyone attacks political correctness, or liberal politics, while at ESPN they will pay a very, very steep price.

Amid growing anticipation about whether the John Lewis advert will feature a lovelorn reindeer or a sad robin, people who love cloying corporate sentimentality have been informed about humanity’s other cultural output. Professor Henry Brubaker of the Institute for Studies said: “For many centuries before high street shops started creating 30-second seasonal narratives to sell jumpers, mankind has been telling stories. “These stories were written down in books, which are stored in libraries or on bookshelves. Some of them are pretty good. “Museums are another good starting point for learning about the things humanity has created that do not involve an animated creature breathing on a window and then drawing a heart in the steam. “Fuck it, even Netflix has some good stuff on it.” Mother-of-two Nikki Hollis said: “I actually tried to get the book version of the last John Lewis advert but apparently it doesn’t exist. “I hope the new one is about an otter who falls in love with Rita Ora and they have little half-human festive otter pups.

19548,10 Ways to Resist Right Wing Populism,"10 Ways to Resist Right Wing Populism Stop Analysing and Act! By Paul Mason / medium.com I’m just one journalist covering the meltdown of the neoliberal world and the rapid slide to xenophobia and nationalism, in the UK the USA and parts of Europe. I’ll probably write one more big analysis of Trump and Brexit, but I’m aready sick of reading analysis articles by people who didn’t see this coming. They all boil down to the same thing: neoliberalism is fucked and the elite has no idea what to do faced with right-wing populism because they can’t imagine capitalism without inequality. This is my personal suggestion on what we, the global left, should do. 1. Protest. Young Americans, especially high school students, are on the streets right now. They didnt need to be told what slogans, or to ask permission, or wait for a statement from their leaders. They just went, scrawling placards saying #NotMyPresident. Let’s take that global. 2. Strike. Yes, strike. Trump’s inauguration day is Friday 20 January — a work day. Take it off and block the streets of your town. If you can get to Washington DC get there and block the streets. All across the world people are planning to mark #J20 with street protests and vigils — but we should do more. We should stop work in the first global mass strike against bigotry. 3. Boycott the companies actively supporting Trump. This means pressuring the companies who do business with them. Who takes ads on Fox, or in the British Sun or the New York Post? Boycott them until they stop. The Knights of Labor did this in the 1880s and it worked. 4. Build a new political alliance. The elite’s ideology is fucked. Their party systems are proved useless. Clinton outspent Trump — it didn’t matter. The left needs to up its game to either take control and renovate the progressive and socialist parties, or to rapidly replace them. Liberal centrist politicians need to stop attacking the left and make a strategic alliance with the left — understanding that xenophobic nationalism is the main enemy. 5. Kill neoliberalism. Every think tanker, investment analyst and policy adviser who comes out with bullshit about how the market-led system is best must be told: this is where it leads: to Trump, Brexit and Le Pen. Millions of people are sick of seeing wealth flow upwards and good jobs disappear and they will vote to end globalisation if that’s the only way to end the pain. To save globalisation we need to kill neoliberalism. 6. Design an alternative. Right now the neoliberal elite is in meltdown, because globalisation is on the edge of collapse. We have to plead now with the economists, the expert voices, even the central bankers to help radically reform capitalism in a way that delivers high wages, cheap public services, greater equality and greener growth. 7. Get a different media. Trump won because social media weaponised post-factual content made by the alt-right, and because billionaire owned news channels promoted him — and promoted the ignorance he feeds off. Well there are billions of dollars in Hollywood and Silicon Valley too — and the liberal elite, if they don’t want to see Western democracies ruled by Trump, Farage and Le Pen should put their money where their principles are and start funding a progressive mass media. In the meantime the theatre, literature, internet video channels, and progressive music artists: it’s up to you. Throw open your spaces and turn them into an alternative face-to-face media. 8. Reclaim the term “working class”. No compromise with racism, sexism and xenophobia. The working class is not “white”— it is multicoloured and more than half of it are women. Stop thinking “if only we, the left, could connect with what is positive in the prejudice of the white poor”. Nothing’s positive. If you’re black, Hispanic, gay, trans or female; if you’re an immigrant in what now feels like a hostile territory… you can’t duck the fight that’s coming. The rest of us should stand alongside the victims of Trump’s America, not behind them. 9. Choose one fight and become expert in it. Trump, the British Tories, the far right in Europe — will attack on all fronts. You are just one person so you need to assess your skills and resources and (my suggestion) operate like this: concentrate on one point of resistance chosen by you — but at critical moments, and through consensus, drop everything for the one big thing that matters. Not three points of resistance, and not ten big things that matter. One and one. 10. Take the political battle outside politics. Trump and Brexit have politicised everyday life: the person serving your coffee is a migrant? Trump and Farage politicised it. Don’t duck away from it. Say something to them. Do something every day, every hour that resists racism, proto fascism and misogyny. Don’t tolerate the ideological bullshit spread by the ultra-right in your life.

19549,Tribute to the Last Honorable US Senator: The Story of Paul Wellstone’s Suspected Assassination,"14th Anniversary of His Passing By Joachim Hagopian
On October 25th, 2002 the last great hero of the common people in the US Senate was very likely murdered by agents of the shadow US crime cabal government otherwise known as the Bush-Cheney regime. His wife and daughter and two pilots also died in the air crash. Paul Wellstone’s story deserves to be retold and Americans need to be reminded that criminals in and out of our government still need to be punished for their unindicted crimes. This article was written as both a tribute to an outstanding American patriot and a reexamination of his probable assassination by criminals still on the loose.
Minnesota Democratic Senator Paul Wellstone was a man of integrity who was among the few politicians openly and adamantly opposing the Iraq invasion as well as the creation of the US version of Gestapo-land Security. As a fearless populist leader he’d been a constant thorn in the side ever since then President George H. W. Bush responding to the junior senator’s uncomfortable questions at a reception asked, “Who is this chickenshit?” 
Years later as the only senator up for reelection who voted against the Iraq War when Democrats held just a one seat edge over the Republicans in the Senate (with one independent caucusing with Democrats), his thorny side made him the #1 GOP target . With the Karl Rove led Republican Party just one seat away from gaining Republican control over the US Senate, Wellstone’s death gave his Republican challenger Norm Coleman the 49-49 split and, as the President of the Senate, Cheney’s tie breaking vote would deliver the GOP 50-49 advantage needed to steamroll yet more tax cuts through for the rich, unending bankers’ wars and a never seen before boom for the military-security industrial complex. Again, motive and means tilt heavily towards assassination. The facts make it more than probable.
A month prior to the November 2002 election Vice President Cheney had arranged a meeting with Wellstone, threatening him with grave consequences should he vote against the preplanned Iraq invasion. A few days later speaking to a group of war veterans, Wellstone publicly recalled Cheney’s threatening words :
“If you vote against the war in Iraq, the Bush administration will do whatever is necessary to get you. There will be severe ramifications for you and the state of Minnesota.”
Then just days after that, 11 days prior to the midterm election and a year to the exact day after the deadly anthrax pushed Patriot Act victory , on October 25th Paul Wellstone, his wife and daughter along with three staffers and two pilots all died in an extremely suspicious plane crash.
The FBI was at the crash site within 90 minutes , indicating they’d left their Minneapolis office before the “accident” at about the same time Wellstone’s plane was just taking off that morning, indicating the possibility of pre-knowledge.
“The authors note that it would’ve taken agents at least three hours to reach the swampy and remote crash site. How they got there from the Twin Cities so quickly remains a mystery”.
Additionally, the NTSB as the national agency that normally takes the lead role investigating all US plane crashes suddenly wasn’t. The FBI moved in ahead immediately proclaiming just another bad weather accident. Yet all on the ground witnesses and reports disagree, from pilots landing at the destination airport just two hours prior to the Wellstone flight to the airport manager who less than an hour after the crash was himself flying over the crash site. The plane considered a Rolls Royce among small planes was in tiptop shape and the two pilots steeped in skilled experience.
As the feds’ rogue cops for go-to cover-ups, as in 9/11 and the anthrax attacks the year before, and the 1993 World Trade Center and 1995 Oklahoma City bombing s, the FBI has a long shady history of leaving its corrupt dirty fingerprints all over these well documented false flag, history changing events.
A couple of brave Democratic House members anonymously stated that they believe Wellstone was murdered. In one Congressman’s words :
I don’t think there’s anyone on the Hill who doesn’t suspect it. It’s too convenient, too coincidental, too damned obvious. My guess is that some of the less courageous members of the party are thinking about becoming Republicans right now.
An unnamed CIA source admitted :
Having played ball (and still playing in some respects) with this current crop of reinvigorated old white men, these clowns are nobody to screw around with. There will be a few more strategic accidents. You can be certain of that.
A number of other Democratic politicians at a 2 to 1 margin to Republicans have also incurred mysterious deaths holding “unpopular” views just ahead of hotly contested elections. Two years earlier while traveling in Colombia Senator Wellstone had already experienced one known attempt on his life when a bomb planted enroute from the airport was discovered. Since that plot failed, he was then sprayed with the highly toxic poison glyphosate.
As a longtime critic of the CIA and covert operations, Wellstone was targeted for assassination in both Colombia and in Minnesota by the masters of mayhem, murder and deceitful cover-ups – the FBI/CIA Criminals-In-Action at the behest of mastermind Cheney.
So far in our two-tiered justice system, murder pays off for those high up on the psychopath food chain like Cheney, the Bushes and Clintons . Renowned investigative reporter Seymour Hersh exposed Cheney’s “executive assassination ring.” Cheney used the CIA as well as the military Joint Special Operations Command as his personal army of hitmen reporting directly to him. (see video below)

If the neocons can live with themselves for murdering 3000 Americans on 9/11, they certainly never lose sleep over a few more targeted eliminations that include the genocidal 4 million Muslim bloodbath caused by the Bush crime family wars.
The heavy-handed Bush-Cheney push for Iraq War and a DHS congressional vote prior to their 2003 invasion cast enormous high stakes in the Senate. Then add the known history of contempt from former CIA director Bush, the Cheney threat just days prior to Wellstone’s death, a slew of brazenly contradictory crash site anomalies , and the exposed murderous means used to pass the Patriot Act and the 9/11 false flag tragedy the year prior, all of this circumstantial evidence taken together strongly points to yet more diabolical skullduggery perpetrated by Skull & Bones criminals against humanity.
The neocons grabbed the Hegelian solution they needed for waging unlimited war in the name of terrorism anywhere in the world while simultaneously at home merging FEMA into their newly created Homeland Security tasked with stripping away the rest of America’s constitutional liberties in the name of “national security.” In its first dozen years alone, deep state’s gluttonously monolithic DHS cancer has metastasized into the third largest federal department boasting near a quarter million fulltime employees. By hook, crook and murder the Cheney-Bush gang in 2003 got what they’d been wanting and plotting for years, two concurrent never-ending wars in the Middle East and the monstrous apparatus Homeland Security whose purpose is making war against the American people. Sadly the rest of the Western vassal nations play follow the leader.
If examined according to the Hegelian Dialectic of 1) problem, 2) reaction and 3) solution, a draconian formula used by deep state to manufacture increased authoritarian control over the US populace, Paul Wellstone’s death can easily be explained.
More than any other single member of Congress, the Minnesota senator posed a serious threat as the major opposition leader standing in the way of war criminals Bush and Cheney’s Iraq invasion as well as their formation of the Department of Homeland Security, two preplanned agendas rooted in the neocon think tank the Project for a New American Century (PNAC). Prior to their stealing the 2000 election and their PNAC’s “Pearl Harbor” event they created called 9/11, their regime had already called for attacking Iraq for regime change and erection of the DHS cancer. The Bush-Cheney reaction to their problem Paul Wellstone was to assassinate him making it appear as an accident.
By murder once Wellstone was out of the way, the neocons’ solution sent a loud and clear message of intimidation and a death threat in order to effectively silence any other potential Congressional opponents to the war in Iraq. Wellstone’s elimination paved the way for the war criminals’ successful campaign to win national support for the March 2003 US invasion of Iraq. That said, the month before the invasion on February 15th, 10-15 million people around the world in over 600 cities assembled in massive protest against the US intervention, the biggest one day antiwar demonstration in history. But unfortunately once the US military occupation began, the antiwar movement gradually fizzled out.
And the PNAC (members of PNAC project, image left) calling for regime change in seven sovereign nations including Iraq within five years was underway. The predatory rape and pillaging of Iraq as the world’s second largest oil producer was justified by lies of Saddam’s non-existent WMD’s and ties to terrorism. Sadly the neocons who are still at the helm wreaking havoc in 2016 were able to implement an enormous new Department of Homeland Security monstrosity masquerading as public “safeguard” against terrorism. So without Wellstone and virtually no further opposition in Congress, the neocons created their multibillion dollar security state apparatchik promoting and enforcing draconian counterterrorism laws leading to increasing centralized authoritarian government control that is ushering in their New World Order.
This tried and true Hegelian strategy has also been regularly utilized to further identify deep state obstacles as problems based on perceived neocons’ threats to US global unipolar hegemony.
American Empire’s relentless efforts to isolate, weaken and target for global war designated international enemies Russia, China and Iran through propagandized demonization and orchestrating fake crises illustrate yet more examples of the Hegelian Dialectic in action. And just as the US crime cabal was successful in eliminating Wellstone as their New World Order threat, for decades the crime cabal government has been planning its war against identified American dissenters as enemies of the state who object to its heavy-handed tyranny.
Paul Wellstone’s courageous opposition to the powerful Washington establishment’s evil cost him and his family’s life. Since we Americans are now in the same crosshairs of the same still entrenched shadow assassins, it’s time to make their arrests for treason and mass murder prior to our own death and destruction.

19552,"Not Just Hillary, Entire Obama Administration Exposed for Using Private Email to Avoid FOIA Requests","Home / Be The Change / Government Corruption / Not Just Hillary, Entire Obama Administration Exposed for Using Private Email to Avoid FOIA Requests Not Just Hillary, Entire Obama Administration Exposed for Using Private Email to Avoid FOIA Requests Jack Burns November 1, 2016 Leave a comment 
Wikileaks is helping President Obama keep his 2008 campaign promise — to be the most transparent administration in U.S. history — whether he likes it or not. And, once again, we’re learning more about the inner sanctum of the administration and its communication practices. As FBI Director James Comey announced Friday, a new investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email scandal has been launched, just days before the presidential election. Comey’s move drew fire instantly from the Democrats who claim Comey is attempting to sway the election in Donald Trump’s favor. While many are focused on Comey’s actions and renewed investigation, Wikileaks has uncovered what may prove to be a systemic problem of executive branch accountability not merely limited to the former secretary of state’s emails. 
According to former State Department official Tom Nides, in a 2015 email to John Podesta (Clinton campaign manager), everyone in Obama’s cabinet and every White House staffer uses their personal email for government business. Nides should know as he worked under Hillary Clinton in the State Department from 2011 to 2013, according to one source . 
While keeping email hidden from the public may seem like no big deal to folks who simply don’t care, ALL correspondence which is related to governmental business is the property of the federal government and is supposed to be accessible by anyone wishing to inquire within the archive of records. 
The Federal Records Act defines a record as anything, “regardless of whether it exists in physical, digital, or electronic form, is a record as defined in subsection (a) shall be binding on all Federal agencies.” This includes all communication of state agents (like the POTUS) who work in the executive branch of government, as well. 
But the Obama administration, according to Nides, has long since avoided the Federal Records Act by using private Gmail accounts. Nides wrote Podesta and said, “There is only one thing that needs to be done on this email thing. (Which I am sure nobody wants to do). Get a state dept career lawyer to go through all the emails and pull the official ones.” That admission seems to be on the level with what is expected for compliance with the Federal Records Act. But it was Nides’ next admission which is the talk of many major media outlets. 
Nides wrote, “Btw you know as well as I every god damn cabinet officer and WH staff uses their [sic] gmail account!” The former Department of State employee revealed what many already suspected. The Obama administration is anything but transparent. Just ask Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch. His organization routinely sues the Obama administration in federal court using the Freedom of Information Act as warrant for inquiry, and says the administration stonewalls his efforts at every turn. Fitton’s organization gave the Obama administration a failing grade on transparency and says his administration is even less transparent than when Bush was president. 
Fitton wrote in 2015 , “There are about 18 lawsuits, 10 of which are active in federal court, and about 160 Judicial Watch FOIA requests that could be affected by Mrs. Clinton and her staff’s use of secret email accounts to conduct official government business. In our various FOIA lawsuits, our lawyers have informed attorneys for the Obama administration that Hillary Clinton’s account and any other secret accounts used by State employees should be secured, recovered and searched.” JW actively seeks out those files through official methods, using FOIA and the Federal Records Act, but has been met with delay after delay from FOIA requests to the Obama administration. 
While the Obama administration is on its way out, groups like Judicial Watch aren’t going anywhere, and presumably have all the time in the world to FOIA their way into digging up those deleted Clinton emails, as well as securing Gmail accounts from the Obama administration cabinet and staffers. This story is definitely a long way from being over. 
It’s no wonder why so many free thinkers are now questioning the story lines they’re being told. With the president and all his men (and women), hiding their communications within their Gmail accounts, the truth is never going to be told, at least not the real truth. And by the time organizations like Judicial Watch are successful in obtaining the electronic communications records that rightly belong to the people, it will be way too late to hold anyone accountable for breaking both the Federal Records Act and the Freedom of Information Act. Julian Assange, we salute you. Thank you for forcing the Obama administration to be transparent. Keep up the valiant work! Share",0
19553,"The Libertarian Party Just Gave Up On Winning, Tacitly Endorsed Hillary Over Trump","Comments 
The Libertarian vice-presidential nominee, Bill Weld, has accepted that his ticket’s longshot bid for the presidency is doomed, and indirectly demanded that voters give their votes to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton instead. He will remain on the ticket but will solely work towards stopping Trump for the remainder of the election cycle. 
The Libertarian ticket, usually popular with a small margin of voters with a particularly poor understanding of basic economics and the Constitution, were looking like they were going to put up a surprisingly strong performance as Republican nominee Donald Trump dragged the GOP brand into the mud, until a series of inexcusable gaffes by presidential nominee Gary Johnson destroyed what little credibility they had. 
In a statement today, Weld roundly tore into Trump for his unfitness to command and his moral deficiencies . 
“I would like to address myself to all those in the electorate who remain torn between two so-called major party candidates whom they cannot enthusiastically support. I’m speaking particularly to those Republicans who feel that our President should exhibit commonly accepted standards of decency and discipline. 
Mr. Trump has some charisma and panache, and intellectual quickness. These qualities can be entertaining. Yet more than charisma, more even than intellectual ability, is required of a serious candidate for this country’s highest office. A serious candidate for the Presidency of the United States must be stable, and Donald Trump is not stable. 
“Throughout this campaign, Mr. Trump has demonstrated an inability to handle criticism or blame well. His first instinct is to lash out at others. When challenged, he often responds as a child might. He makes a sour face, he calls people by insulting names, he waves his arms, he impatiently interrupts. Most families would not allow their children to remain at the dinner table if they behaved as Mr. Trump does. He has not exhibited the self-control, the discipline, or the emotional depth necessary to function credibly as a President of the United States. 
“From the beginning of his campaign, Mr. Trump has conjured up enemies. First it was eleven million criminals in our midst, all bent on obtaining the benefits of citizenship, at our expense. Over time, the enemies became any trading partner of the United States. He says they are nothing but foreigners seeking to threaten our livelihoods. Now we have reached the point where his idea of America’s enemies includes almost anyone who talks or looks different from him. The goal of the Trump campaign, from the outset, has been to stir up envy, resentment, and group hatred. 
This is the worst of American politics. I fear for our cohesion as a nation, and for our place in the world, if this man who is unwilling to say he will abide by the result of our national election becomes our President. This is not the time to cast a jocular or feel-good vote for a man whom you may have briefly found entertaining. Donald Trump should not, cannot, and must not be elected President of the United States.” He’s absolutely right. While the inclusion of more political parties into our stagnant two-party system can only be healthy for our democracy, unfortunately this is not the right moment. Donald Trump is a clear and present danger to our nation as we know it, and stopping him must be our number one priority. This is not the time to throw away a vote on the Libertarian Party.",0
19554,Democratic Panic,"The renewed criminal investigation into Hillary's misdeeds -- and how it could affect the election. November 1, 2016 Matthew Vadum 
Democrats are in panic mode a week out from Election Day as they try to spin away the FBI’s newly announced discovery of a hoard of two-thirds of a million potentially sensitive emails apparently related to Hillary Clinton’s catastrophic tenure as America’s top diplomat. 
Partisan hack James Carville is spewing wild conspiracy theories. 
I think it is an outrage and I think the fact that the KGB is involved in this election is an outrage and I think the American people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for [FBI Director James] Comey. That’s what I think. 
He added, “this is in effect an attempt to hijack an election. It ought to be called for what it is.” 
Just this past July, Comey was praised by Democrats far and wide for his wisdom in opting not to pursue Clinton. There is evidence federal officials tried to hinder various investigations of Clinton and the endlessly corrupt Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, which functions as a bribe processing center for would-be president Hillary Clinton. 
But Democrats have suddenly flipped sides, denouncing Comey as an enemy of the republic now that he has opened an investigation into the newly discovered emails. 
Carville, long known as the “Ragin’ Cajun,” is apoplectic because he thinks these emails could change the dynamics of the election. 
The old Clinton hand may be right. 
Investigators found 650,000 emails on a laptop computer they believe was used at home by disgraced former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D) and his wife, longtime senior Hillary aide Huma Abedin. The computer is reportedly the same device serial pervert Weiner used to send sexual messages to an underage girl. 
“Underlying metadata suggests thousands of those messages could have been sent to or from the private server that Mrs. Clinton used while she was secretary of state, according to people familiar with the matter,” reports the Wall Street Journal . Some of the information emailed may have been classified. 
Abedin, who has intergenerational ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, reportedly forwarded sensitive government information to her personal Yahoo email account and may have viewed them on her home laptop. 
Over the objections of Attorney General Loretta Lynch, Comey notified Congress of the information about the previously unknown emails at this late stage in the election cycle because after letting Hillary off the hook this summer he was facing a huge uprising among FBI employees, the overwhelming majority of whom are not unprincipled supplicants to power. 
Lynch is doing her best to make sure the Department of Justice probe goes nowhere. 
Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs Peter J. Kadzik, whom Zero Hedge calls “the best friend” of John Podesta, Hillary’s campaign chairman and former White House chief of staff in Bill Clinton’s administration, is heading up the email probe. 
So the fix is in. 
In any event, the prospect of restoring his good name may also have prompted Comey to act. 
People are upset at Comey because he took the coward’s way out in the email investigation and is viewed as helping the Clinton team and the Obama White House in their efforts to cover up wrongdoing. 
It was back on July 5 Comey announced that despite the massive body of damning evidence accumulating against Clinton he would not recommend charges be brought against the former secretary of state for her use of hacker-friendly homebrew private email servers to conduct official business. Clinton and her aides were “extremely careless” in their handling of classified documents but there was no evidence of criminal intent, he said, even though the relevant national security statute does not require intent. The next day Attorney General Lynch confirmed no charges would be laid against Hillary. Lynch, as everyone now knows, had a clandestine meeting with former President Bill Clinton at a Phoenix airport a week before, at which a corrupt bargain was presumably made. 
This internal rebellion in the investigative agency was serious enough that Comey felt he had to act immediately. 
“I have some sources in the FBI and the former district attorney's,” commentator Larry Kudlow said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “The FBI is in full revolt right now. The FBI has been in full revolt since the decisions made last summer.” 
Ever the Hillary shill, host Chuck Todd corrected Kudlow. 
“Not full revolt,” he said. “There's been a lot. I mean it's--there are agents--Let's not say full revolt.” 
“All right, a semi-full revolt,” said Kudlow. 
Because what I'm getting at is if Comey hadn't said what he said to Congress and the rest of the world, it would have leaked. It would have leaked. That whole building was ready to leak that they had discovered this new source with [Anthony] Weiner and [Huma] Abedin. So, I don't think Comey had much chance here. And I think the FBI is badly divided.” 
Meanwhile, the trickle of bad news for Hillary Clinton has turned into a raging flood in the last few days. 
Clinton has been directly implicated in a nasty false flag operation against the Donald Trump campaign. Top Democrat operatives Robert Creamer and Scott Foval were caught on undercover video describing their involvement in an elaborate criminal conspiracy involving the use of targeted political violence against political opponents. The euphemism employed was “conflict engagement” which means paying leftist agitators, the homeless and the mentally ill, to cause melees at Trump rallies. 
Fomenting violence and physically attacking political opponents was what the fascist Third Reich did, using the Sturmabteilung or S.A., also called brown shirts and storm troopers. 
Longtime Democrat pollster and campaign consultant Doug Schoen, a familiar face on Fox News Channel, announced he could no longer in good conscience support Clinton’s candidacy. 
“I’m deeply concerned that we’ll have a constitutional crisis if she’s elected,” he said Sunday. “If the secretary of state wins, we will have a president under criminal investigation, with [top aide] Huma Abedin under criminal investigation.” 
Republican Donald Trump is closing the gap in national polls of likely voters. 
Clinton’s unfavorability rating in polls now exceeds Trump’s. She’s at 60 percent; he’s at 58 percent. 
Former New York mayor and leading Trump surrogate Rudy Giuliani said over the weekend that enough evidence has surfaced from WikiLeaks and the FBI to indict Clinton for racketeering. Bill Clinton “does the speeches, they put the money in the pocket, she does the favors in the government,” said Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor. “It all links up. Why did they destroy 33,000 emails? Because it shows the link.” 
Influential liberal journalist Ron Fournier threw Hillary under the bus. Mrs. Clinton got “a secret server” to protect what the Washington Post called “the ‘circle of enrichment,’” he said. 
If Hillary Clinton wins next week, media outlets across America will have to hire extra investigative journalists to handle all the corruption exposes that will follow.",0
19555,Get Ready For Civil Unrest: Survey Finds That Most Americans Are Concerned About Election Violence,"Get Ready For Civil Unrest: Survey Finds That Most Americans Are Concerned About Election Violence   
By Michael Snyder 
Could we see violence no matter who wins on November 8th? Let’s hope that it doesn’t happen, but as you will see below, anti-Trump violence is already sweeping the nation. If Trump were to actually win the election, that would likely send the radical left into a violent post-election temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before. Alternatively, there is a tremendous amount of concern on the right that this election could be stolen by Hillary Clinton. And as I showed yesterday, it appears that voting machines in Texas are already switching votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . If Hillary Clinton wins this election under suspicious circumstances, that also may be enough to set off widespread civil unrest all across the country. 
At this moment there is less than two weeks to go until November 8th, and a brand new survey has found that a majority of Americans are concerned “about the possibility of violence” on election day… 
A 51% majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on Election Day; one in five are “very concerned.” Three of four say they have confidence that the United States will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked American democracy for more than 200 years, but just 40% say they are “very confident” about that. 
More than four in 10 of Trump supporters say they won’t recognize the legitimacy of Clinton as president, if she prevails, because they say she wouldn’t have won fair and square. 
But many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of violence. On Wednesday, Donald Trump’s star on the Walk of Fame was smashed into pieces by a man with a sledgehammer and a pick-ax… 
Donald Trump took a lot of hits today, and not just in the Presidential race. With less than two weeks to go before America decides if the ex- Apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over Hillary Clinton, Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was destroyed early Wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pick-ax in what looks to be a Tinseltown first. 
And there were two other instances earlier this year when Donald Trump’s star was also vandalized. One came in January, and the other happened in June … 
This is of course not the first time the GOP candidate’s star has been attacked or defaced since Trump announced his White House bid in summer 2015. The most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at 6801 Hollywood Blvd in late January. In June this summer, a mute sign was painted on Trump’s star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused Trump of promoting and reveling in during the campaign. In both cases, Trump’s star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day. 
We have seen anti-Trump violence on the east coast as well. Earlier this month, someone decided to firebomb the Republican Party headquarters in Orange County, North Carolina. On the building next to the headquarters, someone spray-painted “Nazi Republicans get out of town or else” along with a swastika. 
There have also been other disturbing incidents of anti-Trump violence all over the nation in recent days. A recent Lifezette article put together quite a long list, and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece… 
On Oct. 15 in Bangor, Maine, vandals spray-painted about 20 parked cars outside a Trump rally. Trump supporter Paul Foster, whose van was hit with white paint, told reporters, “Why can’t they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars, all of this, to make their statement?” 
Around Oct. 3, a couple of Trump supporters were assaulted in Zeitgeist, a San Francisco bar, after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for Trump, GotNews reports. “The two Trump supporters were attacked, punched, and chased into the street by ‘some thugs’ that a barmaid called out from the back.” Lilian Kim of ABC 7 Bay Area tweeted a photo of the men, in which one was wearing a Trump T-shirt and the other was wearing a “Blue Lives Matter” shirt. 
On Sept. 28 in El Cajon, California, an angry mob at a Black Lives Matter protest beat 21-year-old Trump supporter Feras Jabro for wearing a “Make America Great Again” baseball cap. The assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app Periscope. 
There is a move to get Trump supporters to wear red on election day, but in many parts of America that might just turn his supporters into easy targets. Let’s certainly hope that we don’t see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating. 
Of course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad, and a Hillary Clinton victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge. 
For example, this week former Congressman Joe Walsh said that he is “grabbing my musket” if Donald Trump loses the election… 
Former Rep. Joe Walsh appeared to call for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. 
Walsh, a former tea party congressman from Illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host, tweeted, “On November 8th, I’m voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, I’m grabbing my musket. You in?” 
And without a doubt, many ordinary Americans are stocking up on guns and ammunition just in case Hillary Clinton is victorious. The following comes from USA Today … 
“Since the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards Hillary Clinton, I’ve been buying a lot more ammunition,” says Rick Darling, 69, an engineer from Harrison Township, in Michigan’s Detroit suburbs. In a follow-up phone interview after being surveyed, the Trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to “declare martial law and take our guns away” after the election. 
Today America is more divided than I have ever seen it before, and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another. 
Ironically, Donald Trump has been working very hard to bring America together. In fact, he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any Republican presidential candidate since 1960 . 
If Hillary Clinton and the Democrats win on November 8th, things will not go well for Hillary Clinton’s political enemies. The Clintons used the power of the White House to go after their enemies the first time around, and Hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then. 
And the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are. This is something that I discussed on national television earlier this month … 
As I write this, it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a Hillary Clinton presidency would be. 
But at this point that appears to be the most likely outcome . 
Out of all the candidates that we could have chosen, the American people are about to put the most evil one by far into the White House. 
Perhaps Donald Trump can still pull off a miracle and we can avoid that fate, but time is rapidly slipping away and November 8th will be here before we know it.",0
19556,Ft. Lauderdale Terrorist Says He Carried Out Attack for Islamic State,"Esteban Santiago Ruiz told the FBI that he carried out an attack on Fort Lauderdale on behalf of the Islamic State ( ) Michael Ferlazzo, an FBI special agent, reportedly testified at the attacker’s bond hearing Tuesday. [Santiago is the New   Iraq war veteran of Puerto Rican descent who killed five people and wounded six others at Fort   International Airport in Florida earlier this month.  Citing public records opened last week, Sunshine State News adds that Santiago converted to Islam and created a “jihadist identity” for himself, assuming the Islamic name Aashiq Hammad, prior to joining the U. S. Army. He reportedly downloaded Islamic terrorist propaganda and recorded Muslim religious music online. However, the Miami Herald, citing unnamed law enforcement sources, reported that despite rumors to the contrary, nothing in Santiago’s social media history suggests he was “an Islamic convert inspired by terrorist organizations. ” On Tuesday, the attacker was ordered held without bond. CNN notes that FBI agency Ferlazzo “did not elaborate on whether Santiago was purporting to be linked to ISIS or simply inspired by the terrorist organization. ” ISIS has not claimed responsibility for the attack. Nevertheless, Ferlazzo revealed that, during the   interview conducted after the attack, Santiago claimed “to be fighting for ISIS and that he’d been in touch with   people via jihadi chat rooms who were planning attacks as well,” reports CNN. Moreover, the “FBI agent confirmed that the 9 mm gun used in the Jan. 6 shooting rampage at Fort   International Airport is the same weapon Anchorage, Alaska, police seized and later returned to    Esteban Santiago last year,” reports CBS News. “The agent also testified that Santiago mentioned after the shooting that he was under government mind control. ” The terrorist has already been charged with using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a violent crime performing a violent act against a person at an airport serving international civil aviation that caused serious bodily injury and killing a person with a firearm. Of the charges, the latter two are punishable by death, while the first charge carries a maximum penalty of life behind bars. Santiago revealed before the attack that he was hearing voices and that the CIA had been controlling his mind, federal authorities and the killer’s brother Bryan Santiago have revealed. Nearly a month prior to the attack, Esteban Santiago specifically confessed to the FBI in Alaska where he was living at the time, that he was suffering from government mind control linked to ISIS videos. The FBI reportedly contacted law enforcement in Anchorage and told them the veteran had been having “terroristic thoughts” and believed he was being influenced by ISIS. Although authorities did take Santiago to a mental facility, he was ultimately released along with his weapon. Santiago has confessed to the mass shooting. “At Tuesday’s hearing, the defense did not argue the prosecution’s assertion that Santiago posed a flight risk, as well as a danger to the community, and said that the defendant was prepared to be detained throughout his trial,” reports CNN. “The judge ruled he be held without bond. His next court appearance is January 30. ”",0

RATHER than relax and play Texas Hold ‘Em with his friends as they had a few cans after a recent night out, hardcore culchie Noel Kennelan desperatley attempted to explain the impenetrable rules of the card game ’25’, which he claims is ‘way better than poker, hi’. 
25, also known as ‘that culchie game’, involves the dealing of 5 cards to each player and the reveal of a trump card, followed by at least 10 minutes of explaining how the 2 of spades can beat the 9 of diamonds if spades were lead with, and diamonds aren’t trump. 
Kennelan, 28, made great efforts to explain to the 6 other men around the table of his Dublin flat the baffling rules of ‘stealing’ and ‘reneging’, but in the end had to concede that the game was too complex and the players were too drunk to fully wrap their heads around it. 
“After the nightclub, back to the house, few cans, the cards come out,” said Kennelan, dealing himself a solemn hand of Patience. 
“The lads all play poker, but 25 is where it’s at. Way more skill, you can win a hand with nothing if you play it right. But the lads just couldn’t get to grips with the fingers”. 
Kennelan later went online to see if there were any culchies in the area who were looking to play 25, and is considering setting up a club or something where they can go and drink Smithwicks and play cards and complain about Dublin.",0
19559,Think Your Obamacare Plan Will Be Like Employer Coverage? Think Again - The New York Times,"When Obamacare was developed, one goal was to allow   Americans to use the new marketplaces to buy the same kind of health insurance they had at their jobs. People could retire early, or quit a corporate job and become a freelancer, and still have the great care and financial protection that come with   plans. But six years into the health law, the reality is that a typical Obamacare plan looks more like Medicaid, only with a high deductible. The typical marketplace plan covers a small number of   doctors and hospitals, and offers fewer frills than employer plans. The recent   exits of many of the national insurers from markets around the country will only heighten the shift. That change in norms may not be all bad. It largely reflects the preferences of Obamacare’s consumers, who are shopping aggressively for the most affordable health insurance they can find. But it is different from how the law’s marketplaces were imagined and described when the legislation was written. The bill said that benefits should be similar to those from employer plans. The law was supposed to help people like   professionals hoping for a change. President Obama infamously promised: “If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor. Period. ” As networks of doctors narrow, that is getting tough for some shoppers. When the first Obamacare plans were released for 2014, many experts and customers were surprised at how many featured very limited numbers of doctors and hospitals. Three years later, and the trend has only intensified. Many of the companies providing   coverage, like UnitedHealth Group, Aetna and Humana, which tended to offer broad networks, have been exiting the markets. Although the local Blue Cross plans largely remain, many are sharply narrowing the networks offered by their exchange plans. The other insurers are either local plans that are often tied to a particular health system or a company that specializes in Medicaid patients. Unlike many employer plans, these policies often do not allow people to go out of network for care if they want the visit to be covered. According to analyses by two consulting firms  —   Avalere Health and McKinsey  —   the number of plans that offer a wide choice of doctors and hospitals is on a steady decline.   of plans were health maintenance organization plans that offer care from only a limited choice of doctors and hospitals this year, according to an analysis from McKinsey’s Center for U. S. Health System Reform. And even plans that offer    benefits were limiting the doctors who would be covered as  . “With recent carrier exits, this trend is only growing,” said Erica Coe, a McKinsey partner. Those changes have been a shock to many   professionals who thought the Obamacare marketplace would match their previous experience from the corporate world. When Chris Foley, 42, left his career in finance to begin one in   comedy and acting, he assumed his health insurance would look like the coverage he’d received while working for big banks. The transition was a challenge. First, he bought a plan through a New York State program before Obamacare that had skimpier coverage and bigger deductibles than his corporate plan. Then, when he signed up for his first Obamacare plan in 2014, he found that his doctor of 15 years wasn’t covered by any of the options. He needed a colonoscopy last year, and had a hard time finding a doctor who was covered. He was surprised when he was asked to pay $450 out of pocket for a prescription drug at the pharmacy. “I was frustrated I was pretty angry about not having good coverage,” said Mr. Foley, who said he briefly considered a return to the corporate world. But over time, he said, he made peace with his skimpier insurance. His premiums were affordable. “I was covered for any kind of disaster or hospital visit or anything like that, and that’s very important,” he said. Insurers say they are shrinking the benefits in response to market pressures. “What’s driving it is the demand from consumers who are paying directly for these plans,” said Jon Kingsdale, who teaches at the Boston University School of Public Health and is a managing director at the Wakely Consulting Group. “When they compete on the exchange head to head with     plans, the     plans are winning. ” Whether the narrower plans that are dominating the Obamacare exchanges are ultimately good or bad for patients’ health is not clear. Many of these plans are new, and there’s not much evidence about whether they do a good job of caring for patients while avoiding   providers, or simply cover so few doctors, particularly specialists, that patients struggle to get necessary care. One recent study, of a narrow network plan in Massachusetts, found that patients who chose it over a more traditional employer plan spent less on health care and were no worse off. There are also longstanding narrow H. M. O. plans, like Kaiser Permanente and the Group Health Cooperative, that have good reputations and happy customers. But those results may not apply broadly. Recent surveys from the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Commonwealth Fund, two health research groups, found that large majorities of customers liked the cheaper plans they bought. Many of those customers are not like Mr. Foley. They didn’t have insurance before. Or their previous coverage, and expectations, were based on their experience with Medicaid.",0

  can thank eight years of Obama rule, which has most certainly lost Hillary Clinton the U.S. election. 


Socialists in America have had their day, all the Marxists and Communists within the Democrat party have torn the country apart. 
Eight long burdensome years of Obama, overspending on socialist pet projects, controlling, politically correct, gays, feminists, transexuals, inhibiting free speech, encouraging global chaos and people have had enough. 
One can only hope that Black Lives Matter is buried under deep concrete never to be seen again, all the SJWs are taken out into the streets and beaten with bats, and the politically correct morons are told to shut the fuck up once and for all. 
The silent Americans seething for eight long years fought back, and to vote for someone like Trump was a breath of fresh air even though in an act of defiance against the whole system of corruption. 
As one maverick to another, there can only be an element of respect given to Trump, who just did not give a fuck, and has in one night buried eight years of hell under Obama, possibly the worst president of the United States ever encountered. 
It has to be said that eight years of blackness has ended, and we can all breathe a breath of fresh air and light, albeit with major uncertainties. 
Under Trump there will be war with China, there will be economic hell, and there will be upheaval but anything is better than more Obama or socialists. 
Trump has just grabbed the world by the pussy. Share on : Tua Pui Poh 
Yes. Finally, America can be GREAT AGAIN under TRUMP who would trump, triumph and fires those unfit to represent the silent majority people in America! I can be proud of America once again all the way from Belgium!",0
19561,Who Won the Debate? Donald Trump Avoids Annihilation - The New York Times,"Donald J. Trump’s campaign appeared to be crumbling as he entered the second presidential debate against Hillary Clinton, with Republicans withdrawing support for his candidacy after the disclosure of a vulgar recording that showed him bragging about sexual assault. Facing a barrage of tough questions, the Republican nominee managed to scrape through, evading questions, fabricating answers and attacking his opponent in deeply personal terms. While expectations for Mr. Trump were low, many commentators and critics thought that he exceeded them and allayed concerns among supporters that his candidacy was finished. Here is a sampling of the   reaction: “He improved, exceeded expectations, decisively won several exchanges. She could have landed a death blow tonight and did not. ” Guy Benson, political editor at the conservative website Townhall _______ “I may not care for Trump, but he beat Hillary tonight fair and square even with Martha Raddatz trying to defeat him. ” Erick Erickson, writer for the conservative blog The Resurgent _______ “Donald Trump knows he won’t be president. He’s now in full       mode  —   a scowling, pouting menace who threatened during a nationally televised debate to throw Hillary Clinton in jail and called her husband the most sexually abusive man in political history. ” Ron Fournier, writer for The Atlantic _______ “In keeping her cool and indicting Trump’s bad behavior and finally provoking him to threaten to put her in jail, she made certain no one not already in Trump’s corner would sign on with him. ” Jennifer Rubin, writer for The Washington Post’s Right Turn blog _______ “All the Republicans who backed away from @realDonaldTrump look really really stupid right now. ” Laura Ingraham, conservative commentator and editor of LifeZette ________ “Trump looks and sounds defeated. Almost incoherent. .. ” Marc Lamont Hill, Morehouse College professor ________ “She had a chance to throw a knockout punch at Donald Trump and instead looked more at times like Glass Joe from Nintendo’s  . I lost count how many times she said to go to her website or whine about the lack of “fact checking” as the debate went on. Trump had her on the ropes several times. ” Jay Caruso, blogger for the conservative website Red State ________ “Trump picked Putin over Pence, explicitly abandoned Aleppo, lied about Iraq again  again,  showed his appalling temperament. ” Ken Gude, senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal group ________ “With references to Lewinsky scandal,   Benghazi, attacking media, Trump likely shored up his base. Hard to see him leaving ticket. ” Perry Bacon Jr. political reporter for NBC News ________ “I’m a Muslim, and I would like to report a crazy man threatening a woman on a stage in Missouri. ” Moustafa Bayoumi, author of “This Muslim American Life” and professor at Brooklyn College, CUNY ________ “Republicans who took heart at his antic,   performance are grasping at a thin, crazy reed that the coming news cycles will snap. ” Rick Wilson, Republican strategist",0

“I fully expected that we were going to get at least five percent of the vote,” said Green Party vice presidential candidate Ajamu Baraka . “I suspect that when push came to shove, particularly in those swing states, people held their nose and voted for the lesser evil.” Nevertheless, it is essential that the Greens continue to put forward “transitional demands that are meant to galvanize people and win concessions from the state, but also that you keep people focused on the fact the real objective is to transform this system, to take power from the capitalist state.” No World War, But Plenty of Domestic Oppression 
“I think the threat of World War Three has receded significantly,” said author, activist and historian Paul Street . However, “I don’t know if I’ll think that of Trump in two years,” he added. “The more immediate dangers seem to be: police statist assaults on undocumented Latino immigrants, a registry of Muslims, and a potential designation of Black Lives Matter and civil rights activists as quasi-terrorists. The other great, existential threat is runaway climate change because Trump has pledged to thoroughly deregulate energy.” Saving Mumia and Others from a Curable Disease 
Activists in the Free Mumia movement plan a rally on December 9, in Philadelphia, to pressure prison officials to treat the political prisoner and thousands of other inmates suffering from hepatitis C. “Healthwise, Mumia is not doing good at all,” said Pam Africa , of Concerned Family and Friends of Mumia Abu Jamal. “He has the appearance of good health, but he’s itching all over” and “his health is declining.” A judge ruled that Pennsylvania prison officials are obligated to treat Abu Jamal, but he used a technicality to avoid ordering that the cure actually be administered. Pam Africa said next month’s rally will also highlight unsafe, blackish water in prisons. At one facility, she said, “young people coming into the prison are losing their hair.” U.S. Election Ran on “Fear” and “Betrayal” 
“It is accurate to say that economic discontent played a part” in Hillary Clinton’s defeat at the polls, said Mumia Abu Jamal . But he thinks other factors were at least as important. “The Trump campaign represented, not just fear, but profound paranoia, and also white revenge for the darkening of America.” However, “if Trumpism represented vengeance, then Clintonism represented betrayal,” because the Democrats failed to stand up on issues vital to their base constituencies. Torture, Anyone? 
Former Kansas Republican congressman Mike Pompeo is likely to be named CIA director in the Trump administration. “He’s a big fan of torture,” said Ray McGovern , a former CIA analyst who now spends most of his time trying to rein in the national security state. McGovern told Paul Jay, of The Real News Network, that Pompeo “visited Guantanamo, he said it was great, and then said, “As far as I can see, those prisoners are gaining weight.’” President Obama must share the blame. “If Obama had the strength of his convictions, he would have gotten rid of the torturers in the CIA,” said McGovern. “He let them stay, and now they’re having a celebration.” Black Agenda Radio on the Progressive Radio Network is hosted by Glen Ford and Nellie Bailey.

19563,Turkey Declares 3-Month State of Emergency - The New York Times,"ANKARA, Turkey  —   Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, declared a   state of emergency on Wednesday that gave the state extra powers to pass laws as the authorities pursue individuals suspected of attempting to topple his government. The declaration followed the firing and suspension of tens thousands of soldiers, educators and civil servants in recent days on suspicion of complicity in the failed coup last week. In a televised address on Wednesday evening, Mr. Erdogan said the extra powers were needed to protect Turkey’s democracy, and he criticized Western nations who have accused his government of overreaching in its efforts to root out opponents. “The aim is to rapidly and effectively take all steps needed to eliminate the threat against democracy, the rule of law and the people’s rights and freedoms,” Mr. Erdogan said. “This measure is in no way against democracy, the law and freedoms,” he added. “On the contrary, it aims to protect and strengthen them. ” The moves come as a response to the revolt over the weekend, when renegade military units captured a number of officials and attacked the Turkish Parliament and other government buildings before encountering resistance from army and police forces, as well as from Turkish citizens. More than 250 people were killed before the rebellion was put down. Some European leaders and human rights groups have criticized the scope of the government’s subsequent purge of state institutions as well as calls by many Turks to reinstitute the death penalty to punish those involved in the coup. “Europe does not have the right to criticize this decision,” Mr. Erdogan said during his address, noting that some European countries had taken extraordinary measures after terrorist attacks within their own borders. Earlier on Wednesday, Mr. Erdogan said in a television interview that he suspected foreign countries might have been involved in the failed coup, although he declined to say which governments may have wanted him out of power. Speaking through an interpreter in an interview with Al Jazeera, Mr. Erdogan also said that there might still be plots against his government. “I don’t think we have come to the end of it yet,” Mr. Erdogan said. According to the Turkish Constitution, the council of ministers, which is led by the president, can declare a state of emergency based on “widespread acts of violence aimed at the destruction of the free democratic order. ” It must be approved by Parliament and allows the ministers to pass decrees that have the force of law, although they can be overruled by Parliament. It does not grant the power to restrict individual freedoms that is provided by martial law. The Turkish authorities have moved rapidly to remove from the state bureaucracy the suspected followers of Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric and rival of Mr. Erdogan whom Turkish officials accuse of orchestrating the coup plot. On Wednesday, two judges on Turkey’s constitutional court were arrested, and the defense ministry fired more than 200 military court judges and prosecutors. Turkey’s   news agency also reported that the Education Ministry was closing 626 private schools under investigation for “crimes against the constitutional order and the running of that order. ” The constitutional court judges were among a group of more than 100 officials from the judiciary who were arrested on Wednesday. About 60, 000 soldiers, police officers, judges and civil servants have been suspended and detained across the country since last weekend, and about 1, 000 members of the military have been accused of connections to the attempted coup. Mr. Erdogan held a national security meeting earlier on Wednesday to discuss what other measures should be taken to rid the Turkish bureaucracy and security forces of those opposed to his government. In the interview with Al Jazeera, Mr. Erdogan dismissed suggestions that he was becoming authoritarian and that Turkish democracy was under any threat. “We will remain within a democratic parliamentary system, we will never step away from it,” he said. The purges of Turkish institutions included  the country’s Education Ministry on Tuesday, when more than 15, 000 of its employees were suspended. On Wednesday, academics were barred from traveling abroad for work in an effort to prevent scholars and university professors accused of participation in the coup plot from fleeing the country, Turkish officials said. Mr. Gulen, who has denied involvement in the attempted coup, is a onetime ally of Mr. Erdogan who lives in   exile in Pennsylvania. He is believed to have inspired a vast network of educational institutions in Turkey, the United States and elsewhere, and is known to have many sympathizers in the police and judiciary in Turkey. Also on Wednesday, the country’s internet watchdog blocked access to the WikiLeaks website after it published thousands of emails linked to the accounts of the governing Justice and Development Party. A government official said the decision was made because the publishing of the emails was a violation of privacy and because the data had been illegally obtained.",0
19564,Donald Trump’s Slip in Polls Has G.O.P. Worried About Congress - The New York Times,"Donald J. Trump’s support has plunged across the   map over the last 10 days, wiping out his political recovery from September and threatening to undo weeks of Republican gains in the battle for control of Congress. For his party, Mr. Trump’s reversal in fortune comes at the worst possible moment: Having muted their criticism of Mr. Trump in hopes that he could at least run competitively through Election Day, Republicans must decide in the next few days, rather than weeks, whether to seek distance from his wobbly campaign. Should Mr. Trump falter badly in his second debate with Hillary Clinton on Sunday in St. Louis, Republican congressional candidates may take it as a cue to flee openly from their nominee, said two senior Republicans involved at high levels of the campaign who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private party strategy. Mr. Trump has already slipped perceptibly in public polls, trailing widely this week in Pennsylvania and by smaller margins in Florida and North Carolina  —   three states he cannot afford to lose. But private polling by both parties shows an even more precipitous drop, especially among independent voters, moderate Republicans and women, according to a dozen strategists from both parties who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the data was confidential. Liesl Hickey, a Republican strategist involved in several House races in swing states, said she was dismayed by a sudden exodus of independent voters in more diverse parts of the country. “They are really starting to pull away from Trump,” said Ms. Hickey, describing his soaring unpopularity with independents as entering “uncharted territory. ” Mr. Trump’s erratic behavior last week after his poor performance in the first debate with Mrs. Clinton  —   attacking a former beauty pageant winner over her weight, and making an issue of the Clintons’ marriage  —   has alarmed a number of Republican senators, including Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. Mr. McConnell expressed concern that Mr. Trump might not have bottomed out yet and could lose even more support among women, according to a Republican official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to recount a private conversation. If the   dip in Mr. Trump’s standing has heightened anxieties among Republican officials and political operatives, a steady if unspectacular performance by his running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, in the   debate on Tuesday failed to quiet their nerves. “Two weeks ago I would have said Republicans would hold control of the Senate, but there’s just so many seats up and nobody is getting separation,” said Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster, referring to the number of the party’s candidates still locked in tight races. “It worries me that we’re this close to Election Day and you’re not seeing that separation, because it makes you wonder what kind of impact the top of the ticket has. ” Other Republicans are holding out hope that Mr. Trump can at least execute what some cheekily call a “ ” strategy: holding Mrs. Clinton to a narrow victory, and sparing other Republican candidates in the process. Jay Bergman, a petroleum executive and Republican donor from Illinois, said his fellow contributors were no longer optimistic that Mr. Trump will win, and they have lowered their sights. “They want the guy to make a credible showing,” he said. “They’re afraid that if Trump really screws up and looks bad, then   there are going to be a lot more votes for Democrats. ” If Mrs. Clinton wins, putting Tim Kaine, as vice president, there to break a tie, Democrats would need four seats to take control of the Senate. Officials in both parties see Republican incumbents in Wisconsin and Illinois as likely to lose, so Democrats would need just two more pickups to capture the majority if they retain the rest of their seats. Republicans worry that Mr. Trump’s difficulties in New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, where Republican incumbents are caught between their own base and moderate voters appalled by the party’s nominee, could hand Democrats those decisive seats. Senator Kelly Ayotte, the Republican up for   in New Hampshire, demonstrated the vise she is in this week when she said at a debate that Mr. Trump would represent a good role model for children, only to recant a few hours later. Sensing new opportunity, Democrats intend to redouble their efforts to tie Republican candidates to Mr. Trump in states and districts with large numbers of   voters and minorities. “I think it’s quite effective in New Hampshire, in suburban Philadelphia and in Nevada,” said Senator Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat. Compounding their difficulties, Republicans are also fending off a challenge to Senator Richard M. Burr in North Carolina, a state Mrs. Clinton is determined to win, and have also become just as worried about Senator Roy Blunt’s prospects in Missouri. Strategists in both parties who have seen internal polling say Mr. Blunt, whose seat initially seemed safe, is now trailing his Democratic challenger, Jason Kander, a deft campaigner who has been helped by Mrs. Clinton’s narrowing deficit in the state. The good news for Senate Republicans, besides Mrs. Clinton’s own unpopularity and Mr. Trump’s history of bouncing back from   wounds, is that Democrats may need to pick up more than just two seats to seize the majority. In Nevada, which has the only   Senate seat being aggressively fought over this year, strategists in both parties say Republicans have an advantage in the race to succeed Harry Reid, the minority leader. Some Republicans doubt the party will take the step of completely abandoning Mr. Trump unless a landslide gap opens in the presidential race. In that event, Democrats intend to appeal to Mrs. Clinton to spend more of her time and money in areas where the party’s congressional candidates are struggling. In the House, where Republicans enjoy a   majority, the party’s strategists still insist that Mr. Trump’s effect has been limited while his poll numbers have fallen since the first debate, he is not yet seen as so much of a drag on the ballot that he could send the party’s other candidates to defeat. House Democrats, however, finished polling 30 battleground districts last week  —   before the fallout from the first presidential debate  —   and concluded that Mr. Trump remained toxic for Republican congressional candidates. Geoff Garin, one of the Democratic pollsters who conducted the survey, said undecided or wavering voters tended to see Republicans as “putting party loyalty ahead of the country by supporting Trump. ” “Candidates’ support for him and unwillingness to stand up to him becomes a black mark,” Mr. Garin said. In a growing list of House races, Democrats are showing ads that link Republican lawmakers directly to Mr. Trump. A commercial in California brands Representative Jeff Denham as “Donald Trump’s man in Washington. ” An ad in Orlando, Fla. describes Representative John L. Mica as having “the same harmful views on women” as Mr. Trump. Kelly Ward, executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said swing voters tended not to distinguish between lawmakers who vocally endorsed Mr. Trump and those who have stayed silent, neither supporting nor actively opposing his candidacy. “They’re trying to live in this mushy middle, and I think that’s where voters will hold them accountable,” Ms. Ward said. “The separation Republicans think they will see from Donald Trump is just defied by history. ” A handful of Republicans have explicitly sought distance from Mr. Trump already. Robert J. Dold, a congressman from Illinois who has said he will not vote for Mr. Trump, began running a commercial this week that shows him switching off a television broadcast featuring clips of Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton. And veteran Republicans have urged Representative Scott Garrett of New Jersey, who is seeking   in a district Mr. Trump is behind in the polls, to portray himself as a check on Mrs. Clinton, though he has not yet done so. Few have gone even as far as Mr. Dold, fearing backlash from Mr. Trump’s ardent supporters  —   and perhaps from Mr. Trump himself, who has repeatedly attacked Republicans who have snubbed him. Indeed, at a   event outside Chicago last month, Mr. Trump noted in a biting aside that Senator Mark S. Kirk of Illinois, a Republican who opposes Mr. Trump, was on track to be defeated, according to Mr. Bergman, who attended the event. If Mr. Trump fails to recover, Republicans still question whether Mrs. Clinton is capable of piling up enough of a victory margin to pull congressional Democrats into office along with her. Mike Shields, president of the Congressional Leadership Fund, a “super PAC” that supports Republican House candidates, said Democrats were unlikely to win races on Mr. Trump’s weakness alone. “We accepted that we had a challenging nominee,” Mr. Shields said. “But in some districts where Trump is either down or has a very low approval rating, they are not able to take advantage of it. ” Mr. Shields added that Democrats have “had to delude themselves that there’s only one presidential candidate running. ”",0
19565,Buy Me Some Peanuts and Wiener Nougat - The New York Times,"What’s that game they’re playing in the park in Finland? It looks an awful lot like baseball. There are nine players in the field. A ball is being hit with a bat, and the batter is running around the bases. Fielders are trying to catch the ball and retire the runner. Three strikes and you’re out. But wait a minute. The pitcher is standing right next to the batter, and throwing the ball straight up in the air. The bases aren’t in the usual places either. And a blast out of the park isn’t a home run  —   it’s a foul ball. That’s because you’re watching the Finnish game of pesapallo. The similarities to baseball are striking  —   but so are the differences. For one thing, it’s a lot easier to hit a vertical pitch, and batters can have a high degree of control over where and how hard they hit the ball. So the duel between the pitcher and the batter, so crucial in baseball, is   in pesapallo. Instead, bat control and fielding are critical, and both are governed by complex strategy. Managers signal plays using   fans that are  . Other things about pesapallo may seem zany to a fan of the American game. Instead of circling a diamond counterclockwise, pesapallo players run the bases in a zigzag path, starting left to get to first base, then cutting across the infield to second on the right, then left again to third. A player who hits a triple gets credit for scoring a run right away, and can remain on third base to try to score another. Pesapallo was invented in 1920, around the time Babe Ruth was revolutionizing American baseball with his home run hitting, and it has since grown in stature to the point where it is often called Finland’s national game. There are men’s and women’s leagues, and there was even a   scandal in the 1990s. People play pesapallo in other countries, too, including Germany, Sweden, Switzerland and (of all places) Australia, and since 1992, a World Cup has been held every few years. But nobody seems able to beat the Finns at their own game: Of the 21 gold medals awarded so far in various men’s and women’s events, Finland has won them all.",0

Erica Garner was a strong supporter of Bernie Sanders during the primary, even appearing in a powerful campaign ad explaining why she believes in the Vermont Senator.
“I’m vey (sic) interested to know exactly what @CoreyCiorciari meant when he said ‘I know we have an Erica Garner problem’ in the #PodestaEmails19,” she continued.
She was referring to a March 17 email from Clinton’s press secretary Nick Merrill, regarding a gun violence editorial that the New York Daily News ran that was supposedly coined by Hillary Clinton.
“I know we have Erica Garner issues but we don’t want to mention Eric at all? I can see her coming after us for leaving him out of the piece,” he said in the email. 
Ultimately, Garner was not included because he was not killed by gun violence.
“I’m glad you had Maya on your team to explain why you won’t be USING my dad in you f—–g gun violence piece… Black woman saved your a–,” Garner added.

It appears as though the Clinton camp’s “Erica Garner problem,” just got a whole lot worse — as we have consistently seen that she is not one to back down. She accused the campaign of hiding out instead of apologizing — in hopes that it will blow over.
“It may, I won’t make it easy,” Garner added. 
She also accused Everytown, an anti-gun organization, of attempting to co-opt the Black Lives Matter movement — but said she won’t share what she knows about it, yet.
“Everytown has been trying to co-opt the BLM movement and turn it into an anti-gun movement for some time. I could spill tea, but not yet,” Garner also tweeted.

19567,Re: John Bolton Warns That Obama May Divide The Land Of Israel At The UN Before The Inauguration,"Michael’s Latest Video John Bolton Warns That Obama May Divide The Land Of Israel At The UN Before The Inauguration   20th, 2016 
Is Barack Obama about to make the most catastrophic decision of his entire presidency? Former UN Ambassador John Bolton is warning that there is “a lot of speculation” over at UN headquarters right now about “resolutions that recognize a Palestinian state or that try and set a boundary for Israel based on the 1967 ceasefire lines”. Of course this would have to happen before the inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20th , because Trump has already made it quite clear that he will not support any UN resolution of such nature. Knowing that Trump is about to take office, advocates of the “two state solution” are putting an immense amount of pressure on Obama to support a UN Security Council resolution that would permanently divide the land of Israel while he is still in the White House, and at this moment we do not know what Barack Obama’s final decision will be. 
Most Americans have no idea that this drama is playing out behind the scenes, but those in the know are very much aware of what is happening. The Wall Street Journal recently published an article entitled “ Obama’s Israel Surprise? ” that discussed the possibility of Obama supporting a UN Security Council resolution that would permanently divide the land of Israel, and the New York Times editorial board has formally endorsed such a resolution. 
The rest of the UN Security Council is ready to agree to such a resolution, and at this point the only obstacle is getting Barack Obama’s approval. That is why it was so exceedingly alarming to wake up on Sunday morning and read former UN Ambassador John Bolton’s very chilling warning about what could soon happen at the UN. The following comes from an article on the website of The Hill … 
Former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton warned Sunday that President Obama should not take any actions before leaving office that could hurt Israel at the U.N. 
Bolton said during an interview with radio host John Catsimatidis that there is “a lot of speculation over in Turtle Bay at U.N. headquarters about resolutions that recognize a Palestinian state or that try and set a boundary for Israel based on the 1967 ceasefire lines.” 
“I think that’d be very inadvisable for the president to do that,” he said. 
John Bolton is still very tied in to the international community, and Donald Trump is reportedly actively considering asking him to serve as Secretary of State. 
Needless to say, I would take what he is saying very, very seriously. 
So what would this potential UN Security Council resolution look like? 
Well, it would likely accomplish three historic things… 
1. It would give formal UN Security Council recognition to a Palestinian state for the very first time. 
2. It would grant East Jerusalem to the Palestinians as the capital of their new state. 
3. It would establish the 1967 ceasefire lines as the basis for final negotiations for borders between the two states. 
Up until now, the U.S. government’s veto power on the UN Security Council has always blocked anti-Israel resolutions from passing, but earlier this year the Obama administration said that such a “parameters resolution” was now “on the table”. 
And at this point we still don’t know what Obama is going to ultimately decide, but the Trump transition team is so concerned about this that they recently warned Obama “against making moves on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in his last months in office” . 
But no matter how much they object, the truth is that Trump and his team cannot actually do anything to stop Obama. 
If Obama decides to betray Israel at the UN, it is going to happen. 
And of course the Israeli government is extremely concerned about what might take place as well. According to the New York Post , the Israelis asked Secretary of State John Kerry if the Obama administration would promise to veto any anti-Israel resolutions at the UN for the remainder of Obama’s term, and Kerry flatly refused to make such a promise… 
Israel faces a unique window of danger from Nov. 9 to Jan. 20: What might President Obama do in his final days in office to slam the Jewish state? 
Start with Secretary of State John Kerry’s recent flat refusal to promise a US veto on any upcoming anti-Israel resolution in the UN Security Council . 
On Saturday, Haaretz reports, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Kerry he’s counting on Washington to stick to its policy of nixing anti-Israel resolutions. Kerry’s reply: The administration has yet to make a decision on the matter . 
Perhaps equally as alarming is what Obama told the Palestinians. In October, Obama reportedly told them to wait until after the election for any action at the UN Security Council… 
On the surface, the latest message to the Palestinian Authority from the Obama administration is no different from the past two decades of American policy: the U.S. will veto any resolution attacking Israel or demanding Palestinian independence without them first making peace with the Jewish state. But, as Haaretz reported , there was one significant caveat to the warning. They were told not to push for any such resolution until after the presidential election next month . 
So why would it be so catastrophic if Obama decides to support a UN Security Council resolution that permanently divides the land of Israel? 
Well, John Kilpatrick, Shane Warren, Bob Jones and many others have warned that when we divide the land of Israel, our land will be divided too. 
Whether it is Barack Obama, Donald Trump or some other president that does it, someday this will happen. 
And when this happens, the floodgates will open and judgment after judgment will hit this nation. I have warned about many of these events in my latest book , and I hope to write much more about what is coming in the months ahead. 
So right now we are in “the danger zone” until January 20th, 2017. 
If we can get to January 20th and Donald Trump is peacefully inaugurated and the land of Israel has not been divided, perhaps we can all breathe a little bit easier for a while. 
But if the land of Israel is divided between now and then, the consequences for this nation are going to be more severe than most people would dare to imagine.

Thanks to Michael for having the courage to stand up for the truths of the Bible. God makes it plain in his Word that calamities will come upon whoever seeks to divide Israel. Pray for Israel and that America will stand up for Zion. robert 
I think it will be fascinating to see how God responds and if evangelical Bible interpretation is accurate. I am in the “don’t know” category. Have heard far too many preachers for 40 years proclaim this and that with no accurate results to show for it. Standing by. SurrealReality 
Forget the preachers. Believe what the Bible says. Tatiana Covington 
It’s just a plot of ground. I’ve never seen what the BFD is about it. Given the choice between Cuba itself and Israel itself (as geographical expanses only), I’d take Cuba any day. Much better rainfall and way better beaches. ted j GayVet ;)

“I will also gather all nations, And bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat; And I will enter into judgment with them there On account of My people, My heritage Israel, Whom they have scattered among the nations; They have also divided up My land.” Joel 3:2 live in the light 
I agree, if president Obama decides to support or refuse to veto a united nations resolution to divide Israel then it will be very catastrophic. We have had people in our church years ago about fifteen years ago and some longer that saw in dreams and visions of a tsunami hitting the east coast and gulf of Mexico with water going all the way to the Rockies of northern new Mexico and Colorado and then coming down. The south was almost completely gone and all of east Texas from Dallas East and Louisiana was completely gone except a few islands there and in parts of east Texas where there was higher ground. I don’t know if those dreams and visions were from the president betraying Israel but it was something they saw. One sister dreamed a huge asteroid hit the trans Atlantic ridge in the Atlantic ocean and when it did it shook the whole earth and the oceans moved back and forth like when someone sits down to fast in a bathtub. She said the devastation was beyond belief but then again I don’t know if it was related to this event or not. live in the light 
I’m sorry I meant the “mid-Atlantic” ridge.",0
19568,N.F.L. Recap: Who Said Anything About a Quarterback Controversy? - The New York Times,"After four weeks of playing catch in his back yard, Tom Brady can finally rejoin the New England Patriots, who suddenly look like they could really use him. Here’s what we learned in N. F. L. Week 4: ■ There is no quarterback controversy in New England, but there might be room for discussion in Dallas, where Dak Prescott continues to impress in Tony Romo’s absence. And in San Francisco, where Blaine Gabbert’s awkward impression of Colin Kaepernick is getting increasingly odd with Kaepernick available on the sidelines. It still doesn’t matter who plays quarterback for the Broncos, because their defense can win with anyone. ■ It might be time to panic for two of the N. F. C. ’s most   teams. The Panthers and Cardinals both dropped to   with Cam Newton and Carson Palmer being forced out of their respective games because of concussions. ■ Jets coach Todd Bowles has a better sense of humor than people give him credit for. Bowles claimed his confidence in Ryan Fitzpatrick is “no different than when the season started,” despite Fitzpatrick having thrown nine interceptions over his last two games, both of which the Jets lost. The only reasonable takeaway is that Bowles never had any confidence in Fitzpatrick to lose. ■ Julio Jones is very good at football. If the Falcons get 300 receiving yards from him every week they should be just fine. ■ There truly is no typical Browns loss. This week’s collapse came by way of a fumble that was called in the Redskins’ favor even as Cleveland’s fullback, Duke Johnson, stood next to the pile of players holding the football. Next week they may not need a collapse provided Tom Brady’s wife, Gisele Bundchen, kept her word and helped him stay in football shape. You learn more about a young quarterback when they are forced to face some real adversity for the first time, and with the way Dak Prescott handled his team getting off to an ugly start against the 49ers, it appears the Dallas Cowboys are in good hands. And they may be in for a little quarterback controversy as well. The rookie quarterback, filling in for the injured Tony Romo, calmly worked his team back into the game. With a little help from the Cowboys’ defense, and rookie running back Ezekiel Elliott, Prescott secured a   win and a   start to the season. In a   start to the game, the San Francisco offense, which had previously been struggling, looked incredible, converting its first seven   attempts. Carlos Hyde was finding space to run and Blaine Gabbert was carving up the Dallas secondary. But midway through the second quarter, with the Cowboys on the ropes following a sack that forced what would be a    from their own    the 49ers’ Jaquiski Tartt got a little too excited and added an extra hit to the play which resulted in an unnecessary roughness call and extended Dallas’s drive. Three plays later, Prescott found Terrance Williams on the edge of the end zone for a   touchdown that closed the gap to  . From that point forward, Gabbert turned back into a pumpkin, looking   to run an offense that seems better suited for Colin Kaepernick, and the Cowboys took control of the game. San Francisco’s good start on offense was a distant memory as the offense converted just one of its final seven   opportunities. After the quick comeback in the first half, Prescott, who also had a   touchdown pass to Brice Butler in the second quarter, seemed more than happy to let Elliott and Dallas’ overpowering offensive line drive the bus down the stretch. In New England’s final game without Tom Brady at quarterback, reality finally intruded on the Patriots’ dream start to the season. Jacoby Brissett played like a rookie, and every break seemed to go against New England, and they fell to the Buffalo Bills,   on Sunday. Coach Rex Ryan of the Bills was at his bombastic best during the week, and his defense delivered on his bluster, handing the Patriots the team’s first shutout at home since 1993 and erasing memories of Buffalo’s ugly   start to the season. Asked after the game how important getting Brady back next week will be for the Patriots, Rob Gronkowski paused for several seconds with a broad smile. “I don’t even have to answer that,” Gronkowski said. “Obviously it’s exciting to get Tom back. ” Here’s how things went wrong for the Patriots. Carolina allowed Atlanta quarterback Matt Ryan to torch their defense to the tune of 503 yards in the air  —   300 of it going to Julio Jones  —   but that wasn’t the biggest concern for the Panthers, as they finished the game without Cam Newton, the heart and soul of the team, who was taken out for evaluation in the N. F. L. ’s concussion protocol. The final score was   in favor of the Falcons, but until the Panthers know the extent of Newton’s injury, things could still get far worse. Newton, who had been having a subpar effort by his standards with 165 yards passing and 30 yards rushing, was running the ball into the end zone on a   conversion in the fourth quarter when he took a late hit from Deion Jones. The hit appeared to be legal, but that did not stop Newton’s teammates from objecting loudly to it as Newton was clearly scoring on the play. Read more here. Steelers Destroy Chiefs: Six offensive snaps. Three Ben Roethlisberger touchdowns passes. Two to Antonio Brown. One very important reminder of just how good Pittsburgh’s offense can look when all of its dynamic parts are moving in sync. Seven days after a   meltdown in Philadelphia, the Steelers overwhelmed the Chiefs   behind five touchdowns passes from Roethlisberger and 178 yards of total offense from running back Le’Veon Bell. Here’s how the Steelers won. Another Meltdown for Chargers: With the Chargers trying to protect a   lead against the Saints, Melvin Gordon fumbled and Darryl Tapp recovered at the San Diego 13, setting up a Drew Brees touchdown pass to Michael Thomas on    to pull to   with 4:50 to go. Travis Benjamin then fumbled after a reception and Nate Stupar recovered at the San Diego 31. Seven plays later, fullback John Kuhn scored his third TD of the game and the Saints walked away with a   victory. Read more here. Carson Palmer Hurt in Cardinals’ Loss: Tavon Austin returned a punt 47 yards to set up Case Keenum’s   touchdown pass to Brian Quick with 2:41 to play, and the Los Angeles Rams improved to   for the first time in a decade with a   victory over the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday. Arizona’s Carson Palmer threw for 288 yards and a touchdown but left the game to be evaluated for a concussion after his head slammed to the turf on a sack by Aaron Donald with 5:40 to play. The play forced a Cardinals punt and Austin raced past   tacklers to the Arizona 34. A facemask penalty against Ifeanyi Momah moved the ball to the 19 and the Rams ( ) went ahead when Quick caught a pass under tight defense for the score. Broncos Win, but Lose Siemian: Paxton Lynch made his N. F. L. debut sooner than expected Sunday, stepping in for the injured Trevor Siemian to help the Denver Broncos remain unbeaten. Lynch, drafted in the first round to be a big part of Denver’s future, added a nice first chapter to his career by finishing a   victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Here’s how the Broncos won. Browns Find Another Way to Lose: The Cleveland Browns, a team that seems determined to lose in new and exciting ways each week, had a   late in the third quarter and appeared to be in control against the Washington Redskins. It was not to be as the Browns ended the game with a   stretch in which they lost two fumbles, had an interception, turned the ball over on downs and then simply ran out of game clock. Along the way, the Redskins got a touchdown pass from Kirk Cousins and a touchdown run from Matt Jones, which was enough to lead to a   victory, dropping the Browns to  . Next week they are the first stop on Tom Brady’s 2016 revenge tour. Seahawks Top Jets: A week after the worst game of his career and one of the worst quarterbacking performances in recent N. F. L. history, Jets quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick managed not to throw six interceptions, or even five, or four. But he did throw three, all in the fourth quarter, including one that dashed the Jets’ hopes for a comeback in a   loss to the Seahawks. Read Ben Shpigel’s game report here.

19569,Obama Says He Will Keep More Troops in Afghanistan Than Planned - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   President Obama said Wednesday that he planned to leave 8, 400 American troops in Afghanistan until the end of his term, further slowing the drawdown in a   war that Mr. Obama pledged to end on his watch but now seems likely to grind on indefinitely. Acknowledging that the Taliban had retaken territory and were terrorizing the population, Mr. Obama said he was again adjusting his plan to withdraw American forces. The announcement will leave his successor with a substantial military commitment in the country, though far less than the nearly 40, 000 troops deployed there when he took office. “The security situation in Afghanistan remains precarious,” Mr. Obama said from the Roosevelt Room of the White House. “Even as they improve, Afghan security forces are still not as strong as they need to be. ” Those troops, he said, had not been able to quell a string of attacks and suicide bombings, including in the capital, Kabul. The United States has close to 10, 000 soldiers in Afghanistan, where they train and equip Afghan forces, and carry out counterterrorism operations. When he last tinkered with the drawdown schedule, Mr. Obama said he hoped to reduce that number to 5, 500 by early 2017. Now, more than 8, 000 troops will remain, and it will be up to Mr. Obama’s successor to order any further reductions. The president recently loosened the rules of engagement for American troops to give them the ability to fight the Taliban directly, and more flexibility to carry out airstrikes or wage ground combat. Mr. Obama cast his decision as a vote of confidence in Afghanistan’s government, led by President Ashraf Ghani, as well as in the support of NATO members and other partners, who have contributed 6, 000 troops. But it also underscores the fact that American hopes of building an Afghan force capable of securing the entire country had fallen short. “We have to deal with the realities of the world as it is,” said Mr. Obama, who was flanked by Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. “It is going to continue to take time to build up military capacity that we sometimes take for granted. Given the enormous challenges they face, the Afghan people will need the partnership of the world, led by the United States, for many years to come. ” Mr. Obama announced the decision a day before leaving for a NATO summit meeting in Warsaw. Administration officials said the timing was intended to clarify American intentions and demonstrate that the United States was committed to Afghanistan. The president made the decision, which was very closely held, after a lengthy internal debate, and based on a recommendation from the American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr. Keeping 8, 400 troops in the field, a senior administration official said, would allow American forces there to advise Afghan commanders “at the   and   level out in the field” over a sustained period, something that would not have been possible at lower troop levels. The number represents a slight decline from the 9, 800 troops currently deployed. “It’s an important and timely shift,” said Daniel F. Feldman, who was Mr. Obama’s special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan. “I welcome it as a demonstration, not only of the administration’s flexibility in best advancing our national security interests in Afghanistan, but of the   commitment we’ve said we’ve had to Afghanistan, but which was being questioned there. ” Mr. Feldman was among more than a dozen former military commanders and diplomats who had urged Mr. Obama last month in a letter not to cut troop levels. Two prominent Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, added their voices to that call. “If we go to 5, 500, this place will fall apart quickly, quicker than Iraq,” said Mr. Graham, who joined Mr. McCain on a July 4 visit to Afghanistan. “If we keep 9, 800, there is a decent chance we can succeed. ” But Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts and a critic of the war, said, “We are engaged in what appears to be an endless war, with no strategy about how to end the conflict and disengage our troops. ” Besides fragile security, the decision reflected American worries that Al Qaeda was regrouping in Afghanistan, and that the Islamic State had established a foothold there. Mr. Obama repeated his vow that he would not allow Afghanistan to be used as a safe haven for terrorists. There have been other signs that the United States is preparing for a   counterterrorism campaign. In May, a missile fired from an American drone killed Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour, the head of the Taliban, as he was traveling in Pakistan’s Balochistan Province. The decision to strike him on Pakistani soil, and then to announce it publicly, suggested a new, more aggressive approach by the United States. “We can’t forget what’s at stake in Afghanistan,” Mr. Obama said. “This is where Al Qaeda is trying to regroup. This is where ISIL continues to try to expand is presence,” he said, using the administration’s preferred acronym for the Islamic State. The Afghan government had lobbied privately to keep the troops, American officials said. “We were expecting a decision based on the ground realities, and we welcome President Obama’s decision,” said Haroon Chakhansuri, a spokesman for Mr. Ghani. The government has struggled with security as American soldiers have left, steadily losing territory to Taliban insurgents. They briefly captured Kunduz last year, the first time they had seized a major urban center since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001. Insurgents claiming affiliation with the Islamic State have also contested districts in eastern Afghanistan, and have remained a persistent threat despite major military operations against them. Despite the assassination of Mullah Mansour, the Taliban have retained their ability to carry out attacks in cities, most recently killing at least 33 people, almost all of them police cadets, in a bombing in Kabul. The deployment, Mr. Obama noted, was a far cry from the 100, 000 combat troops once there. But he acknowledged the frustration people might feel at the inability of the United States to draw this war to a close. “When we first sent our forces into Afghanistan 14 years ago,” he said, “few Americans imagined we’d be there  —   in any capacity  —   this long. ”",0
19570,"NYPD Catches Itself Selling Stolen Goods, Blames Business Owner","
by Carey Wedler
A business owner in Manhattan is suing the city after being forced to waive his Fourth Amendment rights and potentially forfeit his business because an NYPD officer sold illegal goods at his store.
You read that right.
According to a lawsuit filed this month by the Institute for Justice, a libertarian legal advocacy group, an undercover NYPD detective attempted to sell stolen electronics to customers at Sung Cho’s laundromat in Inwood, which located near the northern tip of Manhattan, in 2013. After the officer successfully sold stolen goods to two people — one inside the store and one outside — the city threatened Cho with eviction “merely because a ‘stolen property’ offense had happened at his business,” the legal organization’s website explained .
Institute for Justice (IJ), which takes on cases involving the suppression of free speech, eminent domain, and civil asset forfeiture, among other government encroachments, detailed Cho’s case:
“The city presented Sung with a choice: See his business shut down or sign an agreement giving up constitutional rights—including his Fourth Amendment right to be free from warrantless searches of his business. Faced with the imminent closure of his laundromat, Sung had no real choice but to sign.”
Under the city’s decades-old “nuisance eviction ordinance,” residents and business owners can be evicted simply because an illegal act occurred on or near their property. Though the law was passed in the 1970s to target businesses that encourage illegal activity, like many laws, it has been abused.
“Under the ordinance, the identity of the criminal offender is irrelevant,” IJ explains. “You can be evicted because a total stranger (or a friend or family member) decided your home or business was a good place to commit a crime.” 
According to IJ, “in many cases, the ‘proof’ of the alleged criminal offense is an affidavit from an NYPD officer relaying vague allegations from unnamed confidential informants.” 

A joint investigation by ProPublica and the New York Daily News reported that in Cho’s case, “the police claimed in court filings that [his] business was facilitating an illegal fencing operation” because the undercover detective sold illegal goods there in 2013.
None of Cho’s employees were ever accused of or charged with a crime.
Nevertheless, in cases like Cho’s, the city often offers to drop the charges — but only if the defendant agrees to relinquish their constitutional rights. Some “are forced to sign agreements waiving their Fourth Amendment rights,” IJ explains.
According to ProPublica and the Daily News :
“Cho agreed to give up his right to a hearing before being fined and agreeing to be shut down if police accuse anybody at his shop of breaking the law in the future. He also must allow the police to search his business and access his security footage at any time. The terms continue in perpetuity, and pass on to any new buyer or partner in Cho’s business, which he said makes it essentially worthless.”
“I couldn’t really defend myself, that’s why we had to settle prior to going to the judge,” Cho said. “Just because it happened nearby, under the law I am guilty, and that is not right.“
The ordinance is being abused in other ways, as well. As IJ explains:
“Others are forced to sign agreements barring family members from the home—including family members who have not been accused of any crime”
This was the case of Jameelah El-Shabazz, also represented in IJ’s suit, who was forced to ban her son from her home. She was required to do so after he was falsely accused of possessing 45 cups of cocaine during a police search of a bedroom at her residence in 2011. Laboratory tests proved her son did not have cocaine or any other narcotic; she says the powder the NYPD found was crushed eggshells he uses for spiritual rituals.
Though no charges were ever pressed, “four months later, she was served with the nuisance case and an order forcing her from her apartment while the case was being decided,” ProPublica and the New York Daily News reported.
She says that when she signed the agreement, she had no idea it meant she had to permanently ban her son from her home.
“I’m not going to make my son homeless because of the false accusations,” she said.
The ProPublica/Daily News investigation reports that of over 1,100 cases in which these notices were issued during 2013 and the first half of 2014, fewer than half of the individuals targeted had actually committed a crime. They reported the cases occurred “almost exclusively” in black and Latino communities.
IJ’s suit follows another similar lawsuit concerning a woman who was evicted from her home for four days after police claimed drugs were illegally sold there. As it turned out, those engaging in illegal activity had moved out eight months prior. Though Mayor Bill de Blasio responded to the lawsuit, saying he believes everyone is entitled to a fair trial, city attorney Nicholas Ciapetta claimed in a recent motion that the woman “was not entitled to any additional process.” The city’s law department said it has not yet seen IJ’s new case filing.
Though the NYPD has amended its use of the ordinance to restrict full closures on homes while nuisance cases are still being decided, they continue to endorse the law. “This is one of many important tools we use as part of precision policing to continue to drive down crime and protect the public,” Police Commissioner James P. O’Neill said .
But Cho disagrees. “It’s unfair,” he asserted . “Unfair to me, unfair to all the investment that I made here, unfair to the employees that work here and support their families…it’s New York City versus a little guy like me.” 
Robert Johnson, the lead attorney on the case representing Cho, El-Shabazz, and one other individual, strongly objected to the practice. “The mere fact that someone’s been arrested is just not a reason why they should be kicked out of an apartment,” he said. The case was filed in the United States Court for the Southern District of New York.
Johnson said IJ is prepared to take the case against the “coercively obtained” settlements all the way to the Supreme Court. If they win, “past waivers of constitutional rights will be declared unenforceable and, going forward, this practice will be put to an end once and for all.” Delivered by The Daily Sheeple

19571,Germans want to breathe Russian natural gas without Ukraine,"Germans want to breathe Russian natural gas without Ukraine 26.10.2016 The current goal of the German establishment is to please the Americans and keep business with the Russians afloat at the same time. The Germans now try to present the Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline as a purely commercial project. The pipeline will be built, despite the anti-Russian hysteria in Poland, Latvia and Ukraine. The economic war with Russia In July 2016, spokesman for the President of Poland Andrzej Duda told the Financial Times (FT), that Duda and Obama were opposed to the construction of the Nord Stream-2. For the US, it goes about the formation of unwanted relations between Russia and the EU, particularly between Russia and Germany. The Americans also hope to push Europe to the construction of LNG terminals (liquefied natural gas) of the American production, of course. Print version Font Size The Americans want to convince Brussels that you the EU must not let Russia build the pipeline system bypassing Ukraine. Such a move would deprive the pro-American Kiev of two billion dollars in annual revenues. On the other hand, several countries of Eastern and Central Europe will remain dependent on Russian supplies for another 30-50 years, even against the backdrop of the ""economic warfare."" Therefore, US officials suggest the EU should start forming an alternative gas transport structure. German companies, for instance, could buy natural gas from Norway, and Italian companies could acquire LNG from Spain. Yet, the Norwegian natural gas will be expensive and even more expensive, whereas Spain will never be able to meet common European demands. Poland says a big, big no to the project on all possible fronts, acting in information, legal and financial fields. Another agent of Washington's influence, Latvian President Raimonds Vejonis said after meeting with his Estonian counterpart in Riga that North Stream-2 did not correspond to common European objectives and energy principles of the European Union. This project is more a geopolitical, rather than an economic one, said Vejonis. Ukraine is very much opposed to the project too, of course. In January, Naftogaz of Ukraine filed a complaint at the European Energy Community, which was then sent to the European Commission. According to Ukraine, the EU may violate its own legislation if the Nord Stream-2 materialises. It goes about the Third Energy Package, which says that the gas producer can not be the owner of the pipeline. All goes well in Germany Germany is quite perplexed as well. Manfred Weber, the leader of the conservative European People's Party in the European Parliament, told Der Spiegel that the possibility to introduce new sanctions against Russia and its leadership must remain on the table. In addition, the Nord Stream-2 will not be built if President Putin does not stop dropping bombs on civilians. German Minister for Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steinmeier does not hear such calls. On Sunday, he told ARD that new sanctions against Russia would be counterproductive. ""What works in Ukraine, does not have to be a right solution in Syria. We need Russia to achieve peace in Syria,"" the minister said. Steinmeier understands that new sanctions would certainly halt the North Stream-2. The Germans say now on a federal level that this pipeline is purely a commercial project without any geopolitical innuendos, so it is not subject to the sanctions pressure. The pipeline will reduce the price for German consumers by 20 percent, so Germany's concerns are easy to understand. ""Due to the extension of the Nord Stream system, we will provide reliable gas supplies for Germany and the EU for a long period of time. This project will strengthen more than 40 years of our successful cooperation with Gazprom,"" the official website of the Nord Stream-2 says, quoting Klaus Schaefer, BASF CEO. The Germans pretended not to have noticed Poland's failure to register a joint venture of international consortia. A failure to register the project within the scope of the EU means that each applicant will have to independently look for opportunities to contribute to the project. Noteworthy, Gazprom owns a stake of 51 percent stake in the project, while E.ON, Shell, OMV and BASF/Wintershall - ten percent each, and Engie - nine. Director of Nord Stream-2 Public Relations Ulrich Lissek remains positive and sees no technical difficulties. The work on the project goes according to plan, and the system is expected to be launched in late 2019. It is in 2019 when Russia is expected to withdraw from the Ukrainian gas transit system. The capacity of two sections of the Nord Stream will make up about 120 billion cubic meters of gas per year, plus the Turkish Stream - 31.5 billion. This will be enough to replace the capacity of the Ukrainian pipeline, which now supplies about 60 billion cubic meters per year. By 2019, Ukraine will remain only an option for import routes, and Europe understands it. Lyuba Lulko Read article on the Russian version of Pravda.Ru Europe sells Ukraine for gas",0

Ne-Yo told TMZ last month that he’d move to Canada and be neighbors with fellow R&B singer Drake if the country elected Donald Trump. Liberal Comedians 
Comedian Amy Schumer said in September that Spain would be her destination of choice. 
“My act will change because I will need to learn to speak Spanish,” Schumer said in an appearance on the BBC’s “Newsnight.” “Because I will move to Spain or somewhere. It’s beyond my comprehension if Donald Trump won. It’s just too crazy.” 
Chelsea Handler said she already made contingency plans months ago. 
“I did buy a house in another country just in case,” the comedian and talk show host said during an appearance on “Live with Kelly and Michael” in May. “So all these people that threaten to leave the country and then don’t — I actually will leave that country.” Former “Daily Show” host Jon Stewart said he would consider “getting in a rocket and going to another planet, because clearly this planet’s gone bonkers” if the real estate mogul wins. 
Whoopi Goldberg, co-host of the “The View”, said on an episode of the talk show earlier this year that if the country elects Trump, “maybe it’s time for me to move, you know. I can afford to go.” Keegan-Michael Key said he would flee north to Canada. “It’s like, 10 minutes from Detroit,” the comedian told TMZ in January. “That’s where I’m from; my mom lives there. It’d make her happy too.” 
Hispanic comedian George Lopez said Trump “won’t have to worry about immigration” if he takes the White House because “we’ll all go back.” Liberal Political Figures 
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joked in an interview with The New York Times in July that it’d be time to move to New Zealand if Trump were to win. 
“Now it’s time for us to move to New Zealand,” she said quoting her husband who died in 2010. “I can’t imagine what the country would be with Donald Trump as our president. For the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be — I don’t even want to contemplate that.” 
Ginsburg later apologized for her comments, calling them “ill-advised.” 
Civil rights activist Al Sharpton told a reporter earlier this year that he’s “reserving my ticket out of here if Donald Trump wins.” source

19573,SOROS & HIS CONNECTION TO THE RIOTS,"SOROS & HIS CONNECTION TO THE RIOTS 53.6K shares by DML DAILY / November 12, 2016 / CRAZY LEFT / 
The mainstream media is pushing the narrative that the protests spreading throughout the country are peaceful, and represent the widespread hatred for President-elect Donald Trump. Unfortunately, the media is pushing a false narrative. 
Fact is theses are not protests. According to the law, the events taking place are riots. Under Federal Law, a riot is a public disturbance involving an act of violence by one or more persons assembled in a group of at least three people. Inciting a riot applies to a person who organizes, encourages, or participates in a riot. It can apply to one who urges or instigates others to riot. According to 18 USCS 2102 ” to incite a riot”, or ” to organize, promote, encourage, participate in, or carry on a riot”, includes, but is not limited to, urging or instigating other persons to riot. 
George Soros, the radical left leaning billionaire who supported Hillary Clinton and donates to radical groups such as Black Lives Matter and MoveOn.org, is behind the riots and needs to be held accountable. The majority of people showing up to these riots are paid to do so by Soros-funded-groups. 
Below is a video produced by RT.com It connects Soros to the riots. This video was sent to us by one of our readers, Charee.

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/10/nato-us-uk-assemble-largest-troop.html In the midst of deepening tension between US allies NATO and Russia, NATO is planning the largest military buildup along the Russian border since the cold war. NATO called on allied governments this week to contribute whatever troops and equipment they can to the effort. According to Reuters , thousands of troops are expected to arrive in the coming days and weeks.It was reported that Italy, France, Denmark and other European states are expected to join the NATO military divisions that will be led by the United States along Russia’s border.On Wednesday, Britain announced it is sending hundreds of soldiers and hardware to Russia’s borders as part of a huge military deployment.A total of 800 troops, drones and tanks are moving to Estonia as part of the biggest military build-up of NATO troops on Russia’s borders since the Cold War. Cold War 2 Has Begun: The US and NATO are Deliberately Provoking Russia, Hoping for WW3 In addition to the forces allocated for his specific operation, NATO has an army of over 40,000 ready to be called up to fight at any time.The US military claims that this threatening move is meant to act as a “deterrent” to the Russian military, but this is obvious a move that will escalate tensions and push towards a possible third world war. “This is a credible deterrence, not to provoke a conflict but to prevent conflict,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday — ironically ignoring the fact that it is a de facto provocation. Just imagine what would happen if Russian troops amassed along the Mexican border and told the US that this move was to ‘prevent conflict.’The so-called Iskander-M cruise missiles can hit targets across Poland and the Baltics, although NATO officials declined to say if Russia had moved nuclear warheads to Kaliningrad.The United States’ envoy to NATO, Douglas Lute, told reporters that NATO and the US military may consider Russia a threat if they had nuclear weapons within range of NATO’s deployment. This statement is insane considering the fact that the US military is the one that is many miles from home on the border of someone else’s lands. “This deployment, if it becomes permanent if the presence of nuclear weapons were confirmed, would be a change in (Russia’s) security posture,” Lute said. If anyone is a threat, it is NATO and the US government.These military tensions are the result of an ongoing proxy war in Syria , in which Western powers are attempting to institute a regime change in the country by funding violent rebel groups. Meanwhile, Russia has interests in keeping their allies in the Syrian government in control, putting the two superpowers at odds.Until now, Russia and the US have been fighting through third parties, just as they had during the previous Cold War, and the same type of situation is developing today.

19576,"In Republicans’ Ethics Office Gambit, a Spectacle of Tweets and Retreats - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   Majorities in Congress often overreach, but usually not on the very first day. House Republicans, on the verge of a Washington takeover as the new Congress convened Tuesday, couldn’t stop themselves from trying to dilute the power of a despised ethics watchdog as their first order of business. In the process, they created an unsightly spectacle that pretty much ruined an   celebration of unified Republican government, undermined their own leadership and perhaps foretold the shape of things to come. House Republicans take a stand on a contentious issue, Donald J. Trump turns to Twitter to break with House Republicans, then Republicans frantically reverse course. “Mr. Trump campaigned that he was going to drain the swamp, and here we are on Day 1 trying to fill the swamp,” Representative Walter B. Jones, Republican of North Carolina, said after he and his colleagues hurriedly jettisoned a plan seen as a brazen attempt to weaken an independent ethics office that some felt had been unfair to lawmakers. “That is not a good way to start. ” Deluged by angry phone calls and bad headlines, chagrined Republican officials say they were well on their way to abandoning the ethics revisions adopted Monday night in a   party meeting before Mr. Trump weighed in via Twitter and suggested that the overhaul shouldn’t be a top priority, urging Republicans to focus instead on taxes and health care. But the final decision did come after the  ’s Twitter posts, underscoring his sway over House Republicans who had moved ahead despite objections and warnings about the optics of the change from Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader. House Republicans might have amusedly applauded Mr. Trump’s cutting tweets when they were aimed at the news media and other common foes, but they found them measurably less funny when the criticisms were directed their way, raising alarms among Republicans about his power to corral them via social media. Following the decision to reverse course, several lawmakers were quietly fretting that Mr. Trump’s megaphone was much more powerful than they had realized. Other Republicans both on and off Capitol Hill were wondering how the   proposal got as far as it did, given the stated reservations of Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCarthy among others. They said it did not bode well that the rank and file was so willing to ignore leadership on such a potentially critical matter, demonstrating once again how hard it can be to manage the House Republicans even when the party is set to control both Capitol Hill and the White House. Mr. Ryan had already headed off an earlier rules change that was deemed potentially embarrassing: a proposal to let lawmakers resume funding of pet projects through designated “earmarks” as long as the money went to public entities. Abuse of earmarks was one of the main sources of congressional corruption that led to tighter ethics rules and a ban on such spending, and Mr. Ryan and his allies believed that a quick move to restore them so soon after Mr. Trump’s election would not send the proper signal. But Mr. Ryan has promised to revisit both the earmark issue and the revisions to the Office of Congressional Ethics later this year. The ethics office was created in 2008 at the urging of Representative Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who was then the House speaker. This was in response to criticism that the Select Committee on Ethics, comprising lawmakers from both parties, was ineffective, given a string of   corruption cases and other breakdowns such as a scandal involving teenage House pages. Lawmakers from both parties were against the office then, as well as now, and would much prefer to be judged by their peers  —   politicians currently serving in the House who might be more sympathetic  —   as opposed to a more discrete board and staff. But in moving ahead with the rules change on a strictly partisan basis, Republicans opened the door to Democrats berating them for the proposal, even though a significant number of Democrats are just as unhappy with the ethics office. It was similar to a move House Republicans made in 2005 when they used the   rules package to weaken the ethics committee itself after a series of rebukes against Tom DeLay, the majority leader. That decision sparked an outcry from Democrats and watchdog groups that helped Democrats regain the majority the next year with a message that Republicans were fostering a culture of corruption. “I think it is always better to do changes to the ethics process in a bipartisan manner,” said John Feehery, a former top Republican aide in the House. “It protects you from political attacks. ” The tussle over the ethics office is just one illustration of how Mr. Trump and his outsider ideas could clash with his own party in Congress. Mr. Trump has vowed to move forward with a proposal to impose term limits on Congress, and many in the party are not happy with that idea. Other sources of friction are bound to emerge, given his campaign message about shaking up Washington. “I just could not believe that the Congress does not understand that, if anything, we need to bring sunshine in,” Mr. Jones said. House Republicans may understand that idea a little bit better now.",0
19577,‘Game of Thrones’ Season 6 Finale: Setting Up the Endgame - The New York Times,"Over 10 weeks in the sixth season of “Game of Thrones,” it has become a cliché to note that the powerful women have come to the fore. But there was one character whose trajectory seemed to be the exception to the feminist revolution remaking this story. That would be Cersei, who since the Season 4 assassination of her son King Joffrey has been on a long slide marked by loss (her father and daughter) humiliation (her walk of shame) and most crucially, an apparent dulling of her once formidable sense of how to work the angles of power. Outflanked by first Margaery and then the High Sparrow, two master manipulators with crocodile smiles, Cersei, with her forthright, shameless spite, seemed antiquated by comparison. All that remained, it seemed, was for one last miscalculation to undo her at her trial, perhaps fatally  —   for the wildfire explosion to claim its architect as a victim, or at least provoke a hubbub that allowed someone like her former fiancé Loras, at some  ’s behest, to slide a blade between her ribs. But Cersei had other ideas, wiping out any such notions, along with her primary nemeses, with a   Wildfire Plot that suggested shameless spite is still very much in fashion in King’s Landing. Any remaining doubters can ask Margaery, or the High Septon, or the luckless Septa Unella, or even King Tommen, for whom it all was finally just too much to bear, the poor thing. Or ask Jaime, who arrived in King’s Landing just in time to see Cersei claim the Iron Throne in her sinister leather power frock, looking like a cross between Maleficent and Thin White   David Bowie. Did he look happy that his beloved sister had finally achieved her dream of absolute power? He did not. Instead the Kingslayer, who has seemed torn this season between his twisted devotion to her and nobler impulses, seemed to be wondering if he might one day be called upon to be a Queenslayer. After all, Cersei just did a version of what Jaime reportedly killed the Mad King Aerys in order to prevent. (It was his wildfire she used.) At the very least, he seems liable to lend an ear to a certain persuasive brother currently heading his way from the east. [ Interview: Niklolaj   on Cersie’s Rise and Jaime’s Evolution ] Whoops, I buried the lead: We’ve left Meereen! We’ve left Meereen! Well all of us except Daario, who’s sticking around to keep the peace in the city as well as the rebranded Bay of Dragons. Forget Meereen, he said (in a way) speaking for all of us. Dany’s long,   departure, backed by a growing list of powerful allies, was but one of a host of major events on Sunday, which packed an enormous amount of plot movement into its 69 minutes as it set up the homestretch of “Game of Thrones. ” Winter officially arrived, according to the weather ravens. Arguably the most popular fan theory about the show  —   that Jon Snow’s parents are really Lyanna Stark, Ned’s sister, and Rhaegar Targaryen, Daenerys’s older brother  —   was seemingly confirmed. Littlefinger announced his desires on the Iron Throne to Sansa. Arya embraced her destiny as a   assassin. Oh, and pretty much every annoying person in King’s Landing met an end or, in Septa Unella’s case, is headed there eventually. Cersei’s death roster included Margaery, Loras, Mace Tyrell and the High Sparrow, who kept on mansplaining up to the moment he realized he’d been outwitted and was turned to ash. Also: Pycelle, Uncle Kevan, Lancel the twit and finally the tragically ineffectual Tommen, who in his poignant final moments finally embraced the reality we first understood when we saw him cavorting with Ser Pounce in Season 4. The boy wasn’t cut out for the   politics of King’s Landing. His mother, however, most assuredly is. Lena Headey has always been one of the strongest performers on the show and it was a thrill to see her again with a full head of steam, culminating in Cersei’s paean to hedonism with Unella: “Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances,” she said. (“Shame! Shame!” she added later, in perhaps the highlight of the episode, after turning the septa over to a chillingly helmetless Mountainstein.) Ms. Headey’s performance was but one element in a sequence that, technically, ranks among the show’s best. Miguel Sapochnik, who directed last week’s   episode, brought a different kind of precision and urgency to Sunday’s installment. Cersei’s scheme unspooled amid insistent strings and a series of shots  —   those vicious little birds taking out Pycelle, Lancel and the dwindling   Margaery’s growing concern and rising tension in the Sept  —   that built inexorably to the High Sparrow’s realization that he wasn’t as smart as he thought. Cornered, Cersei had resorted to her credo about the “Game of Thrones”  —   you win or you die  —   and accepted her own dire fate, as prophesied by the witch years ago. Compared to her grief at the loss of Joffrey and Myrcella, she treated Tommen’s death as the price of doing business. Tired of trying to shape events as the person behind the person  —   be it a husband or son  —   she finally took the power she craved by force and dared anyone to stop her. Long may she reign. [ Looking for something to watch now that “Game of Thrones” is done for the year? Subscribe to the New York Times’s TV and movie recommendation newsletter. ] Count me among those who bought all the misdirection this year, the loss and abandonment, the failure of multiple schemes  —   I thought Cersei was a goner. But while her survival was genuinely surprising, the mechanics of this latest amazingly effective pyrotechnic overthrow (see also: Dany’s big blaze) were less so, thanks to Tyrion reminding us all last week about the stashes of wildfire beneath parts of the capital city. Indeed, whether because 1) “Game of Thrones” has surpassed George R. R. Martin’s intricate plotting, 2) the story has become too big and obsessively covered, or 3) we’ve become wiser to the ways of the writers, the big moves this season seemed broader and more clearly telegraphed. Examples include Jon Snow’s return, certainly, but also the Hound’s return, Arya’s dispatching of the Waif, Ramsay’s death and the Knights of the Vale’s     attack in last week’s Battle of the Bastards. (Only the death and definition of Hodor brought the nuclear OMG factor that became the show’s signature with things like Ned Stark’s execution and the Red Wedding.) The Sept sequence was so artfully handled that I didn’t really mind but it does make me consider how the sense of mystery will likely begin to dissipate from “Game of Thrones,” as longtime theories are confirmed and we pivot toward the final clashes. It’s unavoidable as the story begins to contract toward its conclusion. But I’m already feeling a little melancholy about the show becoming more about big battles and resolution and less about uncovering new pieces of this captivating world. By the end of Sunday’s episode, the major contenders were lined up and ready for action. In addition to Cersei we had Jon Snow and Dany, finally positioned as the clear champions of their respective constituencies, with no one besides us and perhaps Bran aware of how deeply the two of them might be connected. The North is finally rallying around Jon, led by the excellent Lady Mormont. “The blood of Ned Stark runs through his veins,” Lady Mormont said. Yeah  …     about that  …     You’ll recall that according to legend, Rhaegar kidnapped Lyanna, who had been promised to Robert Baratheon, kicking off the wars and rivalries that essentially created the story of “Game of Thrones. ” Doubt has been thrown on the details by various characters  —   was it an abduction? Or two lovers running away together?  —   but the net result is that Jon is not who we’ve been led to believe. Ned lied about his provenance in order to protect him, presumably from the future King Robert. This theory has been hard to avoid online, so part of the joy of having it confirmed comes from finally being able to accept it and move on. But within the story, questions include what will this powerful blood cocktail mean for Jon, going forward? The Starks and Targaryens have a number of special skills  —   warging,    —   that could come in useful against a zombie army. I think Jon could also have a potential claim on the throne, if Rhaegar and Lyanna were married. (Legitimacy is always Jon’s issue.) Of course the biggest question: How will he find out? And will it happen before or after he pairs off with his own aunt? (This might not happen, of course. But Dany did throw over Daario in favor of a strategic marriage to come later.) Speaking of the Dragon Queen, her departure from the pyramid comes with more support than she had even a few weeks ago  —   after years of isolated plotting and machinations by the various groups in this story, the alliances are coming together at a dizzying rate. Last week the Greyjoy siblings made their pact with the Dragon Queen, pledging ships and an end to their pirating. This week, it seems House Tyrell and maybe even the Dorne gals came aboard, unified in their Lannister loathing. “Cersei stole the future from me,” Lady Olenna told Ellaria Sand, who offered vengeance and justice in return. Enter Varys, who seemed to broker a deal and who apparently discovered a wormhole that allows him to jaunt all over the Known World at his leisure. The fleet is perhaps destined to meet up with Euron Greyjoy at some point and for one week, at least, it seemed like a force to be reckoned with. But Dany isn’t so sure  —   it was a less bellicose Dragon Queen we saw this week. “Are you afraid? Good,” Tyrion, the new hand of the queen said. “You’re in the great game now, and the great game is terrifying. The only men not afraid are mad men like your father. ” And, he might have added, mad queens like my sister. Winter may finally be here, but if we learned anything on Sunday, it’s that Dany’s not the only one in this tale who knows how to play with fire. • Arya Stark made a fun reappearance, killing the wretched Walder Frey. In the process she confirmed a few things. She is back on the   beat, which could mean trouble for a certain freshly minted queen. Also, though she ditched the Faceless Men, she apparently retained the   tricks (not sure where she’s keeping the faces). Finally, the   skills she picked up at the House of Black and White translate nicely to the kitchen. • Sansa apologized for but didn’t really explain why she didn’t tell Jon about Littlefinger and the Knights of the Vale’s possible role in last week’s big battle  —   Jon seemed to chalk it up to vague trust issues. Littlefinger finally admitted to Sansa that he wants to be king and he wants her with him, but he’s already misjudging his competition. Counter to his predictions, Jon’s bastardhood didn’t keep the other houses from pledging their allegiance. (Never underestimate the persuasiveness of Lady Mormont.) What did you make of those looks Littlefinger and Sansa exchanged during the meeting? • Davos confronted Melisandre over her immolation of Shireen, and asked Jon Snow if he could kill her. Beat it and don’t come back, Jon told her. She’ll be back. • The Wall has magic in it that keeps the dead from crossing it, Uncle Benjen told Bran. That seems important. Will Mr. Sapochnik be directing an enormous   scene in the coming seasons? • There was a macabre symmetry in Tommen plummeting out of that window, considering everything that has resulted from his father shoving Bran out of a window in the pilot. • It was nice to see Sam, an object of derision at home and at Castle Black, finally attain a career goal. The Citadel, with its Maesterdome of a library holding untold White   secrets, was quite something to behold, even if its   policy is exceedingly out of step with recent developments. Also, how much credibility does an institution of learning really deserve, if its front desk still thinks Mormont and Maester Aemon are running things at Castle Black? Related: I know “Game of Thrones” can’t show us every conversation but at some point, when Sam next sees his old buddy Jon and asks, “So what did I miss?” I hope we get to see him explain it. • Missing in Action: Jorah, presumably stonier these days unless he managed to crack the greyscale code the Hound, perhaps still hashing out his spiritual future with the Brotherhood and Brienne, whose meaningful final wave apparently was for us as much as Jaime. Row on, giant warrior maiden. Let us know if you bump into Gendry. • So what did you think? Are you excited for the reign of Cersei I? How do you think Jon will learn about his origins? How would you grade Season 6 as a whole? As always, please weigh in, in the comments.",0
19578,Israel to Cut $6 Million in UN Funding Over Anti-Settlement Resolution - Breitbart,"(AFP) UNITED NATIONS  —   Israel on Friday suspended about $6 million in funding to the United Nations to protest a Security Council resolution demanding an end to settlements in the West Bank[The council adopted the resolution last month after the United States refrained from using a veto to block the measure in a break from its usual practice of shielding its Middle East ally.  The cut to Israel’s $40 million annual contribution to the United Nations represented the portion of the UN budget allocated to four committees on Palestinian issues, the Israeli mission said. “It is unreasonable for Israel to fund bodies that operate against us at the UN,” Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon said in a statement. “We seek to stop the practice where the UN is used solely as a forum for unending attacks against Israel. ” The announcement came a day after the US House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted in favor of a measure condemning the UN stance and chastising President Barack Obama’s administration for abstaining in the Security Council vote. The cut in funding is the first in a series of retaliatory measures that the Israeli mission said would be taken at the United Nations after the new US administration takes office.",0
19579,Trump’s Gettysburg Address against the New World Order,"Tweet Home » Headlines » Finance News » Trump’s Gettysburg Address against the New World Order 
The Trump movement is an existential threat to the established order that consistently adopts the agenda and practices from the demonic cabal of the NWO globalists. 

Submitted by James Hall : 
If not now, WHEN? Only the most dedicated Totalitarian Collectivist would want to keep the NWO in power. Those who are so dim-witted to believe that the governance elites are legitimate rulers, exercising moral authority are so ignorant and illiterate that they deserve the fate of sheep taken to the slaughter. The Sheeple designation is apt for a society mired in a distorted reality of serfdom. 
The New World Order moved from a century’s old scheme to enslave humanity into a consolidated “ international community ”, when the central banksters organized the Bank for International Settlements, with the adoption of the Bretton Woods system of monetary management, the reorganization of nation states with the end of World War II, the creation of the globalist United Nations and the establishment of the centralized bureaucracy of the European Union. 
The Trump movement is an existential threat to the established order that consistently adopts the agenda and practices from the demonic cabal of the NWO globalists. 
It is because of this opposition to the transnational ruling despots that the vicious, deceitful and unending assault on Trump and his followers has been unleashed, since real meaningful change cannot be allowed that would reverse the systematic destruction of Western Civilization.

DONALD J. TRUMP CONTRACT WITH THE AMERICAN VOTER 
What follows is my 100-day action plan to Make America Great Again. It is a contract between myself and the American voter – and begins with restoring honesty, accountability and change to Washington. Therefore, on the first day of my term of office, my administration will immediately pursue the following six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington, DC: FIRST, propose a Constitutional Amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress; SECOND, a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition (exempting military, public safety, and public health); THIRD, a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated; FOURTH, a 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service; FIFTH, a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government; SIXTH, a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections. 
On the same day, I will begin taking the following 7 actions to protect American workers: 
 FIRST, I will announce my intention to renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205 
 SECOND, I will announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership 
 THIRD, I will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator 
 FOURTH, I will direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately 
 FIFTH, I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars’ worth of job producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. 
 SIXTH, lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline, to move forward 
 SEVENTH, cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs and use the money to fix America’s water and environmental infrastructure 
Additionally, on the first day, I will take the following five actions to restore security and the constitutional rule of law: 
 FIRST, cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama 
 SECOND, begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia from one of the 20 judges on my list, who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States 
 THIRD, cancel all federal funding to Sanctuary Cities 
 FOURTH, begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country and cancel visas to foreign countries that won’t take them back 
 FIFTH, suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting. 
Next, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my Administration: Middle Class Tax Relief And Simplification Act. An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy. The largest tax reductions are for the middle class. A middle-class family with 2 children will get a 35% tax cut. The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate. End The Offshoring Act Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free. American Energy & Infrastructure Act. Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years. It is revenue neutral. School Choice And Education Opportunity Act. Redirects education dollars to gives parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. Ends common core, brings education supervision to local communities. It expands vocational and technical education, and make 2 and 4-year college more affordable. Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act. Fully repeals Obamacare and replaces it with Health Savings Accounts, the ability to purchase health insurance across state lines, and lets states manage Medicaid funds. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications. Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act. Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-side childcare services, and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families. End Illegal Immigration Act Fully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border with the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall; establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; also reforms visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first. Restoring Community Safety Act. Reduces surging crime, drugs and violence by creating a Task Force On Violent Crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police; increases resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars. Restoring National Security Act. Rebuilds our military by eliminating the defense sequester and expanding military investment; provides Veterans with the ability to receive public VA treatment or attend the private doctor of their choice; protects our vital infrastructure from cyber-attack; establishes new screening procedures for immigration to ensure those who are admitted to our country support our people and our values Clean up Corruption in Washington Act. Enacts new ethics reforms to Drain the Swamp and reduce the corrupting influence of special interests on our politics. On November 8th, Americans will be voting for this 100-day plan to restore prosperity to our economy, security to our communities, and honesty to our government. 
This is my pledge to you. And if we follow these steps, we will once more have a government of, by and for the people. 
Publishing the entire list of all these positive measures, which challenge the elitist consortium of a criminal syndicate that impose a neo-feudal enslavement of humanity, documents the essence of the Trump vow of revolutionary nonviolent combat against the forces of satanic evil. 
The ironic symbolism of presenting this restoration of national greatness at the site of the historic betrayal of the original American Revolution, one must not forget that Abraham Lincoln embarked upon the initial destruction of the legitimate States’ Right essence that created the country. 
This apocalyptic step, set into motion the underpinnings of a global empire of which, America was never intended to pursue. Let’s hope that Donald Trump can rectify some of the damage done to the individual rights embodied in the Declaration of Independence. Gettysburg was not a victory for a union of free men, but was the launching of a lustful hegemony for an Imperium international order. 
Only this contract with American citizens can offer any hope of reestablishing a legitimate administration of a limited national government.",0
19580,Jared Kushner Talks of a Trump TV Network With a Media Deal Maker - The New York Times,"Donald J. Trump’s    has discussed the possibility of a   television network with a friend who has helped guide such deals. Jared Kushner, who is married to Mr. Trump’s older daughter, Ivanka, had conversations about the idea with Aryeh B. Bourkoff, the chief executive of LionTree, a boutique investment bank that has helped advise media deals. But such an effort, reported earlier on Monday by The Financial Times, would face enormous obstacles: Creating a television network would require a major cash investment, as well as a willingness by cable providers to carry the network. Without both, discussions of a television network would remain in the realm of fantasy. About a month ago, Mr. Kushner informally reached out to Mr. Bourkoff, a veteran media investment banker, about setting up a Trump television channel, according to a person briefed on the matter. But the conversation with Mr. Bourkoff was brief and has not progressed since, and the banker is unlikely to work on such a network, this person added. Mr. Kushner and Mr. Bourkoff are friends and speak frequently. A spokesman for LionTree declined to comment. Aides to Mr. Trump did not respond to an email seeking comment. The New York Times reported in August that Mr. Kushner had explored the possibility of either creating a media property or acquiring one, and his talks with Mr. Bourkoff were part of that effort, according to a person briefed on the discussions, who asked for anonymity to discuss private conversations. Within Mr. Trump’s campaign, top aides over the summer made reference to the possibility of running a media holding after the election, guided by the belief that the Republican nominee would win and such a property could help bolster his agenda, according to a person with direct knowledge of those discussions, who also asked for anonymity. At the moment, Mr. Trump’s campaign is led by Stephen K. Bannon, who operates the   website Breitbart. Mr. Trump’s campaign digital director, Brad Parscale, is close with Mr. Kushner and has done work for the Trump Organization in the past. People close to the Trump campaign have noted the emphasis that Mr. Kushner has placed on digital advertising, as Mr. Parscale has amassed data that has limited applicable use in a political race. But Mr. Trump himself is said to have expressed limited enthusiasm for the idea of “Trump TV. ” In an interview with the Washington Post in September, Mr. Trump denied that he was interested in pursuing a media property of his own. Mr. Trump, who historically gets investors for his major projects, seems unlikely to put in large amounts of his own cash into a potentially risky venture. The   investors Rebekah and Robert Mercer, who are said to have funded Breitbart operations and who are now supporting Mr. Trump, also do not appear to have the money to finance such an operation on their own. What’s more, major cable providers like Charter, Time Warner Cable and Comcast might be reluctant to give Mr. Trump visibility by putting a Trump channel in their lineup. When Rupert Murdoch created Fox News two decades ago, he faced hurdles in getting a channel from Time Warner Cable. Rudolph W. Giuliani, then the mayor of New York, helped broker a deal by which Fox would be aired broadly. Mr. Giuliani is now an adviser to Mr. Trump. Starting a TV network is no easy feat, as Oprah Winfrey, the popular daytime host turned media mogul, learned. In January 2008, Ms. Winfrey announced with much fanfare that she was teaming up with the media group Discovery Communications to start OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network. Ms. Winfrey would take on responsibility for the programming, while Discovery planned to convert its Discovery Health network to the new venture and help with distribution and other operations. OWN was expected to make its debut the next year. But Ms. Winfrey struggled out of the gate. The start was delayed until January 2011, in part because of issues with programming the    network. Discovery invested more than $500 million. It wasn’t until 2013 that the network broke even. That was all during an easier time for television networks, before they faced such competition from streaming services like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu. The experience is a lesson for anyone in just how arduous and costly it is to start a television network, land distribution, attract viewers and, ultimately, make money.",0
19581,American Is Killed in First Casualty for U.S. Forces in Syria Combat - The New York Times,"BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   The United States military suffered its first combat death in Syria on Thursday when a service member was killed in the northern part of the country, an area where the Americans are helping to organize an offensive against the Islamic State. American warplanes have been bombing targets inside Syria to help tens of thousands of militia fighters try to oust the Islamic State from Raqqa, the group’s stronghold in the country. American forces are on the ground as well. More than 300 members of the United States Special Operations Forces are in Syria to help recruit, train and advise the Kurdish and Arab fighters who are trying to encircle the Islamic State in Raqqa, cut off its supplies and ultimately retake the city. The Special Operations Forces member who died Thursday was killed by an improvised explosive device in the vicinity of Ayn Issa in northern Syria, United States military officials said. “I am deeply saddened by the news on this Thanksgiving Day that one of our brave service members has been killed in Syria while protecting us from the evil of ISIL,” Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said in a statement, using one of the names for the Islamic State. “It is a painful reminder of the dangers our men and women in uniform face around the world to keep us safe. ” Though the Obama administration has sought to limit the number of Americans in the fight against the Islamic State, the death on Thursday shows how volatile and deadly the campaign against the group is in Syria and Iraq. American service members have been killed in Iraq as well, and this month the United States acknowledged killing 119 civilians in Iraq and Syria since it began military operations against the Islamic State in 2014. The area where the service member was killed Thursday, Ayn Issa, is halfway between Raqqa and the Turkish border, and several factions have been active there, including the Syrian Kurds, the Islamic State and most recently local tribal fighters who oppose the Kurds, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist websites. Three Turkish soldiers were killed Thursday by Syrian planes, the Turkish military announced. It was the first time Turkish soldiers had been killed by Syrian government forces while fighting inside Syria since the civil war there began, the Turkish military said. The Turkish troops were moving toward Al Bab, a northern city held by the Islamic State, near the border with Turkey, the military said. The announcement that three soldiers were killed and 10 were wounded heightened the tensions between Syria and Turkey, neighbors with powerful allies. The Syrian government is backed by Russia and Iran. Turkey, a member of NATO, began a major offensive in northern Syria in August as part of its fight against the Islamic State. Turkey’s prime minister, Binali Yildirim, told Hurriyet, a leading Turkish newspaper, that the attack would “not be left unanswered,” and he said it would not deter his country’s army from its mission in northern Syria. Mr. Yildirim also reaffirmed the assessment of Turkey’s military chief, Gen. Hulusi Akar, that the attack was carried out by Syrian government warplanes. Some on the ground raised questions about whether the strike was undertaken by Syrian government forces. A network of activists who monitor the skies over Syria said Thursday that its watchers had spotted a Syrian aircraft taking off after 2 a. m. and also a Russian aircraft about the same time as the strike on Turkish forces occurred. It is impossible to know where the planes that were sighted went they could easily have had another destination, the network said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a network based in Britain that monitors news from Syria, said the strike was by the Islamic State. But the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, is not known to have combat aircraft. Like Turkey, the Syrian rebels oppose the government of President Bashar   of Syria. The Turkish troops had gone into Syria largely to stop an advance by Kurdish rebels, who are also trying to reach Al Bab to dislodge the Islamic State. The Turks see the Kurds as a threat to security as serious as the Islamic State, in part because Kurdish groups inside Turkey have waged a guerrilla war against the government. Turkey wants to stop the Kurds from reaching the city in part because, if the Kurds succeed, it will enable them to gain a portion of the land between two   areas along the   border and increase their potential for joining the regions. The Americans have said they are not taking part in the fight for Al Bab. On Thursday morning, Turkish troops, backed by Syrian Arab fighters, had almost reached Al Bab, according to rebel commanders. They said they were a little more than half a mile from the city when they were hit by the government jets. Although this is the first time that the Turkish military has reported the deaths of its soldiers by Syrian government planes, Turkish troops have died while fighting the Islamic State in Syria. Also on Thursday morning, a car packed with explosives blew up in the parking lot of the governor’s office in Adana, a city in southern Turkey, shaking buildings for blocks around, according to local news reports. Two people were killed and 21 were wounded, according to government estimates. No one has claimed responsibility for the blast. Deeper into Syria, in the eastern part of Aleppo, which is held by antigovernment rebels, the Syrian government continued to batter residential areas as it has for more than a week after a brief pause, according to doctors in Aleppo and residents of   areas. At least 12 people in eastern Aleppo were killed Thursday, according to residents in the city communicating by WhatsApp. There are about 250, 000 people in the city’s east, and most have been unable to leave because the roads are held by government forces.",0
19582,Hillary Admits In Leaked Email That Clinton Donors Are Funding ISIL,"In an email between Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her campaign chairman, John Podesta, the former first lady and secretary of state cites “ Western intelligence, US intelligence and sources in the region ” to accuse Qatar and Saudi Arabia of “ providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [or ISIS]and other radical Sunni groups in the region .”
Citing the need to “ use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets ,” the candidate told Podesta the current developments in the Middle East were “ important to the U.S. for reasons that often differ from country to country .” In the same email, Clinton seemed to claim Turkey needed to be reassured of America’s willingness to “ take serious actions, ” an effort that “ [could]be sustained to protect our national interests ” in the region.
In another piece of correspondence from 2012, the Director of Foreign Policy at the Clinton Foundation, Amitabh Desai , claimed the Ambassador from Qatar would “ like to see [Bill Clinton] ‘for five minutes’ in NYC, to present $1 million check that Qatar promised for [his]birthday in 2011 ,” adding that the small but rich nation occupying the Qatar Peninsula would “ welcome [the Clinton Foundation’s]suggestions for investments in Haiti — particularly on education and health .” Desai added that while Qatar had already “ allocated most of their $20 million … [they were]happy to consider projects we suggest .”
Al Jazeera , a Qatar-based, state-funded news organization, recently ran a list of “ revealing, juicy and quirky emails ” leaked by WikiLeaks. In its list, the news organization went over the “pay-for-play” scheme involving the Clinton Foundation, going so far as to mention an email confirming the king of Morocco offered $12m “for the endowment” — as long as Clinton was willing to take part in a meeting.
Nevertheless, the state-funded broadcaster failed to bring up the Qatar connection. Unfortunately for the organization, Wikileaks promptly noticed the omission.
In a post on Facebook , the WikiLeaks official page said, “ Al Jazeera’s list of juiciest Wikileaks forgets to mention the revelation that Qatar funds both ISIS & Bill Clinton. ”
On Twitter, the convenient lapse wasn’t forgiven. Promptly after WikiLeaks pointed out the omission, users began pressuring Al Jazeera to explain why the publication failed to link Qatar to ISIS and Clinton.

Despite the public outrage, few, if any, news organizations reported on Al Jazeera ’s bias.
In a period of America’s history in which news organizations parrot what one of the most powerful political dynasties in the country keeps on repeating to exhaustion — accusing foreign governments of “rigging” the U.S. election without offering any proof to back their claims — it’s interesting to observe that the mainstream media failed to pick up on this story.
Is it that Qatar’s and Saudi Arabia’s involvement with ISIS — while backing their favorite candidate — is a difficult issue to report on? Or is the media’s refusal to cover this topic rooted in fear that thoroughly addressing it will help her lose the presidential election?
Only time will tell.

19583,‘Jesus Woz Ere’ Inscription Found On Slab In Christ’s Tomb,"0 Add Comment 
THE burial slab Jesus Christ was said to have been laid upon following his crucifixion has been photographed for the first time with what appears to be the inscription ‘Jesus woz ere’. 
The writing, which has not been seen since 1555, was recently excavated during renovation work on the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the Old City of Jerusalem, and has sent archaeologists into a frenzy. 
“This is the only known physical writing of Jesus,” said Harris Mouzakis, an assistant professor of civil engineering at National Technical University who is working on the project, “He obviously left this as a sign for his followers. It’s an amazingly cheeky statement, as if he was taunting the people who crucified him, and giving them the proverbial middle finger”. 
Experts were left shocked to find the inscription was still intact following almost 1,600 years of being covered by marble cladding. 
“We spotted the Jesus graffiti immediately after we removed the top layer of marble and dusted it off,” added Mouzakis, “His writing is very neat, as you would expect from the son of God. Hopefully this will put any doubts about the origin of the tomb to bed”. 
Jesus Christ was crucified nearly 2,000 years ago on the Hill of Calvary after claiming he was the king of the Jews. It is understood he then came back to life three days later in the tomb, wrote Jesus woz ere, spent a few days freaking out his apostles, before then levitating into the sky, through the earth’s atmosphere and back to his dad’s place in heaven.",0
19584,UnReal Primer: Everything you wanted to know about demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000,"Tweet (Image via intoday.in) 
This week, the Central government proved what the philosophers have been saying for ages: Change is the only constant. 
The announcement that the existing Rs.500 and Rs.1000 notes will no longer be valid tender has created a huge confusion among the general public, especially among the poor and lower middle class, the section that mostly doesn’t get to see those two denominations. 
Here at Crank’s Corner , which is always clearing misgivings of people on matters of public importance, we have come up with yet another primer on the whole issue answering some questions on money and economics with our usual yen for irresponsibility. The answers will be so irresponsible and totally false that they would soon be WhatsApped to you by your well-meaning friends and relatives as confirmed news. 
1. Why were Rs.500 and Rs.1000 demonetised ? 
The Central government and the Finance Ministry had credible intelligence inputs that black money hoarders and terrorist networks had somehow managed to figure out that the existing Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes didn’t have special computer chips to track them, and hence the government has had to come up with new rupee notes that are so technologically advanced that, quite frankly, you can use them as a debit card in all places, even in places that doesn’t have a card-swiping facility. 
No, just kidding. The new currency doesn’t have any special feature. But you can rest assured that all Indian legal Indian tender come with the ultimate guarantee of the Indian Constitution: “I hereby promise the bearer of this currency the unfettered right to scribble stuff like ‘I love Priyanka‘ in the blank space provided for the explicit purpose” 
2. Can you give us some historical background to currencies? 
Before the advent of metal coins and paper rupees, as you would doubtless know barter system was in vogue where people exchanged goods and services for goods and services. For example, people with cattle exchanged them with those who had, say, knife or axe. And having got a knife or axe, they used the same to threaten and get the same cattle back. Life was mostly simple and straight forward then. 
But the problem was there were many who had nothing to offer. They all became economists and eventually came up with the concept of money. 
Okay, this is not entirely true. Some of them also became journalists. 
India, of course, was one of the earliest users of coins in the world, its history dating back to around 6th century BC, a period which — all Historians are unanimous on this — was very, very long back. 
Closer back in time, the Reserve Bank of India — keeping in mind its essential character — was set up on the April Fool’s Day of 1935. In those non-technological days, every rupee, except Rupee one, used to be painstakingly signed by the RBI Governor, which to this day remains his only major work. The issuance of one rupee is outside the purview of RBI, and the minting of coins has been outsourced to a metal company in Guindy Industrial Estate. 
3. In the aftermath of demonetisation , gold prices have shot up, Your views on investing one’s savings in gold 
Gold has always been a traditional hedge investment against other instruments that are prone to various vagaries. The government itself has invested hugely in gold, which it uses during times of economic contingency like when having to pay bonuses for government employees during Deepavali or to meet out expenses of the President or the Vice President who have to fly to other countries on emergency goodwill mission. 
The government is said to have reserves above 550 tonnes of gold and during Indira Gandhi’s time there was a smart move to store them as ornaments, especially in the form of kangan sets and ottianam . But the matter didn’t move forward because to this day no one knows how jewellers actually price their stuff. 
4. Enough of history. What should I do in case I am unable to withdraw cash from my bank? 
The important thing is not to panic, at no point should you…no wait, drop that knife. Also, slapping bank employees is banned under the Income Tax Act. 
5. A friend has given me a few 1000 and 500 rupee notes to pay them in my account. Can I? 
Remember you are not supposed to remit in your account somebody else’s money, also you should not give your place in the ATM line to anybody else. If you do, 250% fine will be levied on you and your spouse. In which case, it is your sole responsibility to prove to the IT authorities that you don’t have a spouse at all. 
6. If I still have some queries on demonetisation , whom should I approach? 
You may approach the control room of RBI by telephone (your secret pin number is written on your new notes) and the RBI will be only too happy to put your call on hold. Urjit Patel personally would like to answer your call, but at the moment he is busy signing some rupee notes.",0
19585,Fake News: Hysterical Media Hype Tiny Tel Aviv Anti-Trump Protest,"TEL AVIV  —   Despite only attracting a crowd of about 40, the news media has been hyping a tiny protest outside of the U. S. Embassy in Tel Aviv against President Donald Trump’s temporary halt on refugees while the government revamps its flawed security screening process. [Here are some of the screaming headlines about the miniscule protest:  L. A. Times: “Protesters in Tel Aviv compare Trump immigration order to Israeli refugee policies. ” Jerusalem Post: “Israelis protest Trump travel ban, citing history of Jewish refugees. ” I24 News: “Protesters ‘fight back’ against US, Israel’s refugee and immigration policies. ” Times of Israel: “At Tel Aviv protest, activists hear echoes of Israeli policy in Trump’s refugee ban. ” The L. A. Times article was also picked up by Yahoo! News. Despite the headlines, the articles themselves could not hide the small size of the protest, prompting questions as to why the news media would find the gathering newsworthy in the first place. The L. A. Times conceded the crowd consisted of “several dozen demonstrators. ” The Times of Israel put the number at “some 40 protesters. ”  The Jerusalem Post also cited about forty demonstrators. The turnout is particularly disappointing for Tel Aviv, a city known for its ability to mobilize massive numbers of   protesters. Trump’s executive order halts visas for 90 days for “immigrants and  ” from Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, Yemen, Iran, and Iraq. The order further suspended the entry of all refugees for 120 days, indefinitely blocked Syrian refugees from entering and lowered the ceiling to 50, 000 for refugees allowed to enter the U. S. during Fiscal Year 2017. Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

19587,Top Palestinian Sharia Judge: No Ramadan Divorces While Everyone’s Hungry,"(AFP)  —   The head of Palestinian Islamic courts on Sunday told judges not to grant divorces during Ramadan, fearing the   fast could spark rash words that would be regretted later. [Judge Mahmoud Habbash said he based his ruling on “the experience of previous years” when he found that the    fast and ban on cigarettes, which began on Saturday, tended to lead to frayed tempers and sharp tongues.  “Some, because they have not eaten and not smoked, create problems” in their marriages, he said in a statement, and they can make “quick and   decisions. ” According to the Palestinian Authority, 50, 000 weddings were celebrated in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in 2015, but more than 8, 000 divorces were also registered.

19588,Iran Arrests Person Linked to Negotiations on Nuclear Deal - The New York Times,"Iran said on Sunday that a person close to the government team that negotiated its nuclear agreement with foreign powers had been arrested on accusations of espionage and released on bail. The disclosure, reported in the state news media, appeared to be the latest sign of the Iranian leadership’s frustration over the agreement, which has failed so far to yield the significant economic benefits for the country that its advocates had promised. Iranian officials have blamed the United States for that problem. Despite the relaxations of many sanctions under the accord, which took effect in January, Iran faces enormous obstacles in attracting new investments and moving its own money through the global financial system. The Iranians are still blocked from using American banks, an important transit point for international capital, because of    sanctions imposed by the United States. There were unconfirmed reports last week that the Iranian authorities had arrested Abdolrasoul Dorri Esfahani, who has dual Iranian and Canadian citizenship, on espionage suspicions. Mr. Esfahani, an adviser to Iran’s central bank, helped the Iranian nuclear negotiators bargain for sanctions relief in exchange for Iran’s pledges of verifiably peaceful nuclear work. The official Islamic Republic News Agency said a spokesman for Iran’s judiciary, Gholam Hossein Mohseni Ejei, speaking at a weekly news conference on Sunday in Tehran, had “confirmed the arrest of an individual from the negotiating team. ” But the spokesman also said that “his charge of spying has not been proved” and that the suspect had been released on bail pending an investigation. The spokesman did not identify the suspect by name, which was considered unusual. He also did not explain why bail had been granted for an espionage charge, regarded as one of the gravest offenses. Nonetheless, it seemed clear that he was referring to Mr. Esfahani. Western analysts following the progression of the nuclear agreement said the arrest was worrisome. Cliff Kupchan, the chairman of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy in Washington, said in an email that it was a clear sign that Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, “is unhappy over the slow pace at which the deal has been implemented. ” There was no immediate comment on Mr. Esfahani’s fate from the government of Canada, which has been contending with the arrest of another dual citizen in Iran in recent weeks. In July, the Iranian authorities arrested Homa Hoodfar, a   anthropologist who studies the role of women in Muslim societies. The reason for her incarceration has not been made clear. The   arrest was one of a number of hostile signals from Iran recently. Three weeks ago, the authorities announced the execution of a nuclear scientist who had returned home from the United States, where, he claimed, he had been kidnapped by the C. I. A. The Iranians said the scientist had betrayed secrets to the enemy. And last week,   boats from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy harassed American warships patrolling international waters in the Persian Gulf region at least four times, United States officials said, calling the actions dangerous and illegal. Ayatollah Khamenei, who supported the nuclear agreement, has increasingly denounced what he calls American duplicity in the negotiation and other matters. In a speech on Sunday reported by the state news media, for example, he criticized the United States for opposing Iran’s purchase of a     system. “We face such an enemy that does not recognize any right of defense for our nation,” the state news media reported Ayatollah Khamenei saying in the speech to air force commanders. “In fact, it says you should remain defenseless so that when we wish, we can invade you. ”",0

19591,Roman Catholic Archbishop of Philadelphia: “I admire the integrity” of Muslim women who wear hijab and burqa,"BY ROBERT SPENCER 
It’s a common and recurring tendency among conservative Catholics to be complacent regarding the jihad threat because of a desire to see Muslims as allies in a culture war against all-encroaching and authoritarian secularism. This idea is based on ignorance of or indifference to the fact that, with its polygamy, divorce at a word, sexual slavery of Infidel women, allowance for wife-beating, tolerance for early abortion, and more, Islamic sexual morality is hardly akin to Catholic sexual morality. There is also a tendency, which is also found all over the West outside the Catholic Church, to assume that various concepts, and acts designed to express them, mean the same thing in an Islamic context that they do in a non-Muslim context. That false assumption is what we see here from Archbishop Chaput with regard to modesty. 
Archbishop Chaput says: “The hijab and the burqa say two important things in a morally confused culture: ‘I’m not sexually available;’ and ‘I belong to a community different and separate from you and your obsessions.’” In reality, that is what a Western woman might be intending to convey, but in an Islamic context the message is slightly different, and that slight difference is all-important. Yes, the hijab and burqa certainly say, ‘I’m not sexually available” and “I belong to a community different and separate from you and your obsessions.” But there is more. The Qur’an says: “O Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to bring down over themselves of their outer garments. That is more suitable that they will be known and not be abused.” (33:59) This is the foundation of the prevailing assumption in Islamic culture that if a woman is raped or sexually abused, it is her fault for exciting men, who can’t be expected to control themselves. This is the assumption underlying honor killing, and the reason why it is so common in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and other Muslim countries for women to be imprisoned after they were raped: the rape is their fault. 
So the hijab and burqa are really saying: “I am assuming the responsibility — willingly or not — for the possibility that I might be raped or sexually abused.” It is a visible sign of the subjugation of women. 
And that “willingly or not” clause is all-important as well. Archbishop Chaput says: “I admire the integrity of those Muslim women” who wear the hijab and the burqa. He assumes that they are wearing it freely, as they would be in the West. And to be sure, many Muslim women, especially in the West, are indeed wearing it of their own volition. What does Archbishop Chaput think of the integrity of Aqsa Parvez, whose Muslim father choked her to death with her hijab after she refused to wear it? How does he feel about the integrity of Amina Muse Ali, a Christian woman in Somalia whom Muslims murdered because she wasn’t wearing a hijab? And of the 40 women who were murdered in Iraq in 2007 for not wearing the hijab; and of Alya Al-Safar, whose Muslim cousin threatened to kill her and harm her family because she stopped wearing the hijab in Britain; and of Amira Osman Hamid, who faces whipping in Sudan for refusing to wear the hijab; and of the Egyptian girl, also named Amira, who committed suicide after being brutalized for her family for refusing to wear the hijab; and of the

19592,Oregon Standoff Acquittal Sparks Fears of New Land Disputes,"Oregon Standoff Acquittal Sparks Fears of New Land Disputes 11/01/2016 
AGWEB 
The stunning acquittal of seven people who occupied a federal wildlife sanctuary in Oregon during an armed standoff raised fears Friday that the verdict could embolden other militant groups in a long-running dispute over government-owned Western lands. 
Meanwhile, a juror said the decision was a rejection of the prosecution’s conspiracy case, not an endorsement of the defendants’ actions. 
Supporters of Ammon Bundy celebrated the verdict and said it could invite more confrontations. The government’s top federal land official, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, issued a statement urging all employees to “remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity.” 
An activist from Boise, Idaho, who once camped by a memorial to occupier LaVoy Finicum at the site where he was shot dead by police, predicted that the verdict would encourage others to act. 
“I think a lot more people will be revolting, rebelling and standing up against what we see as a tyrannical government,” William C. Fisher said in a telephone interview. 
The 41-day takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge last January in remote eastern Oregon was part of a larger debate about the use of federal lands in the West. The militants led by Bundy, a small business owner from Arizona, wanted to hand the refuge over to local officials, saying the federal government should not have dominion over it. 
The U.S. government owns nearly half of all land in the West, compared with only 4 percent in other states, according to the Congressional Overview of Federal Land Ownership. 
One of the jurors in the case asserted Friday that the panel was not endorsing militancy to resolve those issues. 
The juror, identified only as Juror No. 4, wrote in an email to The Oregonian/OregonLive that the verdicts were a “statement” about the prosecution’s failure to prove a conspiracy charge “and not any form of affirmation of the defense’s various beliefs, actions or aspirations.” 
The acquittal of the white occupiers came on the same day that officers in riot gear evicted protesters from private land in the path of the Dakota Access oil pipeline in rural North Dakota. Officers fired bean bags and pepper spray as they surrounded demonstrators, many of them Native Americans who have spent months fighting over tribal rights and the project’s environmental effects. At least 117 people were arrested. 
“Are we going to look at these protests the same way?” asked John Freemuth, a public land policy expert at Boise State University. “I certainly think the tribes will have a point if they find themselves arrested and in jail and these Oregon guys get off.” 
Bundy, his brother Ryan Bundy and five others were charged with conspiring to impede federal workers from their jobs at the refuge. 
Chris Rasmussen, a defense lawyer in an armed standoff case that happened two years ago at Bundy’s father’s ranch in Nevada, said it is “obvious” that Oregon prosecutors gambled in seeking convictions on felony conspiracy charges instead of misdemeanor trespassing charges. 
But prosecutors had few other options for serious charges because the defendants never attacked anyone, said Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles and a former federal prosecutor. 
Rather than attempting to retake the refuge headquarters and risking a gunbattle, authorities took a cautious approach. They closed nearby roads and stayed miles away while urging the occupiers to abandon the land. 
“The upside of not confronting them was it was less likely there would be violence,” Levenson said. “The downside was it was less likely that they could use the assault charge.” 
The standoff finally ended when the Bundys and other key figures were arrested in a Jan. 26 traffic stop outside the refuge. That’s when Finicum was killed. Most occupiers left after his death, but four holdouts remained until Feb. 11, when they surrendered following lengthy negotiations. 
Bundy remains in jail because he still faces charges in the standoff at his father’s Nevada ranch. 
Joel Hansen, Cliven Bundy’s attorney, said Friday that he thinks the jury in Oregon “saw through the lies” of a government that “is trying to prove these Bundybrothers and their compatriots were some kind of terrorists.” 
For Hansen and some others in the rural West, ownership of public land is a constitutional question that has not been settled. 
“There is a seething anger among those who use the land,” he said, citing the feelings of ranchers, loggers, miners and Indians. “It’s all part of tyrannical oppression. Their goal is to manage them out of business to get them off the land.” 
The Oregon occupiers had chosen, perhaps inadvertently, a part of Oregon where locals and the feds had a recent history of working together. Few who live near the sanctuary welcomed the occupiers, most of whom were from out of state. 
Not long before the takeover began on Jan. 2, locals and federal officials had determined the fate of large swaths of land, Harney County Judge Steve Grasty, the top local administrative official, said last summer in an interview. 
The High Desert Partnership in Harney County, a group that includes the Bureau of Land Management, the Nature Conservancy and timber business owners, had been working quietly to determine land stewardship, which Jewell credited in her statement on Friday.",0
19593,"Their Soil Toxic, 1,100 Indiana Residents Scramble to Find New Homes - The New York Times","EAST CHICAGO, Ind.  —   Stephanie King, a single mother of five, has adopted a grim routine over the past month: mopping with bleach twice a day and sweeping even more often to remove any dirt her family might have tracked inside. She has a haunted look, and for good reason. Ms. King and other residents of the West Calumet Housing Complex here learned recently that much of the soil outside their homes contained staggering levels of lead, one of the worst threats to children’s health. Ms. King’s    son, Josiah, has a worrisome amount of lead in his blood, according to test results she received last week. Like about 1, 100 other poor, largely black residents of West Calumet, including 670 children, she is scrambling to find a new home after Mayor Anthony Copeland of East Chicago announced last month that the residents had to move out and that the complex would be demolished. “If I’d have known the dirt had lead, he wouldn’t have been out there playing in it,” Ms. King, 35, said a few nights ago as Josiah begged to follow his older brothers outside. “Oh, my God, I’m ready to go. ” The extent of the contamination came as a shock to residents of the complex, even though it is just north of a huge former U. S. S. Lead smelting plant and on top of a smaller former smelting operation, in an area that was designated a Superfund site in 2009. Now, in a situation that many fearful residents are comparing to the water crisis in Flint, Mich. they are asking why neither the state nor the Environmental Protection Agency told them just how toxic their soil was much sooner, and a timeline is emerging that suggests a painfully slow government process of confronting the problem. The mayor’s sudden decision to raze the complex, which is run by the East Chicago Housing Authority, and close an adjacent elementary school turns on its head a plan the E. P. A. has had since 2012 to remove the contaminated soil without displacing residents. People in this heavily industrialized city just south of Chicago are also asking why their governor, Mike Pence, the Republican   nominee, visited flood victims in Baton Rouge, La. this month while campaigning with Donald J. Trump, but has not found time to come to East Chicago. Kara Brooks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Pence, wrote in an email that he had “directed his staff and cabinet to provide support to the federal government” there, and that some of his staff and cabinet members visited the area last week. But the most pressing question for residents is why they were not informed until last month that even the top six inches of soil in their yards had up to 30 times more lead than the level considered safe for children to play in, and that it also had hazardous levels of arsenic. Farther down, the contamination is much worse. There have been no satisfactory answers. A spokeswoman for the Indiana Department of Environmental Management said the E. P. A. was “the lead agency with the authority and responsibility for this site. ” Robert A. Kaplan, the E. P. A. ’s acting regional administrator for the Great Lakes region, said that for many years, cleanup efforts focused on the former smelting plant and not on nearby neighborhoods. In 2008, as the E. P. A. sought Superfund status for the plant and the surrounding area, tests of several dozen yards at and near the housing complex found some “hot spots,” Mr. Kaplan said, but also soil with lead “under the level we’d be concerned about. ” The E. P. A. removed soil from the   areas, he said, and did so again in 2011 after another round of limited testing. The E. P. A. began suing the companies responsible for the contamination in 2009, and by 2012 had a cleanup plan that involved removing all   and   soil from the housing complex. Extensive testing to figure out which soil needed to be removed did not begin until November 2014, Mr. Kaplan said. And the E. P. A. did not receive the final results showing “exactly where” the contamination was, he said, until this May. The delay, he said, was due to problems with the contractor the agency hired to tabulate the data and concerns about the data’s quality. “Our first priority after that was making sure every resident knew not to dig, not to be in contact with the soil,” Mr. Kaplan said. Since early June, he said, the E. P. A. has been covering bare soil in the complex with mulch going door to door with fliers and posting signs that warn, “Do not play in the dirt or around the mulch. ” The E. P. A. has also tested for lead in homes and offered to   them as a temporary measure. Mr. Kaplan said the E. P. A. had in fact warned West Calumet residents for at least a decade to avoid the soil, with public notices and community meetings. Mr. Kaplan said the hot spots discovered during preliminary testing had not created a sense of urgency partly because a 2011 federal assessment of the Superfund site concluded that “breathing the air, drinking tap water or playing in soil” in the area “is not expected to harm people’s health. ” When the E. P. A. gave the lead and arsenic data to city officials May 24, Mr. Copeland decided to seek to demolish the housing complex instead of moving ahead with the E. P. A. ’s soil removal plan. “I cannot multiply this enough times, to tell you the irreparable damage that can happen to your child,” Mr. Copeland told residents of the complex at a meeting Aug. 3. “I do not see how you can remove tons and tons of dirt and don’t aggravate the problem. ” Mr. Kaplan said the E. P. A. still believed that removing the contaminated soil was safe. But, he added, “we respect the mayor saying he wants to go a different way. ” Mr. Copeland’s office referred questions to Carla Morgan, the city attorney, who reiterated that the mayor had sought to relocate West Calumet residents as soon as he learned the specific lead and arsenic levels in their soil. Last week at the complex, which was built in 1972, some older residents said they resented being forced out, while many younger ones said they could not wait to move. Some, including Ms. King, were already packing. The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development has provided the East Chicago Housing Authority with $1. 9 million to help residents pay for new rentals in the city or anywhere in the country, starting next month. But many questions remain, including whether the city, state or federal government will cover residents’ moving expenses and security deposits and whether they will be able to find safe, affordable housing with the amounts they receive. So far, only $100, 000 has been allocated, by the state, for moving expenses. “I have a voucher for Sept. 1,” said Akeeshea Daniels, 40, who is waiting for lead test results on her    who has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and her    who ends up in the emergency room every few months with severe stomachaches. “But they all want deposits, large amounts, which I don’t have lying around. ” Ms. Daniels is named in a housing discrimination complaint, filed Tuesday by the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law in Chicago, that says the East Chicago Housing Authority’s plan for relocating residents violates federal civil rights laws. Jennifer O’Malley, a spokeswoman for the Indiana State Department of Health, said that since early July, 474 residents of the housing complex and surrounding neighborhoods had been screened for lead and that 29, including 19 children younger than 8, had elevated levels in their blood. But in a July 14 letter to the E. P. A. Mr. Copeland said preliminary tests had found that “hundreds of children suffer from excessive levels of lead in their blood,” according to The Times of Northwest Indiana. Shantel Allen, 27, who has lived at the complex for five years, said tests had shown that all five of her children, who range in age from 2 to 10, had alarmingly high levels of lead. She said she had been told that her yard had some of the highest lead and arsenic levels. “They show all the signs and symptoms of lead poisoning  —   they vomit randomly, have headaches,” said Ms. Allen, who said she had retained a lawyer. “Nobody’s given us any advice other than give them foods high in iron. ” Ms. Allen said that she would like to stay in East Chicago so her children could continue at their school, but that she would probably have to move. “Nobody wants to answer our questions,” she said. “They just want to give us a voucher and send us away. ” Standing on her front steps, Ms. Allen pressed her body against her front door to keep her    Samira, from running outside. But children were playing throughout the complex, including Kaelynn Lott, 4, who picked up a ball from a patch of dirt as her mother, Nayesa Walker, begged her to stay on the sidewalk. None of Ms. Walker’s three children have elevated blood levels, she said, but she is weary of trying to corral them inside their small apartment. “They’re just too young to understand why,” she said.",0
19594,Republican Senator Launches Disgusting Racist Attack On Veteran Challenger,"Comments 
Struggling Senator Mark Kirk (R-IL) stunned his opponent and his constituents during last night’s debate when he mocked the generations of military service that his Democratic rival’s family have given to this country because they are immigrants. 
Democratic candidate Tammy Duckworth lost both her legs during the Iraq War when a rocket struck the helicopter she was piloting. She knows what it means to fight and suffer serving America, but that wasn’t enough for Republican Senator from Illinois, who is down over 10 points in the polls . Lacking any reason for voters to choose him, the Republican insulted Congresswoman Duckworth to her face about, her ancestry, her military service and the service of generations of her family, which Politico reports happened like this: 
“My family has served this nation in uniform going back to the revolution. I am a daughter of the American Revolution. I’ve bled for this nation,” Duckworth said during the debate. “But I still want to be there in the Senate when the drums of war sound because people are quick to sound the drums of war and I want to be there to say this is what it costs and this is what you’re asking us to do.” 
Duckworth was born in Bangkok to a Thai mother, Lamai, and an American father, Frank, a U.S. Marine who traced his family’s military roots to the Revolutionary War. Frank Duckworth died in 2005. 
“I forgot your parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George Washington,” replied Republican Illinois Senator Mark Kirk. 
Congresswoman Duckworth was left completely speechless on stage after the Republican Senator’s incendiary personal attack. 
However, the Republican’s horrifying attack on the disabled veteran Congresswoman represents everything that he and his party of Trump’s GOP collaborators has become; a group of angry white men, lashing out in a bitterly cruel manner at women, and lashing out at veterans and lashing out at immigrants. 
Until this debate, Senator Kirk had been the most outspoken opponent in his own party of Republican nominee Donald Trump, but his vile moment of truth reveals that he has had one position in public this whole time, and quite another in private which his outburst exposed. Racism is part of the Republican Party’s genetic code and always has been. 
SEN. KIRK: I unendorse Trump 
GOP: See? Not all Republicans are like Trump. We have- 
SEN. KIRK: Mixed-race people aren’t real Americans

19595,Donald Trump Agrees to Pay $25 Million in Trump University Settlement - The New York Times,"Donald J. Trump has reversed course and agreed on Friday to pay $25 million to settle a series of lawsuits stemming from his defunct   education venture, Trump University, finally putting to rest fraud allegations by former students, which have dogged him for years and hampered his presidential campaign. The settlement was announced by the New York attorney general just 10 days before one of the cases, a federal   lawsuit in San Diego, was set to be heard by a jury. The deal averts a potentially embarrassing and highly unusual predicament: a   on trial, and possibly even taking the stand in his own defense, while scrambling to build his incoming administration. It was a remarkable concession from a real estate mogul who derides legal settlements and has mocked fellow businessmen who agree to them. But the allegations in the case were highly unpleasant for Mr. Trump: Students paid up to $35, 000 in tuition for a programs that, according to the testimony of former Trump University employees, used   sales tactics and employed unqualified instructors. The agreement wraps together the outstanding Trump University litigation, including two federal   cases in San Diego, and a separate lawsuit by Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general. The complaints alleged that students were cheated out of thousands of dollars in tuition through deceptive claims about what they would learn and   sales tactics. “I am pleased that under the terms of this settlement, every victim will receive restitution and that Donald Trump will pay up to $1 million in penalties to the State of New York for violating state education laws,” Mr. Schneiderman said in a statement. “The victims of Trump University have waited years for today’s result, and I am pleased that their patience  —   and persistence  —   will be rewarded by this $25 million settlement. ” The settlement is a significant reversal from Mr. Trump, who had steadfastly rejected the allegations and vowed to fight the lawsuits, asserting that students filled out evaluations showing they were mostly happy with what they had learned in seminars. When political opponents pressed him on the claims during the campaign, Mr. Trump doubled down, saying he would eventually reopen Trump University. “It’s something I could have settled many times,” Mr. Trump said during a debate in February. “I could settle it right now for very little money, but I don’t want to do it out of principle. ” He added, “The people that took the course all signed  —   most  —   many  —   many signed report cards saying it was fantastic, it was wonderful, it was beautiful. ” But the position of Mr. Trump and his legal team appeared to soften soon after his election victory on Nov. 8. At a hearing last week, Daniel Petrocelli, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, expressed interest in moving toward a settlement. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump’s lawyers were seeking to delay the trial in one of the California cases until after his inauguration on Jan. 20, while also requesting that he be allowed to testify on video. At a hearing on the case in San Diego on Friday, Mr. Petrocelli said Mr. Trump had settled the case “without an acknowledgment of fault or liability. ” The judge overseeing the two California cases, Gonzalo Curiel, was thrust into the limelight of the campaign in May when Mr. Trump spent several minutes at a rally denouncing the judge’s decisions in the case, calling him a “hater” and questioning his impartiality because of his Mexican heritage. After he faced days of criticism for his remarks on the judge, Mr. Trump released a statement saying his words had been “misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage. ” He also asserted that he was justified in questioning the fairness of his trial, given various rulings in the case that went against him. Still, he concluded, “we will win this case!” Judge Curiel said in court Friday that he hoped that the settlement agreement  —   and the end of the presidential campaign  —   would begin “a healing process that this country very sorely needs. ” Under the agreement, Mr. Trump will pay $21 million to settle the two California   suits and $4 million to settle with the New York attorney general. The lawyers for the plaintiffs waived their attorneys’ fees. The deal still has to be approved in court, which could take months. About 7, 000 students will share in the settlement, according to their lawyers. The customers will be eligible to recoup at least half of what they spent at Trump University, and some could receive a full refund, the lawyers said. Even before he was in the throes of his presidential bid, Mr. Trump began mounting a vigorous public defense of himself and Trump University. A website, 98percentapproval. com, touted high marks it received from students. A New York Times report in March, though, showed how some students recalled being pressured to give positive reviews. Trump University, which operated from 2004 to 2010, included free introductory seminars across the country, focusing largely on real estate investing and learning Mr. Trump’s secrets. Students could then purchase more expensive packages costing up to $35, 000. Documents made public through the litigation revealed that some former Trump University managers had given testimony about its unscrupulous and exploitative business practices. One sales executive testified that the operation was “a facade, a total lie. ” Another manager called it a “fraudulent scheme. ” Other records showed how Mr. Trump had overstated the depth of his involvement in the programs. Despite claims that Mr. Trump had handpicked instructors, he acknowledged in testimony that he had not. In addition to the financial rewards, the conclusion of the Trump University cases brings vindication to former students, mostly ordinary people across the country who felt they had been robbed of their savings by Mr. Trump, a successful businessman they respected and admired. One student, Jeffrey Tufenkian, who enrolled with his wife to pursue a real estate career, told The New York Times in 2011 that the experience “was almost completely worthless. ” “Trump University has no interest in taking care of its customers,” said Mr. Tufenkian, who paid $35, 000 for a “Gold Elite” class, which he said at the time wiped out much of his savings. Alan Garten, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, said Friday that his side was “pleased” with the settlement. “While we have no doubt that Trump University would have prevailed at trial based on the merits of this case, resolution of these matters allows   Trump to devote his full attention to the important issues facing our great nation,” he said in a statement.",0
19596,Hunt for Berlin Suspect Ends in Gunfire on an Italian Plaza - The New York Times,"SESTO SAN GIOVANNI, Italy  —   It was a routine identity check, the kind Italy has relied on to stem the flow of illegal migration deeper into Europe. But the man stopped by two police officers around 3 a. m. Friday outside the northern city of Milan was anything but an ordinary drifter. He turned out to be perhaps Europe’s most wanted man, Anis Amri, the chief suspect in the deadly terrorist attack on a Christmas market in Berlin that killed 12 people. Asked to show his papers and empty his backpack, he pulled out a gun, shot one officer, and in turn was shot and killed by another. “Police bastards,” Mr. Amri, who turned 24 this week, shouted in Italian before dying, according to the account given by Antonio De Iesu, director of the Milan police, at a news conference. For Italy, the shooting death of Mr. Amri, a Tunisian who had pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State’s supreme leader in a video released by the group on Friday, spurred a moment of national pride and some reassurance that its security measures were working. For Germany, it brought a sense of palpable relief after a week of national anguish. “Now I can wish you all a really peaceful Christmas,” the German interior minister, Thomas de Maizière, told reporters Friday afternoon, as he thanked his Italian counterparts. But the death also raised numerous questions about Mr. Amri’s movements and motivations, as well as about the potential gaps in the security of a Europe with open borders. Law enforcement authorities issued a   warrant on Wednesday for Mr. Amri, who migrated to Italy in 2011 and was imprisoned for four years in six different prisons in Sicily before making his way to Germany in 2015. Italy officially classified Mr. Amri as a terrorism risk after he threatened to decapitate a Christian cellmate in prison in Palermo in 2014, according to Lorenzo Vidino, who chairs an Italian commission of experts on radicalization that was formed this fall. “He was basically a troublemaker, very aggressive and very violent. And then from there, he starts a whole trajectory,” said Mr. Vidino, who said that the Tunisian migrant was arrested soon after his arrival by boat on the Italian island of Lampedusa in 2011, after    arson episodes. “He establishes a track record of bad behavior, which at the beginning was just aggressive and threatening and disrespectful. But in the last place, where he was held in a   prison in Palermo, he showed signs of radicalism. ” The threat to his cellmate was considered serious enough that officials added him to Italy’s database of radicalized individuals, a list that includes only a few hundred names, said Mr. Vidino, who is also the director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University. Both Italy and Germany tried to deport him to Tunisia but were thwarted by a lack of documents and cooperation from his home country. Even after Mr. Amri was named as the prime suspect in the attack in Berlin, he was able to roam freely around Europe, his face plastered across the news media and a reward of more than $100, 000 on his head. “This mobility is great for the   and equally great for the  ” said Douglas H. Wise, a former senior C. I. A. officer, of the borderless travel within the European Union. What Mr. Amri did in the four days between the attack in Berlin and when he was ultimately killed in Sesto San Giovanni, a suburb north of central Milan, is not clear, but that is now the subject of an intense investigation that the authorities remain reluctant to discuss. Asked on Friday when exactly the authorities began to view Mr. Amri as a suspect, the head of Germany’s federal criminal police, Holger Münch, restated in general terms that it was on Tuesday, after investigators found an identity document in a wallet in the cab of the   used in the attack. The police have not said why the wallet was not discovered on Monday, when the attack occurred and a murdered driver was found in the cab. On Friday, Mr. Münch for the first time mentioned that an alias was involved, but he said the police had quickly linked it to Mr. Amri. In Italy, Mr. Vidino said that a train ticket found on Mr. Amri’s body showed that he had traveled by train to Turin in Italy from the French town of Chambéry, near the border between the two nations. But there is no trail suggesting how he got from Berlin to Chambéry. A senior European counterterrorism official said that the delay in identifying Mr. Amri probably gave him a crucial head start of several hours to flee Germany, and that he would have been able to buy a train ticket to France and Italy without showing identification papers.   software on surveillance cameras in Europe is still in rudimentary form in most places, the official said, so even after Mr. Amri was identified, he could have slipped through the train stations undetected, especially if he was wearing a hat or hood. Mr. Amri’s ability to hide through the week and make his way from Germany, through France, to Italy also raised questions of whether he had the help of a broader network, particularly one possibly linked to the Islamic State. The group called Mr. Amri “a soldier” in the video released on Friday, in which Mr. Amri proclaimed loyalty to its leader, Abu Bakr   and declared that the attack in Berlin was intended to avenge coalition airstrikes in Syria that have killed civilians. The video was evidently filmed in the Moabit district of northern Berlin, on the Kieler bridge. The autumn foliage seen on trees suggested it was filmed in fall or even early December. In Germany, Mr. Amri came on the radar of the authorities in part for suspected ties to a      Salafist preacher who went by the name Abu Walaa and who was jailed just weeks ago on suspicion of recruiting fighters to join the Islamic State. “There is high suspicion that he was behind the departure of a number of Germans to Syria  —   as many as two dozen  —   but the intelligence is not clear as to his exact role, whether in radicalization, recruitment or terror financing,” said Laith Alkhouri, a director at Flashpoint, a business risk intelligence company in New York that tracks militant and cyber threats. In a telephone call from the suspect’s hometown in Tunisia, Mr. Amri’s older brother, Walid, said that the family wondered whether he became radicalized while in jail in Italy. After his brother was released, he informed the family that he was leaving for Germany “with friends he had made in jail,” Walid Amri said. Also unknown is whether Mr. Amri had any accomplices in the Berlin attack  —   a question that Peter Frank, Germany’s top federal prosecutor, identified as a priority for investigators. “It is very important now to determine if there was a network of cooperators, a network of supporters, accessories or assistants helping him to prepare the attack, execute the attack and also to escape,” he said at a news conference on Friday in Karlsruhe, Germany. The only uncertainty that seemed to be settled on Friday was that the man killed was indeed Mr. Amri. “There is absolutely no doubt that the person who was killed was Anis Amri, the suspect in the terrorist attack in Berlin,” the Italian interior minister, Marco Minniti, said at a news conference. “As soon as this person entered our country, he was the most wanted man in Europe, and we immediately identified him and neutralized him,” Mr. Minniti said. “This means that our security is working really well. ” Some analysts, however, said that Mr. Amri’s flight over the past 72 hours from German to Italy through France underscored Europe’s porous border controls. “Terrorists with multiple false identification documents are able to exploit Europe’s open borders. Just as Amri arrived in Europe and moved almost seamlessly around the continent before the Berlin attack, he was able to do the same after it,” said Seth G. Jones, a terrorism specialist at the RAND Corporation. Mr. Amri traveled from Turin to Central Station in Milan, where he arrived around 1 a. m. Friday. Surveillance cameras in the Milan train station recorded Mr. Amri’s movements, Italian investigators said. It was not clear how Mr. Amri made his way to Sesto San Giovanni, about four miles away. “How he traveled there and what he was doing there are subject to delicate investigations,” Mr. De Iesu, of the Milan police, said at the news conference. “We have to understand whether he was in transit or was awaiting someone. ” Sesto San Giovanni is a “a strategic hub for transportation,” the town’s deputy mayor, Andrea Rivolta, said in an interview at city hall. “Sesto is a junction for the railway system, the Milan metro, municipal buses and buses that reach all of Europe,” as well as southern Italy. According to the account provided by Mr. De Iesu, Mr. Amri was standing alone on a piazza in Sesto San Giovanni, next to the northern terminus of a subway line. When the officers stopped him and asked for identification, he responded, in good Italian with a North African accent, that he was not carrying any documents on him. They asked him to empty his pockets and backpack. He was carrying a small knife and the equivalent of a few hundred dollars, but no cellphone. But then he pulled out a pistol, Mr. De Iesu said. “It was a regular patrol, under the new system of intensified police checks on the territory,” he said. “They had no perception that it could be him, otherwise they’d have been more careful. ” The officer whom Mr. Amri shot, identified as Cristian Movio, was wounded in the shoulder and had surgery on Friday. The other officer, who shot Mr. Amri, was identified as Luca Scatà.",0
19597,"Tumbler ""Come to the Edge"" Underground Examinations Music Review · Guardian Liberty Voice","Youth blood thrives through the alternative rock band Tumbler, who recently released their second studio album, Come to the Edge . Recorded in Epsom, England, this acoustic passion project sounds like a mix between The Kinks and The Beatles, along with a few elements from pop thrown in for modern taste.
Just as interesting as the genre composition, is the band composition. Richard Grace, has led a family of music for ages. Both him and son, Harry Grace, play guitar and sing on Come to the Edge . This project comes after the positive acceptance of their debut album You Said , in 2015. The album proved to be a powerful experience that would spur Tumbler to finish an entire second album with ideas they created along the way. The work payed off, Come to the Edge sounds pristine and polished, it sounds passionate and somber, it sounds like lessons and living life.

Harry Grace is the young star of the band. Following in his father’s footsteps from a young age, Harry wrote his first guitar song when he was only eight years old. Music has stuck with him over the years, in his teen years in played in multiple bands on bass, drums, vocals and most things in between. Tumbler actually came about when Harry suggested they put some professional work into their family kitchen gatherings. With such a strong musician to follow it is no wonder Harry is improving so rapidly.
The final participant of the project, David Needham, along with playing the keyboard, also produced the album, adding his technical expertise to hot-pot that was the Grace family’s passion and experience. The album has so much work behind it, Come to the Edge has a lot to going for it, this is apparent from even a short listen from songs like “Don’t Take Much” or “Falling.”
“Looking back there were cracks, but not so clearly at the time.”
Come to the Edge really sounds like passion for the sake of passion, not music for the sake of money. This becomes really apparent when band members talk about the project. Emerging from family get togethers were old songs they would sing decades ago, the song “Joanne” is one such example, but with the help of producer David Needham bringing strings and other instruments into the song, it has changed greatly.
“I won’t run from this house we built from stone”
The vocal work sounds like a mixture of new and traditional, some lines lead right into the next, while others repeat and loop as expected. Both Harry and Richard have their own singing style, they accompany each other with grace, but write in different ways. With multiple talented singers, there is usually a voice guiding the way.
The music fans that will take the most out of Come to the Edge are likely also musicians, or at the very least hold an appreciation for harmonious vocals and acoustic guitar. That being said, the album has different atmospheres across different tracks, songs such as “Winter Cold Heart” sound somber while others such as “Sweetest Thing” sound carefree, as for the vocal spotlight “Week” would be a strong contender.

From the looks of it Tumbler is growing steadily. They have the potential and the drive to continue giving life to music and only time will tell how they choose to do that. Come to the Edge dropped July 26, 2016 and can be found in the links below.

19598,German Panzers to Rumble Once More Along Russian Borders,"Citizen journalism with a punch German Panzers to Rumble Once More Along Russian Borders 
Germany confirms it will be sending Leopard 2 tanks to Lithuania Originally appeared at Defence Talk 
Germany has confirmed it is sending Leopard 2 tanks to Lithuania as part of NATO plans to reinforce the Baltic states. But the presence is largely symbolic, since Russia is still militarily superior in the region. 
Protecting Lithuania from Russia is to be Germany’s responsibility, according to the new NATO defense plans that emerged at this week’s summit in Brussels. The German Defense Ministry showed on Wednesday evening just how seriously it is taking this task, confirming to the DPA news agency that next year it will be sending Leopard 2 tanks to the Baltic country’s Russian border in addition to the 650 soldiers it had already promised – though it would not clarify how many. 
The move is part of NATO’s wider plan to protect its Baltic members, who have all shown concern about Russian ambitions following the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the subsequent war in eastern Ukraine. 
A NATO battalion of around 1,000 soldiers will be stationed in Lithuania as of June next year, and will then be rotated every six months. Around 450 to 650 of these troops are to be supplied by the Bundeswehr, while the others will come from France, Belgium and Croatia. German media reported that the combat-trained unit will also be equipped with tanks, armored vehicles, snipers, and engineers. 
Defending the defensive measures 
Each of the alliance’s major powers is sending troops to bolster the defenses of the countries bordering Russia, so while Germany is helping Lithuania, Poland will be protected by the US, Latvia to be manned by the Canadians, and Britain is to help reinforce Estonia. 
The plans are likely to further antagonize Russia, whose government has criticized NATO’s military plans in the region before. “The alliance is concentrating its forces on limiting a non-existent threat from the East,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in the summer. 
German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen defended the measures, calling the deployment “exactly appropriate” and “defensive.”“This is a clear signal that an attack on one NATO country will be considered an attack on all 28 NATO countries,” she said.NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also indicated that the mission was a response to Russian aggression. “Russia is prepared to use its military power,” he said in Brussels. “It is necessary for NATO to answer that.” 
Gustav Gressel, Russia specialist at the European Council on Foreign Relations, believes that NATO’s new plans are actually fairly measured, given the circumstances. “Russia still enjoys military superiority in that area of about five-to-one,” he told DW. “It’s not at all an offensive threat against the Russians – but rather a cautious, small-scale reaction to the build-up and military mobilization Russia has been undergoing. It doesn’t change the military balance in the Baltics.” 
Stoltenberg said NATO had no choice but to respond 
In fact, the Baltic states would have liked NATO to commit more troops to their border areas, Gressel argued. “Since 2009, Russia has trained its forces in scenarios of invading the Baltic countries,” he said. “For the Baltic countries, this is a real thing, this is not something that might at some point happen.” 
Even though it is economically isolated and can ill afford to take new territory, Russia’s political system requires shows of military power for its own population, Gressel argued. “It is increasingly difficult to predict what Russia will do, or when Russia will perceive military provocation. So you’d rather be on the safe side and signal to Russia that there is no free ride in the Baltics.” 
But at the same time, NATO is trying to strike a balance. “You have to hedge against the risk that Russia gets adventurous,” he said. “But on the other hand, you don’t want to maneuver Russia into its self-fulfilling prophecies of a threat. In my view, Russia’s saber-rattling is for domestic consumption and their military knows that NATO is not going to invade.” 
Germany has contributed to NATO’s biggest rearmament drive since the end of the Cold War, last year ordering an extra 100 Leopard 2 tanks – mostly by modifying previously decommissioned vehicles. At the same time, the upper limit of 225 tanks that had been agreed as part of the military reform of 2011 was increased to 328.",0
19599,The Murky Future of Nuclear Power in the United States - The New York Times,"This was supposed to be America’s nuclear century. The Three Mile Island meltdown was two generations ago. Since then, engineers had developed innovative designs to avoid the kinds of failures that devastated Fukushima in Japan. The United States government was earmarking billions of dollars for a new atomic age, in part to help tame a warming global climate. But a remarkable confluence of events is bringing that to an end, capped in recent days by Toshiba’s decision to take a $6 billion loss and pull Westinghouse, its American nuclear power subsidiary, out of the construction business. The reasons are  . Against expectations, demand for electricity has slowed.   prices have tumbled, eroding nuclear power’s economic rationale.   sources like wind and solar power have come into their own. And, perhaps most significantly, attempts to square two   forces  —   the desire for greater safety, and the need to contain costs  —   while bringing to life complex new designs have blocked or delayed nearly all of the projects planned in the United States. “You can make it go fast, and you can make it be cheap  —   but not if you adhere to the standard of care that we do,” said Mark Cooper of the Institute for Energy and the Environment at Vermont Law School, referring to the United States regulatory body, which is considered one of the most meticulous in the world. “Nuclear safety always undermines nuclear economics. Inherently, it’s a technology whose time never comes. ” In the process, the United States could lose considerable influence over standards governing safety and waste management, nuclear experts say. And the world may show less willingness to move toward potentially safer designs. “I’m concerned that if the U. S. is not seen as a big player, and doesn’t have that kind of market presence, that we won’t be in a competitive position to bring those standards back up,” said Richard Nephew, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia. “If you’ve got more lax safety standards worldwide, I think that’s a problem from an industry perspective as well as just a human standard. ” This may be an advantage for   nuclear industries worldwide. Often they benefit from   national policies in places like Eastern Europe, Asia and the Middle East. By contrast, the   withdrawal from nuclear construction shows how daunting it can be for the private sector to build these plants, even with generous government subsidies like loan guarantees and tax credits. Projects take decades to complete. Safety concerns change along the way, leading to new regulations, thousands of design alterations, delays and spiraling costs for every element. In one case, even the dirt used to backfill excavated holes at the Westinghouse project in Georgia became a point of contention when it did not measure up to Nuclear Regulatory Commission standards, leading to increased costs and a lawsuit. Thus far in the United States, only the Tennessee Valley Authority, itself a government corporation, has been able to bring a new nuclear reactor into operation in the last 20 years. Of the dozens of new reactors once up for licensing with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, only four are actively under construction. Two are at the Alvin W. Vogtle generating station in Georgia, and two at the Virgil C. Summer plant in South Carolina. Both projects, which plan to use a novel reactor from Westinghouse, have been plagued by delays and cost overruns, some stemming, paradoxically, from an untested regulatory system intended to simplify and accelerate their development. The projects, more than three years late and billions over budget, are what pushed Westinghouse  —   one of the last private companies building nuclear reactors  —   and its parent, Toshiba, to the brink of financial ruin, resulting in Toshiba’s chairman stepping down. The company has said that Westinghouse will complete the reactors for the projects it already has underway, including two in China. But the fate of other projects in the United States and abroad that plan to use the Westinghouse reactor, known as the AP1000, are in doubt, along with the role of the United States in the future of nuclear energy. It is also unclear how President Trump will approach nuclear energy development, which has broad and overlapping implications for tax and trade policies, economic development and national security. The AP1000 is considered one of the world’s most advanced reactors, with simplified structures and safety equipment which were intended to make it easier and less expensive to install, operate and maintain. It has been designed with an improved ability to withstand earthquakes and plane crashes and is less vulnerable to a cutoff of electricity, which is what set off the triple meltdown at Fukushima. The industry has lurched through boom and bust cycles before. Nuclear construction had all but disappeared in the United States, particularly after the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979. Concerns over climate change led to renewed interest in building new plants under the administration of George W. Bush, however. The   energy policy acts authorized $18. 5 billion in loan guarantees, plus tax credits like those available for wind and solar. Determined to avoid the delays and ballooning costs that were common as plants were built in the 1970s and ’80s, federal regulators had devised a new licensing process. Under the old system, companies received construction permits based on incomplete plans and then applied for an operating license, often leading to rebuilding and lengthy delays. The idea for the new system was that companies would submit much more complete design plans for approval, and then receive their operating licenses as construction started. That way, as long as they built exactly what they said they would, the process could move more quickly. In the meantime, companies like Westinghouse and General Electric were developing a new generation of reactors intended to operate more safely. With the AP1000, for instance, emergency cooling for the reactor mainly relies on natural forces, like gravity, to propel the coolant, rather than relying on mechanical pumps powered by electricity. The problem is that electricity can fail, as it did at Fukushima, which can lead to disastrous overheating in a damaged reactor of an older design. In addition, Westinghouse was engineering its equipment so that large components of the plants could be made in sections at factories, then welded together and lifted into place with cranes at the construction site. In theory, this approach would save money and time, requiring far less skilled labor than the old, bespoke approach, in which workers assembled more parts onsite. By 2008, Westinghouse had deals to expand two existing plants with the electric utilities Georgia Power and South Carolina Electric  Gas. Little went as hoped. Because nuclear construction had been dormant for so long, American companies lacked the equipment and expertise needed to make some of the biggest components, like the   reactor vessels. Instead, they were manufactured overseas, adding to expense and delays. One reactor vessel, headed for Georgia Power’s Vogtle plant from the Port of Savannah, almost slipped off a specialized rail car. That led to a weekslong delay before a second attempt was made to deliver it. And, in a separate snafu, while working on the plant’s basement contractors installed 1, 200 tons of steel reinforcing bar in a way that differed from the approved design. That triggered a     month delay to get a license amendment. To some extent, the unexpected delays were to be, well, expected, given the novelty of the design and the fact that builders were decades out of practice. Any large undertaking involving so many     complexities would be likely get tripped up somewhere, said Daniel S. Lipman, vice president of supplier and international programs at the Nuclear Energy Institute, which represents the industry. “Whether you’re building a nuclear power plant or providing a new locomotive or a new fighter jet complex for the Defense Department, the first of a kind almost always takes longer to be deployed,” he said. And then there was Fukushima, when an earthquake and tsunami knocked out both grid and backup emergency power at the plant, disabling its cooling systems and leading to the meltdown of three reactors. The plant remains shut down, and the decommissioning and cleanup process is projected to take as long as 40 years. The Japan disaster prompted regulators to revisit safety standards, slowing approval of the Westinghouse designs and resulting in new requirements even after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission gave the   for the Georgia and South Carolina projects. That led to more costly delays as manufacturing orders had to be changed. As all of that unfolded, Westinghouse was having troubles with the contractor it chose to complete the projects, a company that struggled to meet the strict demands of nuclear construction and was undergoing its own internal difficulties after a merger. As part of an effort to get the delays and escalating costs under control, Westinghouse acquired part of the construction company, which set off a series of   disputes over who should absorb the cost overruns and how Westinghouse accounted for and reported values in the transaction. Toshiba, which would like to sell all or part of its controlling interest in Westinghouse, has said it will continue to look into Westinghouse’s handling of the purchase. “Certainly they underestimated the amount of liability or cost overruns that these projects were in,” Robert Norfleet, a managing director at Alembic Global Advisors who has followed the machinations, said of Westinghouse. “I don’t really know how they can’t take the blame for that. That’s something within their own due diligence that they needed to do. ” In the meantime, the main stage for nuclear development will move overseas to places like China, Russia, India, Korea and a handful of countries in the Middle East, where Westinghouse will have to find partners to build its designs. In China, plants using an earlier model of the AP1000 are moving toward completion. If they are successful, that may stir up more interest in the technology, and future installations may go more smoothly. But Toshiba’s ambitions of installing 45 new reactors worldwide by 2030 no longer look feasible. Indeed, despite the   ingenuity of a new generation of reactors designed by the likes of Westinghouse and G. E. countries may stick with older technologies that they can produce and install more quickly and cheaply. “Until several of these new designs  —   including the AP1000 from Westinghouse  —   come online on time and on budget,” said Brent Wanner, an analyst at the International Energy Agency, “it will be an uphill battle. ”",0
19600,Fox News Channel Cancels ’Red Eye’ - Breitbart,"Fox News Channel has canceled its     news program Red Eye. [According to AdWeek‘s TVNewser, which first broke the news, the last episode of Red Eye will air Friday, April 7 at 3 a. m.  The irreverent news program with the    timeslot launched in 2007 with host Greg Gutfeld, who left the show in 2015. Breitbart News founder Andrew Breitbart played a pivotal role in Red Eye‘s inception. Breitbart was a frequent guest on the program, which also regularly featured Gutfeld’s “repulsive sidekick” Bill Schulz, “ombudsman” Andy Levy and Tom Shillue, who became permanent host of the show in 2015. In a 2012 segment honoring the late conservative icon, Gutfeld said that Red Eye “would not exist” without Breitbart’s involvement. “It was him who talked to Fox to get me a job,” Gutfeld explained shortly after Breitbart’s passing. “I was living in England, and he talked to people at Fox. I met with people at Fox, and the next thing you know it was Red Eye. And everybody here who’s sitting here  …     we never would have met if it wasn’t for Andrew Breitbart bringing us together, because that’s what Breitbart does. ” The March 2, 2012 episode of Red Eye was dedicated to Breitbart, with the show airing clips of the late conservative icon’s most memorable appearances. In a column for Breitbart News following his departure, Gutfeld said Red Eye was successful because of a “beautiful deal made between its staff and its viewers. ” “The Redeye gang would refuse to underestimate the viewer’s intelligence, and the viewers would forgive us for our incoherence,” Gutfeld explained. “We attracted people that we would drink with, given the chance. These were late night types  —   up in the lonely hours for different reasons. Some had graveyard shifts. Others were nursing moms. Many, I learned were sick  —   or in hospitals, desperate for a distraction. ” According to TVNewser, current Red Eye hosts Tom Shillue and Andy Levy will remain with Fox News. A representative for Fox News Channel said the show’s 3 a. m. slot would be filled by repeats of Tucker Carlson Tonight.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum",0
19601,John Kerry Is Said to Side With Diplomats’ Critical Memo on Syria - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   For a cabinet member whose department had just erupted into open disagreement with the White House, Secretary of State John Kerry’s reaction to a critical memo on Syria policy signed by 51 diplomats was remarkably mellow. “It’s an important statement,” he told reporters in Copenhagen on Friday, “and I respect the process very, very much. ” Mr. Kerry’s mild tone could be explained by the fact that he had not yet read the document. Or maybe it was because the “dissent channel” is a prized institution at the State Department  —   one that guarantees employees a way to air objections without fear of reprisal. But the most plausible explanation is that Mr. Kerry more or less agreed with his diplomats. Their urgent call for the United States to take stronger military action against President Bashar   of Syria closely resembles the arguments that administration officials say Mr. Kerry has been making in Situation Room debates as he has tried to force Mr. Assad to abide by a   and agree to a transition of power. Mr. Kerry, these officials said, has told President Obama that he is operating without any leverage in Syria, and that unless the United States increases the pressure on Mr. Assad, the embattled leader will simply wait out the end of Mr. Obama’s term. “For quite some time, Secretary Kerry has had real reservations about the president’s approach to Syria,” said Frederic C. Hof, a former special adviser to the administration on Syria who works for the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank. “His mellow reaction might indicate sympathy. ” But he added, “It might also indicate a desire not to breathe oxygen into the story. ” To the extent that Mr. Kerry differs from the authors of the memo, said an official familiar with his thinking, it is that he would consider a wide range of military operations to alter the equation in Syria’s civil war. The memo simply recommends that the United States carry out targeted airstrikes on Mr. Assad as a way to force him into negotiations. Few analysts expect Mr. Obama to shift his policy, which makes the military campaign against the Islamic State a priority, rather than any efforts to oust Mr. Assad. Mr. Obama’s military commanders back that position, arguing that removing the Syrian leader would leave a dangerous security vacuum. They also worry about a more direct conflict between the United States and Russia, which began to use air power last fall to bolster Mr. Assad. “We are always open to new and different ideas when it comes to the challenges in Syria,” Jennifer Friedman, deputy White House press secretary, said to reporters traveling with Mr. Obama on a weekend family tour of national parks in New Mexico and California. But Ms. Friedman added that “the president has always been clear that he does not see a military solution to the crisis in Syria, and that remains the case. ” Still, the disclosure of the memo could roil the waters in an election year. The presumptive Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, has tried to tie his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, to what he calls the foreign policy failures of Mr. Obama, whom she served as secretary of state. Neither Mr. Trump nor Mrs. Clinton directly addressed the memo on Friday. But Mrs. Clinton has staked out a tougher position on Syria than Mr. Obama  —   and, in some respects, than the diplomats who signed the memo. They advocate a “judicious use of standoff and air weapons” against Mr. Assad’s forces. She would impose a   zone over northern Syria  —   a much more extensive military operation  —   to protect civilians from Mr. Assad’s bombardment and to increase pressure on him to enter negotiations. While Mrs. Clinton has said little about the proposal in recent weeks, people familiar with her position said she still favored it. The memo also served to underscore the differences between the United States and its allies in the region over how to deal with Mr. Assad. Both Saudi Arabia and Turkey have argued for making his removal a top priority, while the United States has kept the focus on the Islamic State. The Saudi foreign minister, Adel   who is visiting Washington, said Friday he heartily supported the conclusions of the State Department memo. “Yes, yes, yes,” he said. “We have been arguing from the beginning of the Syrian crisis that there should be more robust intervention in Syria, including airstrikes,” he said at a news conference. Only more aggressive military approach, he said, could “change the balance of power” and lead to a political settlement. The administration has discouraged open dissent on issues of war and peace. But White House officials insisted Mr. Obama was not angered by the disclosure of the memo. Ms. Friedman said it was predictable that there would be a wide range of views about an issue as thorny as Syria. Some Syria experts said the recommendations in the draft memo were quite conservative. “They are not advocating invasion or occupation,” Mr. Hof said. “They are not calling for a strategic bombing campaign. They are not asking for piloted American aircraft to go up against the Russians or even the regime. What they are suggesting is the consideration of using standoff capabilities  —   cruise missiles  —   to make Assad’s application of mass homicide something other than a free ride. ” The State Department said five dissent cables were filed in 2014 and 2015. Even though the process is sanctioned and Mr. Kerry appeared to be unruffled by the leak, Mr. Hof said the 51 officials who signed the memo had taken a considerable professional risk. “They no doubt feel the moral responsibility for having facilitated policies they know to be wrongheaded, counter to American interests, and disastrous for Syrians, their neighbors, and for Western European allies,” he said. “We owe them a lot. ” In the 1990s, Secretary of State Warren Christopher expressed frustration when dissent cables about the Clinton administration’s Balkans policy were leaked. And in 1971, when American diplomats in Dhaka, in what was then East Pakistan, sent the first formal dissent cable  —   condemning the Nixon administration’s policy toward East Pakistan  —   officials at the White House and the State Department exploded in rage, even though the cable was not public. “Henry was just furious about it,” said Samuel Hoskinson, a junior aide to Henry Kissinger, Nixon’s national security adviser, as quoted in the book “The Blood Telegram,” by Gary J. Bass.",0

19603,"One Weight-Loss Approach Fits All? No, Not Even Close - The New York Times","Dr. Frank Sacks, a professor of nutrition at Harvard, likes to challenge his audience when he gives lectures on obesity. “If you want to make a great discovery,” he tells them, figure out this: Why do some people lose 50 pounds on a diet while others on the same diet gain a few pounds? Then he shows them data from a study he did that found exactly that effect. Dr. Sacks’s challenge is a question at the center of obesity research today. Two people can have the same amount of excess weight, they can be the same age, the same socioeconomic class, the same race, the same gender. And yet a treatment that works for one will do nothing for the other. The problem, researchers say, is that obesity and its precursor  —   being overweight  —   are not one disease but instead, like cancer, they are many. “You can look at two people with the same amount of excess body weight and they put on the weight for very different reasons,” said Dr. Arya Sharma, medical director of the obesity program at the University of Alberta. Not only can that explain why treatment is so difficult and results so wildly variable, but it can explain why prevention efforts often fail. If obesity is many diseases, said Dr. Lee Kaplan, director of the obesity, metabolism and nutrition institute at Massachusetts General Hospital, there can be many paths to the same outcome. It makes as much sense to insist there is one way to prevent all types of obesity  —   get rid of sugary sodas, clear the stores of junk foods, shun carbohydrates, eat breakfast, get more sleep  —   as it does to say you can avoid lung cancer by staying out of the sun, a strategy specific to skin cancer. One focus of research is to figure out how many types of obesity there are  —   Dr. Kaplan counts 59 so far  —   and how many genes can contribute. So far, investigators have found more than 25 genes with such powerful effects that if one is mutated, a person is pretty much guaranteed to become obese, said Dr. Stephen O’Rahilly, head of the department of clinical biochemistry and medicine at Cambridge University. But those genetic disorders are rare. It is more likely that people inherit a collection of genes, each of which predispose them to a small weight gain in the right environment, said Ruth Loos, director of the genetics of obesity and related metabolic traits program at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Scientists have found more than 300 such altered genes  —   each may contribute just a few pounds but the effects add up in those who inherit a collection of them, Dr. Loos said. There are also drugs that, in some people, can cause weight gain. They include medications for psychiatric disorders, some drugs for diabetes, some for seizure disorders, beta blockers to lower blood pressure and slow the heart rate, and steroids to suppress the immune system, for example. People taking them, however, may not realize the drugs are part of their problem. Instead, they blame themselves for a lack of   as their weight climbs. Certain diseases also cause weight gain, Dr. O’Rahilly noted. They include hypothyroidism, Cushing’s syndrome and tumors of the hypothalamus. To help people find an effective way to lose weight, obesity medicine specialists say they start by asking if there is an obvious cause for a person’s excess weight, like a drug that can be switched for something else. If not, they suggest patients try one thing after another starting with the least invasive option, and hope something works. “There are 40 therapies I can throw at a patient,” Dr. Kaplan said. “I will try diets and aerobic exercise and sleep enhancement. I have 15 drugs. ” Dr. Caroline Apovian, director of the nutrition and weight management center at Boston Medical Center, said most people can lose weight but keeping it off is the key. For most, she said, finding something that works “is still trial and error. ” Andrea Gardner, a registered nurse who lives in Weymouth, Mass. is in the midst of that process. She has tried one diet after another, losing weight and gaining it back. She is 5 feet 5 inches tall, and her body, she says, seems to want to settle at a weight of about 185 pounds, which is not acceptable to her. She continues to work with Dr. Apovian, ever hopeful that this time a diet and, she said, willpower, will do the trick. But about 15 to 20 percent of patients respond to measures short of surgery, with response defined as a change in their body weight that is maintained without constant hunger or cravings. While people seldom end up thin, their permanent weight loss is a proof of principle, showing that treatments can lower the weight the brain forces a person to maintain. The last resort, for those whose obesity is extreme, is bariatric surgery, which elicits a permanent and substantial weight loss in almost everyone. In the meantime, there is Dr. Sacks’s challenge. His study involved 811 overweight and obese adults, randomly assigned to follow one of four diets and undergo behavioral counseling to help them stick to their diets. The diets ranged over the span of what has become popular. Two diets were low in fat but one   diet was high in protein and the other had average amounts of protein. Two others were high in fat and one of those   diets had an average amount of protein while the other was high in protein. The research was designed to answer the question of whether one diet was any better than another and it provided an answer: None of the diets elicited much weight loss on average, and no diet stood out from the others. But buried in those averages were the outliers: In every one of the four diet groups were a few superresponders who dropped huge amounts of weight and a few nonresponders who did not lose any. And as soon as his paper on the diets was published, with the conclusion that no diet stood out and none elicited much of a weight loss, he started hearing from people who challenged him. “People would say, ‘How can you say all these diets have no effect when I lost 100 pounds on diet X?’ Others would say the same thing about the opposite diet. ” Dr. Sacks believes them. He knows people who have lost weight and kept it off with diets, including a colleague in his department. “He lost 30 or 40 pounds in the 1970s and kept it off all these years,” Dr. Sacks said. But why him and not someone else following the same regimen? “Beats me,” Dr. Sacks said. Every obesity medicine specialist has seen it happen  —   someone repeatedly tried and failed to lose weight and keep it off. It turned out they were trying the wrong thing. Here are some people who finally found a   plan that worked. Connie Anne Phillips’s weight inched up gradually in adulthood and her attempts to control it went nowhere. As publisher and chief revenue officer at Glamour magazine, she was always entertaining clients, hosting them at breakfasts, lunches and dinners. Weight loss seemed an impossibility. In 2011, she went to Dr. Louis Aronne, an obesity medicine specialist at    Cornell Medicine Center in Manhattan. He suggested a   plan that would allow her to maintain her lifestyle. The key was a low glycemic load diet, choosing foods to keep her blood sugar from spiking. “I just had to learn to make the right choices,” Ms. Phillips, 51, said. She learned to eat protein before carbohydrates. It was O. K. that she loves pasta, but now she precedes it with a piece of broiled fish or grilled chicken. “Now I would never start my day with a glass of juice and a bagel. ” Ms. Phillips said. Instead, she has egg whites with vegetables or   Greek yogurt. Twenty pounds melted away and she has kept them off without effort. When he arrived for his first appointment with an obesity medicine specialist in April 2014, Scott Goldshine was certain his only hope was bariatric surgery. He had been skinny when he was younger  —   his nickname was Bones  —   but around age 30 he began putting on weight and simply could not halt the relentless accumulation of pounds. Soon he weighed 265 pounds. He is 5 feet 7 inches. “I was a miserable human being,” Mr. Goldshine, 56, said. So he scoffed when Dr. Aronne said, “I think I can help you. ” He was  —   and still is  —   the general manager at Zabar’s, a famous New York deli, spending his days around food he loves. And his cravings were relentless. “I couldn’t go behind the bread counter without taking a couple of slices of bread and a couple of rugelach,” he said. But that was only the start. There was the “big fat piece of crumb cake” almost every day. There were the cookies he’d grab from the catering platters. There were the “gigantic sandwiches. ” Customers noticed his weight gain. “They would come up to me and rub my stomach and say, ‘You’re getting fat,’” Mr. Goldshine said. Dr. Aronne saw something interesting in Mr. Goldshine’s records. He was taking pioglitazone for diabetes, a drug that makes some people gain weight. Dr. Aronne replaced it with Invokana, a diabetes drug that can contribute to weight loss  —   and Mr. Goldshine lost a small amount. Then Dr. Aronne added a drug that combines bupropion, an antidepressant, and naltrexone, a drug used to combat cravings for drugs like opioids. He chose it, he said, because patients often say it helps turn off constant thoughts of eating. It worked. “I pretty much eat my same diet, but so much less,” Mr. Goldshine said. He lost about 75 pounds, and has kept them off without conscious effort. For Eric Scarmardo, 53, a manager at a Chicago prescription benefit management firm, the solution to a frustratingly stubborn weight problem turned out to be blindingly simple. But it took him years to discover it. His problem began when he was 25 and just out of law school, working, he said, “ridiculous hours” for a large Chicago firm, eating without thinking. Within a year, his weight climbed from about 200 pounds to 220 on his     frame. Ten years later, he weighed close to 300 pounds. He tried, repeatedly, to lose weight with elaborate diet and exercise programs that typically lasted about a week. Finally, he went to Dr. Robert Kushner, an obesity medicine specialist at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine. “The first message was that all that matters is calories,” Mr. Scarmardo said. Dr. Kushner insisted that Mr. Scarmardo keep a detailed log of what he ate, weighing and measuring every morsel. “It was difficult at first, but now it has become part of my routine,” Mr. Scarmardo said. He even asks restaurants to weigh his food before serving it to him most comply. He lost 42 pounds and has kept them off for two and a half years. R. C. Binstock, a    novelist and technical writer in Cambridge, Mass. has always been heavy. He felt ashamed, accepting others’ judgmental views. “I am fat because I am weak, I am fat because I am inadequate. I am fat because I am morally flawed,” he castigated himself. So when he went to Dr. Sriram Machineni at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston two years ago, he vowed that this would be his last attempt before bariatric surgery. Dr. Machineni suggested lifestyle modification. Mr. Binstock refused. He was already doing all that and it did not help. Dr. Machineni moved on to medications, trying one after another. Each time the drug would work at first but then Mr. Binstock’s food cravings returned. Eventually, Dr. Machineni found a drug combination that had a lasting effect  —   the diabetes drug metformin, which can have a side effect of weight loss, and lorcaserin, or Belviq, a new   drug that acts on the brain to control appetite. Mr. Binstock lost 55 pounds and maintained it. “I was able to see a food I love and say, ‘I am just not going to have that,’” Mr. Binstock said. “I will never be ashamed of my body again, ever,” he said. Most of Dr. Jennifer Kerns’s family was fat. And so was she. Dr. Kerns, 42  —   now an obesity medicine specialist at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Washington  —   reached a peak weight of 300 pounds. She knows all too well how hard it is to lose weight and keep it off. Diets would work, but then the weight would come back. So, in 2006, she tried what she hoped would be the solution to her weight problem she became a contestant on “The Biggest Loser” reality television show. Her expectation was that with an extreme regimen and the competition, she would get control of her weight. And once she lost the weight, she thought she would keep it off. “The Biggest Loser” contest certainly helped her lose weight  —   she dropped 108 pounds  —   but she was unprepared for how hard it would be to keep those pounds off. At first she thought regular vigorous exercise would do it, but her weight began climbing. Eventually, she discovered a lifestyle program that lets her keep her weight between 155 and 180 pounds  —   her weight fluctuates because each time she relaxes her guard the pounds return. The program is centered on what she calls an iron grip on her diet. Dr. Kerns keeps tempting foods such as desserts and especially anything containing chocolate out of her house. She brings her own breakfast, lunch and snacks to work. She uses an app on her phone to count calories. “I am   of everything I eat,” she said. “It is an active effort. ” She works out vigorously on an elliptical   for 30 minutes a day, nine days out of 10. She weighs herself every day. She just had her first baby, Graham Kerns Marvel, and kept up her routine during pregnancy, exercising, weighing herself every day, and controlling her diet. She only gained 31 pounds. But it never gets easier. So why does she do it? She has seen family members grow extremely obese with uncontrolled diabetes and high blood pressure. By keeping her weight down, she has avoided those problems. And she knows how harshly obese people are judged in our society. “Nobody wants to be obese,” Dr. Kerns said. Elias Elias, president of Griff Technologies in Milton, Mass. thought he knew why he was fat. His life was stressful. To relax, he liked to go out and have a good time, eating and drinking. His weight problem began 40 years ago as a teenager when he began taking steroids to treat three autoimmune diseases  —   psoriasis, ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis, an arthritis of the spine. Steroids are known to cause weight gain. With   use, a person’s weight can be permanently reset at a higher level, his doctor, Dr. Lee Kaplan, an obesity medicine specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital said. New drugs came along, allowing him to stop taking steroids, but the damage was done. His weight kept climbing until it reached 252 pounds. He is 5 feet 9 inches. He tried dieting, but to no avail. He blamed himself for lacking willpower. Finally, in 2007, he went to see Dr Kaplan. Dr. Kaplan prescribed, phentermine, a stimulant. “It was miraculous,” Mr. Elias said. Suddenly, the drive to eat excessively was no longer there. Pounds began to fall off. In six months his weight dropped to around 190 pounds and stayed there for seven years. Then, in early 2014, he wondered if he should stop taking the drug. It did not seem to be working any more. His weight had begun climbing. Dr. Kaplan told him the drug still was effective but usually became less so over time. So, to test that theory, Mr. Elias stopped taking it. His weight climbed even higher and settled around 240 pounds. He thinks he can still lose the weight he gained but, he said, “I lost the motivation. ” As he sees it, his personal problems have sapped his zest to control what he eats. “My success ended up for me being a   sword,” Mr. Elias said. “Now that I know it is doable, I am procrastinating in terms of restarting the focus. ” But Dr. Kaplan said Mr. Elias really needs a different drug. When phentermine was exerting its maximum effect, Mr. Elias ate less no matter what else was going on in his life. In fact, Dr. Kaplan said, it is not really in his power to diet his way back to that low weight and stay there.",0
19605,Cincinnati Mayor: We Are Now a Sanctuary City,"The mayor of Cincinnati has declared his municipality to be a sanctuary city, which will now protect illegal aliens from federal immigration officers. [Mayor John Cranley announced, alongside Muslim, Jewish and Christian religious leaders, that his city would “stand in solidarity with the immigrant community,” and declare itself a sanctuary city, despite the threat of losing federal funding under President Donald Trump’s administration.  “This city stands with immigrants,” Cranley said during the live press conference. “This city stands with Muslims. This city stands with Syrian refugees yearning to break free. ” “This city opposes executive orders to halt refugee resettlement and targeting cities that are trying to live up to the promise of the Statue of Liberty,” Cranley continued. Cranley’s call to become a sanctuary city came just after the Trump Administration enacted an executive order to temporarily halt all refugee resettlement from select nations. Cranley said he supported Catholic Charities, which is contracted by the federal government to resettle refugees all over the country, citing that his wife’s family are immigrants from Jordan. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has come under fire for his sanctuary city designation after the NYPD released a previously deported criminal illegal immigrant, forcing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to launch an investigation to capture the suspect, as Breitbart Texas reported.

19606,Cal Attorney General Threatens Trump Administration over Haste or Greed - Breitbart,"California Attorney General Xavier Becerra wrote a letter to U. S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke threatening legal action if the Trump Administration for “haste or greed” tries to revoke or weaken 6 designated national monuments in California. [President Trump issued an April 26 Executive Order instructing the Department of the Interior to review 20 to 40 Presidential designations or expansions of designations under the 1906 Antiquities Act made since January 1, 1996.  The President directed the review over the next 45 days to focus on designations that now cover 100, 000 or more acres or any designation or expansion where Secretary Zinke determined there was a lack of adequate public outreach and coordination with relevant stakeholders. Secretary Zinke is to report his findings on June 14, which will then start the   regulatory clock that would lead to amending or rescinding designations. Attorney General Becerra warned Zinke in a letter, “National monument designations protect the irreplaceable natural and cultural heritage that belongs to all Americans, ensuring that the haste or greed of one generation does not squander those gifts at the expense of future generations. ” Becerra warned that any such move would be unlawful and he would “take any and all action necessary to protect the American heritage which has become part of our monument lands,” according to the Highland Community News. During the Obama Administration, the President used the Antiquities Act 34 times to set aside a record 553 million acres of national lands and waters, according to the New York Times. As a result, the four states with the largest federal ownership” —  Alaska at 95. 8 percent, Nevada at 87. 8 percent, Utah at 75. 2 percent and Idaho at 70. 4 percent. Breitbart News reported that U. S. Senator Dianne Feinstein asked Obama to use the Antiquities Act, after failing to get Congressional approvals for ‘Mojave Trails, Sand to Snow, and Castle Mountains’ national parks. Although the Act specifically directs the President to limit the designation to the “smallest area compatible with proper care and management of the objects to be protected,” the three desert parcels were over 1 million acres. Feinstein claimed she was protecting mountain lions, desert tortoise, and bighorn sheep, but angry desert residents complained that the real reason was to ban   hunters, miners and oil drillers. According to the Atlantic, former Congressman Becerra was chosen by Governor Jerry Brown to replace the previous Attorney General Kamala Harris, who was elected California’s junior senator in November to support 15 other Democrat Attorney Generals in a united front of forward leaning politics against Trump’s agenda. The Atlantic believes that Attorney General Becerra can play the role against Trump that Texas Attorney General, now Governor, Greg Abbott, and current Attorney General Ken Paxton, played against Obama. Abbott sued the federal government 50 times on issues ranging from Obamacare to the transgender bathroom mandate. Abbott said his job for 8 years was to go work, sue the federal government, and then go back home. Abbott filed 50 lawsuits, won 7, lost 12, dropped 9, and 20 are still working their way through the courts. Becerra at age 59 is believed to be angling to run in 2018 for Senate if the   old Feinstein decides to retire or even run for governor.",0

This one might be wishful thinking:

A reader writes that Soros
“is involved in destabilizing and overthrowing democratically elected governmenbts all over the world. He is not just a political and social threat to Russia and Ukraine, but evidently now to the USA and Western Europe, where he has been behind the mass influx of immigrants to destabilise those countries as well. 
“It is clear that Trump and Putin have a lot of threats in common to deal with. The shadow government is currently rattled, but will strike back soon. After the recent violent events, Trump should join the Russian government and also call for the immediate arrest of Soros for his treasonous activities and confiscate all his assets in the West, appoint special prosecutors to deal with the neocon war criminals and break up the bought and paid for press and media monopolies that are the corrupt and mendacious whores of the oligarchy. Furthermore, he should also shut down the oligarchs’ Fed and create a national bank to issue debt- and interest-free US money to fund infrastructure and the rebuilding of the US economy. That would critically weaken the opposition and strengthen his position in dealing with the shadow government. 
“These forces will be eternal enemies not just of him, but of the Western people. They represent a cancer that is killing the host. Not reconciliation, but deep and thorough cleaning is required to rout out this den of vipers.”
The audacity of George Soros is extraordinary. How does he get away with it?

Vladimir Putin, The Trumpholes puppet master has reacted to the winning by his puppet stooge with unbridled joy. The Kremlin announced that it had been hard fought but their destabilization plan of western democracies was much better value for money than new battle fleets. 
""It had taken us quite a deal of time to realise that Internet disinformation plans were a better world domination strategy but now we have Assange doing the marketing nothing the CIA or the NSA does bothers us anymore"". He remarked ""anyway they are so busy surveilling their own domestic population they didn't have time to annoy Russians military plans anymore"". 
He was also very pleased with the fine job Comey had done in the closing days when it looked like Hillary might romp it in. The Kremlin intend to award FBIs Comey a Russian military medal for his excellent disinformation strategy. ""That guy has got excellent timing with recalling the email server ruse just before voting"". 
Weiner also came in for special mention and the Kremlin has setup a special sexting hotline for him manned by underage Russian beauties. 
Asked what issues would be on the table with his first discussion with the President Elect he replied ""investing in his real estate business by giving him lots of opportunities in Russia, offering him a playboy resort in Crimea and disbanding the 17 US security agencies which he said were much more expensive than the KGB and less effective and offering to outsource internal security agencies to Russia.

19610,Remembering Frank Legge,"Posted on October 29, 2016 by Kevin Ryan 
Scientist and scholar Frank Legge passed away on October 20 th 2016. Frank was a leader of the international 9/11 Truth Movement. He had been a co-editor of the Journal of 9/11 Studies and a founding member of both Scholars for 9/11 Truth & Justice and Scientists for 9/11 Truth. His contributions to research into 9/11 will be remembered as among the most important in history. 
Frank had a long and fulfilling life before and beyond the events of 9/11. He was a husband, father, and grandfather as well as a farmer, pilot, research scientist, and entrepreneur. 
After obtaining a Diploma of Agriculture (Longerenong, Victoria, Australia), Frank spent his early years as an agricultural employee, then a contractor, in the state of Queensland. He then obtained a “conditional purchase” block of virgin bush in Western Australia, which he cleared and developed as a sheep and grain farm. On completion of this, Frank moved to Perth and enrolled at the University of Western Australia. During this period he obtained a pilot’s license and acquired a share in a plane, which was useful in enabling him to easily visit and continue operating the farm. 
On graduating with a Ph.D. in chemistry, in 1983, Dr. Legge worked as a research officer for the Department of Agriculture for a number of years. This included research into the manufacture and use of biodiesel. He was also involved with the Australian Merino Society in the development of their sheep-breeding index. With a colleague, he then formed a company, Solar Track Pty Ltd, and embarked on a project manufacturing solar tracking devices, based on a patented concept they developed in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture. Lastly he moved to consulting. 
Frank’s understanding of the events of 9/11 was set out in his website, now maintained by David Chandler. http://www.scienceof911.com.au/ 
This site includes links to many papers on the subject, including those Dr. Legge wrote and co-authored. He believed that the evidence for explosives in controlled demolition of all three of the buildings at the World Trade Center was convincing and that the failure of the U.S. agency NIST to consider this possibility was prima facie evidence of corruption and obstruction of justice. 
Some of Dr. Legge’s most important contributions to the 9/11 debate: He was a prolific contributor to the Journal of 9/11 Studies , starting with the first publication in June 2006. His careful, logical approach was the basis for a dozen articles and half a dozen letters published by the Journal . In October 2007, he joined as co-editor and continued in that capacity until July 2012. Among his most important articles was an early examination of the fall of WTC Building 7 in which Dr. Legge examined video and graphed the acceleration of the building. This paper, published ten years ago, initiated a series of similar calculations that led to irrefutable arguments in favor of demolition. Dr. Legge’s insights and expertise were often less visible than the work of his colleagues. That fact is exemplified by his listing as fourth author of eight on the seminal article Extremely High Temperatures During the World Trade Center Destruction . His co-authors would agree that his leadership on the article was invaluable. He was co-author for articles that brought the unanswered questions of 9/11 into mainstream scientific discussion. These included a search for common ground with official investigators called Fourteen Points of Agreement with Official Government Reports on the Destruction of the World Trade Center . Frank was also an important contributor to the breakthrough article entitled Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe . Collaborating with Warren Stutt, Dr. Legge provided a study of the data file from the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) for the flight that was reported to have hit the Pentagon. The purpose of this work was to show that, contrary to widespread belief among activists, the data portrayed a flight that corresponded with the official reports of the course of the aircraft. Frank’s position was that there were many reasons to doubt the truthfulness of the 9/11 reports but the data from the FDR was not one of them. His hope was that this information would help to unify the Truth Movement as it would reduce the tendency to assert claims, based on misinterpretation of the FDR file, that the plane did not hit the Pentagon. As co-author with David Chandler, Legge examined the case that the Pentagon was hit by a plane , and that it did not fly over, as asserted by some activists. Again Dr. Legge’s hope was to unify the Truth Movement. This was followed by an Addendum that strengthened the case. 
Although a sound scientific approach was characteristic of his work, Legge’s personality was also important in that he was often the most mature participant in any discussion. This is not to say he was merely the oldest but that he was levelheaded and composed in many heated, ego-driven, arguments. That is, Frank Legge was the grown-up at times when it was most needed. 
This fact was exhibited in many of his writings and communications. For example, in order to achieve incremental improvement in the debate about what hit the Pentagon, Legge advocated a “precautionary principle,” urging everyone to assert only what was truly known. In order to address arguments raised in support of the “flyover” case, Legge wrote a paper on the Search for Consensus to seek common ground. 
In the last decade of his life, Frank Legge had a tremendous influence on many people around the world. He led scientific inquiry into one of the most controversial subjects in history and he collaborated positively with many fellow citizens to reveal the truth. Those of us who worked with him during this time will remember his intelligence, dignity, and respect for others.",0
19611,Support For Brexit at Five-Month High After Article 50 Triggered,"Support for the UK leaving the European Union (EU) has hit a   high, with more that 55 per cent of voters getting behind Brexit, the latest poll has revealed. [For the third successive month, more than half of the voting public approves of the way that Brexit talks are being conducted. Meanwhile, disapproval is at its lowest level yet, sitting at just 45 per cent, a new survey from Orb International shows.  The poll apparently debunks the notion of Brexit regret, and the idea that the British public would vote differently if there was a second referendum. Three per cent more of the voting population now support Brexit than on the day of the referendum. Johnny Heald, managing director of Orb International, told The Telegraph: “Since November, the British public are slowly becoming more comfortable with idea of Brexit and, each month, more are approving of the way in which the government is dealing with negotiations. ” As the dire predictions of   “project fear” have failed to materialise, and the UK’s economy has continued to succeed, it is possible that support for Brexit will continue to grow. However, the public appears to be becoming more interested in trade deals as the divorce process begins, with immigration slipping down the nation’s list of concerns. “However, as these talks develop, it’s interesting that the public is increasingly concerned more about free trade agreements than immigration marking a reversal of the preference aired during the campaign” added Mr. Heald. Immigration was seen as the most important issue in the June referendum. However, the recent survey found that 47 per cent of voters now disagreed that “controlling immigration [was] more important than access to free trade”. Analysis of the figures showed that the swing in opinion has been driven by pensioners, with the proportion of those prioritising immigration over trade falling from 61 per cent in March to 47 per cent in April. Confidence that immigration can be controlled is also down, with only 58 per cent believing that the UK will have greater control over immigration once withdrawal from the EU is complete. The Prime Minister has promised to bring immigration to below 100, o00, but has also said she is happy for free movement to continue for years after Britain leaves the EU during a   “implementation”  period. Last week, a report for   campaign group Leave Means Leave, said that   Britain can slash net migration to 50, 000 a year by barring unskilled labour and imposing a strict visa regime without damaging the economy.",0

19613,Here's How To Increase Human Energy According To Nikola Tesla,"Share on Facebook The most fundamental principle, the basic program of all life, is energy saving. Whatever you do, whatever you like, whatever feels good for you, it's just a psychological response that shows you how to be more energy efficient. Life craves energy and subconsciously you'll always choose the path of least resistance because of that. That's why high calorie food tastes better, that's why whenever your beliefs are questioned you naturally refuse any arguments, that's why people feel more depressed when there is no sunshine outside. All default responses are just energy saving reactions; ‘more calories’ means more energy, changing the structure of your beliefs requires energy, and it's more efficient to do less when you are lacking the energy of the sun. However, a momentary ‘energy waste’ can result in a more sustainable energy consumption in the future. This requires higher levels of intelligence. For this to be achieved we must apply conscious effort in the right time and place. But what is the source of our energy? How can we gain more energy? How can we raise our consciousness and increase our intelligence? Nikola Tesla perfectly concluded what’s the main, most fundamental source of human energy and how to increase our energy and evolve as species. More energy means higher levels of operating power for our consciousness. If you apply time to this ‘equation’ it means that the longer we sustain higher levels of energy for our consciousness, the more intelligence we download from The Universe, the more intelligence we integrate into our being. So What's The Source Of Our Energy? “First let us ask: Whence comes all the motive power? What is the spring that drives all? We see the ocean rise and fall, the rivers flow, the wind, rain, hail, and snow beat on our windows, the trains and steamers come and go; we here the rattling noise of carriages, the voices from the street; we feel, smell, and taste; and we think of all this. And all this movement, from the surging of the mighty ocean to that subtle movement concerned in our thought, has but one common cause. All this energy emanates from one single center, one single source, the sun. The sun is the spring that drives all. The sun maintains all human life and supplies all human energy.” How To Increase The Human Energy? The following answer will make you understand almost everything about Nikola Tesla's lifestyle; why he was vegan; why he was obsessed with free energy; why he despised ignorance and imbeciles; How to increase human energy? There are actually 3 steps. The First Step Is Increasing The Human Mass: In order to increase the energy we have to think in terms of speed. If, let's say, there is a train and you add one more wagon, 3 things can happen. Either the wagon is of the same velocity as the train; in this case the speed of the train will slightly increase . The wagon is with a smaller velocity; in this case the whole train will decrease its speed . Or the wagon is of higher velocity; in this case the whole train will significantly increase its speed . We can think of it like this: ‘If there is a family with children of the same degree of enlightenment as the parents, that is, mass of the “same velocity,” the energy will simply increase proportionately to the number added. If they are less intelligent or advanced, or mass of “smaller velocity,” there will be a very slight gain in the energy; but if they are further advanced, or mass of “higher velocity,” then the new generation will add very considerably to the sum total of human energy.’ In Nikola Tesla's opinion growing muscles is “equivalent to adding mass of “smaller velocity,” and I would not commend it” but moderate exercise “insuring the right balance between mind and body, and the highest efficiency of performance, is, of course, a prime requirement” Food is one of the most important elements of increasing your mass. What we consider as food is just processed sunlight. Plants, with their photosynthesis, combine carbon, hydrogen and oxygen and bind them through sunlight, forming the CHO molecule (fat) we consume through food and burn for energy. However, the actual energy comes from freeing the photons of light between the chemical bond. That's what produces heat. That's what gives calories, stored photons. We eat sunlight for energy! Fruits, Vegetables, Meat, everything that we eat consumed the CHO molecules that the plants created. The energy that we consume through food is actually the same sunlight that plants used to forge these elements together. If we eat meat, we are consuming already consumed, unused CHO, as the only place that CHO comes is from photosynthesis. It's second hand CHO in a way. Consuming CHO directly from plants, fruits and vegetables is certainly equivalent to adding mass of “higher velocity,” “It is certainly preferable to raise vegetables, and I think, therefore, that vegetarianism is a commendable departure from the established barbarous habit. That we can subsist on plant food and perform our work even to advantage is not a theory, but a well-demonstrated fact. Many races living almost exclusively on vegetables are of superior physique and strength. There is no doubt that some plant food, such as oatmeal, is more economical than meat, and superior to it in regard to both mechanical and mental performance.” Nikola Tesla says. The consumption of second hand food is one of the main limits we put on ourselves for evolving as a race into more intelligent, kind and less animal like species. “To free ourselves from animal instincts and appetites, which keep us down, we should begin at the very root from which we spring: we should effect a radical reform in the character of the food.” Nikola Tesla continues. “Gambling, business rush, and excitement, particularly on the exchanges, are causes of much mass reduction” “Whisky, wine, tea coffee, tobacco, and other such stimulants are responsible for the shortening of the lives of many, and ought to be used with moderation. But I do not think that rigorous measures of suppression of habits followed through many generations are commendable. It is wiser to preach moderation than abstinence.” To conclude: Consume food that's closer to the sun, avoid unnecessary enlargements of your body that'll use more energy, avoid energy wasting habits and unhealthy addictions that serve solely to your ego. Each man who practices these advices adds a ‘wagon’ with higher velocity to the ‘human train’ we all move. The Second Step Is Reducing The Force That's Retarding The Human Mass: “The force which retards the onward movement of man is partly frictional and partly negative. To illustrate this distinction I may name, for example, ignorance, stupidity, and imbecility as some of the purely frictional forces, or resistances devoid of any directive tendency. On the other hand, visionariness, insanity, self-destructive tendency, religious fanaticism, and the like, are all forces of a negative character, acting in definite directions. To reduce or entirely overcome these dissimilar retarding forces, radically different methods must be employed. One knows, for instance, what a fanatic may do, and one can take preventive measures, can enlighten, convince, and, possibly direct him, turn his vice into virtue; but one does not know, and never can know, what a brute or an imbecile may do, and one must deal with him as with a mass, inert, without mind, let loose by the mad elements. A negative force always implies some quality, not infrequently a high one, though badly directed, which it is possible to turn to good advantage; but a directionless, frictional force involves unavoidable loss. Evidently, then, the first and general answer to the above question is: turn all negative force in the right direction and reduce all frictional force. “ Simply said, frictional force is ignorant, directionless, without a quality unlike the negative force which carries high quality but in a wrong direction. Frictional force will, most of the time, result only in energy loss no matter where it is directioned, while negative force can lead to significant increase of human energy if focused towards a proper, strategic direction.“There can be no doubt that, of all the frictional resistances, the one that most retards human movement is ignorance. Not without reason said that man of wisdom, Buddha: “Ignorance is the greatest evil in the world.” The friction which results from ignorance, and which is greatly increased owing to the numerous languages and nationalities, can be reduced only by the spread of knowledge and the unification of the heterogeneous elements of humanity. No effort could be better spent.” Nikola Tesla concludes. Individually, this can be explained as maintaining constructive balance between our talents and flaws; establishing peace between our darkness and light and uniting them towards a mutual, greater goal. This, of course, needs to be accompanied with learning, curiosity and reducing individual ignorance about The Universe around us. Cleansing your chakras is as essential as taking a bath in the context of reducing the force that's retarding your energy. Allowing energy to flow freely through your own body ensures a reduction in friction. It decreases the waste of your energy with fighting the negative emotions that are clogging your energy pools. According to Nikola Tesla war should not be terminated suddenly as this can result in something worse than war. “War is a negative force, and cannot be turned in a positive direction without passing through, the intermediate phases. It is a problem of making a wheel, rotating one way, turn in the opposite direction without slowing it down, stopping it, and speeding it up again the other way.” We shouldn't stop war, but redirect it towards a mutual goal of humanity. For example, instead of fighting ourselves, we can redirect our energy towards exploration of different parts of our galaxy. Of course, gently and gradually, with great maintenance. “It is doubtful whether men who would not be ready to fight for a high principle would be good for anything at all” Nikola Tesla explains why war is not a frictional force but one of a negative character. In his views, the future of war should result in reduction of man power exchanged for machines that will take the hit. To see how this can happen we must see how everything began. It started with the law of the strongest where physically weaker men were thrown completely to the mercy of physically stronger men. However, the weaker men developed intelligence due to their energy efficiency and developed ways to use stones, sticks and make weapons. Today wars are held by men who smoke cigars, sitting in a room, completely controlling physical forces with their intelligence. The future will make the intelligence create machines and control them instead of men, until war is mainly intellectual and the physical factor is completely irrelevant. To conclude: Use your talents to guide your flaws. Find peace and eliminate forces of friction with reason, within you and around yourself. The Third Step Is To Increase The Force Accelerating The Human Mass: “Of the three possible solutions of the main problem of increasing human energy, this is by far the most important to consider, not only because of its intrinsic significance, but also because of its intimate bearing on all the many elements and conditions which determine the movement of humanity.” How do you increase the force that's moving the human mass? Simply, spend more energy and spend it towards the most efficient possible direction. Our world is driven by machinery under a system created by our motive power. The mass of people is not moving chaotically but systematically, following an order like a clockwork. If we decrease our motive power we'll, unintentionally, be imprisoned by the same system we alone have created. That's why increasing the motive power is key in increasing the human energy. Constantly increasing the motive power will result in a constant increase of human energy. “Motive power means work. To increase the force accelerating human movement means, therefore, to perform more work.” says Nikola Tesla. But how can one man increase his energy constantly? Will there not be a point when the man cannot do more work? Will there not be a point when doing more work becomes harmful to the man, even unhealthy? There is a secret. When a man applies his effort so that, when coming into effect it will be in the direction of the collective human movement, the effort becomes most efficient and with less energy more is achieved. This means that as more people do more work towards a mutual goal, as more is achieved with less effort resulting in increase of mutual energy. Think of it like spinning a wheel. At first, for only a fragment of its potential speed you need a lot of effort and energy to even start moving the wheel. As you start moving the wheel and applying effort in the direction of its movement, as less effort it demands and as faster it keeps spinning. In the end, with less effort than it was demanded from you to move the wheel an inch, you spin it countless times faster. The same is with human energy! The secret of energy is that it is eternal in The Universe where almost nothing is. Your energy, no matter where you spent it, will forever stay and spread out if not directioned. That's why it's crucially important to focus your effort. As you spend your energy towards one direction, with time this energy will accumulate and less effort and energy you'll need to achieve a lot more. This is true globally and individually. “Another answer we have now found to the above great question: To increase the force accelerating human movement means to turn to the uses of man more of the sun's energy.” Imagine what we can accomplish if we all focus our efforts toward creating more sustainable ways of generating energy; cleaning the earth; reducing hunger; finding solutions for interstellar travel; educating; To conclude: Focusing your motive power and effort on one goal, towards the right direction of movement, will accelerate the velocity with which you move closer to your goal. With time, you'll spend less effort and achieve more. Conclusion: To gain your energy from the right sources means you gain more energy from less; reducing the retarding factors means you have less friction that wastes your energy; focusing your motive power towards the direction of the collective human movement means you use others' energy to boost your energy. Gain more energy, waste less energy, spend the energy so next time you'll need less to achieve more. Increase human mass, reduce retarding force, and increase the force accelerating the human mass. Follow this process with reason. Gain more, waste less, spend efficiently, learn. That's the secret formula for increasing the collective human energy according to the great mind of Nikola Tesla. That's how we raise our intelligence and evolve as species.",0
19614,Donald Trump Picks Reince Priebus as Chief of Staff and Stephen Bannon as Strategist - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —     Donald J. Trump on Sunday chose Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee and a loyal campaign adviser, to be his White House chief of staff, turning to a Washington insider whose friendship with the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, could help secure early legislative victories. In selecting Mr. Priebus, Mr. Trump passed over Stephen K. Bannon, a   media provocateur. But the   named Mr. Bannon his senior counselor and chief West Wing strategist, signaling an embrace of the fringe ideology long advanced by Mr. Bannon and of a continuing disdain for the Republican establishment. The dual appointments  —   with Mr. Bannon given top billing in the official announcement  —   instantly created rival centers of power in the Trump White House. Mr. Bannon’s selection demonstrated the power of   activists who backed Mr. Trump’s candidacy. Some of them have long traded in the conspiracy theories and sometimes racist messages of Breitbart News, the website that Mr. Bannon ran for much of the past decade. The site has accused President Obama of “importing more hating Muslims” compared Planned Parenthood’s work to the Holocaust called the conservative commentator Bill Kristol a “renegade Jew” and advised female victims of online harassment to “just log off” and stop “screwing up the internet for men,” illustrating that point with a picture of a crying child. The   activists may be angered by the selection of Mr. Priebus as chief of staff, viewing him as a deal maker who will be too eager to push the new president toward compromise on issues like taxes, immigration, trade, health care and the environment. In a statement Sunday afternoon, the transition team emphasized that the two men would work “as equal partners to transform the federal government. ” The arrangement appeared aimed at ensuring that both men would be required to sign off on many decisions jointly. And Mr. Bannon was assured that he reports directly to Mr. Trump, not to Mr. Priebus. The simultaneous announcement and competing lines of authority are consistent with Mr. Trump’s management style in his businesses and in his campaign: creating rival power structures beneath him and encouraging them to battle it out. It is also a reflection of who has the ear of the  : his children, and especially his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner. Both had argued that the chief of staff job should not be held by someone too controversial, according to several people familiar with the   inside the transition effort. Mr. Kushner is likely to wield great influence over the new president regardless of whether he holds a formal title. Mr. Kushner, who has no experience in politics or government, often has the final word in advising Mr. Trump. But while Mr. Trump apparently feels comfortable with Mr. Priebus, the people with knowledge of his weekend decision said Mr. Bannon was still the adviser who was better able to talk forcefully to the   during difficult moments. The transition team appeared eager to appease concerns among Mr. Trump’s most fervent supporters that choosing Mr. Priebus meant the   had already caved to the Washington “swamp” he had promised to drain. The team also wanted to mollify Mr. Bannon, and to that end, the official statement mentioned Mr. Bannon first. “We had a very successful partnership on the campaign, one that led to victory,” Mr. Bannon said in the statement. “We will have that same partnership in working to help   Trump achieve his agenda. ” Mr. Priebus said he looked forward to working with Mr. Bannon and Mr. Trump “to create an economy that works for everyone, secure our borders, repeal and replace Obamacare and destroy radical Islamic terrorism. ” Mr. Priebus is expected to have multiple deputies, including Katie Walsh, the chief of staff of the Republican National Committee, who is close to Mr. Priebus and helped ensure a tight working relationship between the party’s operational infrastructure and Mr. Trump’s campaign. A onetime Goldman Sachs banker, Mr. Bannon has transformed himself into a media figure who favors a   style of politics and is deeply suspicious of the government establishment and the corporate elite. During the campaign, he pushed Mr. Trump to embrace a fierce populism that helped fuel his victory. Mr. Trump’s decision last summer to put Mr. Bannon in charge of his campaign was part of an effort to reset a candidacy that had been troubled by controversies surrounding   campaign officials. Mr. Bannon’s appointment on Sunday set off a fierce response on Twitter and in Washington. The   League issued a scathing statement calling him “hostile to core American values. ” “It is a sad day when a man who presided over the premier website of the ‘ ’  —   a   group of white nationalists and unabashed   and racists  —   is slated to be a senior staff member in the ‘people’s house,’” the statement said. Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said, “It is easy to see why the K. K. K. views Trump as their champion when Trump appoints one of the foremost peddlers of white supremacist themes and rhetoric as his top aide. ” Mr. Bannon brings to the post a background that includes misdemeanor charges of domestic violence and allegations that he threatened his wife with retribution if she testified in the criminal case, according to a police report and court records obtained by The New York Times. The charges date back two decades to the end of a troubled marriage to Mary Louise Piccard, who said he had attacked her at their home in Santa Monica, Calif. He was charged in February 1996 with domestic violence, battery and trying to dissuade a victim from reporting a crime, but the case was dropped when Ms. Piccard did not show up to court. In court records, Ms. Piccard later claimed that Mr. Bannon had instructed her to leave town to avoid testifying. Despite his image as a   Mr. Bannon is also savvy at cutting deals to achieve his goals. But as chief of staff, Mr. Priebus will be the one who has several hundred White House staff members reporting to him. He will be the primary gatekeeper for Mr. Trump and the person most responsible for steering the president’s agenda through Congress. That role will be especially critical for Mr. Trump, who has never served in government and has few connections to important political figures. The selection of Mr. Priebus comes at the end of a   year for the Republican Party, which saw Mr. Trump rewrite many of its policy orthodoxies, clash with its leaders in Congress and denigrate the Bush political dynasty. As Mr. Trump denounced the Republican primary process as rigged and, on occasion, threatened to quit the party and run on his own, Mr. Priebus remained neutral. And when Mr. Trump secured the nomination, Mr. Priebus stood by his side. Mr. Priebus worked with Mr. Trump on the nuts and bolts of presidential politics, trying to smooth his rough edges and staying in close contact as a   campaign prepared to go up against the Clinton machine. On the surface, the two men could hardly be more different. While Mr. Trump, 70, is known for his brashness and at times his viciousness, Mr. Priebus, 44, is regarded for his low profile and humility. Born in New Jersey and a lawyer by training, Mr. Priebus has never held elected office. But he served as state treasurer and worked his way up through the Wisconsin Republican Party to become chairman, putting him on the Republican National Committee, where he eventually became general counsel to the chairman at the time, Michael Steele. Now the   Republican National Committee chairman, Mr. Priebus was elected to the job in 2011, unseating Mr. Steele on the promise of modernizing the party and refilling its coffers. With his focus on   and fiscal issues, Mr. Priebus let Republican leaders in Congress be the voices of the party during the early part of his tenure. His profile rose as the 2016 election got into gear. At times, Mr. Priebus, whose first name rhymes with “pints,” struggled to defend Mr. Trump’s antics, but he showed his loyalty by supplementing the campaign’s resources and by urging Republicans to fall in line behind the candidate in spite of their reservations. When Mr. Trump emerged onstage to give his victory speech early Wednesday, Mr. Trump made his appreciation clear, dismissing rumors of tension with Mr. Priebus and singing his praises. “I never had a bad second with him,” Mr. Trump said. “He’s an unbelievable star. ”",0
19615,“First America-First Victory”: Ford CEO Calls Trump to Cancel Plant Move to Mexico,"
This article was written by Tyler Durden and originally published at Zero Hedge . 
Editor’s Comment: Though his administration is still taking shape, President-elect Trump may be able to claim his first tangible victory. Though Ford Motors were resistant to Trump’s trade policy positions and threatened to move jobs to Mexico, the CEO has now announced that, instead, production will remain American. 
Is Trump pulling televangelist-style miracles – with arrangements ahead of time in the back room – or is he making things happen because he is in a position to make good on his policy promises? Either way, Ford and other big companies will be keeping optics in mind when they decide whether or not to play ball with the wild card Trump administration (at this point, still to be). If this actually becomes the trend, perhaps there is a lot of positive that can be done for the economy, and perhaps good paying jobs can return for struggling working class Americans. Only time will tell, but he hasn’t even assumed office yet. 
Ford CEO Folds? Trump Confirms Carmaker Won’t Move Production To Mexico 
by Tyler Durden
Just hours after Ford CEO complained of the “huge impact” of Donald Trump’s proposed trade plans, following the company’s plan to move a substantial portion of its passenger-car production to Mexico from a factory in Michigan, Donald Trump tweeted “Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky — no Mexico,” seemingly winning his first ‘america-first’ victory.
As WSJ reported yesterday, Ford Motor Co. Chief Executive Mark Fields issued a warning about President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed trade policies, saying high tariffs on automobiles and other products coming into the U.S. would be a blow to the auto industry and broader U.S. economy.
Mr. Fields, speaking with reporters on the sidelines of the Los Angeles Auto Show on Tuesday, said Ford has talked to Mr. Trump’s transition team and believes the company can work with the new administration. During a separate interview, he said, “We all share the same objective; we want a vibrant and healthy U.S. economy.” 
The two sides, however, appear to be at odds on how to achieve that goal.
Ford’s plan to move a substantial portion of its passenger-car production to Mexico from a factory in Michigan was heavily criticized by Mr. Trump on the campaign trail. Like many of its rivals, Ford is building more-profitable light trucks in the U.S. while investing in new capacity in Mexico to produce lower-margin small cars.
And then hours later, Donald Trump tweeted…
Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky – no Mexico
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 

I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 

Which was followed by a statement from Ford confirming Trump’s comment…

19616,Security Co. Running Dakota Access Pipeline Has Ties to U.S. Military in Iraq and Afghanistan,"We Are Change 
Security Firm Running Dakota Access Pipeline Intelligence Has Ties to U.S. Military Work in Iraq and Afghanistan 
TigerSwan is one of several security firms under investigation for its work guarding the Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota while potentially without a permit. Besides this recent work on the Standing Rock Sioux protests in North Dakota, this company has offices in Iraq and Afghanistan and is run by a special forces Army veteran.
According to a summary of the investigation , TigerSwan “is in charge of Dakota Access intelligence and supervises the overall security.”
The Morton County, North Dakota, Sheriff’s Department also recently concluded that another security company, Frost Kennels, operated in the state while unlicensed to do so and could face criminal charges . The firm’s attack dogs bit protesters at a heated Labor Day weekend protest .
Law enforcement and private security at the North Dakota pipeline protests have faced criticism for maintaining a militarized presence in the area. The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) and National Lawyer’s Guild have filed multiple open records requests to learn more about the extent of this militarization, and over 133,000 citizens have signed a petition calling for the U.S. Department of Justice to intervene and quell the backlash.
The Federal Aviation Administration has also implemented a no-fly zone , which bars anyone but law enforcement from flying within a 4-mile radius and 3500 feet above the ground in the protest area. Dallas Goldtooth, an organizer on the scenes in North Dakota with the Indigenous Environmental Network, said on Facebook that “ DAPL private security planes and choppers were flying all day” within the designated no-fly zone.
Donnell Hushka, the designated public information officer for the North Dakota Tactical Operation Center, which is tasked with overseeing the no-fly zone, did not respond to repeated queries about designated private entities allowed to fly in no-fly zone airspace.
What is TigerSwan? TigerSwan has offices in Iraq, Afghanistan, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, India, and Latin America and has headquarters in North Carolina. In the past year, TigerSwan won two U.S. Department of State contracts worth over $7 million to operate in Afghanistan, according to USAS pending.gov.
TigerSwan, however, claims on its website that the contract is worth $25 million, and said in a press release that the State Department contract called for the company to “monitor, assess, and advise current and future nation building and stability initiatives in Afghanistan.” Since 2008, TigerSwan has won about $57.7 million worth of U.S. government contracts and sub-contracts for security services.
Company founder and CEO James Reese , a veteran of the elite Army Delta Force , served as the “lead advisor for Special Operations to the Director of the CIA for planning, operations and integration for the invasion of Afghanistan and Operation Enduring Freedom” in Iraq, according to his company biography. Army Delta partakes in mostly covert and high-stakes missions and is part of the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command ( JSOC ) , the latter well known for killing Osama Bin Laden.
One of TigerSwan’s advisory board members, Charles Pittman, has direct ties to the oil and gas industry. Pittman “served as President of Amoco Egypt Oil Company, Amoco Eurasia Petroleum Company, and Regional President BP Amoco plc. (covering the Middle East, the Caspian Sea region, Egypt, and India),” according to his company biography .
“Sad, But Not Surprising” Investigative journalist Jeremy Scahill told Democracy Now! in a 2009 interview that TigerSwan did some covert operations work with Blackwater USA , dubbed the “ world’s most powerful mercenary army ” in his book by the same name. Blackwater has also guarded oil pipelines in central Asia, according to Scahill’s book .
Reese advised Blackwater and took a leave of absence from TigerSwan in 2008 in the aftermath of the Nisour Square Massacre , a shooting in Iraq conducted by Blackwater officers which saw 17 Iraqi civilians killed. TigerSwan has a business relationship with Babylon Eagles Security Company , a private security firm headquartered in Iraq which also has had business ties with Blackwater .
“It is sad, but not surprising, that this firm has ties to the US interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq,” Medea Benjamin, co-founder of the women-led peace group CODEPINK and the co-founder of the human rights group Global Exchange, told DeSmog. “It is another terrifying example of how our violent interventions abroad come home to haunt us in the form of repression and violation of our civil rights.”
The North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the Private Investigation and Security Board are also conducting parallel investigations to the one recently completed by Morton County. TigerSwan did not comment on questions posed about their contract.

19617,Progressives Find ‘White Trash’ More Threatening Than Nuclear War,"By Paul Craig Roberts on November 9, 2016 If only Trump could exile the lot of them. They are anti-American to the core. 
by Paul Craig Roberts 
The American electorate’s preference for Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders has established two facts. One is that the majority of the American people do not believe the media presstitutes. The other is that only the “progressives” and “liberals” who inhabit the Atlantic Northeast and Pacific West coasts believe the presstitutes. 
Trump’s election to the presidency has confirmed these holier-than-thou souls in their strongly held belief that America is a white trash racist country. They have told us this all day long today. 
From these people and from the presstitutes we hear that white supremacy elected Trump. This is their propaganda, the intention of which is to discredit a Trump administration before it is inaugurated. Funny how white supremacy elected black Obama twice previously. 
Truthout has lost it completely. John Knefel declares “The David Dukes of the World Prevail.” 
Kelly Hayes declares “White Supremacy Elected Donald Trump.” 
William Rivers Pitt declares “We have elected a fascist that Mussolini would have recognized on sight.” 
Hillary carried only a handful of states, the states that comprise the One Percent’s stomping grounds. Yet Amy Goodman of Democracy Now sees meaning in political writer John Nichols claim that as Hillary carried New York and California, she won the popular vote and should be in the White House. 
I remember a few days ago George Soros saying that Trump would win the popular vote, but that the electoral vote would go to Hillary, thus ridding the oligarchs of Trump. 
Earth Justice promises to hold Trump accountable. Trump who promises to end the threat of nuclear war with Russia and China, thereby doing more to save animal and human life than the entirety of the Democratic Party and environmental organizations, is going to be held accountable by an organization that allegedly is beyond politics and is dedicated to preserving animals from destruction. 
The ACLU, of which I am a member, has also put “on notice” the president-elect who has said he will save us from nuclear war. Faced with this idiocy from the ACLU, I will not renew my membership. 
Feminists tell us that we are “grieving, scared, and in shock,” and that “it is critical that we stand together and support each other.” 
Jeremy Ben-Ami of the J Street Jewish Community tells us that it is “an incredibly sad and difficult day. For tens of millions of Americans who share a core belief in tolerance, decency and social justice, the election results are a severe shock. In this challenging moment, we turn to one another for comfort and community. During this election, J Street made unequivocally clear our conviction that Donald Trump is not fit to be president of the United States.” 
Van Jones, a CNN commentator, said that Trump’s election is a nightmare, “a deeply painful moment,” a “whitelash” against minorities. While he bemoaned the pain inflicted upon poor little presstitute Van Jones, he didn’t mind insulting the American electorate and the President-elect of the United States. After all, Van Jones sees that as his racist prerogative. Architects of Endless “Regime Change” wars 
And so, the holier-than-thou crowd prefers Hillary, despite her unambigious position that she would maximize conflict with Russia and China, provoke direct military conflict between the US and Russia by imposing a no-fly zone in Syria, attack Iran and other of Israel’s targets, further enrich her Wall Street handlers by privatizing Social Security, and prevent any dissent from the lowly people class of her high-handed ways. If William Rivers Pitt sees Trump as a Mussolini fascist, Trump is too mild for Pitt. He prefers Hillary, a Hitler to the third power. 
The progressives have totally discredited themselves just as the presstitutes have done. Their need for a bogyman to nourish their hysteria indicates serious psychological disturbance. 
They actually prefer the risk of Armageddon to peace among nuclear powers. As their 501(c)3s live off corporate contributions, they prefer globalist corporate profits to jobs for ordinary Americans. 
These are the people who think of themselves as our instructors and our betters. 
If only Trump could exile the lot of them. They are anti-American to the core. Related Posts:",0
19618,"Intensified by Climate Change, ‘King Tides’ Change Ways of Life in Florida - The New York Times","FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.  —   In an enclave of a city known as the Venice of America, where   houses look out over a maze of picturesque canals, the comparison to the Venice of Italy no longer seems so appealing. On Monday morning, shortly after November’s   supermoon dropped from view on Mola Avenue, it was easy to see why. The tide swelled on command. Seawater gurgled audibly up through manhole covers and seeped from the grass. Under a sunny sky, the water drowned docks and slid over low sea walls. By 8:15 a. m. peak tide, this street in the Las Olas Isles neighborhood was inundated, just like the Venice across the pond. Sergio Lafratta, an independent business consultant who moved in just three months ago, stood shirtless in tall waders, watching the saltwater seep into his new lawn. “There goes my grass again,” Mr. Lafratta said. His grass squares floated away down the street. His wife, Marilia, a psychologist, stood on the doorstep in her pajamas and chimed in. “We spend too much money to live here,” she said. “We knew about this”  —   the flooding  —   “but we didn’t think it would be this bad. ” In South Florida, which takes rising sea levels seriously enough to form a regional compact to deal with global warming, climate change is no abstract issue. By 2100, sea levels could swell high enough to submerge 12. 5 percent of Florida’s homes. These   king tides, which happen frequently, are the most blatant example of the interplay between rising seas and the alignment of the moon, sun and Earth. Even without a drop of rain, some places flood routinely. Monday’s planetary dance was particularly notable: The moon was both full and at its closest distance to the Earth since 1948. The closer the moon, the stronger the gravitational tug on the oceans, the higher the tide. Rising sea levels exacerbate the flooding, scientists said. In much of South Florida, including Broward County and Fort Lauderdale, finding   and   fixes to the challenges of flooding caused by rising seas is a priority. A new position now exists to deal with it: resiliency chief or sustainability director. Pumps and backflow valves have been put in place. Roads will be or have been elevated (most famously in Miami Beach, which invested $400 million to deal with flooding). Sea walls are being raised. Counties are also beginning to rethink building codes. Taken together, the costs will be enormous. In the next five decades, the seas could rise two to three feet, said Jennifer Jurado, Broward County’s chief resiliency officer. Already, life on Mola Avenue has changed considerably, depending on the moon cycle, the month, the wind and the rain. Residents are already gearing up for the next king tide. It arrives next month. Adapting to the “new normal,” as some call it, is a requirement now. Sherry Harris kicks off her heels and splashes to her car to go to work. The Lafrattas, both originally from Brazil, pore over tidal charts for the first time in their lives. “No wake” signs warn cars to slow to a crawl so the brackish water does not inundate lawns. Residents know to park on high ground. Garbage cans are kept safely away from the curb, or they wind up bobbing up and down the road like wayward buoys. “I forgot them one time,” Mr. Lafratta said, “and there was garbage everywhere. ” People who live here have complained to city officials for years but said they might wind up having to pay for some of the fixes themselves (one proposal asks for $20, 000 from each resident). Already, many have to elevate their sea walls because they sit on private property. Raising the roads may also cost them. All of these options inevitably give rise to    ’  squabbles. And even as new   mansions rise from the saturated ground, those who live on Mola fret about property values. “Flood?” said Michael Asser, poking fun at the situation after he opened his front door to a waterlogged reporter. “What flood? The city says there is no flood. ” “It’s been going on 25 years, but each year it’s worse,” he added. “When I first came here, during spring tides, you had a splash here, a splash there. ” Does he ever think about selling? “I’ll probably have to stay here forever,” he said. Standing in front of the whimsical garden outside his Coconut Grove house, Dr. Karl H. Muench, a physician and professor of medicine at the University of Miami, said he and his neighbors got lucky this week. The forecast called for widespread king tide flooding, but West Fairview Street dodged the worst of it on Tuesday. “It can come up to here,” he said, pointing to the edge of his property. “I’ve had to wade home   from a block away I didn’t want to bring my car into the saltwater. ” A stone’s throw away, a canal threatened to spill over a sea wall as a manatee frolicked by a small bridge. But the water held back, reaching the brim. Instead, it seeped up through the storm drains and pooled onto Fairview.   County was largely spared the tide cycle this week: Miami Beach’s pumps and elevated roadways easily dealt with the incoming water (save for an inundated parking garage where an octopus swam). Other problem pockets near the Miami River and in Shorecrest got minimal flooding. It was an example of the unpredictability of nature, which can make planning and preparing for floods tricky business. Last month, when the wind was churned up by a passing hurricane, the king tide was much worse. And last year, residents said, it was spectacularly bad. Erratic as the weather can be at times, Dr. Muench, 82, who has lived in this graceful neighborhood of banyan trees and   air for 40 years, said he was certain about one thing: Global warming is the culprit for the   water that regularly covers the road in front of his house. “There has been a definite, gradual increase since the onset of information about global warming,” he said. “In my mind, there is no question about the relationship. The canal is rising because the ocean is rising. ” Dr. Muench said he fretted about   Donald J. Trump’s position on global warming. In a   2012 post on Twitter, Mr. Trump said the concept was “created by and for the Chinese in order to make U. S. manufacturing noncompetitive. ” Now that Mr. Trump has chosen Myron Ebell to lead his Environmental Protection Agency transition team, Dr. Muench’s concerns have deepened. Mr. Ebell has helped lead the charge against the scientific consensus that global warming exists and is caused by people. James Murley,   County’s chief resilience officer, said the rising sea level did not cause king tides, “but it amplifies these events. ” Claudia Falero was drying her French bulldog inside her gleaming house as it drizzled outside. When she and her husband bought the house seven years ago, the flooding took them by surprise. “It wasn’t something advertised,” she said, laughing. The couple’s letters to city officials have gone unanswered, she said. Residents say they hear that the road may get elevated, the sea wall fixed. So far, though, it is just talk. “It gets you mad,” Ms. Falero said, “because you pay taxes, and nothing is getting done. ” Shirley Borg gripped the steering wheel of her Honda Accord, traveling at a turtle’s pace through saltwater a few inches deep that was rising all over her street. The homeowners here on Adams Drive know the drill: Drive slowly to keep the splash down, or drive quickly and risk ruining your car. “I just replaced the wheel bearings because the seals were broken from saltwater,” she said. “I asked, ‘How does that happen?’ And they said, ‘Do you go through a lot of brackish water?’ Oh, yeah. ” The Florida Keys have a unique problem: Unlike areas farther north, which have barrier islands and then the mainland, the Keys are made up solely of a chain of   islands built on porous limestone. Stopping the water from rolling into neighborhoods here is not an easy task. Sea walls, for example, do not work. Patience is a requirement nowadays on some Keys roads. Ms. Borg has lived in Twin Lakes, a waterfront community, for 11 years, and floodwaters are now a regular feature of the neighborhood. They vary, like everywhere else in South Florida, depending on moon cycles, and they are compounded by poor infrastructure and rising sea levels. “The first seven years, we only flooded twice,” Ms. Borg said on Tuesday. Last year, 10 inches of water outside often trapped residents in their homes. Ms. Borg’s car sits five inches off the ground, so do the math. In 2015, she went carless for two weeks  —   not even flatbed truck drivers wanted to chance it. Some people in her neighborhood left their cars somewhere else and commuted, Florida Keys style, by boat. Others lost their cars altogether saltwater is particularly corrosive to engines and metal. Climate change is on many of their minds. And, like Dr. Muench, they worry  —   not just about the incoming president, but also about Florida’s governor, Rick Scott. Some former state environmental employees accused Mr. Scott, a Republican, last year of banning the phrase “climate change” in conversation and on documents, a charge he has said is untrue. “A climate change denier?” quipped Benjamin Klitzkie, standing in his driveway on Tuesday morning as the water encroached. “I got a house for you in Key Largo. ” Mr. Klitzkie bought his home on Shaw Drive in 2011, but worries about his investment. Houses on the street are still selling  —   one is listed for $729, 000  —   but what if the water keeps coming? Recently, he said, it approached a neighbor’s front gate. County officials are meeting regularly with homeowners to discuss raising the road and other improvements. They have stopped issuing building permits on the street, Mr. Klitzkie said. “It’s sinking,” he said. “And the seas are rising. ” Rhonda Haag, Monroe County’s sustainability director, said officials had done an analysis of some county roads. The conclusion was that elevating them, including on Shaw Drive, would be the best option. But it is expensive  —   raising one road six inches costs $1 million for a third of a mile  —   and complicated. “And we do recognize the fact that we will lose certain places sooner rather than later  —   some of the natural areas first,” Ms. Haag said. For Frank Garces, an insurance adjuster who moved here less than two years ago, it cannot happen fast enough. He said he never used to give global warming a second thought. “Now,” he said, “I’m researching moon phases and tides. ”",0

19620,Tim Kaine Readily Moves Out of Spotlight: ‘This Is More Me’ - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Senator Tim Kaine’s   office is much as he left it, with a minifridge full of   hummus and an iPod playlist heavy on bluegrass and classic rock. The trademark harmonicas have been holstered, at least for now, his audience shrinking from a spellbound national electorate to a spirited weekday gathering of the Virginia Chamber of Commerce. And his campaign plane? It was repurposed this past week to deliver the United States men’s soccer team to a match in Costa Rica, with only one lingering reminder  —   an H on the tail  —   of the first female presidential nominee for a major party in American history and the affable     running mate who traveled the country making her case. “I like feet on the ground,” Mr. Kaine said with a smile this past week, suggesting he was not dwelling on the trappings of temporary fame. He boarded an elevator in the basement of the Capitol, nowhere to go but up. Such is Mr. Kaine’s view from the great election comedown of 2016: that quadrennial moment of humility, electoral grieving and reverse culture shock, foisted upon members of the losing ticket as they resume less glamorous public lives. Secret Service agents are reassigned. Media scrums migrate elsewhere. The junior senator from Virginia is, as it turns out, a heartbeat away from very little. Yet as Mr. Kaine and his party seek to regain their bearings after a stunning loss, he has identified at least one task for himself in the interim: taking his place, as necessary, in the wall of opposition to   Donald J. Trump. “The Democratic Senate minority is about the only emergency brake there is on the train right now,” Mr. Kaine said this past week, adding that the levers of obstruction must be used “judiciously. ” “To avoid a disaster,” he added. “You use it to avoid something really bad for the country. ” Though fellow Democrats, including aides to Hillary Clinton, have long trumpeted Mr. Kaine’s appeal to multiple constituencies  —   given his fluency in Spanish, genial manner and eloquence on matters of faith  —   his role in the party’s   future is unclear. Progressive activists have emerged from the election with a conviction that new voices must be elevated. Mr. Kaine, who is up for   in 2018, said that he would not seek the presidency or vice presidency in 2020. Liberal stars like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont have delivered stern, rousing addresses about the way forward. No one is clamoring for a Tim Kaine revolution. But as Senate Democrats gird for bruising policy squabbles and confirmation hearings in a Trump administration, they are expected to look to Mr. Kaine with particular urgency on foreign affairs. A member of the Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees, from a state with a major military presence, Mr. Kaine has made foreign policy a priority of his first term in the Senate. He has seized especially the issue of war powers, breaking with President Obama by calling for Congress to provide authorization for military action against the Islamic State. Among his arguments, as he sought to galvanize Democrats: There is no telling who might be president down the line. “With Trump’s maybe erratic foreign policy, his leadership is more important,” Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio said of Mr. Kaine. “I mean, we were sad to lose him,” he added, referring to Mr. Kaine’s   prospects in the executive branch. “But we wanted to lose him, obviously. ” Mr. Kaine’s purpose in recent days has seemed at times more therapeutic than strategic. With emotions still raw, he supplied a measure of catharsis for devastated supporters as he introduced Mrs. Clinton before her concession speech. He said what Mrs. Clinton chose not to  —   that she had won the popular vote  —   suggesting that the party’s ideals remained resonant despite the outcome. And he channeled William Faulkner to appraise the collective Democratic psyche. “They killed us,” Mr. Kaine said, “but they ain’t whooped us yet. ” Among losing running mates through the years, soul searching has assumed different forms. After the Republican ticket’s defeat in 1976, Hubert H. Humphrey tried to lift the spirits of his despondent friend, Bob Dole, the party’s   nominee, with an ice cream outing. After a loss in 1980, former Vice President Walter Mondale went on to be Democrats’ nominee for president in 1984, and lost 49 states to Ronald Reagan. Sarah Palin announced her resignation as Alaska governor eight months after she and Senator John McCain lost the 2008 election. Mr. Kaine, who has communicated occasionally with Mrs. Clinton since the defeat, is accustomed to jarring transitions. He recalled the day of his successor’s inauguration as governor of Virginia in 2010. “They take you home, and they drop you off and then they drive away,” he said. “I had the same feeling this time. Shaking hands with everybody was very emotional, but watching the cars drive away, I had an immense feeling of relief. ” His most   turn, a debate with Vice   Mike Pence, attracted a smattering of critics, who chafed at his repeated interruptions of his opponent onstage. Mostly though, Mr. Kaine cultivated an unpretentious image during the campaign, introducing   comedy viewers to his assemblage of harmonicas, which remain in his briefcase, and urging voters to choose a “you’re hired” president instead of a “you’re fired” president. He often took the stage with a flurry of     gesticulations, like a   coach flashing signals, proving proficient at vigorous fist pumps and seemingly indiscriminate  . He once described life as a   nominee, playfully, as being “kidnapped. ” “The entourage felt cool on occasion,” he said this past week, “but it was never me. So this is more me. ” Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, said he expected little change from the “energetically engaged, very  ” colleague he had come to know before the election. Mr. Cardin did express a measure of concern about Mr. Kaine’s   health. “He’s tired,” Mr. Cardin said. “He needs to gain a little weight back. He lost too much weight. But he’ll get back to his fighting weight. ”",0
19621,How ‘Elites’ Became One of the Nastiest Epithets in American Politics - The New York Times,"Our new president is a    billionaire Ivy League graduate, a real estate tycoon, a TV star and a son of inherited wealth. But he is no longer, by his own calculations, a member of the “elite. ” Nor are the men (and the few women) now joining his inner circle  —     and corporate executives, Harvard and Yale alumni, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and Goldman Sachs bankers. The true elite apparently sits elsewhere, among those who, in Sarah Palin’s notable 2008 formulation, think “that they’re  —   I guess  —   better than anyone else. ” As an adjective, the word “elite” still conveys something positive, even aspirational: elite athlete, elite model, elite travel services. But as a noun, embodied by actual living people, it has become one of the nastiest epithets in American politics. “Elites have taken all the upside for themselves and pushed the downside to the   and   Americans,” complains Trump’s adviser Steve Bannon (of Harvard, Goldman Sachs and Hollywood). In this formulation, elites are a destructive, condescending collective, plotting against the beleaguered masses outside their ranks. And in these attacks, the   and his team are deploying one of the most effective partisan political stereotypes of the modern age. For most of American history,   sentiment was a matter of up versus down, not left versus right. But about half a century ago, the conservative movement set out to claim   politics as its own. That meant redefining the term away from class and toward culture, where the “elite” could be identified by its liberal ideas, coastal real estate and highbrow consumer preferences. The   Club for Growth captured this type in a famous 2004 attack ad, instructing the Democrat Howard Dean to “take his           New York         freak show back to Vermont where it belongs. ” Trump adjusted the formula for the hot topics of the 2016 campaign. “I was on the right side of that issue, as you know, with the people,” he boasted after Brexit, adding that “Hillary, as always, stood with the elites. ” His complaints against “political correctness” conjure a world of absurdist campus politics, where overprivileged students squabble over gender pronouns and the fine points of racial victimization. “Media elites” come in for special attack, cordoned off in pens to be mocked and jeered at during rallies, labeled both liars and incompetents. But Trump has also ventured beyond mere   turning the 2016 election into a competition between knowledge systems: the      “people” versus the    “elites. ” His campaign insisted for months that pollsters and technocrats and media would be proven wrong by his electoral success. The fact that he did win dealt a blow to an entire worldview, one in which empirical inquiry and   were supposed to triumph in the end. The question, now, is whether it’s possible to run an executive branch based on hostility toward experts and professionals of all political stripes  —   and how many billionaires and Ivy Leaguers Trump can appoint before this rhetorical pose begins to break down altogether. The notion that distant elites might be conspiring against the people comes straight from the Founding Fathers, whose Declaration of Independence lamented the “long train of abuses and usurpations” inflicted upon ordinary Americans by an arrogant British king. From there on, United States history might be seen as a repeating cycle of   revolt. The Jacksonians rebelled against the Founders’ aristocratic pretensions. Northern “free labor” went to war against the oligarchical slavocracy. And the Populist revolts of the late 19th century adapted this story to modern capitalism, with farmers and laborers rebelling against robber barons, bankers,   experts and   professionals. The first historians to study those Populists described them as heroic crusaders, champions of the “people” against the “powers. ” But by the middle of the 20th century, alarmed by the rise of fascism and homegrown demagogues like Senator Joseph McCarthy, a new generation of scholars took a more anxious view of the   spirit. In his 1955 book “The Age of Reform,” Richard Hofstadter dismissed the Populists as   provincial   the latent fascists of their day. Eight years later, his “  in American Life” documented a dangerous suspicion of “the critical mind” that seemed to course through the national culture. From his perspective, the 1952 election captured everything wrong with American political life, with Dwight Eisenhower’s “philistinism” winning over Adlai Stevenson’s “intellect. ” Hofstadter did not usually describe his ideal intellectually minded citizens as members of an “elite. ” That word conveyed something different  —   a ruling class that held direct political and economic power. The most famous articulation of this view came from the sociologist C. Wright Mills, in his 1956 assessment of America’s “power elite. ” “They rule the big corporations,” Mills wrote. “They run the machinery of the state and claim its prerogatives. They direct the military establishment. ” In Mills’s view, these people were tied together not by culture or ideology but by their positions at the helms of large,    institutions. As individuals, they might be Republicans or Democrats, and might live in Ohio or California. The point was that they were in charge of things. But that vision never gained much traction in mainstream politics, where a more partisan, targeted definition was starting to emerge. William F. Buckley Jr. carved out some essentials in his first book, “God and Man at Yale,” drawing a neat distinction between respectable   men like himself and the socialistic eggheads of the professoriate. Ronald Reagan chose the term “elite” to bring it all together in his famed 1964 speech, “A Time for Choosing,” delivered on behalf of the Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater. “This is the issue of this election,” he said: “whether we believe in our capacity for   or whether we abandon the American Revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a   capitol can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves. ” Lyndon Johnson won that election in a blowout, but Reagan’s vision of a smug and detached liberal elite helped spark the oncoming “culture wars,” pitting a supposedly indignant Middle America against the liberal snobs of the coasts. By the 1990s, with the rise of   media stars like Rush Limbaugh and Bill O’Reilly, bashing the “liberal elite” had become a favorite blood sport of the American right. Despite all the abuse hurled their way, some “liberal elites” have accepted at least part of their detractors’ critique, particularly on the progressive left. It was during Bill Clinton’s presidency that the social critic Christopher Lasch published “The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy,” which mourned that “   liberals” had turned into “petulant,   intolerant” scolds, thoroughly out of touch with the concerns of Middle America. Since then, the torch has passed to a younger generation of writers, including MSNBC’s Chris Hayes, whose 2012 “Twilight of the Elites” called for rethinking the entire ethos of liberal “meritocracy”  —   a system, he argued, that tends to fuel   and incompetence at the top while offering little but contempt and dim prospects for those at the bottom. So as 2017 begins, we find ourselves in a strange and uncertain political moment. Antipathy toward a wealthy, preening managerial class seems to be gaining popularity across the political spectrum  —   and, oddly, to have helped elect a wealthy, preening incoming president. Meanwhile, both liberal and conservative “elites” are scrambling to figure out what happens if the   continues to reject basic political norms and even routine intelligence briefings. Under a Trump presidency, such “elites” may have no choice but to attempt a radical redefinition of their role in American life. Otherwise, the man in the White House will do it for them.",0
19622,A collection of thoughts about American foreign policy,"A collection of thoughts about American foreign policy By William Blum   William Blum 
Louis XVI needed a revolution; Napoleon needed two historic military defeats; the Spanish Empire in the New World needed multiple revolutions; the Russian Czar needed a communist revolution; the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empire needed World War I; Nazi Germany needed World War II; Imperial Japan needed two atomic bombs; the Portuguese Empire in Africa needed a military coup at home; the Soviet Empire needed Mikhail Gorbachev . . . What will the American Empire need? 
“I don’t believe anyone will consciously launch World War III. The situation now is more like the eve of World War I, when great powers were armed and ready to go when an incident set things off. Ever since Gorbachev naively ended the Cold War, the hugely over-armed United States has been actively surrounding Russia with weapons systems, aggressive military exercises, NATO expansion. At the same time, in recent years the demonization of Vladimir Putin has reached war propaganda levels. Russians have every reason to believe that the United States is preparing for war against them, and are certain to take defensive measures. This mixture of excessive military preparations and propaganda against an “evil enemy” make it very easy for some trivial incident to blow it all up.”— Diana Johnstone, author of “Queen of Chaos: The Misadventures of Hillary Clinton” 
In September 2013 President Obama stood before the United Nations General Assembly and declared, “I believe America is exceptional.” The following year at the UN, the president classified Russia as one of the three threats to the world along with the Islamic State and the ebola virus. On March 9, 2015 President Barack Obama declared Venezuela “an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.”

“The Plan is for the United States to rule the world. The overt theme is unilateralism, but it is ultimately a story of domination. It calls for the United States to maintain its overwhelming superiority and prevent new rivals from rising up to challenge it on the world stage. It calls for dominion over friends and enemies alike. It says not that the United States must be more powerful, or most powerful, but that it must be absolutely powerful.” 
Two flew over the cuckoo’s nest: “We are, as a matter of empirical fact and undeniable history, the greatest force for good the world has ever known. . . . security and freedom for millions of people around the globe have depended on America’s military , economic, political, and diplomatic might.”— 
“War with Russia will be nuclear. Washington has prepared for it. Washington has abandoned the ABM treaty, created what it thinks is an ABM shield, and changed its war doctrine to permit US nuclear first strike. All of this is obviously directed at Russia, and the Russian government knows it. How long will Russia sit there waiting for Washington’s first strike?”—

US General Barry McCaffrey, April 2015: “Because so far NATO’s reaction to Putin’s aggression has been to send a handful of forces to the Baltics to demonstrate ‘resolve,’ which has only convinced Putin that the alliance is either unable or unwilling to fight. So we had better change his calculus pretty soon, and contest Putin’s stated doctrine that he is willing to intervene militarily in other countries to ‘protect’ Russia-speaking people. For God’s sake, the last time we heard that was just before Hitler invaded the Sudetenland.” No, my dear general, we heard that repeatedly in 1983 when the United States invaded the tiny nation of Grenada to protect and rescue hundreds of Americans who supposedly were in danger from the new leftist government. It was all a fraud, no more than an excuse to overthrow a government that that didn’t believe that the American Empire was God’s gift to humanity. 
Since 1980, the United States has intervened in the affairs of fourteen Muslim countries, at worst invading or bombing them. They are (in chronological order) Iran, Libya, Lebanon, Kuwait, Iraq, Somalia, Bosnia, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Sudan, Kosovo, Yemen, Pakistan, and now Syria. 
How our never-ending Mideast horror began: Radio Address of George W. Bush, September 28, 2002: “The Iraqi regime possesses biological and chemical weapons, is rebuilding the facilities to make more and, according to the British government, could launch a biological or chemical attack in as little as 45 minutes after the order is given. The regime has long-standing and continuing ties to terrorist groups, and there are al Qaeda terrorists inside Iraq. This regime is seeking a nuclear bomb, and with fissile material could build one within a year.” Yet . . . just six weeks before 9/11, Condoleezza Rice told CNN: “Let’s remember that his [Saddam’s] country is divided, in effect. He does not control the northern part of his country. We are able to keep his arms from him. His military forces have not been rebuilt.” 
The fact is that there is more participation by the Cuban population in the running of their country than there is by the American population in the running of theirs. One important reason is the absence of the numerous private corporations which, in the United States, exert great influence over all aspects of life. 
“The U.S. is frantically surrounding China with military weapons, advanced aircraft, naval fleets and a multitude of military bases from Japan, South Korea and the Philippines through several nearby smaller Pacific islands to its new and enlarged base in Australia . . . The U.S. naval fleet, aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines patrol China’s nearby waters. Warplanes, surveillance planes, drones and spying satellites cover the skies, creating a symbolic darkness at noon.” (Jack A. Smith, “Hegemony Games: USA vs. PRC,” CounterPunch) 
SR’s leader Nikita Khrushchev, a native of the region, had donated Crimea to Ukraine in 1954. Crimeans were always strongly opposed to that change and voted overwhelmingly to rejoin Russia after the US-induced Ukrainian coup in 2014. Russian President Vladimir Putin refers to the Ukrainian army as “NATO’s foreign legion,” which does not pursue Ukraine’s national interests. The United States, however, insists on labeling the Russian action in Crimea as an invasion. 
Putin re Crimea/Ukraine: “Our western partners created the ‘Kosovo precedent’ with their own hands. In a situation absolutely the same as the one in Crimea they recognized Kosovo’s secession from Serbia legitimate while arguing that no permission from a country’s central authority for a unilateral declaration of independence is necessary . . . And the UN International Court of Justice agreed with those arguments. That’s what they said; that’s what they trumpeted all over the world and coerced everyone to accept—and now they are complaining about Crimea. Why is that?” 
Paul Craig Roberts: “The absurdity of it all! Even a moron knows that if Russia is going to put tanks and troops into Ukraine, Russia will put in enough to do the job. The war would be over in a few days if not in a few hours. As Putin himself said some months ago, if the Russian military enters Ukraine, the news will not be the fate of Donetsk or Mauriupol, but the fall of Kiev and Lviv.” 
In a major examination of US policy vis-à-vis China, published in March 2015, the authoritative Council on Foreign Relations bluntly declared that “there is no real prospect of building fundamental trust, ‘peaceful coexistence,’ ‘mutual understanding,’ a strategic partnership, or a ‘new type of major country relations’ between the United States and China.” The United States, the report declares, must, therefore, develop “the political will” and military capabilities “to deal with China to protect vital U.S. interests.”

Cuban baseball players who are paid a million dollars to play for an American team are not “defectors,” a word which has a clear political connotation. 
Boris Yeltsin was acceptable to American and Europeans because he was seen as a weak, pliable figure that allowed Western capital free rein in the newly opened Russian territory following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Yeltsin’s era was also a time of rampant corruption by Russian oligarchs who were closely associated with Western capital. That corrosive culture came to a halt with the election of Vladimir Putin twice as president between 2000–2008, and again in 2012. 
Many ISIS leaders were former Iraqi military officers who were imprisoned by American troops. The fight isn’t against ISIS, it’s against Assad; at the next level it isn’t against Assad, it’s against Putin; then, at the next level, it isn’t against Putin, it’s against the country most likely to stand in the way of US world domination, Russia. And it’s forever. 
Connecting to the US-based Internet would mean channeling all of Cuba’s communications directly to the NSA. 
George W. Bush has been living a comparatively quiet life in Texas, with a focus on his paintings. “I’m trying to leave something behind,” he said a couple of years ago. Yeah, right, George. We can stand up some of the paintings against the large piles of Iraqi dead bodies. 
Seymour Hirsch: “America would be much better off, if, 30 years ago, we had let Russia continue its war in Afghanistan . . . The mistake was made by the Carter administration which was trying to stop the Russians from their invasion of Afghanistan. We’d be better off had we let the Russians beat the Taliban.” ( Deutsche Welle , April 2, 2014 interview) We’d be even better off if we hadn’t overthrown the progressive, secular Afghan government, giving rise to the Taliban in the first place and inciting the Russians to intervene on their border lest the Soviet Islamic population was stirred up. 
The former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in an interview in 1998 summed up exactly what the US thinks of the UN: “The UN plays a very important role. But if we don’t like it, we always have the option of following our own national security interests, which I assure you we will do if we don’t like what’s going on.” She is now a foreign-policy advisor to Hillary Clinton.

Of course, we wouldn’t have time to go after them one by one. We’d have to lump Wall Street investment bankers in one trial, the Council on Foreign Relations in another, and any remaining Harvard Business School or Yale Law graduates in a third.

19623,ELECTION CHANGES POLITICAL LANDSCAPE INSIDE MARRIAGE,"ELECTION CHANGES POLITICAL LANDSCAPE INSIDE MARRIAGE Nov 14, 2016 
RICHMOND, VA (SatireWire.com) – Donald Trump’s shock election has dramatically shifted the political landscape in the home of Deirdre and Scott Taylor of Richmond, Va., as Scott’s vote for Trump has caused Deirdre to redraw the physical and emotional boundaries of their relationship, in lieu of just killing him. 
“Due to the incomprehensible votes cast by certain members of this household electorate, I am shifting policy to address the very real threat that my husband Scott is an idiot,” said Deirdre Taylor of Richmond, Va. “As a result, I am today redistricting our house such that Scott resides only his areas, specifically the basement, the garage, the couch – every night – and the yard, although not in areas of the yard where I can see him or hear him or smell him.” 
The bedroom, she added, is now the equivalent of the post-industrial Midwestern states that went for Trump. 
“It’s a place of anger and sadness that was once a thriving hub of activity but now that’s gone and it’s never coming back,” she said. 
The Taylors, who have been married for 12 years, are among thousands of couples in the U.S. that are struggling to adapt to the seismic shift in their once-united states, a shift brought on by a vote in which the women voted for Hillary Clinton and the men chose Trump. 
Ironically, many of these white, suburban males now find themselves holding the status of the women and minorities Trump often railed against. 
“I’ve talked it over with Deirdre and our friends, and my husband Kirk and his buddies will now be marginalized, under-served and, politically and in all other ways, impotent,” said Kora Ann Snelling, a neighbor of Deirdre’s. “Using terms Mr. Trump and my husband can understand, they’ll be vaginally bankrupt.” 
For the Taylors, the shift became apparent late on election night as they watched the results come in. 
“I asked Scott if he voted for Hillary, and he said, ‘Um…’ Deirdre recalled. 
“That’s all I said! ‘Um,’ Scott explained. 
“Because you couldn’t bring yourself to admit you voted for a race-baiting, misogynistic pathological liar who draws support from white nationalists and boasts of sexual assault!” Deirdre countered. 
“But I just… wanted to make American great again,” Scott protested. 
“Why don’t you make the doghouse great again instead?” Deirdre replied. 
“We don’t have a dog,” Scott pointed out. 
“Well get Mexico to build you one!” she said. 
While Trump doesn’t take office until January, Deirdre has already taken steps to institute a core tenet of her new policy. 
“I have completed a virtual border wall between myself and the father of our children – our two daughters ! – and if he so much as attempts to approach he will be treated as an enemy combatant,” she said. 
At press time, Deirdre was reading the children a book about tolerance while Scott was trapped in a hell of his own making.

19624,Review: ‘No Knives in the Kitchens of This City’ Describes a Syrian Hell - The New York Times,"Aleppo has essentially fallen. The images have been unignorable, calamitous: of residents wandering numbly through burning city streets of parents sobbing over dead children of the strong wheeling away the weak. On Tuesday, a United Nations official described the massacre of fleeing civilians as “a complete meltdown of humanity. ” Residents have been tweeting out their goodbyes. Tens of thousands have already been displaced or perished. A   metropolis of wealth, power and culture is now in ruins. Khaled Khalifa writes about his native city with sensuality and an almost feral intensity in his new novel, “No Knives in the Kitchens of This City. ” The book focuses on just one family, and it stops several years short of the Syrian civil war. But it offers a glimpse into how terrified and empty of hope the people of a city must be to rise up in revolt. The future offers them nothing. It is a castle of closed doors. “A festival of veritable insanity and strange odors,” Mr. Khalifa writes, “Aleppo became a city given over to ceaseless fear, a city of retribution, whimpering under the appetites of the mukhabarat”  —   the secret police  —   “and the corrupt officials who were proficient only in loyalty. ” Convention requires that I recount something of the plot of “No Knives in the Kitchens of This City,” first published in Cairo in 2013. But no synopsis can give a sense of what reading this book is like. Mr. Khalifa’s story is episodic rather than linear it is more about an atmosphere, both emotional and physical, than any defining event. The author, whom this newspaper has called “one of the rising stars of Arab fiction,” writes in lush, pungent prose, some of it overripe, like a fermented banana. But some of it is also beautiful. Here he is, describing Sawsan, the siren of the family, furious at a man for overlooking her charms: “She looked at him with the insolence she reserved for those times when she wanted to scrape the marrow from the bones of someone she intended to punish. ” How many women have shot someone just such a desiccating glare? Or dreamed of it, anyway. In broad strokes: “No Knives in the Kitchens of This City,” translated by Leri Price, is about a cultivated family under two successive autocrats who despise cultivation. What these autocrats  —   first, Hafez   and then his son Bashar  —   value is conformity, docility and ultimately treachery there are informers informing on informers informing on informers. “My mother told me that spies lived in the trees,” the unnamed narrator explains. To survive such a government with your sanity and dignity intact requires living a “parallel life,” as the narrator often says. You must split off from the rhythms and doings of everyday Syria, in the hope that some small, lonesome part of your moral machinery remains uncorrupted. The narrator of “No Knives in the Kitchens of This City” was born just a few days before Syria’s 1963 coup. He considers this timing a bad omen, a mark upon his destiny, and his solution is to keep his head down and his expectations low. His brother, Rashid, is a gifted violinist and lost soul. His sister, Sawsan, is a creature of wild excess  —   angry, sexual, mercurial. The narrator has another sister, too, Suad, but a disability takes her life prematurely. It’s the narrator’s mother, though, who embodies the real terror, melancholy and desperation of Aleppo. Once a respected schoolteacher (she gushed to her students about Vivaldi, entertained her friends with   teacups) she spends her later years in an embittered state of disassociation. “My mother was like one of those women who never stopped chattering,” the narrator says, “even while yawning. ” Every character gets his or her moment in this book  —   some in the years before the 1963 coup, some in the near present, some in the decades in between. The central question for each is simple: How do you wrench meaning from such a dismal existence? Some capitulate to the state’s demands. Others defy them and pay the price. Sawsan’s reactions are perhaps the most extreme, running the gamut of possibilities: First she joins the Baath Party and revels in her power then she rejects it and dabbles in religious radicalism. (Her conversion involves a shady operation to restore her virginity.) But nothing, ultimately, can assuage the despair of this family or nation, especially when Bashar   takes his father’s place. “He thought he would spend his whole life being desperate and afraid,” the narrator writes of his brother, Rashid. “He told me he wouldn’t wait until the grandson of the late President was ruling over us. ” Shame floods these characters’ veins. Shame about their lust. Shame about their children. And shame, above all, about their failures to fight tyranny. How to justify participating in Baath Party parades, and throatily chanting party songs, and heartily praising party propaganda? Nizar, the narrator’s uncle (also a musician) leads the life with the most integrity. He is defiantly,   gay in a place where it is criminal to be so. Mr. Khalifa is interested in erotic desire  —   and its repression. He lingers over it, conjuring some of the most graphic depictions of sex (in hotel rooms, in prisons, in the recesses of the imagination) I’ve read all year. “No Knives in the Kitchens of This City” meanders a great deal. At moments, it can be slow and hard to follow its characters sometimes act in ways that make little sense, even by the erratic standards of human behavior in dictatorships. But the sights, smells and horror of living in Aleppo come pounding to life in this book. The place, to me, is no longer an abstraction, and Mr. Khalifa clearly fears for its fate throughout. “Cities die,” he writes, “just like people. ” Sometimes sooner than you’d imagine. In your own lifetime, even, right before your eyes.",0

19626,8 Catastrophic Signs Reveal Hillary’s Campaign Is IMPLODING,"8 Catastrophic Signs Reveal Hillary’s Campaign Is IMPLODING Posted on October 31, 2016 by Prissy Holly in Politics Share This 
For months now, we’ve been patiently waiting for the scandal that would finally bring down Hillary Clinton. With the media constantly in her back pocket, she’s miraculously been able to keep anything from sticking. However, in an ironic twist, a member of her own party in the form of Anthony Weiner appears to be the force that will finally deliver the death blow to Hillary’s presidential bid. 
Over the weekend, we got the incredible news that the FBI would be re-opening their investigation into Hillary after new pertinent emails were uncovered while authorities were investigating Anthony Weiner. Although Hillary would love for everyone to believe that everything is just peachy and she’s on the road to victory, there are catastrophic signs beginning to emerge, revealing that Hillary’s campaign is literally imploding from within. 
Just in time for Halloween, here are the top 8 signs that show Hillary’s campaign is blowing up in her face, and that the long-awaited karma train has finally begun to run her over. 1. Hillary’s Right-hand Woman Huma Abedin Is Suddenly MIA 
It’s rare that we ever see Huma departed from Hillary’s side, but the love affair between the two appears to be crashing down, now that Huma’s own husband Anthony Weiner is the wrecking ball that’s currently crashing through Hillary’s campaign. According to reports, Huma has voided her immunity deal with the FBI, meaning that she has two choices: start singing or face jail time. Hillary obviously doesn’t want Huma around to tarnish her campaign, and in the light of everything imploding, Huma is nowhere to be found. 2. Rats Are Jumping Ship 
Even Democrats are starting to renounce their support from Hillary. On Sunday night, prominent Democratic pollster Doug Schoen, who advised Bill Clinton and worked on Hillary’s campaign from back in 2008, announced he would be withdrawing his endorsement. Schoen went on to say on FOX news that he “fears a constitutional crisis” should Hillary be elected into office, while still under investigation from the FBI. 3. Early Hillary Voters Are Switching To Trump 
Reports are now flooding in revealing that many early voters in key swing battleground states such as Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania are now switching their votes to Trump. The search on Google “change early vote” is now beginning to trend. According to one alarming poll, 24% of the 18,029 people polled said they would be ditching Hillary in the light of recent events. 4. WikiLeaks Promises Leak This Week That Will Put Hillary In Jail 
Hillary’s incredibly been able to downplay the majority of WikiLeaks’ influx of incriminating email dumps over the past few weeks. Now, WikiLeaks is promising the long-awaited “October Surprise” that will hit sometime this week, along with the assertion that what’s in these emails will land Hillary in jail. 5. Trump Is Slaughtering Hillary In Florida 
It’s absolutely imperative that Trump wins in Florida if he’s to secure the number of electoral votes necessary to defeat Hillary. While Hillary and the Democrats flaunted their early lead in that state several weeks ago, Trump is now up by a whopping 4 points. His lead skyrocketed after the FBI’s announcement of their reinvestigation into Hillary’s private server. 6. Hillary’s Hitting The Bars 
What better way to drown out the reality that you’re losing then slamming back a few whiskey sours? During a campaign stop in Florida where only an embarrassing handful of people turned out to see Hillary, she hit up a Florida bar in the middle of the day where she was seen knocking back liquor-heavy drinks. 7. Hillary Loses 11 Points In ONE WEEK 
Liberals love their polls, but even with their heavily-biased fake numbers that previously had Hillary in the “lead,” even they cannot keep up the lie anymore. In a catastrophic new poll from Washington Post/ABC, Hillary has dropped an astounding 11 points in ONE WEEK! Oh, the horror! 8. Voters Are Screaming “LOCK HER UP!” 
Before hitting up the bar in Florida, Hillary was greeted by angry voters who began chanting “lock her up!” True to form, Hillary just ignored the group of angry Americans, while plastering on the biggest fakest toothiest smile she could muster. 
It’s so wonderful when karma finally comes calling. Unfortunately for Hillary, it looks like her dose of karma is deciding to hit with just a little over a week before the presidential election. Oh, how sweet it is! Follow Us On Social Media Search",0

19631,October Surprise: ABC Uncovers “Millions” of Payments From Russia To Trump,"Comments 
Republican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, the dictator of the Russian Federation. He’s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he’s being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord. 
Throughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. “For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia” he tweeted in July. Now – brace yourself, this might come as a shock – it appears he’s been lying to us the whole time. 
An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has “numerous ties” to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. “The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars — what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate—[and] be associated with Donald Trump” says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group. 
Trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to “large numbers” of Russian buyers – so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as “Little Moscow.” 
The oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion . 
The oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense – they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth. 
“I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption…They don’t read books. They don’t go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht” says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev , who went on to describe them as “cultural ignoramuses…not interested in social justice.” Sound like anyone we know? 
When the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscow’s annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves – and Trump himself. “We’ll be looking at that, yeah we’ll be looking” said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July. 
These business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, it’s that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House.

19632,CodeSOD: The Wisdom of the Ancients,"  
As Halloween descends upon us, mysterious emails start reaching our inbox. These plaintive missives are but the screams of the damned, encoded and sent over SMTP. 
For example, someone known to us only as DBA Guy sent an email with this subject: “Silver bullet SQL scalar function built by the Ancient Ones”. 
These ancient ones obviously did not come from the Euclidian plane we know so well, but obviously from a twisted, higher dimensional space where there exist no right angles. 
The code itself, is simple: /* Name fnValueChanged Purpose: Returns a value based on the parameters passed in which will tell the user whether or not 2 values have changed Usage Select dbo.fnValueChanged(Parameter1,Parameter2,Parameter3,ParameterN...) Returns tinyint */ ALTER FUNCTION [dbo].[fnValueHasChanged] ( @pOldValue varchar(255), @pNewValue varchar(255), @pItemType varchar(40) -- to be used if we need to do date comparisions etc. ) RETURNS int AS Begin Declare @vHasChanged tinyint set @vHasChanged = ( Case When IsNull(@pNewValue, '') <> IsNull(@pOldValue, '') and @pNewValue Is Not Null Then 1 Else 0 End ) RETURN ( @vHasChanged ) End 
Given an old value and a new value, determine if they’re different. It’s awkward and strange, with dead parameters coming to us from across the aeons, and an awkward Case statement when an If would probably be clearer and easier to understand. But how, praytell, is this code used ? CarPassword = ( Case When dbo.fnValueHasChanged(@LocPasswordOld, @LocPassword, NULL) = 1 then @LocPassword Else @LocPasswordOld End ) 
The code which calls the function must be the same as the code within the function. Thus, we have a case within a case, a mystery within a mystery, and a function which has ben handed down to us from the ancient ones.

19635,"14 Days to Do 14 Things, If You Want to Survive the Fallout of Hillary’s New Indictment or Election Defeat","

 
UPDATE: HILLARY CLINTON IS AGAIN UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE FBI. IF SHE IS INDICTED, HER PEOPLE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY LAUNCH A CYBER ATTACK ON THE ELECTIONS AND BLAME THE RUSSIANS. HILLARY HAS TIPPED HER HAND MANY TIMES. IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU MUST HASTEN YOUR PREPARATIONS. IF HILLARY SKATES, AGAIN, WE STILL ONLY HAVE A SHORT WINDOW TO ALL HELL BREAKING LOOSE. PLEASE PREPARE NOW! 
The Common Sense Show issued an alert yesterday with regard to the likelihood of widespread violence, regardless of who wins the election. The violence may not be dramatic on November, but I believe that a crescendo will be reached by the holidays. There are literally dozens of troop movements and a number of martial law events taking place as I write these words. The bottom line is, half of the country hates the other half of the country and pressure valve is ready to blow. And if Trump wins, the violence factor will escalate exponentially as evidenced by the firebombed GOP building in North Carolina.
When these events come to fruition, it could potentially paralyze this nation and bring the economy to a standstill. Subsequently, the grocery store shelves could be empty within two days and food riots would likely commence by sundown of the second day. All Americans would instantly be in danger. Local law enforcement would be overwhelmed. What would be your chances of survival? Yesterday, I wrote about the fact that FEMA has conducted research studies on America’s level of preparedness and the news is not good. FEMA concluded that 72% of all Americans are not prepared to survive what is coming In other words, when society begins to fragment, you and your fellow preppers are outnumbered by a 3 to 1 margin.
Are you prepared for 3 out of 4 of your neighbors climbing through your windows in search of life-saving supplies?
The FEMA Preparedness Reports In response to concerns about strengthening the nation’s ability to protect its population and way of life (i.e., security) and ability to adapt and recover from emergencies (i.e., resilience), the President of the United States issued Presidential Policy Directive 8: National Preparedness (PPD-8).
PPD-8 is a directive for the Department of Homeland Security to coordinate a comprehensive campaign to encourage Americans to practice national preparedness. Despite efforts by FEMA and other organizations to educate American citizens on becoming prepared, growth in specific preparedness behaviors has been limited. Government programs to this end are nearly nonexistent.
I have spent the past week illustrating how a coming economic collapse is unavoidable and how the elite have conspired to steal as many of your assets as possible prior to the collapse. This article presents some common sense things one can do which could increase the chances of surviving a major societal meltdown resulting from an economic collapse. If you have any doubts as to what is coming, I strongly encourage you to read what I have written about on this topic over the past several months. Even Ray Charles could see that our economy will not be around much longer in its present form.
It is always best to prepare for the worst and hope for the best. For the purposes of this article, it is possible that society will not totally collapse even if the dollar does. However, large segments of societies always collapse when an economic collapse happens. Surviving the worst case scenario is the purpose behind what will be covered here.
We have about 14 days to do the following 14 things: 1. The Creation of a Pseudo-Identity It may be necessary to become invisible in the event you think you believe that your name could be on a (Red) list because roundups will usually occur in dire situations. Therefore, the creation of a pseudo-identity could become very important.
2. It Takes Money to Prepare If you have read the articles at the above links, you should have concluded that it is the height of stupidity to leave your life savings in an institution that is planning to steal from you. You need to divert your cash, other than the ability to pay basic bills, in preparation for what is coming.
Getting your money out of the bank has become an art form and you need to be careful. There is a barrier to your ability to procure some of these life-saving and life-extending supplies. Right now, you do not have full access to your money.
As you move to withdraw the bulk of your money, there are three federal banking laws that you should be cognizant of, namely, Cash Transaction Report (CTR), a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) and structuring.
Cash Transaction Reports Federal law requires that the bank file a report based upon any withdrawal or deposit of $10,000 or more on any single given day.The law was designed to put a damper on money laundering, sophisticated counterfeiting and other federal crimes.
To remain in compliance with the law, financial institutions must obtain personal identification, information about the transaction and the social security number of the person conducting the transaction.
Before proceeding with the planned withdrawal of your money, I would strongly suggest that you read the following federal guidelines as it relates to CTR’s as produced by the The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). All the federal regulations contained in this article are elucidated in this series of federal reports.
Structuring and SAR There will undoubtedly be some geniuses whose math ability will tell them that all they have to do is to withdraw $9,999.99 and the bank and its protector, the federal government will be none the wiser. It is not quite that simple. The bank is required to file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) which serves to notify the federal government of an individual’s attempt to structure deposits or withdrawals by circumventing the $10,000 reporting requirement.
Structuring transactions to prevent a CTR from being reported can result in imprisonment for not more than five years and/or a fine of up to $250,000. If structuring involves more than $100,000 in a twelve month period or is performed while violating another law of the federal government, the penalty is doubled. 
Enforcement Much like the enforcement of our tax laws, the federal government’s enforcement of its banking laws as it relates to CTR’s, SAR’s and subsequent structuring is quite draconian. Civilian asset forfeiture laws come into play. The government can seize your bank accounts while it determines if a crime has been committed. The government can literally seize your assets in perpetuity without an order of the court. Of course, you could try and sue but you will be up against the deep pockets of the federal government and the case could take years. By the time your case is decided, the financial banking crisis that you are so desperately trying to avoid by withdrawing your money, could be over. So, proceed with caution.
Withdrawing Your Money From the Bank The best way to avoid getting your money caught in the bank in the midst of a bank run would be to not let the lion’s share of your money ever cross the bank. The simplest way to accomplish this is to prevent any form of deposit from going automatically into your account, as much as it is possible.
Secondly, you need to begin to pay cash for everything. Let’s say that every 30 days, Bob cashes his check at the bank from his work worth $5,000 net pay. Bob leaves just enough in the bank to be able to conduct normal banking business. Bob walks out of the bank every month with the majority of the cash from his check. Bob should begin to pay cash for as much as he can, such as eating out, paying the electric bill (pay the bill in person), buying groceries, etc. When it becomes necessary to make a “big ticket” purchase, Bob could temporarily leave more in the bank to cover the writing of a check.
You would also be wise to open multiple banking accounts ranging from the big five megabanks to your local credit unions. You could withdraw much smaller amounts until the sum total of your accounts is greatly diminished and is in your possession. To open the accounts, simply write a personal check from your home bank. Of course, in these cases, the bank could hold the check for 15-30 days.
I cannot promise you that if you become the target of federal investigators, that you will not have your every financial move scrutinized and the feds will eventually discover the aggregate patterns of withdrawal. People who I interviewed told me that they believe that the federal government is in the process of getting the banking computers to “talk” to each other in a way that would reveal structuring, but that technology is not yet online.
If you ever become the target of a federal investigation, do not, under any circumstances, allow yourself to be interviewed by federal officials without an attorney present. In many cases, people go to jail and pay huge fines, not because they have committed a federal crime, but because federal officials state that they have lied or misled them. And if you do not have an attorney present, it is your word versus the federal government. There are other sources besides banks that you can tap into for money which can be used to prepare for what is coming.
4o1K’s, IRA, et al If you were 100% convinced of an imminent crash, you would be foolish not to take your money out. However, the prepayment penalty of 50% is steep if you withdraw your funds before you are 59.5 years old.
If you are retiring soon, take the lump sum option and convert all of these retirement monies to survival supplies and gold which you will need as the world emerges from the crash.
The moral of the story is to become as liquid as possible, from a cash perspective. Getting access to your money is only the first part of being prepared to survive an economic crash.
3. Make a List Buy a good prepper book. Holly Deyo is an excellent source for this information (www.standdeyo.com). In the interim, procure your food, water, guns, ammo and home security adjustments. If you do not have a big dog, consider obtaining a pair. These animals will be your companion, home security system and ally if someone attempts to breach your home with bad intent. Of course, you will have to store dog food as well.
Sit down and construct a list of what you will need after reading a good prepper book.
Make all of you purchases in cash! You do not want to let the wrong people know what you are up to.
 
4. Rural Vs. Urban We have to live our lives for today and it may not be possible to move to a rural area because of your job. However, one survivalist that I was speaking with estimates that the rate of survival for a country in economic chaos would be 10 times higher for rural residents as opposed to urban residents. Consider buying a place in an isolated area and commuting to work in the interim.
5. Pay Off Your Mortgage and Car Loans If you have a CD, a 401k or any other long-term investment, you might want to consider taking the penalty and executing a withdrawal and apply what’s left of the principal, usually about 50% of the original value, and paying down your major debts.
After an economic collapse, you most likely will not have a job and your retirement and savings will likely be wiped out and confiscated. That is why it would be wise to pay down your debt while you can afford to do so because after the collapse, there will still be foreclosures and repossessions and if you and your family survive, you could be on the street if you cannot pay your bills.
 
6. Buy Gold and Silver While You Can Afford It Goldman Sachs has been shorting gold. The elite have been hording gold as have the BRICS. These entities are telling you, by action, what medium of exchange is going to be of value following the collapse that is coming.
Storing gold and silver is an economic survival strategy which will pay dividends after the smoke begins to clear in the post-collapse era.

 
7. Practice Austerity Before Austerity Is Imposed On You It is critical to immediately eliminate all unnecessary expenses. Give yourself some operating capital. You may be able to purchase a bug-out residence in a rural area. You will certainly be able to afford more survival gear.
In order to increase your immediate cash flow, start an at-home business. Start a business which has virtually no upfront and startup costs. Even if you are not able to generate much income, you will create a legal tax evasion strategy in which you can legally deduct many of your present activities and expenses (e.g. mileage, the purchase of any office supply, etc.) including survival gear.
 
8. Create and Store Your Own Food With regard to storing food, you need to do so immediately. I recommend storing two years worth of food. However, you need to master the art of growing food inside your home. There are plenty of resources which can teach you how to do that. However, you would be wise if you would create a hiding place in which you can store food and water safely in a hidden location . If you are ever robbed, you will not have exhausted your food supplies. You are most likely to be robbed by FEMA or one of their mercenary groups (e.g. Academia) during the beginning of the crisis because food and water will be used as weapons to control you. I am personally aware of FEMA going to selected homeowners to catalogue their reserve food and water supplies. Remember, water is sunlight and temperature sensitive. There are plenty of prepper manuals that you can consult for instructions on how to meet these needs. The time to do these things is yesterday.
The biggest threat to survival is death due to dehydration and starving to death. Contaminated water will also pose a threat. There are plenty of places to purchase large drums and obtain water tablets for water purification purposes. Obtain a pair of water filters in case you have to go mobile to survive.
Finally, learn to grow your own food within your residence. Your garden will likely be raided by humans and hungry animals alike. There are plenty of prepper manuals which can teach you how to accomplish this task.
9. Personal Supplies Of course you will need toothpaste, toiletries, eating utensils, feminine hygiene supplies, etc. For a complete list of personal items see Steve Quayles list on his website .
 
10. Horde Medicines and Medical Supplies If you or your family has a chronic health condition, it is critical that you have 6 months to a year in medicine. Also, you should research natural alternatives to treatment for health conditions in case you are not able to meet this goal due to the inability to obtain prescriptions. Don’t forget to obtain some pain medication and antibiotics in case of unforeseen emergencies. Make a trip to Mexico and sneak across medication in old pill bottles in order to escape detection by the Border Patrol who will ask you if you obtained medication in Mexico when you come back across the border.
If you can safely ration your existing medication doses, do so and store the excesses. Make sure you also have a first aid kit. Take a First Aid class including CPR at your local fire station.
Some are thinking that this is a lot of work. My response would be, how bad do you want you and your family to survive?
11. Guns and Ammunition Regardless of your moral convictions, ask yourself if you want your family to survive.
Buy your guns off the books from private parties and at gun shows. “Keep guns for show and guns for go”. In other words, have a safe location that you can bury guns so that when gun confiscation begins, you will not be left totally defenseless.
America needs to not only create safe and secure homes, but to create as many Warsaw ghettos as possible (look it up). We need to make ourselves a hard country to conquer and occupy. We cannot stop a treasonous leader from handing off the country to some foreign entity (e.g. the UN). However, occupation of America should be problematic for the blue-helmet wearing Russians, Chinese and other proxy forces training on our soil to occupy us.
It is recommended that you have 3 types of weapons: (1) pistols for close in fighting; (2) shotguns for defense of the entrance to your home; and, (3) a rifle with a scope in order to fight back against long-range snipers that do not want to storm your home because you appear to be prepared. Immediately, obtain weapons instruction for you and your family, firearms training and then practice! Conduct mock raids on your residence so that you can see your vulnerabilities. An armed populace makes a people more feared by an abusive government.
Do not forget about gas masks for each member of your family and make sure to store extras. If you have the means to obtain body armor, do so now, because Congress is preparing to outlaw the private use of body armor.
 
12. Prepare to Survive in the Raw Elements and Build a Way of Life 
It is possible that you can learn to survive in the raw elements without heating and central air conditioning. You may not have lights. Obtain flashlights, many batteries and a hand crank radio.
Make sure you have clothes befitting all weather that you may encounter because a crisis that begins in January, may not be over by August.
Take a weekend and pretend the grid is down. This will allow you to see firsthand what supplies you will need. When should you perform this drill? There is no time like the present.
To people with generators, congratulations on your foresight. However, if you are the only house on the block with lights, how long do you think it will be until you have unwanted visitors with bad intent?
Get in shape, begin to walk, jog or run. The better shape you are in, the better.
Don’t forget about procuring non-electronic forms of entertainment. This should include board games and educational materials for your children. You will want to establish some normalcy for the sake of your children. You are preparing to adopt a new way of life. Make the new life worth living.
I would also recommend that every personal library contain The Constitution of the United States. After the chaos subsides, we will need to rebuild. You will not want to live in a “might makes right” society.
13. For Goodness Sake, Do Not Tell Anyone If your four adjacent neighbors broach the topic of preparedness, gauge the situation and then make an informed decision. If your neighbors are on board with preparing, that will help you form a defensive perimeter and a mutual alliance pact. Otherwise, tell nobody of your preparation plans. Do not tell your friends, family members, and co-workers. Make your preparations in cash or cashier’s checks as much as possible. Limit the paper trail to you. You do not want the government to know that you are prepared because you could be the first one on your block that is visited at 3AM. You and your mate should prepare in stealth. Kids talk and so do their friends.
14. PRAY! Survival is never guaranteed, salvation is! And do not forget one of your most important resources, your Bible. In a post-collapse America, it is likely that a religion will be forced upon the survivors and that religion will not be Christianity.
Conclusion In an upside-down world in which the banks legally own your money, getting your money away from these criminal banks has become an art form. I cannot promise you that you will be able to retrieve all of your assets. However, I can promise you that if you do not act, you will lose everything and you will lack needed supplies to weather what is coming.
I would strongly suggest that you keep your gas tank filled and you have plenty of cash, food and ammunition on hand. It is better to be safe than sorry.

19637,Bombs Ready: The American Blob Is Already Oozing Into Syria - Ryan Cooper,"Politics Bombs Ready: The American Blob Is Already Oozing Into Syria 
The US foreign policy establishment is laying the groundwork for Hillary to send the US military against the Syrian state Originally appeared at The Week 
Syria is in absolute ruins. The ongoing civil war, a disorganized melee involving the Assad regime, various rebel groups, Russia, Iran, ISIS and other Islamists, Turkey, Kurdish forces, and the U.S., has been stuck in stalemate for month after month. Much of the country is in a state of utter collapse, hundreds of thousands have died, and refugees continue to pour into neighboring states and Europe. 
With the election of a militarist-inclined Hillary Clinton looking all but certain, the Blob — White House aide Ben Rhodes' apt name for the permanent D.C. foreign policy establishment — is quickly coalescing around a new consensus that existing U.S. intervention should be dramatically scaled up, as Eric Levitz writes . The central policy for this effort is a no-fly zone to be enforced by American air power . 
This is a seriously risky policy that stands little chance of meaningfully ameliorating the humanitarian disaster in Syria. But there's virtually nothing at this point that can be done to stop it. 
This long background article in Spiegel Online provides a great overview of the dizzying complexity of this conflict, and good context for the debate over escalation. At the risk of stating the obvious, the central factor in the endlessness of the war is that nobody has been able to win. This in turn is the result of a rough parity of support from outside powers, particularly Russia and the U.S. Along with Iran, the former regards Assad as a crucial regional ally and source of an important Russian naval base; without their support the Assad regime would have collapsed years ago. 
America's main concern, meanwhile, is fighting ISIS, done directly with U.S. forces and through Kurdish proxies, who have carved out a semi-autonomous Kurdish zone in northern Syria connected to Iraqi Kurdistan. 
This infuriates Turkey's ( increasingly unhinged ) President Erdogan, due to the longstanding feud between the Turkish government and Kurdish organizations in the south of that country. The Turkish military recently hit Kurdish forces outside Aleppo with airstrikes , killing dozens — right as the Iraqi military and Kurdish troops were in the middle of a long-planned effort to oust ISIS forces from Mosul . This almost can't be a coincidence, and no doubt infuriated U.S. commanders. 
Awkwardly, Assad's forces are also fighting ISIS, and responded to the Turkish bombardment with a threat to shoot down any more Turkish planes that violated Syrian airspace. 
In sum, this is a tremendously complicated conflict, with multiple shifting factions. The U.S. goals — defeat ISIS and remove Assad without helping radical Islamists — are directly at odds with each other. 
Let's grant for the sake of argument that the Blob is actually motivated by a desire to stop the bloodshed in Syria. (If they were, it would pressure the Saudi government to stop their disastrous war in Yemen instead of refueling their bombers, but that's a different story.) Here, their argument that hesitation on the part of President Obama has prolonged the conflict does have a grain of truth to it. If one great power or another had jumped in with overwhelming military force and steamrolled the opposition (or simply withdrawn from the conflict), the civil war could have ended years ago. 
The problem, of course, is what comes after that. Sufficient force to end the war would have meant either an invasion or occupation, which was a disastrous bloody failure in Iraq, or a heavy air power intervention only, which was a disastrous bloody failure in Libya. If there's anything the last 15 years of foreign policy history has shown, it is that the American military is extremely good at smashing organized military forces, and it is extremely bad at establishing any sort of lasting political order in the aftermath. 
And more fundamentally, if hesitation is really the problem, then a no-fly zone has the exact same problem as Obama's current policy. It's an escalation that is far short of the overwhelming force that would be necessary to impose peace on Syria. Why? Probably because the American public shows no sign of supporting the kind of force (read: a massive ground invasion) that would be necessary to impose peace on Syria. 
What a no-fly zone would do, however, is risk immediate conflict with Russia, which has been assisting Assad with lots of air power. It's disturbingly easy to imagine getting into a shooting war with the world's only other nuclear superpower over this. 
The general public apathy towards low-key military interventions gives the American president huge latitude to bomb and deploy special forces basically anywhere in the world — which is often devastating to the targeted communities . But the moment that creates large numbers of U.S. casualties, a political backlash is certain. Hillary Clinton, whose 2008 presidential campaign was lost because she supported the invasion of Iraq, probably realizes this, however grudgingly. 
Ultimately, the Blob does not really care about carnage in Syria. Its overwhelming priority is the use of military force, which it views as good by definition. The civil war there is just a convenient pretext. Non-military means to stop violence will be downplayed or ignored — just like the last several consecutive failures of military intervention were, and the probable upcoming failure of the Syrian intervention will be.

19638,Kellyanne Conway: General Flynn Enjoys the ’Full Confidence of the President’ - Breitbart,"Monday in an interview with MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki, Kellyanne Conway, an aide to President Donald Trump, downplayed the controversy surrounding national security adviser Michael Flynn having allegedly discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak before Trump’s inauguration.  Conway told Kornacki Flynn continues to “enjoy the full confidence of the president” despite those allegations. “Yes, General Flynn does enjoy the full confidence of the president,” Conway said. “And it is a big week for General Flynn. He’s the point of contact for many of these foreign visits. If you look at the schedule, we had the prime minister of Canada Justin Trudeau here. Obviously for bilateral meetings. On Wednesday, we’re welcoming Benjamin Netanyahu here. Behind the scenes, where they’re talking about trade, they’re talking about terrorism, security, the fact that Canada and the U. S. are very important, neighbors to each other and will continue to be. And obviously, the national security advisor is a very important point person in those discussions. General Flynn has said he can’t recall. And that he had about 30 phone calls with, I guess leaders at the time. And since then, 70 I’m told, with different leaders, and I’ll just leave his comments at that. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",0

19640,"In Covering Civil Rights, Reporter Enhanced His Words With Film - The New York Times","Every Sunday in February, we will feature and explore previously unpublished photographs from The New York Times’s archives, with a special focus on the 1960s. Revisit last year’s Unpublished Black History project, sign up for our   newsletter and share your own experiences with black history in the comments. The   bullet tore through a civil rights worker’s shoulder, stopping within an inch of his spine. The shotgun blast shattered the car windows of four voting rights activists and gouged the wall of a nearby home. And a fire destroyed voter registration equipment and materials outside the city’s Voter Registration Headquarters, leaving the street strewn with rubble. It was 1963 in Greenwood, Miss. a major battleground in the fight for civil rights, and white officials were playing down and ignoring a series of attacks intended to discourage thousands of   from registering to vote. Claude Sitton, the renowned New York Times correspondent, shot photos and took meticulous notes, exposing the racial violence with his pen and with his lens. Mr. Sitton is best known for his words. But the typewritten letters that he sent, along with his film, to John Dugan, a Times photo editor, reveal that he was also determined to capture history with his camera. He carried a Leica, according to one of his sons, and wrote about light and shadows and underexposed frames. He lamented the gloom inside a crowded black church and the time constraints he faced as he scrambled to report the news and illustrate it at the same time. “I didn’t have very much time,” Mr. Sitton wrote apologetically, “and will try to give you a better selection the next time I offer something. ” Yet there is power in Mr. Sitton’s   letters and in the    images he captured on   film in March of 1963. Shown together here for the first time  —   as part of a weekly series running throughout the month  —   they offer a firsthand glimpse of life on the front lines of the civil rights movement. In one frame, Robert P. Moses, the field secretary of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, clipboard in hand, pointed to the holes left by the shotgun blast in the wall of a weathered home. In another, the charred detritus of the fire  —   set by a person or persons unknown  —   littered the street outside the old voting headquarters. Medgar Evers, the state field secretary of the N. A. A. C. P. addressed a packed voter registration rally at the local African Methodist Episcopal church in what may well be the only photograph taken of Evers by The Times. In another series of images, black women took their seats in a citizenship training school intended to train volunteers to help register black voters, and another woman stacked cans of food in the Sunday school room of a local church. The food was collected in Chicago for hungry black farm workers in Greenwood, who had been denied federal food assistance by white county officials in retaliation for their voter registration efforts.   accounted for 61 percent of the county’s population. Yet only 1. 9 percent of blacks of voting age were registered, compared with 95. 5 percent of whites. The Justice Department, contending that whites were disenfranchising blacks with discriminatory voting laws, filed suit. Justice Department officials also sought a federal court order to prevent the city and county from denying blacks the right to protest, after the police unleashed a German shepherd dog on peaceful marchers and jailed voting rights activists. It was the first time that federal officials had taken such a step, Mr. Sitton noted in his article about Greenwood, which was published in April of 1963. (Only three of the many photographs that he took during his time in Greenwood were published with this article.) But with every step forward, it seemed, there were several steps back. Two months later, on June 12, 1963, an assassin killed Evers in Jackson, Miss. That afternoon, hundreds of   took to the streets in protest. And Mr. Sitton was there with his pen, his notebook and his camera.",0

To receive it in your inbox, register here. Good morning. The bunting’s up, the beer cold in the fridge. There’s a lamb shoulder collapsing under the smoke of fruitwood out in the yard, and Julia Moskin’s salty pluff mud pie rests comfortably on the windowsill to cool. Independence Day is tomorrow, and friends will arrive to consume burgers and brats, ribs and potato salad, coleslaw, iced tea, prosecco, more. But today is for family. Today is for us. See if you can’t make it that way as well. Many of us here in the world of Cooking identify as hosts. The word has two definitions. The first is familiar: a person who receives or entertains guests. The second comes from biology and is a little grim: an animal in which a parasite or commensal animal lives. On holiday weekends, the former can sometimes feel like the latter. The best way to stay sane is to carve out a meal or two over the course of the weekend for the nuclear unit of family, even if the nuclear unit is one. So maybe make lamb sandwiches and that delicious pie. Or cook a simple omelet, according to the instructions of Jacques Pépin. You might try Julia’s recipe for a cucumber salad with yogurt, dill, sour cherries and, if you can find any, rose petals. Or you could make pad Thai and watch television. Make gazpacho and listen to Alejandro Escovedo and Ryan Adams sing “Castanets. ” Make Sunday a family day, and the coming holiday party will be all the more sweet. On Monday, you can go big with the cooking festivities. Eat leftovers on Tuesday night, with a big pot of rice and beans. For the Wednesday night meal, how about the recipe for flattened chicken thighs with roasted lemon slices that Julia brought to us last week, part of her awesome report on the state of the   pan? If you’ve got two of the things, you could also make her recipe for crisp toffee bars, an adaptation of Charlotte Druckman’s adaptation of a Maida Heatter recipe. It’s incredibly good. Thursday night, we could go for some salmon. Maybe my recipe for fillets roasted with brown sugar and mustard? Or David Tanis’s recipe for salmon with green sauce? Have you made Melissa Clark’s recipe for baked potatoes topped with salmon roe and crème fraîche yet? You really ought to, before the world grows too hot to bake. And then on Friday night, you can put on your host face again, and assemble a taco bar for everyone who wants to join. A simple search for “tacos” on our site yields many, many good ideas for such a dinner. I’m thinking fish tacos, myself. You may prefer them with black beans and chard. Just browse the site and apps, and save the recipes you’re interested in cooking to your recipe box. (Here’s mine, if you want an example of how big they can get.) Rate their success on a scale of one to five stars. Leave a note on a recipe if you have one to add to the conversation. By all means, share them with friends and family via email and the wonders of social media. And don’t forget: If you run into problems along the way, we’ll be standing by to help (cookingcare@nytimes. com). Now, have you read Lorrie Moore on Helen Gurley Brown in The New York Review of Books? Or considered what the Houston Texans defensive end J. J. Watt eats each day, according to GQ?

19643,"With ‘Star,’ Lee Daniels Tries to Expand an Empire - The New York Times","DOUGLASVILLE, Ga.  —   “Caliente!” the director Lee Daniels howled toward Naomi Campbell, across the waiting room of a decommissioned county jail. “Wonderful, Naomi, wonderful  —   I love it!” After another take, Mr. Daniels crooned, “Cruella de Vil, Cruella de Vil,” gleefully comparing the   ’s haughty, villainous performance to the infamous “101 Dalmatians” character. As both boss and head cheerleader, he was in his element. Mr. Daniels, though not officially directing that day in   was overseeing the filming of his new Fox series, “Star,” about a girl group clawing its way through Atlanta’s booming music universe. Ms. Campbell’s scene, a showdown between two disparate matriarchs over the fate of a young woman caught between worlds  —   after an episode of police brutality  —   had him charged up. “It’s all fabulous,” Mr. Daniels said. “The physical altercation”  —   between Ms. Campbell’s character and one played by Queen Latifah  —   “is even better than I thought it was going to be. You see two different classes of black women, and yet the rich one pushes the poor one. So much privilege!” It’s exactly that blend of     social consciousness and histrionic soap opera that has driven Mr. Daniels’s triumphs in film (“Precious,” “The Butler”) and television, where he scored big for Fox with the Shakespearean   melodrama “Empire,” beginning in 2015. But while “Empire,” now in its third season, relies on bombast and opulence, with a plot twist every few scenes  —   “Dynasty” and “Dallas” by way of peak Puff Daddy and Bad Boy Records  —   “Star” finds its creator returning to his earlier, grimier palette, including foster homes and addiction, for a slightly more earthbound tale. Still, the new show, part of Mr. Daniels’s  “Empire” production deal with Fox, will be expected to deliver in prime time the way its predecessor did. Its premiere in December, following the “Empire” midseason finale, drew strong   viewership  —   especially considering its leading trio of unknown actresses  —   but starting with its second episode on Wednesday, Jan. 4, “Star” will be going it alone. (Adding pressure, “Empire,” once a ratings juggernaut, has seen its impact wane recently, hitting viewership lows, though it remains the network’s   cornerstone.) “I’m doomed,” Mr. Daniels, uncensored and casual in luxurious black sweats, said playfully a few weeks before his set visit, during an interview at his Midtown Manhattan apartment. “Hollywood builds you up to take you down  —   I’ve learned that from many friends. ” Yet instead of returning victoriously to movies, particularly a   Richard Pryor biopic, Mr. Daniels was persuaded to double down on another network show about the music business, despite the mixed results of recent programming  —   “Vinyl,” “Atlanta,” “The Get Down”  —   set in the record industry. “My boyfriend said, ‘On TV, more people will appreciate your work, even if it’s not as potent, than on any film you ever do,’” Mr. Daniels recalled. He seemed unconcerned about competition. “Which one’s ‘The Get Down’?” Mr. Daniels asked. “Do they sing in ‘Atlanta’?” “Star,” which addresses Black Lives Matter and transgender issues in the first episode, also comes at a loaded moment politically. Mr. Daniels assumed, as he was sketching the   first season, that Hillary Clinton would win the presidency. He imagined the show’s diverse girl group  —   one poor and white, one rich and black, one of mixed race  —   as an imperfect yet inspiring portrait of racial unity and healing. “I was going to hit you with stings of ‘this is what’s going on in the streets,’” Mr. Daniels said. Now, instead of ratcheting up the politics under the coming administration of President Donald J. Trump, “It’s really going to be more of a place of escape. ” He cited 1960s sitcoms like “Bewitched” and “I Dream of Jeannie” as mass entertainment necessary in uncertain times. Even if he hopes to avoid positioning “Star” as a protest show, though, it still has progressive, confrontational themes at its core  —   albeit expressed through Mr. Daniels’s idiosyncratic lens. In casting Star, the title character, amid a period of racial tumult stemming from police shootings, Mr. Daniels said, “I wanted to show a white girl that had some swag” as “part of the healing process. ” He added: “I wanted white people to feel cool. I wanted them to not be made fun of. We are one. ” He found his girl in Jude Demorest, a     performer from Detroit, with a pile of   ringlets and earrings the size of her face. The character, as written, “had all but her Social Security number,” Mr. Daniels said. Ms. Demorest agreed: “It was the first role where I never had to fake an accent or not wear my hoops to the audition or straighten my hair. ” (The show nods at racial dynamics in the industry, with one character joking, “a white girl who can sing RB  —   even the mediocre ones go platinum. ”) On the other hand, Mr. Daniels said he created Derek, the show’s young Black Lives Matter activist played by Quincy Brown, as a message to his son, who had recently left what Mr. Daniels called his Upper West Side “bubble” and began experiencing   racism. “Star,” despite its modern   milieu, with original songs by a team including the longtime producer Rodney Jerkins that recall Rihanna and Fergie, is filled with other personal flourishes for Mr. Daniels, who said the show’s essence was inspired by his time trying to break into Hollywood: “What happens when you’re young and naïve, and you’ll do anything to get to where you want to go?” Queen Latifah, who plays Carlotta, a beautician and den mother to the singers, said: “So many parts of this take me back. I’ve come full circle after starting as a hungry   wanting to get a deal and change the economic circumstances of my family. ” She also recalled seeing striving’s ugly side  —   “how hungry people can be, selling their soul to have that success. ” The idea of using desperate, wily young women to tell a version of that story grew out of Mr. Daniels’s childhood love of “Dreamgirls,” which he said taught him that “we’re from the ’hood and we can still be fabulous. ” Other influences included “Valley of the Dolls” and “Paris Is Burning,” both of which Mr. Daniels had considered remaking Ms. Demorest also said that he told her to watch “Sweet Charity” and “Female Trouble” during the audition process. As for making them a modern pop trio  —   Ryan Destiny plays Alexandra, who has determined to make it in music without the help of her internationally famous   father (Lenny Kravitz) and Brittany O’Grady plays Simone, Star’s shy, damaged half sister  —   Mr. Daniels said he liked that there wasn’t a notable girl group at the moment, though he later learned of the existence of Fifth Harmony. (Ms. Demorest, coincidentally, was a writer on that group’s biggest hit, “Work From Home. ”) “They only last for a few years  —   because they implode,” Mr. Daniels said, with delight, of girl groups. “That’s just the nature of the beast. ” (In fact, Fifth Harmony would lose a member to a solo career not long after “Star” had its premiere.) Careful attention to group chemistry led Mr. Daniels and Fox to audition Ms. Demorest, Ms. Destiny and Ms. O’Grady about a dozen times, mostly as a unit, before choosing them for the roles. Despite Mr. Daniels’s   approach at every opportunity  —   he will direct the “Star” season finale in addition to its first two episodes  —   learning to relinquish some authority has been a sometimes rocky process in his shift to TV. “It’s not like a movie where you can control it from A to Z,” he said. “There’s a director who has an interpretation of your interpretation, and you haven’t personally written all of the episodes. ” He created “Star” with Tom Donaghy (“The Mentalist”) not his “Empire”   Danny Strong, who also wrote “The Butler. ” “I don’t think Danny would understand this world,” Mr. Daniels said. “This would not have been the right partnership for us, because of the specifics  —   it’s an underbelly. ” Early episodes touch on sexual abuse, human trafficking and an assault of a transgender woman outside a strip club. Gary Newman, the chairman and chief executive of Fox Television Group, credited Mr. Daniels’s work for the authenticity of “Star. ” “It’s hard, but we want to be a   network,” he said. “We want all people to feel they’re welcome. ” Mr. Daniels’s broad demographic appeal is also “good business,” Mr. Newman said. “Prior to ‘Empire,’ I think there was an underserved audience. ” At the same time, despite his role in diversifying TV, Mr. Daniels can be sent into a fit of frustration at a mention of last year’s #OscarsSoWhite controversy over representation at the Academy Awards. (He was nominated for best director for “Precious” in 2010.) “Go out and do the work,” he fumed over oatmeal at his apartment. “Oscars so white! So what? Do your work. Let your legacy speak and stop complaining, man. Are we really in this for the awards? “If I had thought that way  —   that the world was against me  —   I wouldn’t be here now,” he added. “These whiny people that think we’re owed something are incomprehensible and reprehensible to me. I don’t expect acknowledgment or acceptance from white America. I’m going to be me. ”",0

19646,How Marches in Washington Have Shaped America - The New York Times,"“One of the great weapons of a democracy. ” This was how Harry Belafonte, the performer and civil rights activist, referred to the street march in a recent interview. Mr. Belafonte played a critical role in organizing the 1963 March on Washington, which helped spur the passage of two major civil rights bills. He is also a   of the women’s march set for Saturday. When thousands of women converge on Washington this weekend, they will join a long tradition of rallies in the capital. From the suffrage processions of the early 20th century to the Tea Party rallies of 2009, marches have drawn attention to crucial issues, occasionally resulted in violence and often prompted opposing gatherings. Marian B. Mollin, an associate professor at Virginia Tech who studies the history of social movements, said successful marches had capitalized on symbolism and street theater, attracted a broad coalition and pushed clear policy goals. But the test of a march’s   efficacy, she said, is whether it energizes participants long after they’ve gone home, sustaining them through the less exciting aspects of change. This is what she’ll be watching for in the months after Saturday’s march. “Are they continuing to be fired up when they get back? Because there is a lot of unfun, unglamorous work to do,” she said. We took a look back at several marches in Washington and how they changed  —   or didn’t change  —   history. On March 3, 1913, a    named Inez Milholland slipped on her white kid boots, threw a cape around her shoulders and climbed onto a borrowed horse to help lead what was then the largest women’s march in American history. Behind her came businesswomen in blue, writers in white, artists in pink and musicians in red, all calling for their right to vote. Five thousand women marched while some onlookers hurled insults and tripped them. “If my wife were where you are,” a police officer told one woman, according to this newspaper, “I’d break her head. ”   Woodrow Wilson skipped the event, taking side streets to a hotel to avoid the crowds. By the end, more than 100 women were hospitalized. Women had fought for suffrage since at least 1848. But the 1913 march kicked off a series of political actions that swayed the public and male politicians, finally pushing them to pass the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. By 1920, American women had the right to vote. Read how The New York Times covered the march here. On July 28, 1932, Gen. Douglas MacArthur and Army troops surrounded a group of protesting veterans in Washington, wheeled tanks into position, prepared gas bombs and gave the former fighters 30 minutes to disperse. The Bonus Army gathering, in which an estimated 20, 000 World War I veterans demanded the payment of bonuses guaranteed under a 1924 law, is among the   marches in American history. The law had said payments would be made in 1945, but veterans reeling from the Depression wanted them earlier. The event lasted weeks, until President Herbert Hoover ordered the protesters’ removal. Army troops shot “a heavy barrage of tear gas” at the veterans, according to The Times. Two people died during the protest. In “The Bonus Army: An American Epic,” the authors Paul Dickson and Thomas B. Allen wrote that the march changed the nation, pushing Congress to pass the G. I. Bill, landmark legislation that allowed many veterans to go to college. Read how The Times covered the march here. The National Mall swelled with people on Aug. 28, 1963, to urge Congress to pass a historic civil rights bill. It was here that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his “I Have a Dream” speech. “As he arose, a great roar welled up from the crowd,” the journalist E. W. Kenworthy wrote in The Times. “When he started to speak, a hush fell. ” The paper reported that more than 200, 000 people had attended. At the time, civil rights legislation was tied up in Congress, facing a filibuster by Southern lawmakers. But the march helped energize everyday people like Hazel Mangle Rivers, a black woman who took the $8 overnight bus to Washington from her home in Birmingham, Ala. “When I get back there tomorrow I’m going to do whatever needs to be done,” she told a Times reporter after the protest. “I don’t care if it’s picketing or marching or   or what, I’m ready to do it. ” The gathering was followed by sustained activism  —   including a   drive in Mississippi and a march in Alabama from Selma to Montgomery  —   that helped pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The march, Mr. Belafonte said recently, showed that there was “a great swatch of American opinion that was supportive of our cause. ” Read how The Times covered the march here. On Nov. 15, 1969, antiwar activists streamed down Pennsylvania Avenue, calling for a rapid withdrawal of troops from Vietnam. Three drummers led the procession, followed by people carrying 11 coffins bearing names of the dead. Then came rows and rows of marchers, 17 abreast, shouting, “Peace now! Peace now!” A police official estimated the crowd to be at least 250, 000 strong, though others have said it was much larger. At the time, many Americans had grown impatient with President Richard Nixon’s policy of gradual withdrawal. The White House said the president had spent the day watching college football inside. It was the largest antiwar protest to date. But its success was less clear than the 1963 civil rights gathering. “In the aftermath of that march, Nixon escalates the war,” Professor Mollin said. Read how The Times covered the march here. The Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v. Wade, which affirmed a woman’s right to an abortion, spurred anger across the country, particularly among religious and conservative families. A year after Roe v. Wade, on Jan. 22, 1974, thousands gathered in Washington to urge Congress to support a constitutional amendment, known as the Buckley Amendment, which would have effectively overturned the decision. When it became clear it wouldn’t happen that year, the march’s founder, Nellie Gray, vowed to hold marches every year until it did. This year’s march, to be held on Jan. 27, will include a particularly prominent speaker: Kellyanne Conway, the   woman in the Trump administration. Read how The Times covered the march here. Andy Humm was a television reporter for the Gay Cable Network on Oct. 11, 1987, when an estimated 200, 000 people gathered in Washington to call for AIDS research and the end of discrimination against gay people. (The event followed a 1979 march, before the AIDS crisis.) By 1987, more than 20, 000 Americans had died of AIDS and an additional 36, 000 had learned they had the disease, which was deeply stigmatizing. Activists were desperate for research and care. They spread a quilt bearing names of the dead. And they wept as Mr. Humm interviewed them. “There was no hope,” he said in a recent conversation. “We were a fairly powerless movement back then. ” The march helped mobilize and personalize the movement. Three years later, Congress passed the Ryan White Care Act, the largest federally funded program for people living with H. I. V. and AIDS. (AIDS deaths continued to climb each year until 1995.) Read how The Times covered the march. Hundreds of thousands of people, most of them black men, came together on Oct. 16, 1995, for a rally organized by Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam. He called on them to “accept the responsibility” to “be good husbands and fathers and builders of our community. ” It was contentious  —   Mr. Farrakhan had been criticized previously for sexist and   remarks  —   and was attended by the poet Maya Angelou but opposed by the N. A. A. C. P. Organizers said the event spurred 1. 7 million black men to register to vote. But the march’s legacy is the subject of debate. “Some say its core message of   and atonement left black men grappling alone with issues such as violence, drug abuse and poverty, letting politicians and institutions off the hook,” a Washington Post reporter wrote. “Others argue that the earnest assembly was a potent symbol that changed perceptions of black men and inspired the marchers to make great changes in their lives. ” In 2015, Mr. Farrakhan held a second march. Much of the discussion centered on the use of force by the police and continued discrimination. Art Scott, 59, a salesman who attended, told The Times: “There comes a time, after being pushed for so long, to push back. I think that’s the feeling in the black community right now. ” Read how The New York Times covered the march.",0
19647,"Muirfield’s Mulligan, Allowing Female Members, Is a Grudging Blow to Bigotry - The New York Times","The Muirfield Golf Club took advantage of a mulligan, and, in its second vote in 10 months, straightened out enough of its wayward members to surpass the   majority needed to admit women. Tuesday’s victory was perhaps more about pragmatism than principles. Just over 80 percent of the men of the Honourable Company of Edinburgh, which runs Muirfield, determined that it is better to have to share membership privileges with the occasional woman than to be excluded from hosting a British Open. Of the 621 members who voted, 498 were in favor of admitting women. Last May, 616 members cast ballots, with fewer than 400, or 64 percent, voting for the resolution. Any inclination to warmly welcome the gentlemen of Muirfield into the 21st century is tempered by the fact that 123 members  —   even confronted with a boycott of their storied course by the Royal and Ancient, the organizer of the British Open  —   stubbornly thumbed their noses at what passes for progress in the rest of the civilized world by voting against admitting women. In their defense, the pace of change must be dizzying for those stuck in the era of   trousers, ruffled cravats and tweed jackets. For more than a century,  Muirfield had been able to welcome the world to its storied course while keeping women out, except as guests and visitors. Sixteen times, most recently in 2013, Muirfield managed to keep its discriminatory membership policy and host one of golf’s most prestigious championships, too. So it must have seemed like a bad dream when many gentlemen of Muirfield woke up one morning  —   got out of their marital beds to go play golf with their chums, as the former chief executive of the RA, Peter Dawson, so memorably described it in 2013  —   and realized that the ground beneath their feet had moved. It is proof of the seismic shifts remaking the glacial game of golf that in a matter of a few years, Muirfield went from being too famed a course to leave out of the British Open rotation to being too fetid to include. Muirfield, formed in 1744, was one of the last clubs to host a major golf event to dig their heels in on membership. The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews opened its membership to women in 2014. Royal St. George’s, another British Open site, followed suit a year later. Last year, Royal Troon ended its   membership policy  —   a few weeks before hosting the British Open. Augusta National Golf Club, home of the Masters, deserves credit for offering membership to women in 2012, however belatedly, and, in doing so, daring the rest of the heel diggers to fall in line behind it. Renee Powell, one of the first women offered membership to the Royal and Ancient, had a mixed reaction to Muirfield’s mulligan vote. “I’m delighted it passed, first of all,” she said Tuesday by telephone. “I’m also a little bit bewildered why anyone would vote against it. ” Pioneers like Powell have been joined in the fight by younger generations of men who seem as confused as anyone by the old guard’s intransigence. After last year’s voting results were announced, Rory McIlroy, a   major winner from Northern Ireland, expressed disbelief. It was hard for him to wrap his head around a host of the major he loves perhaps more than any other discriminating against women. On Tuesday, the reigning Masters champion Danny Willett, an Englishman, expressed delight in the voting reversal. “I think that’s great,” he said. “I think it shows how times have changed. It shows how golf’s changed. ” Muirfield’s waiting list for membership stretches at least two years, so women will have to keep a stiff upper lip  —   there will be no line jumping for history’s sake. It is hoped the club doesn’t follow the example of the Royal and Ancient and earmark for membership a couple of nonagenarian women who don’t have time on their side. After the vote was announced, the RA affirmed Muirfield would go back into the British Open rotation. The first Open that Muirfield could host is in 2022, and by then, it is hoped, its membership will include a handful of women. Twenty years from now, no one is likely to care that the gentlemen of Muirfield were grudging in their acceptance of women. It will be like the 74 that Willett posted in the second round last year at Augusta  —   a footnote to his   victory. Two decades on, when women are mingling with men in the golf clubs where access to power is one of the privileges of membership, few will remember that it wasn’t always like that. History is long, but collective memories, blessedly, are short. The next battleground is Kasumigaseki Country Club, which was chosen as the site of the men’s and women’s golf competition at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. The club denies women full membership and prohibits them from playing on Sundays. In an interview with Reuters last month, the International Olympic Committee’s vice president, John Coates, said that if the club did not “achieve gender equality,” the Olympic competition would be moved to another course. One can argue that a club with discriminatory membership policies never should have been chosen as the host course in the first place. But as the RA demonstrated with Muirfield, the spotlight can be a powerful tool, starting conversations in which clubhouse politicking ends.",0
19649,Wife of FBI Official Investigating Hillary Got $500K from Hillary Allied PAC,"Wife of FBI Official Investigating Hillary Got $500K from Hillary Allied PAC October 27, 2016 Daniel Greenfield 
The system is broken. It's deeply corrupted by insider politics . The situation at the center of power has reached the point of utter unaccountability. Insider politics function as a shadow government. That needs to change. Restoring America requires dismantling much of the Federal government not only for Constitutional reasons, but because it's a simple matter of saving the Republic. 
Hillary Clinton headlined a major fundraiser for a political action committee shortly before the group steered nearly $500,000 to the wife of the FBI official who oversaw the Clinton email investigation, DailyMail.com has learned. 
Clinton's ties to the Common Good VA - a Virginia state PAC run by Clinton's long-time friend and advisor Terry McAuliffe, its governor - came under scrutiny this week after the Wall Street Journal reported that the group donated heavily to the state senate campaign of Jill McCabe. 
Her husband Andrew McCabe led the FBI investigation into Clinton's emails. 
Andrew McCabe, now the deputy director of the FBI, told the Wall Street Journal that he complied with federal ethics rules and was not promoted to lead the Clinton probe until months after his wife's unsuccessful state senate bid ended. 
Common Good VA was the largest single donor to Jill McCabe's campaign, election records show, giving her $467,000 between June and October of 2015. 
She was the third-largest recipient of money from the group, which can only contribute to Virginia state candidates. 
Her campaign also received an additional $207,788 from the Democratic Party of Virginia, a group over which McAuliffe exerts significant control. Combined, the money made up nearly one-third of her total funding. 
Now McCabe, a pediatrician, suddenly decided to run for public office. Unopposed. That was certainly nice of the Dems to not only put a first timer unopposed, but to throw piles and piles of cash at her. And some of that cash was coming from a key former Clinton Foundation man at the center of the latest Foundation scandal. 
Although Common Good VA is only allowed to fund state-level candidates, many of its largest donations came from outside of Virginia – including $50,000 from Clinton Foundation official Doug Band in New York, $100,000 from Clinton loyalist Robert Johnson in Maryland, and $10,000 from Clinton mega-donor Stephen Cloobeck in Nevada. 
In the following months, Common Good VA received several major donations from other close Clinton associates, including $100,000 from Bill Clinton's business partner Ron Burkle in California and $50,000 from Ready for Hillary's finance committee member Leonard Lauder in New York. 
There are basic conflicts here. Someone this linked to the Clinton network should never have been investigating Hillary regardless of the dates and timing. But this is exactly what happened with Benghazi.",0
19650,What Does It Take to Survive Where You Live?,"License DMCA 
How much does it take to get by where you live? A new report concludes that current federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour doesn't come close, anywhere in the United States. It takes more than $15 per hour to earn a living wage in most states. When you throw in the rising cost of student debt, low-income Americans are even further underwater. 
The report, "" Waiting for the Payoff: How Low Wages and Student Debt Keep Prosperity Out of Reach (pdf),"" was issued this week by the People's Action Institute. Among its findings: 
* It takes more than $15 per hour to earn a living wage in 42 states and the District of Columbia. That figure is over $16 in more than half of the country, comes to nearly $20 per hour in California, and is more than $20 in New York state. 
* New York State's minimum wage of $9 per hour provides only 44 percent of a living wage for a single adult and less than a quarter of the living wage for a single adult with two children."" 
* Arkansas had the lowest hourly rate of any state, but at $14.58 per hour it was barely below the $15 per hour minimum proposed by Fight for 15 . - Advertisement - 
* The situation is even more dire for working parents. A single adult with two children needs more than $26 per hour to get by in South Carolina, more than $41 per hour in New York state, and nearly $44 per hour in Washington DC. 
* 43 states and Washington, D.C. have a lower minimum wage for tipped workers. Half of tipped workers are 30 years old or older, and tipped workers are three times as likely as other workers to be impoverished. 
What's the price of a dream? For people who saw college as the way to a better life, this country's student debt crisis offers a harsh answer. More than 43 million Americans now carry some level of student debt. 
Student loan debt in this country now totals more than $1.3 trillion -- and it's getting worse. Common Dreams' Deirdre Fulton points to a new study from the Institute of College Access and Success which shows that the average undergraduate borrower now graduates with $30,100 in debt, a 4 percent increase from last year's figure. 
Living wage figures rise even higher when the cost of student debt is factored in. The national median payment for student debt comes to $242 per month. Student debt cost increases the national average living wage from $17.28 to $18.67 per hour. - Advertisement - 
College graduates typically earn higher wages, but the discrimination faced by women and people of color contributes to ongoing wage inadequacy. For example, African Americans are considerably more likely to take on student debt that white Americans, and are more likely to go to higher-cost private institutions. Women and people of color are more likely to work in tipped occupations, so the sub-minimum wage affects these groups disproportionately. 
Wage discrimination is also a critical problem, both for student debt holders and low-wage workers as a whole. As the report notes: 
""... Majors with a high proportion of white males, such as computer and information sciences, see starting salaries of $65,000. At the same time, English and Psychology, which see more women and people of color, have median starting salaries of $35,000 and $32,750 per year, respectively -- lower even than the traditional living wage for a single adult."" 
Discrimination in hiring and other systemic problems take a heavy toll. For each dollar paid to white male college graduates with degrees, black men are paid 78 cents; Latinos are paid 81 cents; black women are paid 72 cents; and Latinas are paid 69 cents.",0
19651,"Obamacare Architect Jonathan Gruber: “Obamacare Is Not Imploding,” “Working As Designed”","MIT professor Jonathan Gruber, a well-known architect of President Obama’s Affordable Care Act, tells CNN that the law known as ‘Obamacare’ is working exactly as intended. 
Full transcript, via CNN: 
JONATHAN GRUBER: Obamacare’s not imploding. The main goal of Obamacare was two-fold. One was to cover the uninsured, of which we’ve covered 20 million, the largest expansion in American history. The other was to fix broken insurance markets where insurers could deny people insurance just because they were sick or they had been sick. Those have been fixed, and for the vast majority of Americans, costs in those markets have come down, thanks to the subsidies made available under Obamacare… 
The 22% increase [in health care premiums], let’s remember who that applies to. That applies to a very small fraction of people, who have to buy insurance without the subsidies that are available. 
85% of people buying insurance on the exchanges get subsidies. And for those people, this premium increase doesn’t affect them. 
Now, for those remaining people, that is a problem, and that’s something that we need to address, but it’s not a crisis. It doesn’t mean the system’s collapsing. And most importantly, it doesn’t affect the 150 million Americans who get employer insurance, who have actually seen their premiums fall dramatically, relative to what was expected before Obamacare. 
CAROL COSTELLO, CNN: OK. So let’s talk about how exactly you can fix Obamacare. And I just need you to be specific, because I think people really want answers. So Hillary Clinton says she can fix Obamacare. So what would be one fix that would drive premiums down. 
GRUBER: Look, once again, there’s no sense of oh it just has to be fixed. The law is working as designed; however, it could work better, and I think probably the most important thing experts would agree on is that we need a larger mandate penalty. We have individuals who are essentially free riding on the system. They’re essentially waiting until they get sick and then getting health insurance. The whole idea of this plan which was pioneered in Massachusetts was that the individual mandate penalty would bring those people into the system and have them participate. The penalty right now is probably too low and that’s something ideally we would fix. 
COSTELLO: So somebody who is president could go to congress and say, “You know what, lawmakers, this is a fix. Can you pass this?” Is that what would have to happen to put that fix into place? 
GRUBER: Basically, it’s hard to know what dramatic fix we could do without congress participating in the process. We could do things like a stronger mandate is one. We could do things like increasing the pressure on states to expand their Medicade programs, a horrible act of political malpractice where states have left millions of people of their lowest income citizens uncovered. We could do things like that, but a lot of that would involve congressional participation. It’s hard to know what you can do just on your own as a new administration. 
COSTELLO: What about the insurers who have fled the system? How do you convince them to come back or new companies to sign on? GRUBER: Once again, I think the press here has been misleading. Some insurers are leaving. Other insurers are thriving. I think what you have is a system where we’ve shaken up the status quo, exactly what we expect of new innovation, disruptive innovation if you will, to do. Insurers who were thriving in the old system are finding this new system sort of hard for them. Other insurers are doing really well and what’s going to happen is the natural process as the market evolves. These premiums are going to increase. That’s going to allow profitable opportunities for new insurers to enter they are(ph) and bring premiums back down. So we’re just seeing the ups and downs of a new market. What you have to remember is that premiums in 2014 came in way below what we expected. In fact, where they are today is exactly where they thought they’d be today. It’s just they came in lower than we thought and they rose faster than we thought. And that’s just some of the unpredictability of a new market. That will settle down over time. And new insurers will enter. 
COSTELLO: OK. So hindsight is 20/20, right? 
GRUBER: Yes. 
COSTELLO: Looking back, is there one thing that you wish was done differently? 
GRUBER: I think there’s really probably two things I wish was done differently. One is I wish the mandate penalty was stronger. The other, I wish the federal government had done more to get states to expand their Medicaid programs. I think that this is a fundamental flaw in our system that states are leaving so many systems uncovered and citizens who are sick who are coming into this exchange pool and making it more expensive. 
COSTELLO: So realistically, you know, after the next president is put into office, what do you think will happen with Obamacare? 
GRUBER: I think nothing much is going to happen, to be honest. I think that basically a system that largely works , that the flaws your seeing now or the premium increase you’re seeing now are just the natural dynamics of a market as it transitions to its new state, and I think that we’re just going to let it go for a couple years and it’s going to get better on its own. And basically I think it’s a system which largely works. 
COSTELLO: What if Donald Trump becomes president, he has a republican congress, and he does repeal it? What happens then? 
GRUBER: Well, first of all he won’t repeal it. Remember, the whole argument and public debate against this law is that people didn’t get to keep insurance they liked. Well, you’re going to have 20 million Americans or more who are now getting insurance that they like. You’re not going to take that away from them. And let’s be clear, there is no replace. There is only repeal. There is no Republican alternative to this law, and the reason is because this is fundamentally a bipartisan legislation that was originally drafted on Republican principles, to be honest. And so there is no Republican alternative. And so his repeal and replace is just repeal and leave people uninsured. That’s not going to happen.",0
19652,Throwing Stones and Slaughtering Sheep at the Hajj - The New York Times,"Usually, the post office is where you send mail or pay your bills. In Saudi Arabia during the hajj, it’s where you pay for your animal sacrifice. It costs 460 riyals, or about $120, to have a sheep slaughtered. The sacrifice, known as the hadi, is incumbent on all pilgrims, who must donate at least   of the meat to the poor. Modern pilgrims usually have a slaughterhouse near Mecca do this for them, via the local post office. How do you know your animal was sacrificed? By text message, of course. Outside Saudi Post in Mina, the sprawling tent city where pilgrims live for part of the hajj, Marwan Nabil, 22, who is from Yemen, began to worry when he had not received his confirmation. “The system is down, but don’t worry, it will be done in an hour,” said Faisal   a postal worker. It was all so neat and tidy. Not so in a humid, sweaty slaughterhouse on the edge of Mecca: Men in stained robes hauled flailing sheep into the building. One man dragged his prey by its leg, and another carried one of the animals on his back. Butchers in red   hacked with curved blades at skinned sheep hanging on hooks. Cleaners in yellow   dumped sheep guts into drains under the killing floor. Nearby, men in muddy clothes sat on a dirty red carpet, watching animals being chopped up. Outside the slaughterhouse, a Pakistani woman shook an empty plastic bag. “Meat?” she asked, hoping charitable locals would oblige. For pilgrims who are not strong enough to endure the long trek of the hajj, there are men with wheelchairs for hire who will push them from site to site, ritual to ritual. But it’s not cheap. One wheelchair pusher told me he charged older clients 200 riyals, or about $53, for a day. I asked him how he set his price, and if he charged by weight. On the third day of the hajj, pilgrims throw rocks at three stone pillars near Jamarat Bridge in a   of Ibrahim (or Abraham) stoning the devil as he tries to follow God’s commandment. Jamarat has been a notorious choke point for hajj crowds. That’s where hundreds, maybe thousands, of pilgrims died last year in a crush of people. In 2004, my sister was caught in one of the hajj throngs. Security officials this year are trying to limit the number of pilgrims who can go to Jamarat at any given time. To avoid dangerous backups, officials have instituted   pedestrian roads for pilgrims from the tent city of Mina to the Jamarat building. And directions flash in English and Arabic to keep people moving. I collected 49 small rocks in an empty water bottle for the ritual, and some more experienced pilgrims showed me how to carefully but purposefully throw my stones. Tip: Nobody likes a lefty. After throwing my first batch of stones with my left hand, I was politely corrected. I joked that any devil could duck my   throw. I grew up in an observant Muslim family in Canberra, Australia, but stopped wearing a head scarf in college and now, at 38, lead a largely secular life. Naturally, as a reporter, I came on my first hajj  —   the   pilgrimage, filled with rituals, that is required of every Muslim  —   with many questions. How would people from stunningly different places, like Inner Mongolia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and New Jersey, interact? Who gets to kiss the rock lodged inside the Kaaba, the black cube that pilgrims circle seven times? What would I pray for on the second day atop Mount Arafat, a time and place in which our tradition tells us God answers petitions? Where do two million people poop? I’m still working on my list (scroll down for video and snapshots) but I took some time to answer questions that readers submitted on nytimes. com. What is inside the Kaaba? Has it been rebuilt over the centuries? Do men and women walk around the Kaaba at the same time?  —   Swaroop Conjeevaram, North Royalton, Ohio Are women and men allowed to circle the Kaaba together, or are the genders segregated?  —   Mary Ann Hall, North Charleston, S. C. Only very   delegations are allowed in the Kaaba, and not often. There are blurry videos online that seem to show it mostly empty save for two pillars, an altar, incense lamps and plaques on the wall. What we can say for sure is what is not there: images of the gods that   Arabs once worshiped and kept inside the Kaaba. I love the idea that the place Muslims must pray to is empty. Muslims are internalizing in every prayer that the one god they worship cannot be represented in an image and cannot be imagined, to the point where the house sanctified to God is empty. The Kaaba is renovated from time to time, but sparingly so, out of respect for the structure’s importance to Islam. Men and women do walk around the Kaaba at the same time. In that way, it’s a unique holy site in Islam where the sexes mix and undertake their rites together. What is the connection between the Kaaba and Allah?  —   Daan Bijdevaate, the Netherlands Muslims believe that the prophet Ibrahim  —   the biblical Abraham  —   built the Kaaba to worship the one true God. Some think it sits on the site where Adam, the first human, had his own prayer space. In all cases, Muslims see it as the oldest house of worship for the one God it is also called Beit Allah, House of God. The pilgrim, in turn, is a “guest of the House of God. ” Are   allowed to watch the hajj, such as tourists or visitors?   —   Sarah C. Santiago, Chile Why are   not allowed in Mecca?  —   Fabian Babich, Sydney, Australia Are Christians welcome to observe the rituals?  —   Erin Bunting, Aliquippa, Pa. Only on the live television broadcasts.   are not allowed to enter the holy sites, based on the Quran’s Chapter 9, Verse 28, which says, “O believers, verily the polytheists are impure, so let them not approach the Masjid   after this, their final year. ” This is so rigidly enforced that there is a special highway bypassing the area. In any case, there’s no room. The Saudi government already limits the number of people allowed into Mecca during hajj to about two million many countries have a lottery system to select pilgrims. I met a Palestinian man who had applied for seven years and, at 72, had worried that he might die before seeing the holy sites. How is it going with the bathroom situation?  —   Lynn Bender, Davis, Calif. I think the Saudis have gone to some effort to try to make bathrooms as available as possible. Nobody has peed in front of me, as happened to members of my family when they came here. But we are on the move so much that sometimes I have to hold it in for hours. Luckily, we’re not eating much heavy food. Also, since my journalist visa makes me a V. I. P. guest of the Saudi government, I’m staying in a compound where there are clean toilets and showers. How accessible are relief stations for, say, heatstroke?  —   Ahad Chowdhury, Chino, Calif. That was something I worried about a lot before I came. I have not seen many medic stations, but I have seen ambulances and hospitals. Also, pilgrims are constantly spraying one another with water to avoid overheating, and many places have structures that emit a fine mist to cool you down. Do people stay with the people they came with (or stay alone) or do they also connect with strangers and make new friends?  —   Ani Grosser, Lenox, Mass. Well, my mum was hoping I’d find a husband here! Usually pilgrims come in delegations and stay with them in the same hotels, travel on the same buses and share the same meals. Except for interviews, it’s been hard to meet people because they tend to move in big units. In my news media delegation, there is a Yemeni woman who looks like a sweet granny until she flips on her niqab. She’s always smiling and she’s my favorite. Do young men and women try to make friends?  —   Mo Kareem, Houston I don’t see much mixing, and it’s hard to see where it could happen, except perhaps while circulating the Kaaba. Men and women mostly pray separately, and they sleep in separate quarters. It’s also forbidden for even married people to have sex during hajj, so I’m guessing that any premarital mixing, which Islam already sees as sinful, would be considered doubly bad! I saw an ad for the hajj at a tour company and one package had animal sacrifice as an option. What is the deal with this?  —   Beth Harrison, Millburn, N. J. I wish I had that option! One requirement of the hajj is for each pilgrim to ritually slaughter an animal  —   sheep, cow, camel or goat  —   at the end. If your hajj package does not have a sacrifice option, which means the tour company does it on your behalf, you can also buy a coupon here in Mecca for a slaughterhouse to take care of it. Pilgrims who do it soon enough receive a confirmation by text message that their chosen animal has been slaughtered, and the government undertakes to distribute the meat to the poor around the world. I am interested to know your (inner) feelings about bikini and burkini before and after the hajj.  —   Mohammed Basith, New York I think both bikinis and burkinis  —   the   swimsuits designed to adhere to Islamic modesty codes and banned recently by some French beach towns  —   are fine. I find it offensive when any faith (including, yes, Islam) dictates what a woman should wear. I also find the contemporary secular obsession with women needing to be thin and to look young to be depressing. Is there an   where one can do the full hajj but with fewer teeming multitudes?  —   Steven Adkins, Aucamville, France Nice idea, but the full hajj can begin only on the 8th of   the last month of the Islamic calendar. The good news is that it’s a lunar calendar, so sometimes hajj is in the winter, a lovely time to visit this desert plain. If you really can’t handle crowds, there is always umrah, a kind of   Muslims can do anytime. You mainly circle the Kaaba and walk between the hills of Safa and Marwa, which are now enclosed within the sprawling (and  ) Grand Mosque. I get nervous and tetchy in crowds, but so far I’ve done O. K. The fear melts away, and at some point you stop caring about the sweat and viruses everybody is sharing. The pilgrims’ chants of “Here I am, O Lord” were barely audible over the   of plastic water bottles squashed underfoot as we jostled toward Mount Arafat on Sunday, the greatest day of the annual hajj. Muslims believe it is when God will answer all sincere prayers offered there. As the sun blazed, men and boys splashed the crowds gleefully with the last ounces from their bottles. Some ducked their heads under gushes from a supply tower, and a few kind souls offered to turn their spray bottles onto strangers’ faces. At first I was disappointed to see the mess of bottles and mud, a cleaning man in bright yellow and green looking on helplessly: I had thought Arafat would be austere and clean. But the pilgrims’ cheery mood brightened my own. Of course it was dirty. Two million people were walking together on a hot day to a rocky hill and sucking down bottles of water. Of course the cleaner couldn’t sweep it up  —   yet he could cause a deadly crush if he got in the way of that river of pilgrims. So I, too, crunched the bottles, tried not to slip, let people spray me with water. I even prayed. At the end of the hajj, men are required to shave their heads, and women to cut a lock of hair. At the busy barber complex near the Grand Mosque, they’ll buzz you with a razor (disposable) or scissors for $4 a machine cut is $2. 70. Signs around the mosque warn pilgrims not to cut hair inside the complex  —   it turns out some people like to D. I. Y. at Islam’s holiest site. I mean no disrespect when I say Mecca is, well, a mecca for shopping. People have come here to pray, but even five times daily leaves time for the glittering gold shops that line Ajyad Street. This year’s big sellers: lightweight rings and white, rose and yellow bracelets so finely spun that they feel like cotton candy on the wrist. Traders, as they do, lament that last year was better  —   instability throughout the Middle East has left fewer buyers for the   bling. For those with lighter wallets, children hawk velvet prayer rugs decorated with images of the Kaaba for $2. 60. People sell   for the inevitable pilgrim who has lost her shoes somewhere around the Grand Mosque, calling out the prices in Urdu: “Panj! Panj! Panj!” Five! Five! Five! The pharmacy on Ajyad Street is constantly packed, doing a roaring trade in antibiotics  —   hajj flu again  —   and   pills. Sitting next to a group of Saudi women who resembled large black crows in their billowing robes, double face veils and gloves, I noticed they all wore little rings that looked like miniature pedometers. When I asked how many miles one woman had walked that day, she laughed. It turned out the rings were electronic prayer counters. Muslims often keep track of individual prayers like “I seek God’s forgiveness,” believing that they earn credit for a good deed, or hasana, with each supplication. Prayers uttered at the Grand Mosque are said to be worth 100, 000 times those said elsewhere. One of the women, Hanan, showed me her counter: 266, and it was only noon. Then she thrust the device into my hands and told me to “keep it, so you can always count your prayers. ” I politely declined. The big and the small. For Syria. For refugees to find homes and acceptance. That children would go to sleep with full stomachs and mothers able to love and care for them. I prayed for my friend’s mother who has cancer, and tried to remember all the other friends, most of them secular, who shyly asked me to sneak in a word for them. Right before we had to leave Arafat, I remembered Mum making me promise to pray for a husband, and so I did. My mum, of course, has instructed me to pray for a husband as I make my first hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca required of every Muslim. Also: the health of her best friend and the release, from jail in Egypt, of the son of my aunt’s maid. On the second day of the hajj  —   this year, Sunday, Sept. 11  —   pilgrims will clamber onto Mount Arafat to ask for God’s forgiveness and make specific requests by prayer. Muslims believe that a supplication at that place at that time will be answered. Along with Mum’s list, I’ll be praying for the health of a friend’s mother who is fighting cancer, and the continued happiness and health of my family and friends. A few friends who are secular Muslims like me asked that I throw in a word for them, and I will. God, if you are listening, peace would be really nice. I’m not so sure about the husband. I have been asking all the people I meet in Mecca what they’ll be praying for on Mount Arafat: ■ Mervat, a    cardiologist from Yemen, said she would ask “to go to paradise with my parents” and that her   country might find peace. ■ Hassan Abbas, a doctor from Nigeria, hopes that his   country might find peace. ■ Sayida Bakri, 68, seeks for terrorism to be defeated and “for Egypt to stand on its feet” after years of instability. ■ Abd Aziz Hj Johari  —   who is 18 and from Brunei, and who wore a   proclaiming, “I Love the Prophet”  —   shrugged at my question. His mother, Siti Hayun Hj Abdul Qadi, patted him affectionately and said she would ask that her son “become a good boy in the future, a good husband, especially, a good son. ” There are no pockets on the ihram that men wear during the hajj  —   the traditional dress consists of just two white sheets draped around their bodies. And it’s difficult for men and women to carry bulky bags in tight quarters. So the air rights above their heads become valuable personal real estate. I’ve seen people carrying canteens of Zamzam water on their heads others balancing their prayer mats like hats and men from Afghanistan, Sudan, Oman and Egypt top themselves with carefully arranged turbans that seem to delicately float above their heads. When I was a little girl and we traveled from Australia to Egypt to visit my mum’s family, I remember the enchanting women with large baskets perched on their heads, walking casually down crowded market streets, their empty arms swaying freely. I see some Palestinian women doing the same thing in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where I work as a correspondent in The Times’s Jerusalem bureau. A good idea knows no borders. The hajj is hot and grueling, and pilgrims flock to the Aesra ice cream shop near the Grand Mosque, where there are separate lines for men and women. “After worship, there’s a treat,” said Arar Hafsi, 51, an Algerian pilgrim, giggling. I met one young woman in a niqab, her face and body covered in heavy black cloth, clutching a plastic cup filled with swirls of mango and strawberry. She said, laughing, that maybe she had one after every prayer  —   that’s five times a day. “Is it good?” I asked. “Well,” she said, “it’s all there is. ” I know you want to know, so: A woman wearing a niqab eats ice cream by filling the spoon, then raising her veil just a bit and sticking the spoon in her mouth. Qasim, 16, a worker I interviewed at the shop, gave free cups to me and   the Saudi minder who follows me everywhere under the government’s rules for journalists covering the hajj. The ice cream tasted good. Also: It’s all there is. So as I made my first hajj, joining millions of Muslims from around the world on the annual pilgrimage to our holiest places, I did not have the antibiotics or disinfectant gel my family had insisted I carry to ward off what we call “the hajj flu. ” I did not have a proper head scarf or even a prayer mat. As the call to prayer sounded, I stood in a line of women on the street leading to the Grand Mosque and realized I would have no clean place to put my head during the full prostrations we make in a symbolic act of submission to God. I figured, never mind, this is the hajj, once in a lifetime. Then the woman standing next to me said, “I’ve made space for you. ” We had to pray very close together, our heads were touching on that tiny mat. Afterward, I thanked her. Her name is Samira, and she is a professor in Algeria. She kissed me on the cheek and said that was the way a Muslim should behave, and that I was her sister. One of the main hajj rituals is to walk seven times around the Kaaba, Islam’s holiest site. My brother and sister, who did the hajj years ago, had told me about the pigeons that circle, seemingly in sync with the pilgrims, overhead. A sign from God? Perhaps, but helped along by the women selling bird feed to people who flung it joyously into the air around the Grand Mosque. A group of Nigerian teenagers stood in a corner, calling out “Zamzam, Zamzam, Zamzam!” and passing out plastic cups of water. Zamzam is a well located within the Haram, the mosque that surrounds the Kaaba, Islam’s holiest site. Muslims believe God made it bubble up as the second wife of Ibrahim (Abraham in the   bible) tried to soothe her thirsting child. A   bottle sells for $4. 95 on the internet. I was spooked after reading an article saying Zamzam water had high levels of arsenic. But in the heat and exhaustion of the hajj, it tasted refreshing. I even stopped in front of an Egyptian man spraying people’s faces with the water as a small good deed  —   he said he did the same during the 2011 uprisings in Cairo. But I was worried when I saw pilgrims returning their empty cups to the Nigerians  —   this is how hajj flu spreads! My favorite passage of “The Autobiography of Malcolm X” was when he described the pilgrims being of all races and colors. It’s still like that. A Chinese woman showed me her Mandarin Quran. I saw women from Uzbekistan who had their national flag sewn onto their head scarves, and men with “Kurdistan” emblazoned on their jackets. There were Pakistanis with beards dyed a cartoonish red, and one guy, who knows from where, in a gold sequined hat. He looked fabulous. It reminded me of the little mosque of my childhood in multicultural Canberra, Australia. I grew up thinking it was normal to worship next to Muslims from Bosnia and Vietnam, Afghanistan and Jordan. Walking around the Kaaba was like Canberra, writ large. There was something very incredible and lovely about being a tiny little human among tens of thousands of other humans, saying the same prayers and doing the same rituals.",0
19653,New Moon in Scorpio: Making a Calculated Effort,"By Carmen Di Luccio
We are having a New Moon in Scorpio on October 30th in most places around the world, and during the early hours of October 31st in Australia and New Zealand. It will occur at 5:38pm Universal Time ( click here for your time zone).
New Moons bring in a new wave of energy for the upcoming month. It is the beginning of the first half of the lunar cycle, which is when the Moon is waxing (gaining light), while the Full Moon is the transition into the second half, when the Moon is waning (losing light). Therefore, the energy of the New Moon serves as more of a guidepost for those first 10-14 days of the cycle.
Scorpio: Powerful, Deep, Intense, and Passionate Scorpio is a primal and passionate sign about desires, fears, and intensity. As a ‘fixed sign’ ruled by Mars and Pluto, it holds a high concentration of power that can be used to control or to transform. It likes and seeks what is real and refrains from anything that is lacking substance.
The deep merging of two individuals or parties, whether it be sexually, financially, or resourcefully, is Scorpio territory. This sign seeks loyalty, yet it must be earned after a period of being under scrutiny. It wants to know what is hidden beneath the surface to decide on how much trust is to be earned.
Scorpio is about being willing to look at and even embrace the deepest, darkest, and scariest aspects of others, oneself, and the world around us. It is the sign of death and rebirth, love and hate, as it is the sign of extremes. An example of all of this is how we have Halloween followed by ‘All Saints Day’, and then followed by ‘All Souls Day’ back to back during Scorpio season.
The shadow side of Scorpio is that it can be manipulative and controlling in a very calculated way. While the scrutinizing of others is to gain trust, it can also be about getting some sort of advantage to have more control over a person or situation. Although Scorpio seeks hidden aspects of others, it can be very guarded about one’s own secrets.
New Moon Conjunct Mercury and Trine Neptune Mercury is also in Scorpio moving away from a conjunction with the Sun that was exact 3 days before on October 27th. In the days leading up to this New Moon, many people could have experienced important communications, ideas, deep thoughts, or some sort of mental efforts towards joint resources/efforts, money, sexuality, and/or some sort of strategy. Whatever it is, think of it as something that has been ‘gathered’ or ‘set-up’ to be implemented or expanded on in this moon cycle and in the coming months.
The New Moon (with Mercury separating) is also in a trine with Neptune, which could assist us with our imagination, creativity, intuition, dreams, visions, and spiritual connection. Due to the nodes also being involved, there may also be a connection with how our past can help our future. For some lovers, it can be a time of feeling like soulmates. This energy is strong until November 2nd.
Venus Conjunct Saturn, Mars In Capricorn Square Uranus The day before the New Moon, Venus made a conjunction with Saturn, which initiated a new 14 month cycle between the two. Venus is about fun, love, relationships, beauty, and pleasure while Saturn is serious and more concerned with responsibilities, structure, discipline, and commitments. Therefore, many of us will experience some sort of merging of these themes both in either favourable or unfavourable ways. Occurring in Sagittarius, it can be related to our beliefs, visions, travel, education, publishing, or marketing.
Mars, a ruler of Scorpio, has been in the ambitious sign of Capricorn since September 27th. This has been an excellent time to really make things happen in terms of reaching our goals, and it will last until November 8th/9th.
During this New Moon, Mars is separating from a square with Uranus which was stronger in the 2 days prior. At worst, their could have been sudden change, separation, instability, and the need to take some sort of action as a result. For some people, it could have of been rebellion or wanting to break free from a controlling situation. In other cases it could of positively brought innovation towards our ambitions. These are just some examples of how it could be manifested, but whatever it is for each of us, it has created the landscape for some new beginnings.
Mercury and Sun Sextile Pluto, Venus Trine Uranus During the first week of the Moon cycle, Mercury (followed by the Sun) will be in a harmonious aspect with Pluto in Capricorn. Pluto, being the modern ruler of Scorpio, indicates that this is an excellent time to expand on what was initiated during the previous week when Mercury was conjunct the Sun. Powerful thoughts, communication, or deep research to assist us in our careers, managing or earning resources/money, or implementing some sort of structure or strategy to help gain some of sort of success and fulfill a goal.
Venus is trine Uranus and will be strongest on November 4th-5th. This can be a fun and exciting time, and luckily it will fall on the weekend. This is a great time to connect with people, attend social events, especially since Venus is in Sagittarius, it is a good time to explore and try new things that can bring you enjoyment. This can be a great time for lovers as well with potential breakthroughs.
Things To Consider And Making Intentions For This New Moon Look at everything that has played out for you in the last week prior to this New Moon. The next 10 days following it is a significant time to make a great effort to expand on what has been initiated, and take steps to move beyond anything challenging that has occurred.
Your intentions for this Lunar Month should be related to improving on and/or facilitating the positive qualities of Scorpio energy into your life. This includes (but not limited to) improving your ability to earn or manage money/resources, tapping into and harnessing your inner power and sexual energy better, facing your fears, trying to understand complex things, seeing beyond fakeness or deceit, and becoming more in touch with what is real.
The best time to make your intentions for the Moon cycle is during the first 24 hours following the New Moon but it could even be done within the first 3 days. The closer to the New Moon, the better. The exact time will be at 5:38pm Universal Time, but you can click here to find out what it will be in your time zone.

19654,Hillary Clinton’s Doctor Says Pneumonia Led to Abrupt Exit From 9/11 Event - The New York Times,"Hillary Clinton is being treated for pneumonia and dehydration, her doctor said on Sunday, hours after she abruptly left a ceremony in New York honoring the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks and had to be helped into a van by Secret Service agents. The incident, which occurred after months of questions about her health from her Republican opponent, Donald J. Trump, and his campaign, is likely to increase pressure on Mrs. Clinton to address the issue and release detailed medical records, which she has so far declined to do. Mrs. Clinton was taken from the morning event at ground zero to the Manhattan apartment of her daughter, Chelsea. About 90 minutes after arriving there, Mrs. Clinton emerged from the apartment in New York’s Flatiron district. She waved to onlookers and posed for pictures with a little girl on the sidewalk. “I’m feeling great,” Mrs. Clinton said. “It’s a beautiful day in New York. ” Mrs. Clinton left in her motorcade without the group of reporters that is designated to travel with her in public. A campaign spokesman, Nick Merrill, indicated that she had returned to her Chappaqua, N. Y. residence sometime after 1 p. m. and Mrs. Clinton was not seen publicly the rest of the day. Mr. Merrill initially described Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, as feeling “overheated” at the commemoration ceremony. But just after 5 p. m. a campaign official said Mrs. Clinton’s physician, Dr. Lisa R. Bardack, had examined the candidate at her home in Chappaqua, and Dr. Bardack said in a statement that Mrs. Clinton was “rehydrated and recovering nicely. ” “Secretary Clinton has been experiencing a cough related to allergies,” Dr. Bardack’s statement said, adding that on Friday morning, after a prolonged cough, Mrs. Clinton was given a diagnosis of pneumonia. “She was put on antibiotics, and advised to rest and modify her schedule,” Dr. Bardack added. “At this morning’s event, she became overheated and dehydrated. ” Dr. Bardack did not indicate what sort of pneumonia Mrs. Clinton had or elaborate on the nature of the examination last week, whether Mrs. Clinton had a fever today, or a host of other issues that could offer more precise insights about her condition. Late Sunday night, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign said she was canceling her plans to travel to California on Monday for what had been a planned   trip there. A video of Mrs. Clinton taken by an attendee at the ceremony captured what appeared to be her legs buckling as she struggled to steady herself and walk to her van. She required assistance from two Secret Service agents, who held her on either side, to move off a curb and into the van.   images revealed that her feet were dragging as she was hoisted into the vehicle. The episode thrust questions about Mrs. Clinton’s health and the transparency of her campaign squarely into the last two months of the race, which many polls show has grown tighter. For months Republicans have, with scarce evidence, questioned the stamina of Mrs. Clinton, 68, and claimed she is ill, often pointing to her repeated coughing bouts. She has brushed off such claims. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump, 70, have shared substantially less information about their health than some previous presidential candidates. And Mrs. Clinton revealed that she had pneumonia and had been prescribed medication only after the startling video emerged of her being unable to walk under her own volition after the ceremony. Her campaign initially did not offer any information about why she had left early or her whereabouts. Twice during the day, she abandoned the group of reporters assigned to cover her public movements. Campaign officials did not respond to multiple inquiries about whether Mrs. Clinton had been treated by a doctor or had taken any medications. Even some members of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign staff had been unaware of her recent diagnosis. Huma Abedin, Mrs. Clinton’s   aide, sent an email to the full campaign staff on Sunday that included the doctor’s note, to share with them “the full picture. ” “Onward as H. R. C. would say,” Ms. Abedin wrote in the message, the contents of which were disclosed by a Clinton aide who requested anonymity to share an internal campaign email. Temperatures were in the high 70s on Sunday morning in New York, and humidity was high. Mr. Trump also attended the ceremony, as did many other dignitaries. Other attendees at the event said afterward that Mrs. Clinton had not appeared ill when she first arrived at the former site of the World Trade Center. “She seemed fine,” said Representative Peter T. King of New York, a Republican, who recalled speaking briefly with Mrs. Clinton around 8:30 a. m. But about an hour later there was a minor commotion, Mr. King said. A number of New York’s current and former elected officials had been standing in silence as the names of the victims of the attacks were read. Suddenly, Mrs. Clinton, a former New York senator, left her position. Mrs. Clinton emerged last week from an August mostly focused on private   with campaign events in Ohio, Illinois, Florida, North Carolina and Missouri. On Wednesday, she participated in an NBC forum on national security, and on Friday she attended a Manhattan   where she characterized half of Mr. Trump’s supporters as a “basket of deplorables. ” The candidates had taken their advertisements off the air to honor the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, and Mr. Trump said nothing when he was asked on Sunday about Mrs. Clinton’s condition. But he and his supporters have aggressively sought to raise questions about Mrs. Clinton’s health in recent months. Mr. Trump has highlighted her recurring cough and wrote on Twitter last month that “both candidates” should “release detailed medical records. ” (Mr. Trump has issued only a limited summary of his health.) Questions about the health of presidential hopefuls are hardly new to this campaign, but long before the exacting scrutiny of the modern media environment, campaigns were often able to suppress information about the ailments of candidates. Rumors about Franklin D. Roosevelt’s health, for example, pervaded his final presidential campaign in 1944, but he campaigned vigorously and his aides kept the extent of the heart disease that would kill him the following year out of the news. More recently, Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and Senator John McCain, each of whom was the Republican presidential nominee while in his 70s, faced questions about their physical condition. “The physical demands of running for president, even with private planes and Secret Service protection, are more difficult than the mental demands,” said Scott Reed, who managed Mr. Dole’s 1996 campaign. Mr. Trump has also been criticized for sharing few details about his health, providing only a brief statement from his personal physician in December. Short on particulars like heart rate, cholesterol level or family history, it described Mr. Trump in laudatory terms, saying that he would be “the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency. ” The physician, Dr. Harold Bornstein, later told NBC News that he had written the statement in five minutes while a black car waited outside his office to collect it. Mrs. Clinton’s campaign has tried to bat away rumors about her health, including releasing a letter from Mrs. Clinton’s doctor saying she was in “excellent health. ” But aides have dismissed such questions as a way to distract from the issue of Mr. Trump’s not releasing his tax returns. In July 2015, Mrs. Clinton issued a detailed   letter from her physician that included a concussion she sustained in 2012, while she was secretary of state it left her with a blood clot in her head and double vision. Dr. Bardack, Mrs. Clinton’s physician, said those symptoms had been resolved within two months. The candidate’s husband, Bill Clinton, however, has said that she “required six months of very serious work to get over” the concussion  —   a statement that helped feed conspiracy theories among Republicans that the injury was worse than initially disclosed, though there is no medical evidence to support those theories. Asked whether she was concerned that such questions about her health would affect the election, as the polls have tightened, Mrs. Clinton told reporters on her campaign plane last week: “I’m not concerned about the conspiracy theories. There are so many of them, I’ve lost track of them. ”",0

19656,"Mississippi Suspect Kills Eight, Including Deputy Sheriff, in House-to-House Rampage","Eight individuals were killed  —   including a deputy sheriff  —   during a    rampage in Mississippi on Saturday night. [The suspect,    Willie Cory Godbolt, was arrested after allegedly “holding a    hostage. ”  The Daily Leader reports that Godbolt was “captured this morning shortly before 7 a. m. at Super Jack’s at East Lincoln Road and Hwy. 84. ” Lincoln County Sheriff Steve Rushing provided a few details tied to the attacks: It appears the deputy responded to a call at Lee Drive of a resident wanting the suspect removed from the property. Rushing said the deputy and three others were killed there. Two more people were shot and killed at a residence on Coopertown Road, he said.

19657,"Bill Murray, Brooklyn Bartender - The New York Times","Many restaurants host an evening for friends and family before a formal opening as a dress rehearsal for the real thing. Such was the case on Sept. 16 at the Brooklyn bistro 21 Greenpoint, formerly known as River Styx. It was reopening, under the same owners, with a new menu and a new look. Most    nights are intimate affairs. Not this one. There were camera crews on the sidewalk and a line of people stretching from Greenpoint Avenue nearly to the East River. The restaurant’s   Homer Murray, had let it be known that there would be a special guest bartender on duty that night: his father, the actor and urban folk hero Bill Murray. But at 7:15 the    star of “Ghostbusters,” “Groundhog Day” and “Lost in Translation” had yet to arrive for a shift scheduled to begin at 7. From inside 21 Greenpoint, the younger Mr. Murray and the restaurant’s bar director, Sean Patrick McClure, a veteran of Le Bernardin and Dirty French, kept an eye on the growing crowd. Asked to describe his father’s bartending skills, Mr. Murray said: “He just kind of pours Slovenia Vodka into people’s glasses when they look thirsty. He’s about efficiency.   . ” The throng seemed to press against the doors shortly before 7:30, and the owner decided to open for business, although the main attraction had yet to appear. At 8:05, Bill Murray stepped in at last. The place lit up with smartphone flashes as he moved toward the bar. Those not occupied with capturing his likeness for their Instagram accounts gave him a round of applause. His first order of business was to grab a bottle of Slovenia Vodka from behind the bar. He twisted off the square black cap, poured a shot into it, drank it and placed the cap on his head to big cheers. Then he got to work. People who shouted the names of complicated cocktails got nowhere fast. But when someone said, “Mezcal, rocks,” the guest bartender served it up chop chop. Mr. Murray was equally quick with tequila shots, for himself and for anyone who asked. As he went about his business, he sang along to the music  —   “Disco Inferno,” Stevie Wonder’s “Higher Ground,” The Rolling Stones’ “Miss You” and “Street Fighting Man. ” One man asked him if he knew how to make a Bellini. “I know people who do,” Mr. Murray said. He refused another man’s order until, at Mr. Murray’s request, the guest removed his hat. Mr. McClure had whipped up a cocktail in honor of the restaurant’s reopening, mentioning that he had yet to come up with a name for it. Mr. Murray took a sip of the drink, eyes closed. Then he turned to Mr. McClure and said, “The  . ” And so it shall be known. (Recipe below.) The orders kept coming. Smartphones kept flashing. Mr. Murray slid a bourbon shot toward one patron, saying, “Old   will make you feel more intelligent. ” When a fellow bartender was in the middle of making a cocktail, Mr. Murray swiped the jigger and drank its contents. A bit later, he said, half under his breath, “I’m making nothing in tips. ” A group of firefighters entered the place, hoping for a photo with the special guest. Mr. Murray took a pineapple from the bar and cradled it like a baby as he posed with them. As the evening wore on, he left his station briefly and nearly bumped into a young woman. As if to make up for his lapse, he put his hands on her shoulders, kissed her on the nose and told her she was beautiful. Around 10, the music cut off, and Mr. Murray gestured toward the   with the drink he held in his hand. “This is my firstborn son, Homer,” he said. “And I am so happy for myself, and his brothers and sisters and mom, and all of you, that he has not continued in the family business. Instead, he has taken the joy of the family  —   to have a drink, and to have a meal, and to have friends together in one place  —   and made it his life’s work. To my son, and his friends, and his work, and all his partners. Homer Murray!” More cheers from the crowd. Mr. McClure praised Mr. Murray’s performance. ”A mixologist simply knows how to mix drinks,” he said. “A bartender knows how to run a bar: interact with guests, have fun, have conversations with them. Bill is a bartender. ” Mr. Murray looked fatigued toward the end of his shift. When asked what he had learned on the job, he said, “Well, if your barback isn’t getting you the right glasses”  —   he glared at a fellow bartender  —   “then you’re put in an instant of creativity, where you have to make a drink with the glasses you have. And that, to me, is a life of service. ” 1   ounces Slovenia Vodka   ounce Amaro liqueur   ounce fresh lemon juice 2 ounce soda water 1 pinch dried rosebuds Pour the vodka, Amaro and lemon juice into a shaker with ice. Shake vigorously, and strain into a highball glass. Top with ice, soda water and garnish with dried rosebuds. Serve with a straw.",0

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — Nayef Salam Muhammad Ujaym al-Hababi, al-Qaeda’s emir in eastern Afghanistan, was killed by a drone strike in Kunar province, NBC reported citing an unnamed US official on Wednesday. 
Al-Hababi planned attacks against the west as well as against international forces operating in Afghanistan, according to the US Treasury Department and United Nations. 
The airstrike on Sunday also killed al-Hababi’s deputy, Balal al-Utabi, according to reports.

19659,Ethics Office Praises Donald Trump for a Move He Hasn’t Committed To - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The Office of Government Ethics has informed lawyers for   Donald J. Trump that only a divestiture of his financial stake in his sprawling real estate business will resolve ethical concerns about conflicts of interest as he assumes the office of the presidency. The revelation from the normally secretive federal agency came Wednesday in a bizarre series of oddly informal postings on its Twitter account after officials apparently concluded, erroneously, that Mr. Trump had committed on his own Twitter account to divesting his assets. “As we discussed with your counsel, divestiture is the way to resolve these conflicts,” the office wrote on Twitter, revealing legal advice that would normally be confidential and adding in a separate post: “Bravo! Only way to resolve these conflicts of interest is to divest. Good call!” In fact, Mr. Trump had made no such commitment, at least publicly. In a series of   posts on Twitter, Mr. Trump said he would separate himself from the operations of his vast global business empire. Mr. Trump provided few details in his posts and did not say whether he would divest his assets. But he promised to hold a “major news conference” with his adult children in two weeks to reveal legal documents that would remove him from what he called the “business operations” of his company. He vowed to leave the Trump Organization “in total” to focus on running the country. But his vague promise to “in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses” drew an immediate rebuke from legal and ethics experts in Washington, who said that a close reading of the actual words in the posts suggested that Mr. Trump was not planning to take sufficient steps to eliminate conflicts. The emphasis on “business operations,” not on ownership, hinted that Mr. Trump was not ruling out retaining a financial stake in the Trump Organization or putting his children in control. Ethics experts said such moves would leave Mr. Trump vulnerable to accusations that his official actions were motivated by personal financial interests. “Although it is of course important that he have no involvement in Trump business operations, in order to avoid conflicts he must also exit the ownership of his businesses through using a blind trust or equivalent,” Norman L. Eisen, who was a White House ethics lawyer in the Obama administration, and Richard W. Painter, an ethics lawyer in the Bush administration, said in a joint statement to The New York Times. Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal nonprofit group that promotes ethics in government, said: “Unless his solution is to sell the business outside the family and put the proceeds in a blind trust, he’s not really doing anything to solve the problem. Just because you say something on Twitter doesn’t make it so. ” Every president in the past four decades, Mr. Eisen and Mr. Painter noted, has taken personal holdings he had before being elected and put them into a blind trust in which the assets were controlled by an independent party. If Mr. Trump were willing to sell his assets, one option would be to seek a certificate of divestiture from the Office of Government Ethics, which would allow him to sell his real estate holdings and other businesses with an enormous tax advantage. This system was set up to allow wealthy Americans to take jobs in the government and avoid conflicts of interest without a large financial impact. It allows incoming government officials to defer paying capital gains taxes on any earnings on the investment. This could generate an enormous windfall for Mr. Trump, given his vast real estate holdings. After Henry Paulson was nominated by President George W. Bush to serve as Treasury secretary, he left a job at Goldman Sachs and took advantage of this provision, avoiding conflicts of interest by selling an estimated $500 million in Goldman stock. Money generated from the liquidation of Mr. Trump’s assets would have to be invested in “permitted property,” which is limited to Treasury bonds or diversified mutual funds, ending the real estate ventures that are so tied to the Trump family’s identity. Still, that is what the Office of Government Ethics has said he should do. The office is normally a staid agency that rarely talks to reporters on the record, but Wednesday’s Twitter posts were oddly enthusiastic. The series of nine posts suggested that officials were celebrating what they thought was a decision by Mr. Trump to accept their legal advice. In their posts, officials at the ethics agency referred to a 1983 legal opinion in which the office urged presidents to “conduct themselves as if they were” bound by conflict of interest laws, even though such laws do not apply to occupants of the Oval Office. In a statement, Seth Jaffe, an agency spokesman, said that officials there were “excited” by Mr. Trump’s announcements on conflicts of interest and that the messages were not based on any information about the  ’s plans beyond what was shared on his Twitter feed. Asked later about the disclosure of the advice that the Office of Government Ethics had given to Mr. Trump’s lawyers, Mr. Jaffe said he could not provide additional comment. But the agency has left the posts on its official government account. Officials for Mr. Trump’s campaign and the Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment about the disclosures from the agency. And Reince Priebus, who will be the White House chief of staff, said on the MSNBC program “Morning Joe” that he was not ready to provide any more information about the legal discussions. “You should know that he’s got the best people in the world working on it,” Mr. Priebus said. In fact, the  ’s plan to deal with conflicts remains unclear. Simply removing Mr. Trump from    control of business decisions could still allow him to benefit financially from payments made to his companies by foreign governments, which may be prohibited by the   emoluments clause of the Constitution, Mr. Eisen said. And Mr. Trump’s Twitter posts said nothing about whether his children, who serve as advisers on his presidential transition committee, would continue to have roles in his administration. If Mr. Trump’s business is run by his children, they must be entirely separated from government operations, Mr. Eisen and Mr. Painter said. That means they could not participate in meetings with world leaders, like the prime minister of Japan, as Ivanka Trump did last month. “Without an ethics firewall that is set up at once and continues into the administration, scandal is sure to follow,” Mr. Eisen and Mr. Painter said in their statement. Democrats on Capitol Hill immediately questioned on Wednesday whether Mr. Trump’s Twitter posts indicated a significant change in his plans, and called for a formal investigation by the House Judiciary Committee. A letter sent by Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, and signed by 15 other Democrats on the committee, said Mr. Trump’s posts raised “a number of questions,” including whether Mr. Trump intends to transfer ownership of his assets. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump emphasized the appearances he would need to maintain as president, saying he believed it was “visually important” to avoid conflicts between his government role and his businesses. Mr. Trump insisted, as he has before, that he is not legally required to take any steps to divest himself of his financial ties. In an interview with The Times last week, he said, “The law is totally on my side, meaning the president can’t have a conflict of interest. ” He also said in the interview, “I would like to try and formalize something, because I don’t care about my business. ” Divesting could be costly and complicated. “That’s a very hard thing to do, you know what, because I have real estate. I have real estate all over the world,” he said in the interview. “Selling real estate isn’t like selling stock. Selling real estate is much different. It’s in a much different world. ”",0
19660,"Betsy DeVos, Trump’s Education Pick, Has Steered Money From Public Schools - The New York Times","It is hard to find anyone more passionate about the idea of steering public dollars away from traditional public schools than Betsy DeVos, Donald J. Trump’s pick as the cabinet secretary overseeing the nation’s education system. For nearly 30 years, as a philanthropist, activist and Republican   she has pushed to give families taxpayer money in the form of vouchers to attend private and parochial schools, pressed to expand publicly funded but privately run charter schools, and tried to strip teacher unions of their influence. A daughter of privilege, she also married into it her husband, Dick, who ran unsuccessfully for governor of Michigan a decade ago, is heir to the Amway fortune. Like many education philanthropists, she argues that children’s ZIP codes should not confine them to failing schools. But Ms. DeVos’s efforts to expand educational opportunity in her home state of Michigan and across the country have focused little on existing public schools, and almost entirely on establishing newer, more entrepreneurial models to compete with traditional schools for students and money. Her donations and advocacy go almost entirely toward groups seeking to move students and money away from what Mr. Trump calls “failing government schools. ” Conservative school choice activists hailed her on Wednesday as a fellow disrupter, and as someone who would block what they see as federal intrusion on local schools. Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, where Ms. DeVos helped push legislation establishing tax credits for scholarships to private schools, called her an “outstanding pick,” a “passionate change agent to press for a new education vision. ” “Her allegiance is to families, particularly those struggling at the bottom of the economic ladder, not to an outdated public education model that has failed them from one generation to the next,” he wrote on Facebook. Frederick M. Hess, the director of education policy studies for the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington, called Ms. DeVos a “smart, principled   conservative who’s experienced in politics and versed in the relevant policy. ” But to teachers’ unions, she is anathema. Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, called Ms. DeVos “the most ideological,   education nominee” since the secretary of education was elevated to the cabinet level four decades ago. Even some groups that share her support for charter schools worried that picking someone so closely identified as a champion of vouchers signaled that the Trump administration would try to starve public schools. As a candidate, Mr. Trump proposed steering $20 billion in existing federal money toward vouchers that families could use to help pay for private or parochial schools, perhaps tapping into $15 billion in   Title I money that goes to schools that serve the country’s poorest children. He called school choice “the civil rights issues of our time. ” Amber Arellano, the executive director of the Education   an advocacy group in Michigan that supports charters but has been critical of a Michigan charter school law that Ms. DeVos has spent millions to defend, said the pick had “the potential to undermine the nation’s   progress by diverting resources from the young people who most need them, or by failing to uphold the federal government’s responsibility to protecting the needs and interests of all students  —   especially the most vulnerable. ” Michigan is one of the nation’s biggest school choice laboratories, especially with charter schools. The Detroit, Flint and Grand Rapids school districts have among the nation’s 10 largest shares of students in charters, and the state sends $1 billion in education funding to charters annually. Of those schools, 80 percent are run by   organizations, a far higher share than anywhere else in the nation. The DeVoses, the most prominent name in state Republican politics, have been the biggest financial and political backers of the effort. But if Michigan is a center of school choice, it is also among the worst places to argue that choice has made schools better. As the state embraced and then expanded charters over the past two decades, its rank has fallen on national reading and math tests. Most charter schools perform below the state average. And a federal review in 2015 found “an unreasonably high” percentage of charter schools on the list of the state’s   schools. The number of charter schools on that list had doubled since 2010, after the passage of a law a group financed by Ms. DeVos pushed to expand the schools. The group blocked a provision in that law that would have prevented failing schools from expanding or replicating. Ms. DeVos, 58, got into education advocacy primarily as a backer of vouchers, and has served on the board of several organizations that have campaigned for them across the country. A ballot initiative she led to establish vouchers in Michigan failed in 2000. The next year, she established the Great Lakes Education Project, which became an ardent proponent of charter school expansion, and has donated generously to candidates who have supported it. The Michigan law pushed by Ms. DeVos to establish charter schools 20 years ago allows an unusually large number of organizations to start such schools, yet established little mechanism for oversight. Even Republican supporters of charter schools say the law has allowed failing charter schools to expand or replicate. Last spring, the   group was the chief force behind the defeat of legislation that would have established standards for identifying and closing failing schools, both charter and public, in Detroit, where a flood of charter schools in the past decade has created what even charter school supporters call chaos. Ms. DeVos was born in Western Michigan, the more conservative and religious part of the state, where her father created a successful auto parts company. Her brother is Erik Prince, the founder of Blackwater, the troubled private security contractor that was awarded billions in United States government contracts in the Middle East. Like many conservatives who supported Mr. Trump, she does not support Common Core, the set of standards for what students should know at each grade level that was developed by the National Governors Association and other groups  —   and that has been incorrectly branded as a federal policy. She also had not supported Mr. Trump her family was behind Senator Marco Rubio of Florida in the Republican presidential primary. On Wednesday, she wrote on Twitter: “I am honored to work with the   on his vision to make American education great again. The status quo in ed is not acceptable. ”",0

19663,Ex-SEAL Member Who Wrote Book on Bin Laden Raid Forfeits $6.8 Million - The New York Times,"Matt Bissonnette, a former member of Navy SEAL Team 6 who wrote an account of the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, agreed on Friday to forfeit $6. 8 million in book royalties and speaking fees and apologized for failing to clear his disclosures with the Pentagon, according to federal court documents. Mr. Bissonnette also recently forfeited $180, 000 in fees for consulting work that he did for military contractors while he was still on the SEAL team, his lawyer, Robert D. Luskin, said in an interview. If approved by a federal judge in Alexandria, Va. the royalty settlement would bring an end to more than two years of civil and criminal investigations into Mr. Bissonnette, who won several awards for valor in Iraq and Afghanistan before writing “No Easy Day,” his   book on the Bin Laden raid, under the pen name Mark Owen. The firsthand account of the daring raid was one of several   books and movies involving former Navy SEALS that has led to criticism within a community once known for discretion that Mr. Bissonnette and the others were cashing in on their exploits. The Justice Department conducted criminal investigations into whether Mr. Bissonnette had disclosed classified information in his book or speeches and whether he had violated    laws in consulting for companies that had contracts with SEAL Team 6. In the end, the department did not bring any criminal charges, settling instead for the cash forfeitures. Mr. Bissonnette said in a statement Friday that he regretted his failure to submit “No Easy Day” for vetting before it was published in 2012 so Pentagon officials could ensure that it did not include classified information. Mr. Bissonnette acknowledged that he was required under his security clearances to let the Pentagon review the book, and he blamed another lawyer for advising him that he did not need to do so. “I acknowledge my mistake and have paid a stiff price, both personally and financially, for that error,” he said. “I accept responsibility for failing to submit the book for review and apologize sincerely for my oversight. ” Documents filed in Federal District Court in Alexandria on Friday indicated that Mr. Bissonnette must transfer nearly $6. 8 million to the government as part of the settlement. The amount includes all of the $6. 7 million in royalties he has earned on “No Easy Day,” as well as $100, 000 in fees for six speeches he gave in early 2013 before the government approved the slides he used in such presentations. Mr. Bissonnette wrote in “No Easy Day” that he was one of the SEALs who shot Bin Laden, and he and Robert O’Neill, another former SEAL Team 6 member who claims his shots were the fatal ones, have competed on the lecture circuit. Military officials said that Mr. O’Neill is writing a book of his own and has asked the Pentagon to vet it. While Mr. Bissonnette’s fight with the Pentagon over his book has received public attention, some details of his consulting work while he was still a SEAL Team 6 member, as well as his fee forfeiture, have not been disclosed. Mr. Luskin said that Mr. Bissonnette and the federal authorities reached a “nonprosecution agreement” in May in which Mr. Bissonnette forfeited $180, 000 in fees for advising three equipment manufacturers who were doing business with SEAL Team 6 while he was on the team. Mr. Luskin said the fees dated back as far as 2006, when Mr. Bissonnette was the research and development representative for his squadron within Team 6. Other former SEAL members have said that his job was to figure out what types of equipment they needed. Mr. Luskin said that the $180, 000 came from   a helmet maker now owned by the Gentex Corporation in Carbondale, Pa. and two   manufacturers based in Virginia Beach  —   SS Precision and London Bridge Trading. No executives at the three companies were available for comment. Mr. Luskin said that Mr. Bissonnette and other SEAL members also received consulting fees from companies that designed tactical clothing and gear for other parts of the military or for sales to outdoor enthusiasts. Mr. Bissonnette has maintained that he cleared the consulting work in advance with a Navy lawyer, and Mr. Luskin said that helped persuade prosecutors that “there was clearly on Matt’s part no intent to breach the    laws. ” Navy officials say they have restricted such moonlighting since then. Mr. Luskin also noted that a number of   officials have assisted other authors writing about the Bin Laden raid as well as the creators of the movie “Zero Dark Thirty. ” But, he said, only Mr. Bissonnette has paid any penalties for the disclosures.",0
19664,Kim Jong-un’s Half Brother Is Reported Assassinated in Malaysia - The New York Times,"SEOUL, South Korea  —   He seemed like an ordinary passenger in the departure hall of the airport for Malaysia’s capital, awaiting a   flight to Macau. Moments later, he felt dizzy and was carried out on a stretcher, apparently dying from   punctures or perhaps a toxic liquid splashed on his face by two women who ran away. The ruckus caused by the man’s death on Monday at the international airport for Kuala Lumpur was minor news until a thunderbolt from the South Korean and Malaysian news media a day later: The victim was Kim   45, the estranged older half brother of Kim   the unpredictable and ruthless leader of North Korea. The death immediately turned into an international assassination intrigue connected to the opaque regime of the Kim family, which has ruled North Korea for more than 60 years. It came as Kim   33, who has ordered scores of subordinates executed when he questioned their fealty, has further shaken up the ranks of his closest aides, purging the chief of the secret police less than two weeks ago. In addition, Kim   has stoked a new international crisis with a ballistic missile launching and threats of more nuclear weapons tests. The South Korean news channel TV Chosun said that two women had stabbed Kim   with poisoned needles and fled in a taxi and that the local police were searching for them. The Star, a Malaysian newspaper, quoted the police as saying the victim had sought help from a departure hall receptionist after someone “grabbed him from behind and splashed liquid on his face. ” He died as medics rushed him to a hospital. Political experts on North Korea’s politics immediately speculated that Kim   had ordered the assassination of his older half sibling, who at one time had been the heir apparent and had been favored by China, the country’s ally and principal benefactor. “Maybe Kim   was about to do something drastic that would either compromise the regime or the family,” said Jae H. Ku, director of the U. S.  Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. “By the nature of things in North Korea, the fact that he is in the bloodline represented a threat. ” Others were even more emphatic in their suspicion that Kim   had been responsible, partly because Kim   had been publicly critical of the transfer of power that made Kim   the top leader after the death of their father, Kim   in 2011. “The apparent murder today of Kim   in Malaysia by agents of his brother is the latest explosive turn in Pyongyang’s vicious palace intrigue,” said Nicholas Eberstadt, a political economist who specializes in North and South Korea at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. “The question remains: Do these deadly measures secure his rule or serve to undermine it?” There also was speculation that Kim   might have ordered Kim   killed because China might have been planning to support him as a replacement for Kim   who has angered Chinese leaders with his provocative weapons and missile tests. “Kim   reportedly has been Beijing’s favorite, which may mean one day the Chinese Communist Party may overthrow Kim   and install Kim ” said Lee   a North Korea expert at Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. The Royal Malaysia Police identified the dead man as Kim Chol, an alias that South Korean officials said had been used by Kim  . A police statement said the cause of death was under investigation. In Seoul on Wednesday, Prime Minister Hwang   who is serving as acting president during the impeachment trial of President Park   called a meeting of   cabinet ministers and urged his government to work closely with the Malaysian authorities to help uncover who killed Kim  . “If he was killed by the Kim   regime, it will be an example of its cruelty and inhumaneness,” Mr. Hwang said. North Korea’s   media has said nothing about the reports. Kim   the eldest son of Kim   had been widely considered next in line to succeed him until 2001, when he was caught trying to take his son to Tokyo Disneyland with a fake visa. He was detained for several days, then deported to China. Other analysts in South Korea say Kim   fell out of the succession race after his mother, Sung   was rejected by the North Korean leader, who favored Kim  ’s mother, Ko  . Ms. Ko and Kim   had another son, Kim   who was seen at an Eric Clapton concert in London in 2015. North Korea began grooming Kim   as heir after his father  had a stroke in 2008. As his youngest brother consolidated power, Kim   lived in   abroad. Until recently, he was sometimes seen in Macau. TV Chosun said he had also been visiting Singapore and Malaysia, where he had girlfriends. Kim  ’s son, Kim   had once studied in Bosnia and later in France. In an interview with a European television channel in 2012, the son said he did not know how his uncle, Kim   “became a dictator. ” Kim   was once questioned in Macau by a reporter about the likelihood that his half brother would take over, and he seemed to accept his fate. “It is my father’s decision,” he said. “So, once he decides, we have to support. ” But at other times, he was critical of Kim  ’s ascendance. “I believe that my father originally was against the notion of a third generation succeeding him,” Kim   interviewed in November 2010, told the Japanese journalist Yoji Gomi in the book “My Father, Kim   and I. ” “There must have been some internal reasons that made him change his mind. ” Kim   also once predicted doom for his half brother’s rule while talking to reporters from Japan, North Korea’s sworn enemy. His criticism fueled speculation that China and certain generals in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, might be protecting him in case anything should go wrong with Kim  ’s rule. Mr. Gomi said in an interview on Tuesday that the last time he had contacted Kim   in January 2012, he had said North Korea should follow China’s economic path. China supported Kim   financially for many years because if Kim   died, North Koreans, indoctrinated to venerate the Kim family, would look to Kim   to step in as leader, according to Kang Chunnu, 51, a distant relative of the Kim family who lives in Britain. “Kim   is a person which China can control and the North Korean people can trust,” she said by telephone. There seemed little question in South Korea that Kim   was behind his half brother’s death. A spokesman for South Korea’s governing Liberty Korea Party, Kim   said the killing was a “naked example of Kim  ’s reign of terror. ” Since taking power, Mr. Kim has executed more than 140 senior party and military officials deemed a threat to his authority, often ordering them killed by machine guns and even flamethrowers, according to the Institute for National Security Strategy, a research group affiliated with the South’s National Intelligence Service. Thae   who was the North’s No. 2 diplomat in London until his defection to South Korea last summer, said he had fled partly because of Kim  ’s ruthlessness. In 2015, South Korean officials said that Gen. Hyon   the defense minister, had been executed with an antiaircraft gun in Pyongyang after dozing off during military events and   Mr. Kim’s orders. In August last year, they said Mr. Kim found fault with a deputy premier’s “disrespectful posture” during a meeting and had him executed by firing squad. Relatives were not spared. An uncle and the country’s No. 2 official, Jang   was executed in 2013 on charges of factionalism, corruption and sedition. Defectors from North Korea live in fear of retaliation. In 1997, Lee   a nephew of Kim  ’s mother, was shot and killed in Seoul. South Korean officials suspected that a North Korean agent killed Mr. Lee, who had become a bitter critic of the government in Pyongyang after defecting to Seoul in 1982. Cheong   a longtime researcher on the Kim family, said that the killing of Kim   could have been carried out only on the orders of Kim  . Ken E. Gause, a specialist in leadership studies at the CNA Corporation, a research group in Alexandria, Va. said the assassination also might have been meant as a warning to all North Korean expatriates. “Given the recent defections,” he said, “Kim   felt the need to show that the regime could get to anyone who may be contemplating opposing the regime. ”",0

“Es que no hace nada”, ha insistido el nuevo presidente de los Estados Unidos, que achaca el mal funcionamiento a la falta de uso. 
Según él mismo ha dicho nada más salir victorioso en las últimas elecciones americanas, tiene “mucha prisa y mucha ilusión” por asumir todas y cada una de las competencias que deberá desempeñar los próximos cuatro años. “Estoy ansioso por asumir todas mis responsabilidades, la del botón de las bombas y también las demás”, ha declarado el republicano en su discurso de agradecimiento a sus votantes. 
“Quiero ponerme a trabajar cuanto antes”, ha repetido en varias ocasiones a lo largo de su primer discurso como presidente. 
“Acabo de recibir la llamada de la secretaria Clinton. Nos ha dado la enhorabuena por la victoria, yo le he felicitado por toda la campaña y le he preguntado si su marido sabe cómo funciona el maletín, porque me lo acaban de traer y creo que está roto porque se queda igual y no responde”, ha dicho. También ha pedido “un poco de paciencia” a los americanos. 
“Paciencia, paciencia, paciencia”, ha repetido el nuevo presidente. 
El magnate no ha querido detallar por qué sabe que el botón no funciona.",0
19666,"Wells Fargo Offers Regrets, but Doesn’t Admit Misconduct - The New York Times","Wells Fargo was flowing with regrets on Friday, taking out ads in nearly a dozen newspapers saying the bank took “full responsibility” for creating sham bank accounts without its customers’ permission. The bank’s chief executive officer, John Stumpf, even called one prominent Democrat in Congress to express his willingness to assume personal responsibility for the mess. The bank fired at least 5, 300 employees and refunded millions of dollars to customers. But with its banking regulators, Wells Fargo was not as contrite. The bank agreed to pay $185 million in fines and hire an independent consultant to review its sales practices, but it was able to settle the investigation into the questionable accounts without officially admitting to any of the suspected misconduct. It was classic Wall Street. Since the financial crisis, regulators have brought dozens of cases against banks and other financial firms, hitting them with tens of billions of dollars in fines and requiring the companies to overhaul their business practices. But frequently, regulatory cases are settled without a bank having to admit doing anything wrong. Some Congressional officials and governmental watchdog groups say regulators may be too eager to extract a   fine and to settle a case quickly than to prove a bank’s guilt in court. It could take years of court battles for regulators to prove that every one of the 1. 5 million accounts that Wells said may have been unauthorized was indeed phony. “It’s very troubling,” Senator Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat and member of the Banking Committee, said in a telephone interview Friday. “Wells Fargo is saying they take responsibility, but they aren’t actually taking responsibility in the official sense. ” Mr. Merkley said he wants the leadership of the Banking Committee to hold hearings on the Wells Fargo scandal. He hopes to hear testimony not only from bank executives, but from regulators on why they agreed to the settlement terms without an admission of wrongdoing from the bank. Republican staff members of the banking committee were briefed by Wells Fargo executives on Friday. The staff is still collecting information from the bank to help committee members decide whether the scandal warrants hearings, people briefed on the matter said. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman said that while the bank readily admits that it created questionable accounts, it does not agree with other findings by its banking regulators, namely that the bank’s culture and business model fostered such behavior. “We recognize that these instances occurred, and we want to be very open about that and make sure they don’t happen again,” said Mary Eshet, the Wells Fargo spokeswoman. “But this was not part of an intentional strategy. ” Legal experts say that not admitting wrongdoing may have another benefit for Wells Fargo: helping the bank defend itself against lawsuits from aggrieved customers. “It ends up being a ”’ said Robert Hockett, a professor at Cornell Law School. “The regulator gets some kind of payment from the accused, and the accused gets to ease the risk of private plaintiff litigation by not admitting to guilt. ” Wells has already been hit with a number of lawsuits over the phony accounts. In addition to the 1. 5 million sham bank accounts that regulators say may have been opened, there were an additional 565, 000 credit card accounts that bank employees may have applied for without customer consent. In some cases, bank employees would move money from a customer’s existing deposit account to open up another one. The unauthorized account was then quickly closed, but the bank employee got credit for drumming up new business. Regulators said employees were given financial incentives to open up as many new accounts as they could, as part of a   bank culture to grow business. Much of the illegal activity took place in California, including in and around Los Angeles, where the city attorney filed a lawsuit against the bank last year over the questionable accounts. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency then joined the investigation, which broadened to encompass several other states. As part of the settlement, Wells agreed to pay $100 million to the consumer protection bureau, the largest fine ever levied by that agency. Still, the fine pales next to the   penalties that banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America paid to settle civil investigations into soured mortgage securities sold in the   to the financial crisis. “Wells is paying what amounts to a couple of parking tickets for each of the 1. 5 million accounts,” Mr. Hockett said. Regulators say that the Wells Fargo fine may look small by comparison, but that the amount of financial harm to the consumer is relatively small. Wells said that the average refund to consumers was $25. Some regulators have vowed to push more financial firms to officially own up to their misdeeds. In a speech in 2013, Mary Jo White, the chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, noted that in criminal court, judges will not accept a guilty plea unless the accused admits to the unlawful conduct. Ms. White said in the financial industry, pushing companies to officially admit to their actions was important to public accountability. “Anyone who has witnessed a guilty plea understands the power of such admissions,” Ms. White said in her speech. “It creates an unambiguous record of the conduct and demonstrates unequivocally the defendant’s responsibility for his or her acts. ” That said, there will still be times that the securities agency would settle cases without such admissions. Just this week, the S. E. C. settled a case with the investment firm Raymond James over trading commissions. The firm settled the case “without admitting or denying the findings” by the agency.",0
