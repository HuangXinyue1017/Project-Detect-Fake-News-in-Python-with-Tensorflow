17078,Delingpole: Top Physicist and Leading Republicans Urge Trump to Quit Paris Climate Agreement,"Should Donald Trump hamstring the U. S. economy, rip off the consumer, despoil the landscape, give succour to America’s enemies and promote junk science  —   all in order to keep a “seat at the table” with people who despise him and think he’s an idiot? [To some people  —   including several senior members of the Trump administration  —   the answer isn’t immediately obvious. Which is why this week both a leading U. S. scientist and a number of top Senate Republicans have had to urge the president to see sense and ignore the siren voices urging him to stay in the UN’s Paris climate agreement.  The 20 top Republicans, led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell,  . have signed a letter warning the president that remaining in Paris “would subject the United States to significant litigation risk that could   your administration’s ability to fulfill its goal of rescinding the Clean Power Plan. ” Meanwhile, the distinguished physicist Will Happer  —   long mooted as a possible Science Advisor in the Trump administration  —   has argued that staying in Paris will not only be pointless but will be a betrayal of Trump’s election promise to voters that he would pull out. Climate policy, however, poses a grave threat. Yes, those who engineered the Paris Agreement will be upset if the United States withdraws. Withdrawal will also outrage the many who profit from climate alarmism. But remaining in the Paris Agreement will not sit well with many of those who voted for Mr. Trump in part because of his campaign promises to withdraw from the agreement. These voters rightly perceived that the agreement would benefit a privileged international elite, at the expense of the common people of the United States and of the rest of the world. You might think that such interventions ought to be unnecessary. President Trump is, after all, an avowed climate skeptic who has already taken several important steps towards tackling the Green Blob, most recently by promising to eliminate “nearly $1. 6 billion in international programs aimed at promoting green energy and fighting global warming. ” Among the targets on his hit list: the United Nations’ Green Climate Fund (GCF) which hands out money for programs to adapt or mitigate global warming the Clean Technology Fund and the Strategic Climate Fund  —   saving $239 million and the Global Climate Change Initiative, saving U. S. taxpayers $362 million. But Trump is still wavering over the Paris climate agreement, which senior members of his administration, including Jared Kushner, daughter Ivanka, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson are urging him not to quit. Anyone puzzled by the fact that the former CEO of Exxon is supporting an agreement totally opposed to the company’s business model and shareholder interests really needs to read this   piece by Steve Milloy. Exxon, Milloy explains, like most Big Oil companies has effectively been hijacked by green activists. As described in George Washington University professor Jarol B. Manheim’s 2004 book “  and the    Elite: The Progressive Attack on the Corporation,”   political activists met and decided after the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 that one way back to political power was to become activist shareholders in publicly owned corporations. That is, they would exercise the rights and status of shareholders to pressure, if not, capture corporate managements so as to use corporate resources and influence to help achieve their political agenda. It has been an enormously successful strategy for the activists, especially when it comes to the controversy over climate change. Not only do many of the largest and     corporations now openly advocate for climate policies, even oil and gas companies have been pressured into pursuing policies that militate against their own products. This is one of the many disastrous side effects of the growing power of the green blob: it is stopping businesses from doing business, making everyone poorer as a result. As Milton Friedman famously wrote in 1970: “There is one and only one social responsibility of business  —   to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud. ” So businesses serve as society’s wealth generators. They are not governments, charities, or activist groups. When it comes to climate, Exxon Mobil’s job is to create wealth via production and sale of oil and gas  —   not to participate in the dubious pursuit of returning the atmosphere to   Revolution conditions. Amen, bro. Mr President  —   jobs, the economy and the American way are in peril here. Are you listening?",0
17079,Steve Jobs Told Mark Zuckerberg To Visit This Temple For A Surprising Reason,"posted by Eddie During the Indian PM, Narendra Modi’s visit to the U.S.A, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said that he had visited a temple in India during the initial days of Facebook when it was going through a tough patch. The temple which Mark mentioned was of the “Neem Karoli Baba.” Since its inception, the temple has been a magnet for tech honchos from across the globe. Mark was told about this temple by Steve Jobs –“Father of the Digital Revolution.” The temple is in the Kaichi Ashram, which is a beautiful secluded ashram located in the Kumoan hills in Uttarakhand. It was in June 1964 when the first temple was inaugurated. It is approximately 38 km from Nainital. The temples are open to everyone from 7 am to 6 pm and the temple is closed in winters for 4-5 months because it gets very cold there. Neem Karoli Baba Neem Karoli Baba was born in Akbarpur village in Uttar Pradesh. When he was 11 he was married to a brahmin girl and soon after his marriage he left his home. It is believed that by the time he was 17, he knew everything. Baba kept himself engaged in social work throughout his lifetime. Krishna das was his devotee Krishna Das(born as Jeffrey Kagel) came to India and became the devotee of Neem Karoli Baba and studied ancient Indian meditation practices. He is now devoted to singing and teaching of Kirtan. In India, he often visits Rishikesh for practicing Yoga and meditation. He was referred as the “Rockstar of Yoga” at the 2013 Grammy Awards. Julia Roberts started following Hinduism just after looking at his picture. Roberts said that her interest in Hinduism came from seeing a picture of Neem Karoli Baba. She said,” I was so drawn to this picture of a person and I did not know who he was or what he was but I felt a very strong interest.” Where did the Apple logo come from? Jobs visited India in 1974 as a hippie or what he called it a “spiritual retreat” and a philosophical quest. The Kainchi Ashram is the place where Steve got the vision to create Apple. Jobs said his visit to India was one of the experiences which he will never forget in his life. The Beatles and their Indian connection In February 1968 The Beatles traveled to Rishikesh to attend a meditation session at the ashram of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. India from the very beginning has been the land of enlightenment and divine spirituality. He knew everything It is said that his word was the last on any matter. Soon after he said smallpox will be eradicated from this world, it really vanished and a postcard was released to mark this occasion. Watch the video here",0
17080,Life: This Slightly Misinformed Woman Is Buying Up As Much Deodorant As She Can For The Next Four Years,"Email 
If his campaign is any indication, Donald Trump’s presidency will usher in drastic, regressive changes to immigration, health care, and women’s rights in America. In response, Angela Bubash, a woman who appears to be slightly misinformed about just what is likely to happen, is rushing to stockpile enough deodorant to last her the next four years. 
Well, it seems like some wires got crossed somewhere, but okay! Way to take action, Angela! 
In the days since Trump’s victory, she’s cleaned out the deodorant inventories of multiple Omaha-area grocery stores, apparently under the impression that deodorant will soon become much more difficult to acquire than it is now. With the prospect of a menacing new world looming, Angela is taking some seemingly misguided precautions and buying up all the stick, gel, roll-on, and spray deodorant she can ahead of Trump’s inauguration ceremony on January 20. 
For whatever reason, Angela is also taking to Facebook to encourage her peers to follow suit in stashing away lots of deodorant as soon as possible: 
Wow. It’s unclear how she came to the well-meaning but mistaken conclusion that it was necessary to hoard hundreds of dollars’ worth of deodorant in preparation for Trump’s first term, but it’s hard not to be impressed by how much deodorant Angela has amassed in the past few days! 
Even if she’s a little off base here, Angela is showing the importance of not being complacent in the face of tyranny, and we think that’s awesome. Stay strong, Angela. You’ll get through this.",0
17081,EPIC,"It didn’t take us long to think of a word to describe the 2016 election results. In fact, it took approximately 2 seconds. 
EPIC. 
Two weeks ago the media and their allies in the GOP establishment’s #NeverTrump movement had already made their decision. And they had their polls back up their proclamation. 
Hillary Clinton was going to win and that was that. 
According to the media and their ilk in Washington, there was nothing anyone could do to change the outcome. There was no amount of enthusiasm, no amount of energy, no amount of effort that could defeat their choice. 
Hillary Clinton would be the next President. She would go on to pass TPP, tax the hell out of America, spend us into oblivion, get us into war around the world, further corrupt our government and remain unscathed by her abundant scandals. 
So much for that . 
Turns out America has had enough. America is making a stand and that stand doesn’t include corrupt elitists like Clinton, Pelosi and whoever they had planned to take over the Senate. It doesn’t include Loretta Lynch, Director Comey and a radical leftist Supreme Court. It doesn’t include George Soros, criminal aliens and potentially dangerous Muslim Refugees. 
Nor does it include the old and tired bunch of self-proclaimed #NeverTrump conservatives who, for decades have told voters to support big government Republicans like Paul Ryan, John McCain and Mitt Romney. 
They’re all out and a new game is in town. 
Donald Trump will be the next President of the United States of America . 
It’s real. It happened. It’s a done deal. 
It gets better, though, in that Trump will go into his Presidency with a strong majority in both the House and Senate. Yeah, the same House and Senate the media said would tilt towards Democrats in this election. 
Our hats are off to the electorate for restoring faith in the system, the people and the sanity of our nation. 
Congratulations to Donald Trump and his team. A hard fought battle won, a victory well deserved. 
Now buckle up, folks. The media and their friends in Washington are going to lose their minds. It’s going to be a wild ride. AL",0
17082,Russian Attempt to Reduce Voter Turnout Backfires,"Friday, 4 November 2016 Brad, sticking it to the Ruskies 
The 2016 presidential election has been full of talk about Russian involvement. WikiLeaks released repeated batches of emails related to the Democratic Party. U.S. intelligence agencies traced the leaks to Russian hackers sanctioned by the Russian government. 
While no evidence emerged showing Russian hackers able to directly meddle with voting, hackers have been found to be electronically ""sniffing"" around election databases in multiple states. Experts speculate Russia may be planning something disruptive related to the election itself. 
This activity has left the public on edge about Russia and what its intentions are. Well, American citizens can rest easy on at least one front. 
Moscow had one plan to reduce voter turnout on Tuesday, November 8th that backfired biggly. It seems to be getting MORE people out to vote. 
Intelligence agencies recently found evidence of an extensive subliminal message campaign. Cleverly hidden in the background of internet memes about funny cats and fast food tray liners have been messages encouraging people not to vote. 
The hidden phrases include ""Vote nyet,""""Don't vote,""""No Vote,"" and ""Vote no mas."" 
The operation produced the opposite result. 
Under anonymity an U.S. agent explained, ""We are seeing unusually large turnout in all populations targeted by this campaign."" 
""We have two main theories to explain this. 
One, those reading the message don't register the negative in the statement and keep seeing the word ""Vote"". Kind of like ordering someone to not think of an elephant, and then all they can do is think of elephants. 
The second theory is that the Russians totally misread American culture. Americans harbor a deeply ingrained reaction against being told what to do. No American wants to be bullied into anything. 
As a result, the Russians are getting exactly what they didn't want, people are actually getting themselves to the polls in record numbers."" 
When Brad Johnson, one of the many who found himself inexplicably voting early, heard all of this he said, 
""Well, heck, that makes me sort of proud. I was just sticking it to the Ruskies."" Make pinkwalrus's  ",0
17083,MAG: Alex Marlow ’Most Consequential Countercultural Figure to Come Out of UC Berkeley Since Free Speech Movement’,"The following highlights come from a   profile of Breitbart News    Alexander Marlow, a graduate of University of California, Berkeley. The article, written by Scott Lucas, appears in the February issue of San Francisco magazine:[He is the most consequential countercultural figure to come out of UC Berkeley since the Free Speech Movement. And he just helped get Donald Trump elected.   …     Having recently assumed a position of almost unimaginable power in American journalism, Marlow could afford to smell the roses. Perhaps more than any other person working in media today, he has a direct line into the head of the 45th president of the United States. His most recent boss and constant adviser, Steve Bannon, stepped down as executive chairman of Breitbart in August to run Trump’s campaign and has been named senior counselor in the White House —  one of the two or three closest advisers to the most powerful man on earth. Throughout the race to become president, and in the surreal and improvised weeks after the election, Trump tweeted links to Breitbart News more often than to any other source.   …     Marlow ran [Breitbart. com] all [election] day from his laptop in “the fishbowl,” a large,   studio used for special events with seating for a small audience, until 3 a. m. when he returned to his room at the Park Lane Hotel, across from Central Park, and managed two hours of sleep before returning to the studio at 6 a. m. On the morning of November 9, he proclaimed a victory that he’d seen coming a year and a half before it happened. “You’re going to see incredible amounts of hot takes trying to make sense of the election in the coming weeks,” he said on his radio show a few hours before Hillary Clinton conceded. “They could have listened to Breitbart radio. ”   …     [Marlow is] every bit the             agitator that ’60s free speech icon Mario Savio was. Even if the world he’s busy tearing down is the one that Savio and his comrades helped to build, you could argue that Berkeley had a large hand in building Alex Marlow as well.

17084,"Intrepid Report will resume publishing on Monday, November 29","Intrepid Report will resume publishing on Monday, November 29 This year’s elections have left yours truly drained. By Bev Conover   Bev Conover 
Yes, Donald Trump, a sexual predator, a misogynist, a racist, a liar, a cheat, a con man extraordinaire, and a narcissist, who has never held public office and may not even be as rich as he claims, will, barring anything unforeseen, become president of the United States on January 20, 2017. 
Hillary Clinton may have won the popular vote but the Trump supporters gave him the necessary 270 Electoral College votes needed for victory. It was half a bloodless revolution. The other half would have been cleaning out Congress, too. 
While Hillary called half of Trump’s supporters “the deplorables,” and some undoubtedly are, all of them have had it with a government that only serves and enriches the plutocrats, and cares nothing about the rest of the people’s welfare and needs. Thus, they saw an opening to revolt and did—call it striking out blindly because they didn’t finish the job and Paul Ryan, if he hangs on to the House speakership, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are licking their chops over the prospect of all the damage they intend to cause, i.e., if Trump goes along with them. 
It remains to be seen how happy Trump’s supporters will be in a year or so if they lose their health insurance, if Medicare is cut, Social Security is privatized, there is no increase (maybe even a cut) in the federal minimum wage, the Dodd-Frank Act is overturned to let the banks go hog-wild, the wars aren’t ended and the military is further bloated, and millions of undocumented aliens are deported. And those are just the openers on Trump’s list of what he wants to do. Forget about the environment and drill, baby, drill. Global warming? He says it’s a hoax. 
All is not doom and gloom if he follows through (at the risk of winding up like John F. Kennedy) on ending globalization, repealing NAFTA, leaving the World Trade Organization (WTO), refusing to sign on to the TPP, TTIP, TISA and any other trade deals that sap the signatories’ of their nations’ sovereignty for the benefit of the corporations. 
Now is the time for all of us who realize this broken system must be replaced to put aside our petty differences and reach out to each other and organize. We all want the same things: fairness, justice, peace and a sustainable planet. We the people have the power if only we would recognize it; the plutocrats do and that’s what scares them. 
And now is the time for me to spend time with family visitors who have been very patient with me this week while I have been glued to this computer. Plus, it would be an understatement to say I need some R & R. 
As usual, I will be checking email daily, so writers may submit articles that aren’t time sensitive.

17085,"From Pauper to A-List Princess, Anna Kendrick Reveals She Was Once 'Too Poor' To Buy Shoes for Oscars","
In 2009, Anna Kendrick became a star. 
But it seems she wasn't quite prepared in terms of....anything. 
When the 31-year-old actress snagged a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for her work in “Up In The Air,” it made her an instant A-lister. 
But while promoting her new memoir, “Scrappy Little Nobody,” on the “Ellen DeGeneres” show Wednesday, Kendrick revealed that it all happened at a time when she was totally broke: 
“It was this weird combination of, like, all these great things are happening but at the same time nothing has changed.” 
She describes how she had a hard time getting together a decent outfit for the Oscars: 
“My stylist told me I had to wear the perfect shoes for an outfit, and because the movie isn't out yet, she said, 'Nobody really knows who you are. The shoe places don't want to loan you the shoes, so can you buy a pair of Louboutins?'” Image Credit: Simon & Schuster 
Kendrick laughed as she recalled being sent to New York to promote “Up In The Air” alongside George Clooney and Vera Farmiga. 
She said being broke put her in an awkward position: 
""At one point I was like, 'If we do another trip to New York can you put me up in a less nice hotel room and then I could keep some of the cash?' And they were like, 'Ew no, this is not how this works!''' Image Credit: Screenshot/ YouTube 
Kendrick's memoir covers more hilarious moments of being “too poor,” in addition to moments that will stand out to her for the rest of her life - namely her recent duet with Justin Timberlake for their new film “Trolls”: 
“It'll be, like, a career highlight for me. It was amazing watching him do his thing.” Image Credit: Screenshot/ YouTube 
“Scrappy Little Nobody” is available now at bookstores, and “Trolls” comes to theaters November 4th.

17086,Canadian Neighborhood Rots in the Shadow of an Unborn Bridge to Detroit - The New York Times,"WINDSOR, Ontario  —   It is a postapocalyptic streetscape that most Canadians associate with American cities like Detroit:   houses,   roofs, a mess of scattered shingles, peeling paint and crumbling masonry. In some abandoned homes, the only residents are skunks, raccoons, rats and feral cats. But this vision of urban blight is not in an American city  —   it is in Canada, just across the border from Detroit. This corner of Windsor, a neighborhood called Sandwich, was settled in 1783 and was once a terminal for the Underground Railroad bringing American slaves to freedom in Canada. Many of its   streets boasted majestic   houses. The area around Indian Road, built largely in the last century, was a thriving neighborhood favored by professors from an adjacent university. But now Indian Road runs through a ghost neighborhood of over 100   houses and three abandoned apartment buildings punctuated by a few, lonely occupied homes, a result of a   battle between an American businessman and Canadian governments at various levels. The businessman, Manuel Moroun, owns one of the last private road bridges linking Canada and the United States. For years, he has battled to keep the Canadian government from building a competing bridge, and has bought up houses in the area to build his own second bridge next to the current one. The fight has raged on for more than 15 years. In April, one of the many legal battles it has spawned reached the Supreme Court of Canada. The result for the neighborhood around Indian Road has been decay and the steady depletion of people. “It’s very, very quiet on this street,” said Rita Montgomery, a factory worker. Ms. Montgomery was standing on the concrete veranda of the brick bungalow she has rented for about 10 years. Across the street, a   fence surrounded an entire block of   and decayed houses, and empty lots where others had burned down. “They say he’ll fix the houses up,” she said of Mr. Moroun. “But I don’t know. ” Mr. Moroun’s Canadian Transit Company operates the    Ambassador Bridge, a hulking suspension bridge that sits between, and looms above, Indian Road and the nearby University of Windsor. At night, the bridge’s name glows neon red from towers on the shores it connects in Canada and the United States. Thanks to a constant flow of cars newly assembled on each side of the border and trucks packed with the parts used to make them, the bridge is the busiest border crossing in North America, with 6. 3 million trips last year, according to the Public Border Operators Association. But the location of the Ambassador Bridge, which Mr. Moroun bought in 1979, is not where anyone would consider putting a busy border crossing today. On the Canadian side, there is no direct expressway connection, and a lack of space means that the truck inspection for customs and immigration is miles away. It is an arrangement that suits neither Windsor’s residents nor bridge users. After years of political debate and a string of unsuccessful and messy legal challenges by Mr. Moroun (in one tussle in 2012, the businessman, then 84, and one of his executives were jailed overnight in Detroit for contempt of court) a solution is now emerging. A recently opened expressway will link to a new bridge that the Canadian government will build in an industrial area about three miles west of the Ambassador Bridge. Mr. Moroun, however, is not yet ready to back down. For 15 years or so, his Canadian Transit Company gradually acquired houses around Indian Road as part of a plan to build a   bridge beside the   Ambassador and to expand the customs and immigration plaza on the Windsor side. In anticipation, an approach to the new bridge stretches for a block behind Indian Road with unused customs booths at one end and a ramp to nowhere at the other. But any new bridge needs approval from Canada’s transport minister and the Province of Ontario, and Drew Dilkens, Windsor’s mayor, firmly opposes the idea. In a statement, Transport Canada, a federal department, said it was reviewing Mr. Moroun’s application but offered no timetable for its approval. Because the company lacks permission to build a new bridge, the city has refused demolition permits for its collection of houses and apartments. City inspectors have also ordered that the houses be kept in good repair. But the bridge company has ignored those orders, saying an obscure piece of federal law, the International Bridges and Tunnels Act, puts it above local law. “We wouldn’t be in this position  —   the condition of the houses and the nuisance there  —   we wouldn’t be in this position if we’d been allowed to tear down those homes,” said Stan Korosec, a former Ontario provincial police officer who is now the director of Canadian government relations and security for Mr. Moroun’s companies. “If we’d been allowed to do what we want to do, there would be green space there. ” The city, which has declared some of the homes to have heritage value, has resisted arguments that the houses should be demolished just because their owners let them become  . And the mayor, Mr. Dilkens, is adamant that local laws apply to Canadian Transit just like any other property owner. “I can’t figure them out and why they decided to be a bad corporate citizen,” said Mr. Dilkens, who has been the target of unsuccessful litigation by Mr. Moroun’s companies, along with the previous mayor and all of the city’s councilors. “Why would they choose a path that beats up the neighborhood?” In April, the two sides met in the Supreme Court of Canada, which is expected to rule on the city’s jurisdiction in the case this year. In the interim, Sandwich waits. Mary Ann Cuderman, a neighborhood activist who runs a bake shop in her large   house, said the growing desolation had set off an exodus of families with young children, resulting in the closing of schools, shops and a bank. “The family aspect of the community is really being whittled down,” Ms. Cuderman said. “It’s a complete loss of community. ” A block over from Indian Road on Rosedale Avenue, a   boulevard, there is no plywood on the doors and windows of houses. But as the neighborhood has been hollowed out, most of the houses have been sold to absentee landlords. The families that once dominated the street have been replaced by   tenants, often students, and many houses are poorly kept. David Fehrenbach, who has lived on the avenue for 30 years, said the bridge company’s actions had affected the whole area. “At Halloween time, people from Detroit used to come over here to these streets,” Mr. Fehrenbach said. Mr. Moroun set out “to destroy the neighborhood in order to take it over, so that’s what he’s done,” he added. “If you allow him to tear it down, he’s won. ” John Elliott, a city councilor who is descended from American slaves who escaped to Sandwich, said that while he would like some of the houses to be repaired and restored, he was open to demolishing others in exchange for efforts by Mr. Moroun’s company to do something for the community. “Take something out of the community, put something back in,” he said. “After that, we’re fine. ” In her bake shop, where an old promotional poster for the Ambassador Bridge (“The Fresh Air and Sunshine Route”) is on display, Ms. Cuderman joked that her best bet was a big lottery win. The proceeds, she said, would go toward buying the house next to Mr. Moroun’s home in an affluent Detroit suburb. “And then I’d board it up. ” She added, laughing: “I bet it wouldn’t stay boarded up for more than two days. But I could say, ‘See how the neighborhoods you’ve devastated have to live. ’”",0
17087,"At Cafe Milano, Politicians Are Served Dinner and Peace of Mind - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   As the sun was setting one recent evening, two black Chevrolet Suburbans pulled up next to Cafe Milano, the Georgetown restaurant where some of the world’s most powerful people go to be noticed but not approached. Steven T. Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, slipped out of one of the vehicles and lingered with his Secret Service detail in front of the restaurant’s wall of windows. His fiancée, the actress Louise Linton, emerged wearing a sleeveless   jumpsuit, as if this were Studio 54 by the Potomac. On the other side of the glass at this longtime   fishbowl, the mood was clear: This was dinner and a show. Every town, no matter its size, has a bar or restaurant where the powerful gather to hold court. Washington has Cafe Milano. It has been a destination for   members of media and of governments around the world since it opened in November 1992, on the same day Bill Clinton, now a Cafe Milano regular, was first elected president. It is a place where diners can enjoy relative privacy as they dine on grilled calamari and velvety burrata. It is also the exact sort of establishment that President Trump might have disparaged as a candidate, when he emphasized that his leadership would mean that the cozy bonds forged among the capital’s elite would be broken. But in recent weeks, several   members of the Trump administration have visited the restaurant to meet with journalists, socialites and even the occasional Democrat. Mr. Trump calls this city a swamp, and Cafe Milano is one of the places where members of his cabinet are learning how to swim. Franco Nuschese, the restaurant’s owner, became well known in this city for making   people feel comfortable and guarding their privacy. For this reason, he rarely gives interviews. But in a recent   in a private dining room, where one of his friends, the corporate consultant Juleanna Glover, kept close watch, Mr. Nuschese said that the Trump administration had, so far, been good for business. “There’s more wheeling and dealing,” Mr. Nuschese said. Originally from Minori, Italy, Mr. Nuschese, 56, learned the importance of discretion while managing restaurants in Las Vegas, another city where luck can change in an instant. As a policy, he will not publicly say who visits, but in an era where today’s lunch becomes tomorrow’s   gossip tidbit, news has a way of leaking quickly. The evening after Mr. Mnuchin dined at the restaurant, sipping red wine with his back to the wall, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson shared dinner and red wine in a private room with Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia. Wilbur L. Ross, the commerce secretary, has also been spotted among the tables. Reporters often call the restaurant within minutes, trying to confirm the sightings. Mr. Trump has so far not visited, but members of his Republican administration may be heading here because it is insulated from the opposition. Even in a neighborhood where local establishments are known to host Make Georgetown Great Again parties, running into angry residents of this heavily Democratic city is a reality: Just around the corner, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, was recently accosted at the Georgetown Apple store. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, said in an interview that members of the administration might be seeking out a place to relax. “I saw Rex Tillerson there one night after he had been through Senate hearings,” Mr. Gingrich said. “He wanted to go there with his family and take off his tie. ” It’s also possible, Mr. Gingrich said, that the Washington establishment’s newest arrivals are just getting the lay of the land. “Washington changes with each party,” he said. “But they say to the newcomers, ‘Do you want to go to Cafe Milano? ’” Representative Debbie Dingell, Democrat of Michigan and a longtime fixture of Washington’s social scene, suggested that bipartisan behavior can sometimes rise above the fray at this establishment. “If you have a relationship with someone,” she said, “it’s much harder to demonize them. ” If the new secretary of state feels comfortable dining observed but unbothered with a Democrat at Cafe Milano, it is because Mr. Nuschese keeps order. Along with the regular presence of Secret Service details, several men in gray suits scan the restaurant during the dinner hour, their hands clasped, watching like hawks for signs of dining discomfort, be it cold fish, interlopers or threats. (The restaurant was the target of a bomb plot to assassinate Adel   then the Saudi ambassador, in 2011.) It’s not uncommon to see one of these employees whisper in Mr. Nuschese’s ear or slip a piece of folded paper toward his lunch plate. Gauche behavior is punished. Once, after Mr. Nuschese caught a woman from a rival Italian restaurant  —   he would not publicly say which one  —   passing out business cards, he had one of his employees slip the woman one from his private stash. It read: “The management requests you leave quietly. ” Peace of mind is what Mr. Nuschese is selling. “In Washington, you need to have that level of trust among all of us,” he said. “The minute they walk inside, the door closes right there. ” Mr. Nuschese said he was annoyed by “spies” who breach the restaurant’s privacy rules: After Mr. Tillerson dined with Mr. Warner late last month, a source quickly relayed the information to The Washington Post. Still, as sightings documented by gossip columnists or in   like Politico Playbook grow more frequent, he keeps up on the coverage. “A bottle of red wine on the table?” Mr. Nuschese said, exasperated by a detail that slipped out about Mr. Tillerson’s meeting. “I was like, ‘Oh my God. ’” Mr. Nuschese’s friends say he is as much a fixture of Washington as the people he hosts. He has teamed up with vineyards in Italy to create a wine company, Capital Wines. (“A little bit pricey,” Mr. Gingrich said.) Mr. Nuschese hosted an 81st birthday lunch for Benedict XVI, the pope emeritus. He sends his friends flowers on their wedding anniversaries. And he puts on big parties. At his home in the Forest Hills neighborhood, which he bought for around $3. 5 million in 2002, he has hosted events that draw hundreds. A party that featured $50 million worth of baubles supplied by the Italian jeweler Bulgari was among the most extravagant. An oil painting of Pope John Paul II sits in his dining room, a gift from the Vatican. “He’s really human,” said Ms. Dingell, who receives anniversary flowers from him each year. Another friend, the journalist Charlie Rose, called Mr. Nuschese a “master” of creating a comfortable atmosphere. The restaurant draws both Republicans and Democrats.   members of President Barack Obama’s administration also frequented Cafe Milano  —   Valerie Jarrett is known to be a regular, and the Obamas visited several times. The CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer has covered several presidential administrations and has been coming to Cafe Milano regularly for two decades. He said the Trump team was avidly going out. “A lot of the cabinet secretaries are not just finishing the day and going home,” Mr. Blitzer said. “I think from their perspective it’s probably part of their job to go out and work their various contacts. ” When it comes to contacts, Mr. Nuschese has so many that he travels with three BlackBerrys: One is for American business, another for his ventures in Italy and the third for the Middle East. He recently opened a Cafe Milano outpost in the Four Seasons in Abu Dhabi and travels there once a month. It is, he said, a joint venture with the government. Yousef   the ambassador from the United Arab Emirates, is another frequent visitor. In an email, Mr. Otaiba said he expected Mr. Nuschese would use his Washington “recipe” to make the new restaurant a success. That recipe, according to Mr. Nuschese and those who know him, is to continue keeping his   customers comfortable. Any criticism about those relationships becoming too cozy doesn’t seem to bother him. “Obviously,” Mr. Nuschese said, “the clientele that comes, they don’t think this is a swamp. ”",0

Donald Trump ha arruinado la posibilidad de que una mujer acceda a un puesto importante en Estados Unidos y ha optado él mismo al trabajo a fin de garantizar “estabilidad, fortaleza y seriedad”. 
“Son tareas muy duras para una mujer, por eso siempre han sido hombres los que lo han llevado a cabo”, ha dicho Trump. Él mismo ha reconocido que ha hecho “todo lo posible” para hacerse con el cargo de alto nivel antes de que pudiera ocuparlo una mujer. 
“Todos tranquilos”, ha dicho al dirigirse al país, que temía tener que estar a merced de una persona que lleva vestidos y de establecer un precedente histórico que diera a entender que cualquier mujer puede acceder a cargos directivos con alto nivel de responsabilidad. 
Millones de americanos han aplaudido a Trump porque tampoco consideraban que la mujer estuviera capacitada para asumir un cometido que supone pasar muchas horas fuera de casa y alejada de su familia. 
“Hubiera tenido a muchas personas, incluso muchos hombres, haciendo lo que ella hubiera dicho”, ha insistido el empresario satisfecho con el resultado. 
A última hora, diversos medios estadounidenses también han informado de que Donald Trump ha arrebatado el trabajo a un negro.",0
17089,The Spiritual Significance of Halloween,"by Tanaaz 
Halloween is all about celebrating the cycle of death and rebirth. The leaves are dying, nature is preparing for the still of winter and the year is reaching its end. 
Death and rebirth is an important cycle that is seen in nature constantly, and it’s also something that is mirrored within us. 
We are always going through our own process of shedding, releasing and rebirthing ourselves as we travel along the journey of life. 
Halloween is a time to honor the deaths that we have all experienced throughout the year. It is a time to make peace with the things that have needed to be let go of and it is a time to celebrate the cycle of the new. 
For centuries people have celebrated Halloween and the cycle of death and rebirth. In pagan times, the ritual of Halloween was known as Samhain . 
Samhain falls on the auspicious day of 1/11 and on the night before the calendar ticks over into November, spiritual activity is at its highest. 
One of the reasons that spiritual activity is so high on this night is due to the vibrations of the date 111. If you look at number 1 as a pillar, you can see that there are two pillars on either side with a pillar in the middle. 
That middle pillar represents the veil and “being stuck” or in limbo between the two worlds. The veil between the living and the dead is also said to be thinnest due to the Sun’s position in the deep and intuitive sign of Scorpio. 
Samhain is really a celebration of darkness, but not darkness as in evil. It is more about the darkness of the unknown, the subconscious mind and the intuition. It is about the darkness of the unseen worlds and the things that we can’t really make sense of with our rational minds. 
In pagan times, important rituals were conducted on Samhain to celebrate death and to understand the darker, hidden realms of life. Through understanding the darkness, the knowledge of light also becomes stronger. 
There are many other day’s of the year where the veil between the living and the dead is believed to be thin. These are often days that carry high spiritual significance due to numerology or astrology. Samhain or Halloween is just one of the more common dates in the west. 
Because many people also celebrate Halloween, even if it is just through costumes and candy, it can still amplify spirit activity. 
Halloween is not a night to be feared however. It is a time to give just a little extra thought into the darker things that lurk within. It is a time to give just a little extra thought to any subconscious musings or intuitive hunches. 
Halloween is also a great time to honor, celebrate and remember loved ones who have crossed over. It is also a powerful time for strengthening your intuition and connection to the Divine. 
In 2016, Halloween falls just one day after the potent Scorpio New Moon which is definitely going to be amplifying all of this energy and really allowing us to explore the deeper, darker, hidden realms.",0
17090,The Case of Hongxiang and the US Pressure on China | New Eastern Outlook,"N20160922000251315.html ). We prohibit everything unless it can be demonstrated conclusively that it is to support humanitarian purposes.” In this context, the USA and China are engaged in another conflict related to coal trade between Beijing and Pyongyang. The USA is trying to stop this supply but, as the official representative of the Foreign Affairs Ministry of China Geng Shuang announced on September 28, this trade has been carried out in accordance with the regulations and resolutions, as well as the national laws and regulations of the PRC, and does not violate international law and UN resolutions on sanctions against Pyongyang, which permits the coal trade with the North. This statement was made in response to the speech of the Assistant US Secretary of State Daniel Russel who announced that the USA was working to block the loopholes the North used to obtain foreign currency. In this context, Russel noted that the North had earned 1 billion dollars from coal sales to China every year, which was a third of the total sum of North Korean exports. However, an item on the possible export of the North Korean coal was included in the UN Security Council resolution with due account for China’s opinion. While the South is trying to present the case so that the Resolution 2270 adopted by the UN Security Council in March 2016 generally prohibits the import of North Korean coal, it actually concerns a ban on the supply that provides income that could be used for the development of nuclear and missile programs. As a result, the export volume of coal to China is increasing. On September 24, the Japanese Nihon Keizai Shinbun published an article, which stated that the import volume of coal from North Korea to China sharply dropped by 38% in April 2016 when compared to the same period of the previous year, and this trend had lasted until July. However, this indicator started to grow in August having increased by 27.5% year-on-year. The overall trade volume between North Korea and China has also increased by 30%. South Korean experts believe that the restoration of imports of North Korean goods to China has taken place due to the Chinese government relaxing its level of control, which reflects their dissatisfaction with THAAD missile defense system placement on the Korean Peninsula. Thus, the attempt to dictate unilateral sanctions to Beijing has failed so far. In addition, they often emphasize that “Beijing opposes unilateral sanctions that do not help in solving the issue.” This was announced on September 15 by the Foreign Affairs Minister of China Wang Yi during a telephone conversation with his Japanese colleague Fumio Kishida. The same position was expressed on September 22 during a meeting with the special representatives of China’s and the Republic of Korea’s governments, where they discussed countermeasures in respect of the fifth nuclear test conducted by Pyongyang. The South Korean party is reported to have demanded the adoption of stricter sanctions against Pyongyang from China, including the ban of the land transportation of cargo, but China refused. The concealed disagreement was reflected in the statement made by the UN General Secretary Ban Ki-moon who expressed his dissatisfaction with the delay in the adoption of additional sanctions in response to the fifth nuclear test of the DPRK. He stated that the UN Security Council had spent too much time on it. Meanwhile, China’s attitude in respect of the sanctions against the North is quite clear. According to a report by a Senior Research Fellow of the Sejong Institute Chun Jae-hon presented at the Forum in Seoul “Korean Unification and Security Issues”, China is not willing to support the sanctions against the DPRK, which will result in the fall of the current regime and deterioration of the living standards of North Koreans. According to the speaker, the fall of Kim Jong-un regime “is fraught with unpredictable consequences,” including integration of the both Koreas under the guidance of Seoul. Beijing does not want a united Korea, that would be an ally of the USA, to appear in on its border and it will do everything possible to prevent it. In fact, the Chinese government has restricted the level of sanctions in respect of Pyongyang all the while implementing the UN resolutions and not exceeding them by imposing additional unilateral measures, as the United States or its allies do. And it will not go beyond this level under any circumstance.

17092,Sen. Joe Manchin: Trump Administration Gets It on Coal Regs - Breitbart,"West Virginia Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin III praised President Donald Trump’s reversal Tuesday of President Barack Obama’s “Clean Power Plan,” which created a regulatory regime that targeted the coal mining industry and   energy plants. [“Since I was governor, I have fought against unnecessary bureaucratic regulations that harm our way of life with no regard for the catastrophic economic impacts they have on West Virginians,” said the only Democrat to stand and applaud during the president’s joint address to Congress.  “We need to strike a balance between the environment and the economy. The Clean Power Plan never achieved that balance. Rolling back this regulation is a positive step towards preventing further job loss, increases to consumer energy bills, and more damage to our economy,” he said. “We must stop ignoring the damage these regulations caused our energy sector, our economy and our way of life in West Virginia,” the senator said. The president touched on the human side of what he called the War on Coal in his remarks Tuesday after signing the executive orders. I actually, in one case, I went to a group of miners in West Virginia  —   you remember, Shelly  —   and I said, how about this: Why don’t we get together, we’ll go to another place, and you’ll get another job you won’t mine anymore. Do you like that idea? They said, no, we don’t like that idea  —   we love to mine, that’s what we want to do. I said, if that’s what you want to do, that’s what you’re going to do. And I was very impressed. They love the job. That’s what their job is. I fully understand that. I grew up in a real estate family, and until this recent little excursion into the world of politics, I could never understand anybody who would not want to be in the world of real estate. (Laughter.) Believe me. So I understand it. And we’re with you 100 percent, and that’s what you’re going to do. Okay? The “Shelly” Trump was calling out was  Senator Shelly Moore Capito ( ) Manchin’s fellow senator from the Mountain State. Manchin said Trump gets it on coal and the effects of the last administration’s approach towards coal. “This step by the administration recognizes that the Clean Power Plan went beyond the bounds of EPA’s authority, instead of working against us and imposing   economic wounds like the last administration,” he said.",0
17093,Pope Francis Names Joseph Tobin to Lead Archdiocese of Newark - The New York Times,"NEWARK  —   In his latest move to reshape the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States, Pope Francis on Monday named a moderate known for standing up for refugees and nuns to be the next leader of the Archdiocese of Newark, a large and troubled diocese. Francis’ pick is Joseph W. Tobin, currently the archbishop of Indianapolis. He made national headlines last year when he rebuffed Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, now the Republican   nominee, by insisting that Catholic Charities continue to resettle refugees from Syria. Archbishop Tobin is so clearly in the pope’s favor that he is among 17 churchmen being made cardinals in Rome this month. The Archdiocese of Newark has never before been led by a cardinal, the rank of those entrusted to select new popes. His transfer to New Jersey places him in    proximity of the nation’s media capital, where Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan of New York is now the   spokesman on Catholic matters. At a news conference at Sacred Heart Cathedral in Newark on Monday, Archbishop Tobin said he was surprised at both of his new appointments and could not explain why the pope had tapped him for two   roles. The two men first met at a synod in Rome in 2005. “Sometimes I think that Pope Francis sees a lot more in me than I see in myself,” he said. Archbishop Tobin, whose formal title is now   is replacing Archbishop John J. Myers, a conservative who is among a small minority of American prelates who announced long ago that Catholic politicians who support abortion rights should not receive Holy Communion. Archbishop Myers’s tenure was hobbled in recent years after he failed to ensure that a priest convicted of child sexual abuse no longer had access to children. He was also widely criticized for using more than half a million dollars of church money to build an addition onto his weekend home that included three fireplaces, a whirlpool and elevator, even while he was closing schools. In September, Archbishop Myers suspended the Rev. Warren Hall from ministry, accusing the priest of “confusing the faithful” by publicly supporting some gay rights groups and a Catholic high school counselor who had been fired for marrying her female partner. Archbishop Myers exemplified the church’s “culture warrior model of leadership” while Archbishop Tobin is in sync with Francis’ emphasis on dialogue, said Michael Sean Winters, a columnist at the National Catholic Reporter, an independent   publication, and a visiting fellow at Catholic University of America’s Institute for Policy Research and Catholic Studies. At the news conference, Archbishop Tobin said he was concerned that the “    mentality” that had polarized the country had also infected the church, but that the church could help the country heal the divide after the election. He said that Cardinal Dolan had called him on Monday morning to welcome him. Asked if he anticipated that they would have a competitive relationship, Archbishop Tobin said, “If there’s any competition, I hope it’s who can serve the people of God best. ” Bishops are required to submit retirement letters to the Vatican when they turn 75, but are often kept in their posts far longer. Archbishop Myers turned 75 in July. Francis has quickly accepted his retirement, while allowing one of his most prominent American allies, the archbishop of Washington, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, to continue to serve for a year beyond his 75th birthday, in November 2015. Newark is one of the 10 largest dioceses in the country and one of the most ethnically diverse, with about 1. 5 million Catholics in 214 parishes that offer Mass in 20 languages, said Jim Goodness, a spokesman for the archdiocese. The news that Archbishop Tobin had been chosen to lead it was first reported by NJ Advance Media. Archbishop Tobin is to be formally installed in Newark on Jan. 6. He is 64, a native of Detroit and the oldest of 13 children  —   an experience that taught him, he said, that “you can’t hog the bathroom. ” He belongs to a religious order of missionaries, the Redemptorists, and served as the order’s superior general for 12 years, based in Rome. Besides English, he speaks Italian, French, Portuguese and Spanish. He was serving as the   official in the Vatican office that dealt with priests, brothers and nuns in religious orders as the Vatican conducted two investigations of American nuns over accusations that they had strayed from doctrine. While some American bishops encouraged the investigations, Archbishop Tobin was supportive of the nuns and questioned the Vatican’s intervention. Francis’ predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, transferred Archbishop Tobin to Indianapolis in 2012 before he had served his usual   term at the Vatican, a move widely seen as a consequence of his advocacy of the nuns. Francis ended the investigations and expressed appreciation for the women in a surprise meeting at the Vatican last year. “Women Religious see Archbishop Tobin as a friend and a brother and an ally,” said Sister Mary Pellegrino, president of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, which was a target of the Vatican’s investigation. “The sisters I know in the Indianapolis diocese are saddened, but the folks I know in Newark are delighting in this, and that says a lot. ”",0
17094,Putin's New Promise: 'I WILL DEFEAT THE ILLUMINATI',"The Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown that he has never been afraid of fighting several opponents on different fronts. Now, it appears that he has a new target in his sights – the Illuminati.


Vladimir Putin swears to take on the Illuminati 

It has been previously alleged that Putin, who was born and raised in the shadow of important political influence and who previously served in the notorious Russian intelligence agency, the KGB is himself a bona fide member of the New World Order. However, it seems unlikely that Putin ever became a fully-fledged member of the Illuminati. From the outset of his rise to power, Putin has made it clear that he is a Russian patriot and that his first duty will always be to his country.

To this end, Putin has been seen to actively act against the interests of those within the Illuminati if their activities conflict with the health and prosperity of the Russian nation. This has allegedly led to Jacob Rothschild calling Putin ‘a traitor to the New World Order.' In response, it has been claimed that Putin said that he would destroy the shadowy organization. It is believed that Putin has now established himself as the most dangerous opponent of the Illuminati alive today . 


Over the years, Putin has forced out some oligarchs in the pay of the Khazarian Mafia out of the country and into areas such as the City of London. It is claimed that he has done this to loosen the stranglehold that the Illuminati have held over the Russian economy and major industries since the end of the Cold War. He has also expelled all businesses operating under the Rothschild Banking Group in recent months as he believed that they were playing a positive role in the Russian financial system.

WATCH THE VIDEO: 

It has also been alleged that Putin is moving outside of the realm of domestic concerns and is also thwarting Illuminati operations on the global scale. It has been said that the Russian military’s intervention in Syria and commitment to protecting the ruling party headed by President Al-Assad has torpedoed Illuminati plans to lay a pipeline through the country which would have been operated by their agents.

17095,Trump: I Want to Put an Extra ’F’ in NAFTA for ’Free and Fair Trade’ - Breitbart,"Thursday after a meeting at the White House, President Donald Trump laid out his vision for restructuring the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Commerce Secretary desgnee Wilbur Ross and adviser Carl Icahn.

It’s been a catastrophe for our workers and our jobs and our companies. They’re leaving our country. I want to change it.

17099,"Is a Teen Depressed, or Just Moody? - The New York Times","The hardest questions pediatricians must routinely ask teenagers at checkups are those about depression and suicide. But they aren’t optional we have to ask them, every time. From 2005 to 2014, the prevalence of depression  —   that is, the chance of having a major depressive episode over the course of a year  —   increased significantly among   to    in the United States. These data come from an annual survey, the National Surveys on Drug Use and Health, in which the same structured questions are asked every year. The trend toward more depression was steeper in girls than it was in boys. Furthermore, when   to    were surveyed, there was again a significant increase in the prevalence of depression, but only among those 18 to 20. So it appears to be increasing in the population from 12 to 20. Dr. Ramin Mojtabai, a psychiatrist who is a professor in the department of mental health at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins and the first author on the study, said that there was no real increase from 2005 to 2011, but then the rise began, and got more pronounced in 2012 and 2013. Why was the prevalence of depression increasing, and why was it more intense among girls? Were adolescents actually suffering more from depression, or was it possible they were just more willing to talk about it? Dr. Mojtabai said that over the past couple of decades, teenagers have generally been more open about depression, but the researchers didn’t think that could account for the pattern they were seeing. They adjusted for the prevalence of substance abuse, and still the trend was there it wasn’t explained away by drug use or drinking. Neither could it be accounted for by looking at household composition (two parents versus one parent versus no parents). Suicide is the second leading cause of death in adolescents 15 to 19, second only to accidents, but that rate, as opposed to the incidence of depression, has actually been decreasing since the 1990s. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced last November that the suicide rate for younger children from 10 to 14 had increased to the point where the risk of dying by suicide was as high as the risk of dying in a traffic accident they were looking at 2014 data, the most recent available. Dr. Benjamin Shain, the head of the division of child and adolescent psychiatry at NorthShore University Health System, was the lead author on the American Academy of Pediatrics’ clinical report last summer on suicide and suicide attempts by adolescents. “When it comes to your child, in a sense statistics don’t matter, what matters is your particular child,” he said. “Pay attention to worry signs. ” Too often, he said, the parental impulse is to give advice or even step in and try to fix the problem. “What parents should do is mostly listen, that should be 90 percent of the conversation,” he said. The other 10 percent of the time, parents should not attempt to offer a solution, “but help the child problem solve. ” He raised concerns, in particular, about the impact of electronic media on adolescents. Dr. Mojtabai pointed out that the study was missing some information about factors like child abuse and neglect and about screens and digital devices, which some reports have associated with depressive symptoms. “There’s certainly evidence that cyberbullying may be connected to an increase in depression particularly among girls, maybe an increase in suicide,” Dr. Shain said. And this is an area, he said, where many parents feel at a loss about how to guide their children the parental impulse may be to take away the cellphone, which may make things worse for some adolescents. “They tend to find parent restriction of social media actually more traumatic than whatever the event was,” he said. “That’s how they connect to their peer group, that’s how they get their support, that’s how they have a conversation with their group you take this away and then you have a very isolated child. ” Over all, Dr. Mojtabai said, we need more information about whether there really is a trend here, and much more information about the teenagers’ lives. Still, it’s important for parents to be aware of the risks, both for children who are already struggling with mental health issues, and for those who may not yet have given their feelings a name. “A lot of children and adolescents have psychiatric problems that are not recognized by parents and they go untreated as a result,” he said. The signs of teenage depression include mood changes, like persistent sadness or irritability, and changes in level of functioning, such as school failure. They also include withdrawal from friends and family, a loss of interest in activities that had been important, and changes in eating and sleeping patterns, as well as some pretty nonspecific signs like lack of energy, trouble concentrating and unexplained aches and pains. Any parent of an adolescent has to wonder, of course, what’s the difference between “regular” adolescent mood swings and teenage behaviors and these warning signs. Parents need to ask themselves how severe the symptoms seem, and how persistent. When a child really seems to have changed, you can’t just write it off as adolescence. Dr. Shain pointed out that many of the warning signs are relatively nonspecific there could be many reasons adolescents might be hiding in their rooms, or bringing home significantly worse grades. “It could be depression, could be drugs, could be simply that their schoolwork is too hard,” he said. “The first step is sit and have a conversation with your child  —   what’s going on  —   the next step could be talk with teachers or bring your child to a counselor or psychiatrist. ” And though this increase in the prevalence of depression was not explained by substance abuse, it’s important to remember that substance abuse and depression have always gone together in adolescents those who report depression are more likely to have used drugs or alcohol. Identifying depression, of course, doesn’t solve the problem, and this is not an issue that lends itself to quick fixes, even with caring and supportive families. As the A. A. P. clinical report says: “Suicide risk can only be reduced, not eliminated, and risk factors provide no more than guidance. ” This can be a long and hard journey for teenagers and their families, but the message to parents, and to pediatricians, is that we have to keep asking the right questions.",0

17101,Maria Sharapova Claims Victory and Goes on the Offensive - The New York Times,"With her doping suspension reduced by an appeals court, Maria Sharapova will be allowed to return to professional tennis in time for next year’s French Open. The top officials for the sport’s global governing body are unlikely to be there cheering for her. Sharapova, who tested positive for meldonium this year after it was added to the list of banned substances, started a public attack on tennis’s leaders after the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled on Tuesday that her   ban should be reduced to 15 months. Although the court did not clear her of a doping offense, she said she viewed the ruling as vindication, and she sharply criticized the International Tennis Federation for its handling of the case. “I let everyone speak for a long time,” Sharapova said in an interview Tuesday afternoon. “I let everyone make assumptions and judge and say anything that they wanted to, and that’s what makes the world go round. But at the end of the day, when this is all over, I knew that I would have the final say. ” Sharapova revealed in March that she had tested positive at the Australian Open for meldonium, a drug banned as of Jan. 1. Sharapova said at the time that she was unaware of the change in the drug’s status, and she reiterated that assertion on Tuesday while faulting the tennis federation for the way it had communicated the change. Sharapova, whose handlers argued that the ban on meldonium was apparent only with a deep examination of links in emails, compared the federation’s messaging to changing the traffic patterns at an intersection without a sign. “The I. T. F. didn’t put up a ‘No Left Turn,’” she said. “A sign wasn’t even there it wasn’t even behind a tree. It was complete false advertisement. It was like it was written on a   piece of paper, folded up and glued to a tree. “If there was a sign, I’d have been, like, O. K. But through this process, there were no signs. And that was something that was obviously very evident in the C. A. S. report, that there were no signs. ” The federation declined an interview request Wednesday. The group’s director of antidoping told the appeals court that he believed the group’s notifications were “reasonable. ” Sharapova disputed that. “The delegation that the I. T. F. had with the WTA on checking what lists and emails were going out and who was actually receiving these notices  —   was it players, agents, their doctors  —   they had no system in place,” she said, adding: “That’s something that as I look to the future, I make it very clear that I don’t want this to happen to anyone else. And I will be very much involved in making sure that it doesn’t. ” Asked if the tennis federation had conceded any failure on its part, Sharapova scoffed. “They wanted to ban me for four years that was their way of conceding to me,” she said, citing the maximum penalty she could have received from the federation at its initial June hearing, before her violation was ruled unintentional. “I spent four days total in hearings listening to the head of the I. T. F. antidoping, Stuart Miller, giving two testimonies. I’m sitting there just shaking my head on how so many athletes and tennis players are in the hands of someone in his position. I really couldn’t believe it. “I was really shocked how little knowledge someone like him had, in his position. When he spoke about meldonium, he didn’t know anything about it. It didn’t strike him that it was so common that maybe more notice was appropriate for Eastern European athletes. ” When reached Wednesday morning, Miller declined to respond to Sharapova’s remarks. The federation instead issued a statement. “The I. T. F. did not try to ban Ms. Sharapova for four years, as has been claimed,” the statement said. “The I. T. F. position was that it is the Independent Tribunal’s responsibility to determine what the appropriate sanction should be. “There has been a suggestion that the I. T. F. should have given specific notice to Eastern European athletes about the use of meldonium because it was so common and widely known. In fact, it was accepted in the hearing by Ms. Sharapova that the I. T. F. did not know about the extent to which meldonium was used by athletes from any region, or that she was using it. ” Sharapova has said that she took meldonium for 10 years because of a magnesium deficiency, dizziness and a family history of diabetes. More than 300 athletes, mostly other Eastern Europeans, have tested positive for meldonium this year. “Then it was a question of ‘How is this banned when I knew it was legal, and for that amount of time? ’” Sharapova said. “I just couldn’t fathom. And then I was like: ‘How did this happen? Something that is so common  —   are you sure? I mean, my grandparents take it, and millions of people in Russia.’ In the beginning, I couldn’t believe that. ” The appeals court did not conclude, as the I. T. F. had, that her initial use of meldonium had crossed a line into performance enhancement. Several other recent bans issued by the federation have also been overturned upon appeal. “I think that makes you wonder, makes you think,” Sharapova said of the federation’s recent record in doping cases. “Six bans in a row that have been overturned: You wonder, does the I. T. F. think about it? Is that on their mind? The tribunal that they choose, that they call neutral, by no means is it neutral at all. That part of it does not make any sense. ” Sharapova said she had entrusted her longtime agent, Max Eisenbud, with monitoring changes to the list of drugs banned by the World   Agency. In the tennis federation’s inquiry, Eisenbud said his divorce had disrupted his normal   ritual of examining the list while on vacation the federation mocked his routine, asking, “Why it was necessary to take a file to the Caribbean to read by the pool?” Sharapova said the experience had only made her relationship with Eisenbud stronger, but she also said she planned to have a doctor monitor antidoping concerns for her, including advising her on a permissible substitute for meldonium. While her case was being considered by the appeals court, Russian hackers penetrated WADA’s athlete database and publicly revealed private medical information about international athletes. The hackers published documents showing that Serena Williams and others had received medical exemptions to use banned drugs. The hackers said the exemptions were proof of unfairness in antidoping protocols. Antidoping officials said that the athletes had legitimate medical reasons for using the drugs and had followed the rules. Of the athletes with medical exemptions whose records were published, about a quarter are American, although that group is not necessarily a representative sample of all international athletes. “I think everyone knows how the system works, and that didn’t show me anything except that players requested T. U. E.s and those were granted,” Sharapova said, referring to   exemptions. “The only thing I took notice of was the difference in numbers from certain countries compared to others and the number of T. U. E.s that each country had. But as far as anything the athletes were doing, they didn’t do anything wrong. ” Sharapova said she had kept herself occupied during her suspension with both physical challenges  —   yoga, distance running, spinning classes  —   and intellectual ones, like coursework at Harvard and a stint shadowing the N. B. A. ’s commissioner, Adam Silver. “From one point of view, it gave me this reassurance that life without tennis, or after tennis, is fine  —   and it’s pretty freaking amazing, too,” she said. “I’d never known what weekends felt like. Weekends are pretty cool. In a time of so much uncertainty in my life, I actually felt like I was in control of my own schedule. ” She added: “When you’re constantly playing tennis, you wonder about when you’re going to stop. In this time, I realized that I’m in control of what I do. ” Retirement had seemed like an option for Sharapova, who has struggled with injuries throughout her career, including much of the last year she played. Sharapova, who won a Wimbledon title at 17, turns 30 in April, a week before she can return to competition. She acknowledged that the travel of tennis could be a grind, saying, “I don’t miss getting on a plane to Wuhan, you know what I mean?” But she has no finish line in mind and wants to finish her career on her own terms, she said. She feels healthy and motivated. “No matter if I’m in the middle of nowhere in Asia or walking into Arthur Ashe Stadium, it’s the greatest feeling that I have,” Sharapova said. “That’s what I miss. I miss walking out onto my stage because that’s been my stage since I was a young girl. ”",0
17102,Alec Baldwin at War with Producer Over Underage Sex Scene Claims,"An   war has broken out on social media between Alec Baldwin and film producer Dana Brunetti over claims that the actor did not know actress Nikki Reed was underage when she and Baldwin filmed sex scenes for the 2006 movie Mini’s First Time. [Baldwin writes in his new book, Nevertheless, that he didn’t realize Reed was underaged until the end of filming. “When I found out, just as we finished, that she was 17, I flipped out on the producers, who had told me something different,” he writes.  Brunettti fired back at Baldwin on Twitter Tuesday, confirming that the actor “knew Reed was 16, didn’t find out AFTER filming, and did not yell at us. ” Brunettti  —   who has since produced the Twilight and 50 Shades of Grey film franchises  —   further refuted Baldwin’s claims in a interview published Wednesday morning with the Hollywood Reporter. “Of course he totally knew how old she was,” Brunetti told THR. “That’s why there’s no nudity in the movie. He knew before we even cast the movie. I think he’s been method acting Trump too much and he doesn’t know difference between fake news anymore. ” By Wednesday night, the Hollywood   were trading personal insults in what has descended into a very public,   social media war of words.

17103,"Homeland Security Chairman, “Hillary’s Mishandling of Classified Information is Treason” – TruthFeed","Homeland Security Chairman, “Hillary’s Mishandling of Classified Information is Treason” Homeland Security Chairman, “Hillary’s Mishandling of Classified Information is Treason” Breaking News By Amy Moreno November 7, 2016 
People are rotting in prison for doing a FRACTION of what Hillary has done with our nation’s secrets. 
Folks, she had her MAID printing off piles of classified emails. 
Her server, which she kept in some bathroom closet, was HACKED by at least FIVE by foreign players. 
Hillary Clinton DESTROYED 33 THOUSAND emails AFTER receiving a congressional subpoena. 
Just because she’s rich and powerful and has a rigged system saying “She’s INNOCENT” doesn’t make it so. 
Right now there are GOOD Americans rotting away in prison for doing the smallest fraction of what Hillary did. 
She’s getting away with TREASON. 
Those were the exact words expressed from the Chairman of Homeland Security said. 
From the Washington Times: 
Michael McCaul was among the first to call Hillary’s choice to carelessly have a personal server which she used for State Department business a treasonous act. 
Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, on Thursday said Hillary Clinton’s exposing sensitive information to potentially multiple hacks from foreign actors amounts to treason. 
“This is why you have security protocols — to protect classified information,” Mr. McCaul said on “Fox and Friends.” “She exposed it to our enemies, and now … our adversaries have this very sensitive information that not only jeopardizes her and national security at home, but the men and women serving overseas.” 
“In my opinion, quite frankly, it’s treason,” said Mr. McCaul, Texas Republican. 
This needs to end. 
Our system is rotten to the core.

17104,Donald Trump Hosting Chinese President Xi at Mar-a-Lago,"President Donald Trump will host the Chinese President Xi Jinping at his    estate, according to Mike Allen of Axios. [The president will host Xi in April for a political working session at Trump’s “Winter White House,” where he goes to make some of his biggest deals.  Trump extended the    invitation to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife in February, where the two couples dined with New England Patriot’s owner Robert Kraft. Trump also golfed with Abe at his golf course in Palm Beach. But according to Allen, Trump will not be golfing with the Chinese president. The two leaders will likely discuss a number of sensitive issues, including trade policies, Xi’s military buildup in the South China Sea, and the ongoing disruptions in North Korea.",0
17105,"For every argument the media make against Trump, Hillary’s worse","By ANN COULTER 13 reasons for voting for Donald Trump 
(1) Eleven years ago, Trump said on a secretly recorded tape that celebrities can do anything — even grab a woman’s p*ssy. 
Hillary, born-again Victorian virgin, campaigns with Beyonce, who performs a duet with the words “curvalicious, p*ssy served delicious.” 
Hillary is thrilled to have the support of Madonna — who has publicly offered to give blow jobs to anyone who votes for Hillary. (She’ll even remove her teeth!) 
Hillary’s campaign has deployed Miley Cyrus to canvas for her — when Cyrus is not busy inviting men in the audience to reach up and grab her p*ssy. (Here’s a video of delicate flower Miley Cyrus in action.) 
When Vernon Jordan was asked by CBS’ Mike Wallace what he talked about while golfing with Bill Clinton — aka Hillary’s husband — he answered: “P*ssy.” 
Oh, and 11 years before Teddy Kennedy ran for president as the Conscience of the Democratic Party — he killed a girl. After grabbing her p*ssy. 
(2) Trump’s a sexual predator! 
Hillary’s husband is a well-established rapist, groper and pants-dropper. She’s his fixer. 
Unlike the serial predations of her husband, leveled repeatedly throughout the decades, the timing of these 11th-hour allegations against Trump make them highly suspect. 
Recall that The New York Times spent months investigating Trump’s treatment of women earlier this year. The Newspaper of Record put its best reporters on the job, interviewed a dozen women, and the paper splashed the story on its front page. But the best the Timescould come up with was a story about Trump, as a bachelor, publicly praising a model for looking great in a bikini at his pool party. Then they dated. The horror. 
Five months later, just days before the election, there doesn’t seem to be a female Democrat who isn’t claiming to have been groped by Trump — and getting loads of fawning publicity. 
(3) Trump doesn’t give enough to charity. 
The media only counts “charitable giving” if it can be taken as a tax deduction with the IRS. When Trump spent time and money saving a Georgia family farm from foreclosure in the 1980s, for example, he didn’t get any tax write-off. 
Hillary, by contrast, was a big philanthropist because, at about the same time, she was taking a deduction for donations of Bill’s used underwear — the modern equivalent of smallpox-laden blankets. Today, the munificent Clinton Foundation spends less than 10 percent of its revenues on actual charity, using about 90 percent for salaries, offices and travel. 
(4) Several of Trump’s businesses went bankrupt. 
Trump has created or helped create hundreds of businesses. Fewer than 10 went bankrupt. Hillary had one business, Whitewater Development Corp., and it went bankrupt — after ripping off scores of ordinary Americans. Also, a dozen prominent Arkansans went to prison in connection with sleazy financial transactions involving Whitewater. 
(5) Trump University was a scam! 
Approximately 10,000 graduates of Trump University were thrilled with the program and said so in writing. But a law firm that paid Hillary and Bill Clinton $675,000 for three speeches managed to find a handful of disgruntled students to be the named plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit against it. 
Trump University was a minuscule portion of Trump’s portfolio. Whitewater was a huge part of Bill and Hillary’s get-rich-quick schemes, scamming the elderly, retirees and working-class Americans for the money-hungry Clintons. 
As described by The Washington Post, people who bought property from the Whitewater Development Corp. were required to submit a down payment, followed by monthly payments, until the entire purchase price of the property was paid off. But if buyers missed a single payment for any reason, the entire transaction would be deemed null and void, and the property, as well as all prior payments, would be forfeited to the Whitewater corporation. No foreclosure proceeding, no court hearing, no due process. 
More than half of Whitewater’s customers lost their entire investment. (See “Whitewater Repossessions; Sales Practice Benefited Clintons, Partners,” The Washington Post, April 21, 1994.) 
Though Hillary had long claimed to have nothing to do with the operation of the business, when the books were finally opened, it turned out that the monthly checks were mailed to the Whitewater Development Corp. — “care of Hillary Rodham Clinton.” (See “Records Show Wider Role for Hillary Clinton; Whitewater Papers Detail Involvement,” The Washington Post, April 21, 1994.) 
(6) We can’t allow Trump access to nuclear codes! 
Hillary is the one who is champing at the bit to go to war with Russia, which, I am reliably informed, is a nuclear power. 
At least Hillary’s adept at dealing with sensitive digital information. Huma! Quick! Are the nuclear launch codes on my Blackberry, my desktop thingy or my Facebook page? 
Compared to Hillary, we’d be safer if the nuclear codes were held by Miley Cyrus (unless she kept them in her p*ssy). 
(7) Trump’s temperament will get us into World War III. 
Hillary’s temperament drove her to push for intervention in the Libyan civil war against Moammar Gadhafi for the sole purpose of giving her a foreign policy success that could be all her own. 
Obama was skeptical. Libya was Hillary’s baby. (Sidney Blumenthal’s email to Hillary: “First, brava! This is a historic moment and you will be credited for realizing it.”) 
After Gadhafi was killed, Hillary’s temperament led her to go on TV and laughingly say, “We came. We saw. He died.” 
Unfortunately, Hillary hadn’t given the slightest thought to what would come next. What came next was: the Muslim Brotherhood, the murder of Americans in Benghazi and millions of refugees pouring into Western Europe. 
(8) Trump failed to denounce David Duke with the ferocity deemed sufficient by our media. 
No one even knows if Duke actually exists or is just a phantom produced by the media every four years to smear Republicans. 
I know that no one has ever been incited to commit murder after listening to a David Duke speech. Lots of people have been murdered by someone who’d just heard an Al Sharpton speech: seven at Freddy’s Fashion Mart in Harlem, and one Orthodox Jew, plus one Italian mistaken for a Jew, in Crown Heights. 
Hillary has not disavowed Sharpton — nor would our media be so rude as to ask. 
The mother of Ferguson thug Mike Brown, Lesley McSpadden, campaigns with Hillary — she even took the stage at the Democratic National Convention. The father of Omar Mateen, the Orlando nightclub shooter, appeared on stage behind Hillary at a rally. 
If the media won’t ask her to “disavow” the relatives of criminals and terrorists featured at her events, could they at least ask her if she approves of their parenting techniques? 
(9) Trump is a “racist” because of his plan to remove Muslim jihadists, Mexican drug dealers and rapists from our country. 
Apart from the fact that “drug dealer,” “rapist” and “jihadist” are not races, we didn’t do anything to Muslims or Mexicans, except send them billions of dollars in foreign aid. The only “racism” Americans care about is that toward black Americans. We did something to them. 
Hillary asks blacks to vote for her, then vows to bring in millions of Muslims and Mexicans to take their jobs — the ones that “Americans just won’t do.” That’s racism. 
(10) Trump “fat-shamed” Miss Universe! 
No, he didn’t — he saved her crown and she was grateful. It’s on tape. 
But more importantly, the Miss Universe in question is Alicia Machado, well-known in Venezuela as a publicity-seeking clown. 
Machado is credibly accused of: driving the getaway car in an attempted murder; threatening to kill a federal judge; and being the baby mama to drug cartel kingpin Gerardo Alvarez-Vazquez, who was on the State Department’s “Most Wanted” list under — let’s see, checking my notes — Hillary Clinton. 
Until 1975, everyone would have realized that it’s stupid to bring in single mothers with no marketable job skills, to add to the dependent class. If we did bring them in, politicians wouldn’t proudly introduce them at rallies. 
But Machado is Hillary’s model immigrant. Her only job skill is voting. Upside: Hillary gets another vote. Downside: You’ll be supporting Machado and her anchor baby for the rest of their lives, America. 
(11) Trump is challenging the very foundation of our democracy by saying elections are rigged! 
They are rigged — ask former Sen. Norm Coleman of Minnesota, whose 2008 election was provably stolen from him when more than a thousand ineligible felons voted for Al Franken in a race Coleman lost by 312 votes. (At least it wasn’t an important election: Franken provided the 60th, and deciding, vote to pass Obamacare.) 
In any event, Hillary says the election is rigged, too — by the Russkies! 
The Democrats and the media have gone full John Birch Society on us. There’s a fifth column in America — and their leader is Donald Trump!!! 
This is a marked departure from their previous cosmopolitan sangfroid about communism. We could have really used this fighting spirit during the Cold War. Instead, we got Jimmy Carter warning Americans about their “inordinate fear of communism.” 
Today, bad-ass, eye-rolling journalists are somberly announcing: “I have in my hand a list — a list of Donald Trump supporters, who are a conscious, articulate instrument of the Russian conspiracy …” 
(12) Trump is shallow, has a microscopic attention span and has not studied political issues deeply. 
On the other hand, he has a good heart, good judgment and wants the right outcome for America: limits on immigration, fair trade deals, the elimination of Wall Street tax breaks and no more pointless Middle East wars. 
Hillary doesn’t want any of these things. She is good at memorizing all her little facts, but is deeply evil. She wakes up early in the morning to make sure she does the wrong thing for America. 
(13) Trump has personal baggage. 
This election is not about Trump. It’s never been about Trump. Anyone running on his platform of putting Americans first would be torn to shreds. 
There are probably lots of bad things Trump’s done in his personal life in the past. The ruling class wants Hillary to do bad things to our country in the future.",0
17106,West Ham V Chelsea Violence Pinned On Russian Hooligans Again,"We Use Cookies: Our policy [X] West Ham V Chelsea Violence Pinned On Russian Hooligans Again October 27, 2016 - BREAKING NEWS , SPORT Share 0 Add Comment 
THE English football community has today cursed Russian hooligans for once again tarnishing the good name of English football fans, following an outbreak of violence at an EFL Cup meeting between West Ham and Chelsea last night. 
Not content with falsifying eyewitness accounts of some Euro 2016 hooliganism, Russian scumbags are dedicating their time to infiltrating sections of Premier League football club’s hardcore fanbase and making it appear as if they enjoy ‘beating the shit out of each other’. 
“Ripping up chairs, throwing punches, terrifying children and ruining their enjoyment of a football match. Yup, there can be no doubt this was an inside job by the Russians,” concluded Dave Richards, spokesperson for The Best League In The World. 
In scenes eerily similar to violence seen at Euro 2016, English football fans were minding their own business when Russian hooligans parachuted into the Olympic Stadium to cause trouble. 
“Just like the greasy Italians and Spaniards coming over here forcing our players to dive, this is another example of the morally incorruptible force of English football tradition being besmirched by things like video evidence,” Richards added. 
While no concrete evidence of Russian involvement in the fighting last night at the Olympic Stadium was found, staunch supporters of the infallible nature of the Premier League said they were under no obligation to find any.

17107,Trump’s Visa Ban May Keep Nominated Iranian Director From Attending Oscars - The New York Times,"PARIS  —   The ability of an   Iranian director to attend the Academy Awards ceremony next month has been thrown into question by President Trump’s order temporarily banning citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States. The director, Asghar Farhadi, whose film “The Salesman” is nominated in the best   film category, was not immediately available for comment. But early Saturday, Trita Parsi, director of the National Iranian American Council, based in Washington, said in a Twitter post: “Confirmed: Iran’s Asghar Farhadi won’t be let into the US to attend Oscar’s. He’s nominated for best   film. .. #MuslimBan” In a telephone interview hours later, Mr. Parsi said he had heard only second hand that Mr. Farhadi would not attend the ceremony on Feb. 26. Mr. Parsi said his intention with the message posted on Twitter was to show that under the new immigration policy announced on Friday, no Iranians would be allowed entry into the United States for 90 days. “The clarification of the law made it very clear that he can’t come, whether a green card holder or an Iranian citizen,” Mr. Parsi said of Mr. Farhadi, whose film “A Separation” won an Oscar for best   film in 2012. Mr. Parsi added that he had not meant to imply that the United States government had requested that Mr. Farhadi not come to the Oscars ceremony, but to call attention to the ban itself. “It is so stunning and shocking  —   so profoundly    —   that people have a hard time wrapping their heads around it,” Mr. Parsi said. It was unclear whether Mr. Farhadi would request an exemption to the visa ban or be granted one by the United States government. Earlier this week, one of the stars of “The Salesman,” Taraneh Alidoosti, said in a message on Twitter that she would boycott the Oscars to protest the visa ban, which she called “racist. ” The ban was not policy at the time. “I decided not to go even if I could, because it hurts me deeply to see ordinary people of my country being rejected for what might be their legal right to have access to their children abroad or to their school classes as students,” Ms. Alidoosti told The New York Times in an interview. The government of Iran approved the “The Salesman” for submission to the Academy Awards it is one of five films vying for best   film. The film tells the story of a couple in Tehran whose lives are upended when they move from one apartment to another while they are acting in an amateur production of “Death of a Salesman,” a play by Arthur Miller. In a statement, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said it was “extremely troubling” that Mr. Farhadi and the cast and crew of “The Salesman,” could be “barred from entering the country because of their religion or country of origin. ” The Academy gives an allotment of tickets to distributors and representatives of all nominated films, who are responsible for securing visas when necessary. The proposed ban has affected those connected to other films. The Iraqi director Hussein Hassan withdrew his visa application to the United States, where he was expected to attend the United States premiere of his film “Reseba  —   The Dark Wind” at the Miami Film Festival, Variety reported.",0
17108,Trump: New Steps Next Week to ’Keep Country Safe’ - Breitbart,"Friday at the White House, during a joint press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, when asked about the 9th Circuit Court ruling upholding the blocking of his executive order banning immigrants from seven   countries from entering the United States, President Donald Trump said new steps would be forthcoming next week.  Trump said, “We are going to keep our country safe. We are going to do whatever is necessary to keep our country safe. We had a decision which we think we will be very successful with. It shouldn’t have taken this much time because safety is a primary reason, one of the reasons I’m standing here today, the security of our country, the voters felt that I would give it the best security. So we’ll be doing something very rapidly, having to do with additional security for our country. You’ll be seeing that sometime next week. In addition, we will continue to go through the court process, and ultimately I have no doubt that we’ll win that particular case. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0

17110,‘I Have No Choice but to Keep Looking’ - The New York Times,"Yuko Takamatsu was somewhere in the sea off the coast of Japan. Two and a half years had passed since the tsunami, and no one had found her but no one was really looking, either, except her husband, Yasuo Takamatsu, who loved her very much. Takamatsu first searched on land, at the bank where she vanished, and along the beaches of Onagawa, and in the forests in the mountains. After two and half years, in September 2013, when he still hadn’t found her, he turned to the sea. He contacted the local dive shop, High Bridge, to ask about lessons. The dive instructor, Masayoshi Takahashi, led volunteers on dives to clean up tsunami debris along the coastline. Takahashi and his team had encountered bodies locked inside cars or drifting through the water. Takamatsu felt sure Takahashi would be the one to help him find Yuko. On the phone, he said, “Let’s just meet and talk about it. ” At the shop, he confessed his plan. “At the age of 56,” he said, “the reason I’m actually interested in learning to dive is that I’m trying to find my wife in the sea. ” Takahashi kept maps and records of Takamatsu’s searches, recording which shore and what depth. Sometimes the men searched the same region several times, because bodies and debris moved around in the currents. The shape of each search was different: circular, semicircular, a straight sweep though a current. Now and then Takamatsu had an intuition that his wife was in one part of the sea or another, and Takahashi tried to accommodate his hopes. But there were many restricted areas  —   fishing routes, places with dangerous currents  —   and Takahashi had to coordinate each dive with the coast guard and fishermen. On the first dive, Takamatsu took a boat out to sea. He was scared. The water wasn’t clear, and he knew that below the surface, there were dangers  —   he could get caught by a rope or cut by debris. A flipper might hit his head and flood his mask. The regulator might not work. He might panic. He could die of hypothermia, entanglement, the bends. For his first dive, he reached a depth of 16 feet. He had expected silence, but the ocean had a sound. Takamatsu called it chirichiri  —   the sound of hair burning or a snake hissing. Takahashi instructed him not to touch the bottom with his hands or fins because he might kick up a disorienting cloud of sand. Takamatsu kept his head down and flippers up. One day, Takamatsu visited the home of Masaaki Narita, a    manager at a   plant, who lost his    daughter, Emi, to the tsunami. She was an employee with Yuko at the Onagawa branch of 77 Bank, a regional bank based in Sendai. The women had evacuated to the bank’s roof, but the wave swept them away. Takamatsu felt sorry for Narita’s loss and offered to look for Emi in the sea, too. But Narita decided he would rather dive for the body of his daughter himself. In February 2014, Takamatsu introduced Narita to Takahashi. A heavy rain began the morning I watched Takahashi prepare Narita for a dive. It was January 2016, a warm winter, and the flowers were blooming. Narita had arrived to the shop late, in blue clogs and khaki wind pants. He stood in the corner and tucked his hands under his armpits. He looked at the floor. The room was filled with white orchids. It smelled like pine. Takahashi checked oxygen tanks and pulled wet suits off the drying rack.   in the shop read “Dive Into Your Life. ” A box stacked with diving brochures read “Onagawa, Land of Dreams. ” We drove to a beach called Takenoura, just east of Onagawa’s main port. Narita unloaded his gear. The ground was covered in cracked oyster shells, bathroom tiles, porcelain bowls. Fishing ropes hung like nooses from pine trees, and orange buoys clotted the branches. Narita hoisted the oxygen tank onto his back and wobbled. He tightened his flippers. His wife, Hiromi Narita, paced the loading dock. She climbed barrels of   oyster shells and lifted her hand to the sun like a visor. She watched all her husband’s dives because she worried about him. The ocean was dangerous, and she didn’t want to lose him, too. “If I die, throw my ashes in the sea,” he said. He walked down the boat ramp, snorkeled to deep water and made the descent. On weekends, Hiromi prepared special lunchboxes for Emi that she would deliver into the sea on Sunday. They were packed with Emi’s favorite meals, things like pork soup, Salisbury steak,   shrimp, all in special boxes that decomposed. She tossed the boxes off boat ramps, piers or rock ledges or set them gently adrift on the water. Always someplace hidden, where no one would see her. She had done this for five years. But in the year after the tsunami, when the family relocated to Ishinomaki, a city 30 minutes away, she and her husband did this every day, leaving the house at 5 in the morning to deliver lunch in Onagawa before the workday began.   minutes passed, and Narita resurfaced in the glittering water. He was alive, mouthpiece unhinged, breathing. Hiromi walked to her car and drove off. It was time to deliver rice balls and   chicken. “You will do anything for your child,” she said. Takamatsu met Yuko in 1988, when Yuko was 25 and an employee at the 77 Bank in Onagawa. Takamatsu was a soldier in Japan’s Ground   Force and his boss introduced them. They fell in love right away, Takamatsu said. He described her as gentle. He liked her smile, her modesty. She listened to classical music and painted watercolors on canvasses she showed no one but him. On Friday, March 11, 2011, the day of the tsunami, Takamatsu drove Yuko to the bank. It was on the waterfront, at Onagawa’s main port. Later that morning, he drove his    to the hospital in Ishinomaki. Takamatsu was in the entranceway of the hospital, on his way out the door, when the   earthquake hit. The shaking lasted for six minutes. Traffic lights went down. Takamatsu made his way back to Onagawa on old farming roads and listened to the radio for news of a tsunami. He received a message from the University of Sendai about his son, that he was alive, but he couldn’t reach Yuko or his daughter, a   student in Ishinomaki. Finally, at 3:21, he received a text from Yuko: “Are you O. K.? I want to go home. ” Takamatsu thought that Yuko would have evacuated to a hospital on Mount Horikiri, about 800 feet from the bank. It was high up on a hill, one of many that surrounded Onagawa, and a designated evacuation point for the town. But Takamatsu couldn’t get there. Firefighters blocked the road that led to the hospital. A house was in flames on the hillside. He had no way to reach Yuko, so he went home. She had been lost once before, he told me, on one of their first dates, when Takamatsu took her to a shrine on New Year’s Eve. He told her not to get lost in the crowd, but she did anyway, for 20 minutes, until he found her again in the flow of exiting people. He would never forget those 20 minutes. Takamatsu returned to the hospital in the morning. “I’m here to look for my wife,” he told the nurses. A hospital worker asked him to write down his name on the back of a calendar. He asked if anyone knew what happened to the bank employees. Many people in the hospital had witnessed their fate  —   their screams, their arms extended  —   but no one said anything. Finally a woman told Takamatsu that she had heard that some of the employees were wiped off the roof. She was certain they didn’t make it. “But I don’t know about Yuko,” she added. Takamatsu didn’t think she was dead. He went to every floor of the hospital, and when he couldn’t find her there, he walked to the gymnasium, the elementary school, the hotels  —   all the designated evacuation points. On this search, he ran into many friends and neighbors, and from them he learned that his daughter was safe. Still, no one had seen Yuko. It snowed the day of the tsunami. The sky was leaden, almost black, and the wind was strong between the high cliffs surrounding Onagawa Bay. The wave was expected to sweep in from the ocean at a height of 10 feet. When it first reached the shore at 3:20 p. m. it was surging as high as 45 feet. As it retreated, the buildings in town began to crack and slide under its weight. The water was so cold that survivors crawled toward the hospital but died of hypothermia on the way. Elderly victims died of the cold even after they arrived to safety. Soldiers from the Ground   Force arrived at Onagawa, and the morning after the tsunami they began poking the debris for bodies. They used long poles  —   in places the debris was 15 feet deep. They wrapped the bodies in blankets and left them on the streets until they could return to collect them. All told, 613 bodies have been identified, many elderly who were discovered entombed in their homes. Takamatsu had retired from the Ground   Force he was supposed to begin working as a bus driver that June. Until then, he searched for Yuko every day from morning till evening. Beginning in June, he searched on weekends. On one of his first searches, he made his way by foot to the bank. He traveled carefully across a field of debris. Trains lay twisted on the hillside. A car dangled from a   window. A light pole bent down 90 degrees. Seemingly only the Marine Pal, a fish market, was still standing. The police station was on its side. He stood outside the building. It was nothing now, just a frame, gutted of everything. Sometimes Takamatsu walked alongside the soldiers and listened as they spoke over  . If they announced the discovery of a body, he would walk over to them to ask what the body was wearing. Yuko was wearing black trousers and a   coat. Even though he was searching for Yuko’s body, he was always relieved when it wasn’t hers. A month after the tsunami, when the bank was cleaning its premises, someone found Yuko’s phone in the parking lot. It was a pink flip phone. Takamatsu found a text he didn’t receive, written at 3:25. “So much tsunami,” it read. From that text he knew she was alive until 3:25. He guessed the tsunami was up to her feet. When Narita heard about what happened to the bank employees, all of them swept off the roof by the tsunami, he returned home, crying. He had last seen Emi the day before, on March 10. It was his wife’s birthday, and Emi delivered a cake. Hiromi Narita was at work at the Ishinomaki Royal Hospital when the earthquake began, and she wasn’t aware there was a tsunami until the following day. Their house was washed away, so the Naritas stayed at the home of a relative. On Sunday morning, Emi’s husband traveled to Onagawa by bicycle, and the next day the Naritas traveled by car. They all looked for Emi’s body. Inside the bank they called out her name. In a corner was a single windsock, shaped like a golden carp. They found her business cards in the mud. In April, six weeks after the tsunami, a body was found floating under debris in the waters off Tsukahama Beach, on the opposite side of the port, in Goburra Bay. It belonged to Michiko Tanno, a    who worked at the bank for more than two decades. Seven or eight bodies floated nearby. Tanno’s sisters, Keiko and Reiko, told Takamatsu the news. They said the body was in good condition. “It was intact,” they said. The body of a second bank employee washed up in Onagawa, at Takenoura Beach, on Sept. 26, 2011. It was a    named Kenta Tamura. The body had been in the ocean for about seven months. Tamura’s parents, Takayuki and Hiromi, were called to identify their son at the morgue. His body was badly decomposed, so the workers laid out his clothes. “We were so discouraged and afraid to see him,” Hiromi said, “so we didn’t encourage ourselves to ask, ‘Can I see my son’s body? ’’u2009” She asked the police to run a DNA test so she could be sure it was really her son. Days later, they burned the body. She picked bones from the ashes. “Looking back,” she said, “even though we were afraid, we should have seen the body there at the morgue. ” “I understand that other families still have missing members,” Takayuki told me, “and I should tell myself I’m glad to find my son, but even though we found the body, it still feels like hell. We had hope until they found the body. ” Takamatsu worried that his wife would be next. If he did find her, he did not know what to expect. He told me about a mannequin head he found on the hillside at Takenoura Beach. For a moment, he thought it was Yuko. It was the closest he had come to finding a body. Tetsuya Takagi, a forensic pathologist at Tohoku Medical and Pharmaceutical University in Sendai, told me about the fates of bodies lost in the sea. The day of the tsunami, he was teaching in Tokyo. At the request of the Tokyo police, he traveled to Sendai and visited gymnasiums filled with bodies. Over eight days, he examined nearly 200 corpses. “If a body is taken into the ocean and disappears,” Takagi told me, “it’s hard to say what happens to it. No one ever really knows how the sea moves or flows. If a body is pulled down to a certain depth, it stays there. If it catches in fishing equipment, it might float across the Pacific and turn up in Hawaii. A body in the sea will mostly become soft as cheese, so that if you touch it, the skin falls apart. In other cases the body may become encased in a substance called grave wax that makes it turn hard like plaster. ” For grave wax to form, which can happen when the body’s fat decomposes, the body usually needs to be in a cold, wet,   environment, he explained. If a body floats, it’s not grave wax. “Decomposition may take anywhere from a few days to several years,” Takagi said. “In Onagawa, after the tsunami, it would have taken about half a year to become ‘cheese’ and a year or two for the flesh to decompose completely, so that all that’s left are bones. ” But it depends on the season, he said, and other variables, including sea animals who might eat the body. He described a body with flesh on its back but with no flesh on its stomach. “I think animals ate it,” he said. A month after the tsunami, the air and water were cold, so the bodies had only just begun to decompose. A muddy cornea here, he said, a green belly there. There were some bodies floating on the surface of the ocean, but most of the bodies were on shore. If a body was found with foam bubbling from its mouth or nose, it meant the person was still breathing underwater before dying. When we think of a tsunami, Takagi told me, we think about drowning, but people also died as a result of hypothermia or blunt trauma (they washed up missing an arm or a leg). There were burn victims, too. In Ishinomaki, a school bus floating on the surface of the wave caught fire, and a search team recovered four charred children. “Only kids,” Takagi said, “with milk teeth. ” A few years ago, a tsunami victim washed up on the shore of Ibaraki as a skeleton with clothes on and bits of tissue on its chest. Clothes float and take longer to decompose than flesh, and so sometimes bones return in the shape of a body, held together by coats, pants, gloves and sneakers. The people who lived in the mountains, where the houses were stacked atop one another, between cliffs and trees, wouldn’t have seen the tsunami coming. But those who lived in the rice fields did. In these flat areas, the tsunami traveled about four miles inland at a speed that gave hundreds of residents time to react but not escape. The supervisors at an elderly care home near the rice fields decided to put all the residents in one room. The elderly were discovered, all dead, with their medical tubes and equipment still attached. “I worked on these, too,” Takagi said. “I saw 300, 400 bodies lined up in a school gymnasium. I’m traumatized, and I will never forget. ” On a Friday morning, Takamatsu and I toured the routes he made years ago when he searched for Yuko on land. We drove on twisting seaside roads. He noted the shaggy cedar trees, the graveyard he crossed to get to the beach with the squeaking sand. There were forests of black pine and overlooks of amaranth and silver grass. After the tsunami, in the thaw of spring, he followed snowmelt on its way to the sea. At Tsukahama Beach, he showed me the dark waters along the concrete port where Michiko Tanno was found. Takamatsu was skittish and walked in a circuitous pattern. We found a pile of purple starfish stashed like cookies behind a mound of old fishnet. He dipped his fingers into a pile of rope and watched crabs scatter. I followed him up a ladder to the top of a concrete wall, about five feet high, that separated a length of dock from the ocean. He put his hands on his hips and squinted at the water. There was nothing. We went to another spot where the seafloor was sparkled with bathroom tiles popular 40 years ago, light blue and dark blue. Plates, bowls and a microwave. On one of his dives, he saw a clock stopped forever at the hour of the tsunami. Along the water, on the way back to the car, about halfway to the parking lot, Takamatsu stopped and closed his eyes. “Listen,” he said. Something like a heartbeat came from the ocean. Takamatsu took a few steps toward some construction workers near a docked boat. The sound emanated from a long burgundy tube that descended into the water. Takamatsu said the tube must be connected to the fishbowl helmet of a diver. “So what is it?” I said. “It’s the sound of breathing,” he said. Three days of training with Takahashi, the dive instructor, earned Takamatsu a beginner’s license. His sessions took place in the ocean, in the shallows. He learned how to put on his mask and how to take it off, how to adjust his buoyancy, how to do rope work, how to navigate in the shadows. He managed only a single dive a month for six months before his breathing calmed and his muscles loosened and he could finally follow Takahashi into the deep. Takamatsu went out with Takahashi’s regular dive customers  —   the ones who dove for fun. They had no idea Takamatsu was searching for a body. Each dive began with an equipment check and recheck. Takamatsu, watched by Takahashi, examined his regulator attachment,   connector, communication unit, pressure gauge, depth gauge. He always carried a flashlight. Takamatsu hoped to reach a depth of 100 feet. It took him a year to dive about 80 feet, and his deepest dive was about 85 feet. At that depth, he could stay 10 minutes. He was never alone in the sea, always with Takahashi or another diver, and every month they swam slow and quiet as manatees over the seafloor. Their flashlights illuminated dog bones and bird bones like constellations in the sand. “What did you see?” I asked. “All the things in a person’s life,” Takamatsu said. In December 2013, Takamatsu spent an hour each day reading a   textbook to earn the national diving certification that would allow him to move debris and search for bodies. He passed the exam in February 2014. For months, he dove with Takahashi’s volunteer groups to remove debris off the northern coastline. He retrieved small items like fishing ropes, and once he found a tire and made a knot on a rope so volunteers on the surface could pull it onto a boat. After six months, Takahashi started to give Takamatsu lessons he wouldn’t normally give: how to find and retrieve bodies from the ocean, living or dead. Takamatsu learned the way colors shifted at different depths, because it would help him locate a body that had sunk. On sunny days, he descended through shades of blue, and in storms, shades of brown. He learned that the bodies of drowned people are usually found poised with buttocks high, hands and feet dangling. The corpses of scuba divers are like dead bugs, on their backs, hands and feet floating. By this January, Takamatsu had been on 110 dives, each lasting 40 to 50 minutes. He was not just looking for the body he was also searching for a wallet, clothes or jewelry  —   anything that might identify his wife after five years in the ocean. “I expected it to be difficult,” Takamatsu said, “and I’ve found it quite difficult, but it is the only thing I can do. I have no choice but to keep looking for her. I feel closest to her in the ocean. ” I thought of the song that a French composer named Sylvain Guinet composed for Takamatsu after he learned of his loss. The title is “Yuko Takamatsu. ” Takamatsu listened to the song, a piano solo, when he shopped online, ironed his clothes, drove his car and as he fell asleep. I asked him if the song brought back memories of Yuko. “It does not bring back memories,” he said. “Because it is not something that I forget. ” We often think of searching as a kind of movement, a forward motion through time, but maybe it can also be the opposite, a suspension of time and memory. Heidegger wrote of a metaphoric pain, calling it the “joining of the rift. ” It’s this rift, he said, that holds together things that have been torn apart, to perhaps create a new space where joy and sadness can find communion. This is the space I believed Takamatsu found beneath the sea, where he could feel close to his wife, in the rift between “missing” and “deceased. ” There was one survivor from the bank. The day of the tsunami, fishermen found him, tangled in debris, drifting in and out of consciousness. A month later, the families organized a meeting with the bank, and everyone hoped to speak with him. They wanted to know why the employees evacuated to the roof and not the hospital. They wanted to learn any details they could about their loved ones. But the meeting ended before they could speak with the survivor. “Everyone was quite confused,” Takamatsu said. “We thought we would see him again. ” The bank would schedule a meeting, but the survivor always canceled. The following year, Takamatsu received a letter from the bank. It was a formal invitation to a memorial service. “We had nothing to talk to them about anymore,” Takamatsu said. At that point, he and the other families discussed filing a lawsuit. 77 Bank was the largest employer in the region, and no one wanted to sue, but they needed to know what happened. Keiko and Reiko Tanno, the sisters of Michiko, joined some of the families in the suit, with their elderly mother as the legal plaintiff. “Everyone assumed they died when they were trying to evacuate on the staircase,” Keiko said. “They didn’t mention that they were on the roof waiting to die. ” The trial began in February 2014 in Sendai, and the district court ruled in favor of the bank, concluding that its evacuation plan was reasonable. In April 2015, the families’ lawsuit failed on appeal. By then, though, they had finally been able to hear the survivor tell his story in court. In January, I met Keiko and Reiko at the bank memorial outside the hospital. We sat outside in the snow around a foldout table stacked with court transcriptions. Keiko told me the survivor’s story as she remembered hearing him tell it in court. At 2:46, there was an earthquake, she said. The manager of the bank in Onagawa was out of the building when it happened. (His name and the survivor’s have been kept secret by the bank.) He returned at 2:55. The employees were fixing things. He told them about the tsunami warning. Two customers fled. He told everyone to lock up and put documents into a safety box. The survivor and Kenta locked the front door and unlocked the door to the roof. It wasn’t easy to open. The manager called the bank headquarters in Sendai to notify them about where they were going. He didn’t consult with anyone about where to evacuate, and no one doubted his commands about going to the roof. One employee asked to leave. “I want to go home,” she said. “I’m worried about my children. ” The tide was being sucked out to sea. She knew it was not safe to leave, but she wanted to try to get to her children. When she stepped outside, it was 3:05, and the tsunami sirens were already wailing. She lived. At 3:10, the remaining employees climbed to the roof. They brought a radio. The tsunami was expected to reach a height of 10 feet, and the roof was 30 feet. It would arrive at 3:30. They had time. A few men went back downstairs to get coats. It was cold and snowing. By 3:15, all 13 employees were on the roof. Everyone seemed calm. They made phone calls and wrote to their families. Yuko wrote to Takamatsu. Michiko wrote to her sisters: “I’m safe. ” The bank manager told the survivor and Kenta to listen to the radio and monitor the sea. There was a building between the bank and the water, so the men walked to the edge of the roof and watched the bay. Kenta noticed that the hospital on the mountain was crowded with evacuees. People were standing on top of cars in the parking lot, watching for the wave. He talked to the survivor about the hospital and wondered if they should go there. They agreed that they still had time to run. Everyone seemed calm. They decided to stay. The survivor saw the ships near the fish market move suddenly over the water. The bank was built on a floodplain over the ocean, and water swelled up from below. It cracked the earth and spread through the streets. Shortly after 3:30, the wave came. It was low at first and rushed past the building, but then the water level rose, gradually at first and then quickly, to about 65 feet from 19 feet. It took five minutes for the ocean to flood the first floor. The manager commanded everyone to the highest point, a small electrical room with a   vertical ladder. He was the last to climb, and when he stepped up, the building was already underwater. Masaaki Narita wore Mickey Mouse slippers, jeans and a sweater vest patterned with reindeer. We were in his new home in Ishinomaki. He rubbed his back and sighed. He said diving caused him back pain. At the shore dive earlier that day, he wore eight kilograms of weight so that he wouldn’t float. “I’m grateful my husband is diving,” Hiromi, his wife, said, “because I can see how deeply he loved my daughter. He’s still in training, so he doesn’t talk much about what he sees, but when he comes home, he looks good even though he’s tired. I think it’s a good process for him because he can feel closer to his daughter. Even if we can find some of her things, I’m sure it’s going to lead us to a clue of where we should look next. ” In the living room were two shrines to their daughter. Hiromi sat on the floor by the coffee table and faced a   portrait of Emi. “So we can still have her live in the middle of us,” she said. The portrait was based on a photograph of her and her future husband at Disneyland seven years ago. Emi’s husband lived with them for a year after the tsunami, but they knew they couldn’t keep him forever they told him he should move on with his life and find another wife. “I can’t think that this was her doom,” Hiromi said. “If it was inevitable, then at least we would have sent her off on a warm bed. She wasn’t born to stay in the cold water. I have the feeling she might be saying, ‘Why did you let me be born?’ Of course, my daughter would have never thought her life would have ended the next day. We take it for granted that tomorrow comes. I just wonder what she was thinking as she fell asleep the night before. ” Hiromi covered her face with her hands. “She was my only child,” she said. “She was with me all the time ever since she was born. The last five years I still cannot believe she is not with me anymore. ” She would have been 31 this year. “You have to live longer than your parents,” she told me. “I tell that to everyone who is as young as my daughter. ” Hiromi’s mother, Emi’s grandmother, joined us in the living room. She cooked the food that Hiromi took to the sea. She wore a green apron patterned with flowers and had a thick head of curly gray hair. She sat on the chair beside us. “Actually,” Hiromi said, gesturing to the grandmother, “she asked if I wanted to join her in suicide a few times after my daughter was gone. ” The grandmother looked at me and nodded. “I don’t really want to live anymore, but I just couldn’t do it, because if we are gone, my husband will be alone. ” “Does he know?” I asked. “We told him later,” she said. Emi had been living in a   apartment two minutes away from her parents. All the floors were muddy after the tsunami, but the Naritas recovered most of her things. They found a photo album filled with photographs of Emi that Emi had wanted to show at her wedding reception, which had been delayed instead, Hiromi used them at Emi’s funeral. They never found Emi’s cellphone. Hiromi didn’t want to close her daughter’s account, so she wrote a letter to the carrier and asked to keep it open because it was the only way she could communicate with her daughter. The phone company came to the house with a new phone  —   same number and address  —   as an offering to the family. Hiromi added the cellphone to the shrine. Emi’s friends text her on her birthday. Hiromi texts her every day. I’m sorry, she writes. I’m sorry. Masaaki disappeared into his bedroom. Hiromi and the grandmother wept. “We need cake,” Hiromi said. The grandmother hurried to the kitchen and returned with cake. Chocolate, strawberry, chestnut. Masaaki was alone in the darkness of his bedroom. The women ate cake and Hiromi told me a story about her daughter’s hair. Because Emi was missing, they didn’t have anything to put in the grave. She wanted something. So she pulled some of Emi’s hair out of the drain and buried it. On Jan. 11, in the afternoon, Takamatsu, wearing a silver tracksuit and   white sneakers, came to watch a body hunt conducted by the coast guard. The tracksuit glimmered like tinfoil. Narita wore a puffy jacket with a fur hood and small dark sunglasses. Keiko and Reiko, the sisters, arrived with food  —   steaming rice balls stuffed with oysters and sour plums. The search was Narita’s idea. Every now and then, he asked the Japan Coast Guard to conduct an official search for his daughter’s body. He had asked them to search in May, and in October, and again in January. The government let Narita decide where. On this day, Narita chose a shipping route that belonged to the government, because it was a place he would never be able to dive himself. Not many people came to watch the search  —   only the families of the bank victims and Takahashi  —   and a few local residents. Members of the Japanese press outnumbered spectators. The   divers arrived by sea. There were seven, dressed in bright    dive suits and thick yellow helmets. The men would dive for an hour, tracing a length of rope dropped in the water. On the way, they would record what they saw for Narita and Takamatsu. They docked and hopped ashore. They were militaristic and ceremonial. Everyone was quiet. They stood in a line, saluted their commander. After a brief speech, they saluted the families and drove the boat 20 meters from the dock. Hiromi poured coffee in the ocean for Emi, and everyone took a photograph. She walked over to me and pointed out to sea. “Today I served Salisbury steak,” she said. “Emi’s favorite. ” We waited an hour before the divers resurfaced. One by one, they climbed belly first onto the boat ramp and came back to shore. The dive commander briefed the families. “We found nothing,” he said. Narita nodded and wiped his nose. Takamatsu was very still. “Nothing that didn’t already belong in the sea,” the dive commander continued. “The soda cans are all new. But do you want to see the photos anyway?” “Yes,” Narita said. The underwater images played on a laptop computer in the back of a van. Narita and Takamatsu leaned forward to look inside. The commander talked about the way the water felt. Here is a section of a building, he said, and part of a clock. Here is a Coke can. Takamatsu walked quickly away from the crowd. He stayed close to the sea, and I tried to catch up with him. He started searching again. He stepped onto a pile of rocks, put his hands on his knees and stared down into the sea. The search for love, the search  —   his, hers, everyone’s  —   is not for a needle in a haystack, nor a fish in the sea. It’s for a specific person on earth. The world never looks as big as when someone is lost.",0
17111,"Another Mass Grave Dug by ISIS in Iraq, and a Ghastly Ritual Renewed - The New York Times","HAMAM   Iraq  —   The battle was over in Hamam   Iraq, an old spa resort town that the country’s security forces had wrested from the Islamic State a few days ago, but one Iraqi soldier was still on a very personal mission. The soldier, Zaman Mijwal, was looking for his older brother, Munther, a former policeman he described as “a quiet man, a poor man,” who lived in a nearby village but hadn’t been heard from in weeks. Mr. Mijwal’s circuit had taken him to a stretch of road flanked by two dirt fields. He pointed to one side, where decaying, headless corpses were lying in heaps of trash on a barren plot of land that had once been a shooting range for the Iraqi Army. “He may be there,” he said. He pointed to the other side of the road, just an expanse of earth that looked freshly moved. “Or he may be there. ” With every mile of territory the Iraqi security forces retake from the Islamic State, it seems another mass grave is uncovered. It has become nearly ritual, and despairingly regular. The legacy of the mass grave in Iraq is long, stretching back further than the Islamic State to the times of Saddam Hussein’s   killings. It is the horrible symbol of what has been for decades a   constant of Iraqi life: the disappearance of loved ones into the machinery of despotism. For Iraqis, the Islamic State, for which the mass grave is as much a part of the group’s infrastructure as makeshift prisons and slaveholding houses, is just a new form of tyranny with direct links to Mr. Hussein’s regime. Many former Baathist officers from Mr. Hussein’s security forces populate the top ranks of the Islamic State, mimicking the former dictator’s tactics. Lately, with the Islamic State under pressure from Iraqi security forces, the group’s cruelty has gone into overdrive: Many of the mass graves recently uncovered, the biggest of which was in Hamam   contain the bodies of local men. Most of the buried were former members of the security forces who were executed only in recent weeks, after the campaign for Mosul began. There are those, like Jamal Abul Younis, who count themselves as lucky. Mr. Younis is a former policeman from Hamam   who was also marked for execution, but survived by hiding in a hole in the ground, obscured by an air cooler, in his   house. Of his time hiding out, he said, “Each one hour was like one year. ” He is now one of just a few surviving witnesses to the Islamic State’s killings in Hamam  . One evening around 8 p. m. several weeks ago, he said, he watched from his rooftop as eight minibuses drove toward the area where the mass grave was discovered, and he heard gunshot after gunshot. “I saw Daesh bury 200 bodies over here,” he said, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS or ISIL. (The official government estimate is that roughly 100 people were killed in Hamam  . But Human Rights Watch, after carrying out its own investigation, believes that at least 300 were killed there.) In the days before the killings, he said, Islamic State militants herded hundreds of people  —   perhaps thousands  —   from nearby villages and took them to Hamam   using them as human shields against the possibility of American airstrikes. In the city, he said, the militants gathered the people, reciting verses of the Quran and praying to God to protect them from Iraq’s Shiite militias and army. Then they separated out the former policemen, many of whom, after the Islamic State conquered their lands more than two years ago, repented for their service and made peace with their new rulers. Now, as government forces waged an offensive to reclaim these territories, the Islamic State saw them as potential spies, or a fifth column preparing to rise up and join the security forces, and ordered them killed. “I cannot believe I am still alive,” Mr. Younis said. For Iraqis, the pain of not knowing can be the worst of all. The International Commission on Missing Persons, a   organization, has estimated that up to a million Iraqis have gone missing in recent history. That encompasses the war between Iran and Iraq, the mass killings ordered by Mr. Hussein after a Shiite uprising in 1991, the Iraqi government’s Anfal   strikes against the Kurds in the late 1980s, and the more recent sectarian civil war of the last decade. The commission noted on its website that there are “millions of relatives of the missing in Iraq who struggle with the uncertainty surrounding the fate of a loved one. ” Go anywhere in Iraq, especially in the south where Shiites dominate, and knock on almost any door, and you will hear a story of a lost loved one and, improbably, of a remaining shard of hope. Nihad Jawad, a teacher from the southern city of Hilla, said that one night in 1991, her brother left home and was never heard from again. She has heard all sorts of rumors  —   that he was seen being apprehended by the military, that he was shot. “We searched everywhere for him, and we have found nothing,” she said. “We still have hope that he is still held in one of the secret prisons. ” The Islamic State’s brutality has written a new chapter in that dark history. The number of bodies has overwhelmed the capacity of the Iraqi government, and very few of them are ever identified by DNA testing. In Diyala Province, where the Islamic State was once strong, a father who lost his son about two years ago said he scours jihadist websites for videos that might show his missing child. He rushes to the scene of every mass grave uncovered in the province. “The most difficult thing is when my grandson asks me about his father,” said the man, who gave his name as Abu Marwan. “I answer, ‘He is on a trip and will return one day. ’” Mr. Mijwal, the soldier, like millions of others here who have endured the same painful ritual, has found no answers about what happened to his brother. “We have no information about him,” he said. “So I came here. It’s very difficult for me. I don’t know his destiny, his fate. At the very least, I need to find his body. This is the important thing for us. So we can have a funeral. ” He added, “Thousands of people don’t know the fate of their loved ones. ” There is a   Iraqi novel called “Saddam City,” by Mahmoud Saeed, in which the protagonist disappears into one of the old Hussein regime’s many prisons, leaving his loved ones scrambling for information. In the novel, pondering his own fate as a prisoner, he recalls “the futility of trying to help a neighbor find her husband, who had disappeared. ” They visited a hospital, where “we were no more than the latest link in a long chain of people who visited hospitals inquiring about missing loved ones. ” A few pages later, Mr. Saeed wrote, “Events like this happened routinely. ” Just up the road from the Hamam   killing grounds where Mr. Mijwal searched for his brother, others were looking for answers, too. A former policeman named Muneer Muhammed, 37, said that he hid on the night of the killings, but that his brother, Anmar, another former policeman, was among the hundreds rounded up. “They took the former policemen because they were afraid they would rise up,” he said. Tears were streaming down his cheeks. “I’m crying because I was able to save myself, but I couldn’t save him,” he said.",0
17112,Why Is the Foreign Policy Establishment Spoiling for More War? Look at Their Donors.,"Written by Dennis J. Kucinich Wednesday October 26, 2016 Washington, DC, may be the only place in the world where people openly flaunt their pseudo-intellectuality by banding together, declaring themselves “think tanks,” and raising money from external interests, including foreign governments, to compile reports that advance policies inimical to the real-life concerns of the American people. As a former member of the House of Representatives, I remember 16 years of congressional hearings where pedigreed experts came to advocate wars in testimony based on circular, rococo thinking devoid of depth, reality, and truth. I remember other hearings where the Pentagon was unable to reconcile over $1 trillion in accounts, lost track of $12 billion in cash sent to Iraq, and rigged a missile-defense test so that an interceptor could easily home in on a target. War is first and foremost a profitable racket. How else to explain that in the past 15 years this city’s so called bipartisan foreign policy elite has promoted wars in Iraq and Libya, and interventions in Syria and Yemen, which have opened Pandora’s Box to a trusting world, to the tune of trillions of dollars, a windfall for military contractors. DC’s think “tanks” should rightly be included in the taxonomy of armored war vehicles and not as gathering places for refugees from academia. According to the front page of this past Friday’s Washington Post, the bipartisan foreign-policy elite recommends the next president show less restraint than President Obama. Acting at the urging of “liberal” hawks brandishing humanitarian intervention, read war, the Obama administration attacked Libya along with allied powers working through NATO. The think tankers fell in line with the Iraq invasion. Not being in the tank, I did my own analysis of the call for war in October of 2002, based on readily accessible information, and easily concluded that there was no justification for war. I distributed it widely in Congress and led 125 Democrats in voting against the Iraq war resolution. There was no money to be made from a conclusion that war was uncalled for, so, against millions protesting in the United States and worldwide, our government launched into an abyss, with a lot of armchair generals waving combat pennants. The marching band and chowder society of DC think tanks learned nothing from the Iraq and Libya experience. The only winners were arms dealers, oil companies, and jihadists. Immediately after the fall of Libya, the black flag of Al Queda was raised over a municipal building in Benghazi, Qaddafi’s murder was soon to follow, with Secretary Clinton quipping with a laugh, “We came, we saw, he died.” President Obama apparently learned from this misadventure, but not the Washington policy establishment, which is spoiling for more war. The self-identified liberal Center for American Progress (CAP) is now calling for Syria to be bombed, and estimates America’s current military adventures will be tidied up by 2025, a tardy twist on “mission accomplished.” CAP, according to a report in The Nation , has received funding from war contractors Lockheed Martin and Boeing, who make the bombers that CAP wants to rain hellfire on Syria. The Brookings Institute has taken tens of millions from foreign governments , notably Qatar, a key player in the military campaign to oust Assad. Retired four-star Marine general John Allen is now a Brookings senior fellow . Charles Lister is a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute , which has received funding from Saudi Arabia , the major financial force providing billions in arms to upend Assad and install a Sunni caliphate stretching across Iraq and Syria. Foreign-government money is driving our foreign policy. As the drumbeat for an expanded war gets louder, Allen and Lister jointly signed an op-ed in the Sunday Washington Post, calling for an attack on Syria. The Brookings Institute, in a report to Congress , admitted it received $250,000 from the US Central Command, Centcom, where General Allen shared leadership duties with General David Petraeus. Pentagon money to think tanks that endorse war? This is academic integrity, DC-style. And why is Central Command, as well as the Food and Drug Administration, the US Department of transportation, and the US Department of Health and Human Services giving money to Brookings?Former secretary of state Madeleine Albright, who famously told Colin Powell , “What’s the point of having this superb military you’re always talking about if we can’t use it,” predictably says of this current moment , “We do think there needs to be more American action.” A former Bush administration top adviser is also calling for the United States to launch a cruise missile attack on Syria. The American people are fed up with war, but a concerted effort is being made through fearmongering, propaganda, and lies to prepare our country for a dangerous confrontation with Russia in Syria. The demonization of Russia is a calculated plan to resurrect a raison d’être for stone-cold warriors trying to escape from the dustbin of history by evoking the specter of Russian world domination. It’s infectious. Earlier this year the BBC broadcast a fictional show that contemplated WWIII, beginning with a Russian invasion of Latvia (where 26 percent of the population is ethnic Russian and 34 percent of Latvians speak Russian at home). The imaginary WWIII scenario conjures Russia’s targeting London for a nuclear strike. No wonder that by the summer of 2016 a poll showed two-thirds of UK citizens approved the new British PM’s launching a nuclear strike in retaliation. So much for learning the lessons detailed in the Chilcot report. As this year’s presidential election comes to a conclusion, the Washington ideologues are regurgitating the same bipartisan consensus that has kept America at war since 9/11 and made the world a decidedly more dangerous place. The DC think tanks provide cover for the political establishment, a political safety net, with a fictive analytical framework providing a moral rationale for intervention, capitol casuistry. I’m fed up with the DC policy elite who cash in on war while presenting themselves as experts, at the cost of other people’s lives, our national fortune, and the sacred honor of our country. Any report advocating war that comes from any alleged think tank ought to be accompanied by a list of the think tank’s sponsors and donors and a statement of the lobbying connections of the report’s authors. It is our patriotic duty to expose why the DC foreign-policy establishment and its sponsors have not learned from their failures and instead are repeating them, with the acquiescence of the political class and sleepwalkers with press passes. It is also time for a new peace movement in America, one that includes progressives and libertarians alike, both in and out of Congress, to organize on campuses, in cities, and towns across America, to serve as an effective counterbalance to the Demuplican war party, its think tanks, and its media cheerleaders. The work begins now, not after the Inauguration. We must not accept war as inevitable, and those leaders who would lead us in that direction, whether in Congress or the White House, must face visible opposition.

17113,"86,000 People Kinda Used To Boiling Water At This Stage","0 Add Comment 
“IT’S just part of the day,” confirmed Roscommon man Seamus O’Gravan, clicking on his kettle for the 8th time today. 
“To be honest, I’m not sure I’d drink water from the tap at this stage. You see people on telly filling a glass from the tap and drinking it and I want to shout ‘yuck, put that fucking poison down!’… you forget that other people don’t have to boil their water, you know?” 
WWN are speaking to one of the 86,000 and rising people who are currently under a ‘boil water’ notice, an increase of over double from last year’s 40,000 people living in an area where the water has been deemed unfit for human consumption. 
While Irish Water continue to work hard on whether or not they’re going to get paid, homes across the country continue to receive a supply of water that is above the acceptable EPA levels of pesticides and contaminants, forcing thousands of homes to boil their water before they consume it. 
But as we found out, these homes have long since given up any hope of the government sorting out the problem, and have ‘kinda gotten used to it’. 
“It’s sort of like being on holiday, you know the way you’re not supposed to drink from the tap in Lanzarote?” said O’Gravan, enjoying a nice scalding glass of Mi-Wadi. 
“It’s sort of like that, except you’re in Roscommon”.",0
17114,"South Africa, a Nation With Sharp Inequality, Considers a Minimum Wage - The New York Times","KHAYELITSHA, South Africa  —   He works in AIDS prevention and his wife gets the occasional gig at a local supermarket. But neither job is regular enough for a “proper home,” Zwai Lugogo says, so his family lives in a shack here in Cape Town’s largest black township, making do with thin walls of painted metal. Many of his neighbors  —   housekeepers, factory workers, nurse’s aides  —   are in the same predicament, working hard at jobs available to black South Africans, but barely scraping by. “That money that we’re getting from work is just not enough to be able to take care of our families,” said Mr. Lugogo, 34, as neighborhood children, including his    son, ran around their narrow street recently. “We need an intervention. ” South Africa is now considering one. Faced with rising discontent over the economy among black voters, the government is weighing something more common in developed economies: a national minimum wage. Late last year, a government panel recommended about $260 a month, or about $1. 50 an hour  —   a small amount even in South Africa, but close to the median income in a country where the official unemployment rate is 27 percent and nearly half the population lives in poverty. Last week, the nation’s deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa, endorsed the panel’s recommendation, vowing that the minimum wage would be in effect by May 2018. But in such a sluggish economy, opponents contend that the effort would destroy jobs, especially for the least skilled. Supporters counter that a minimum wage is the only way to reduce poverty in one of the world’s most unequal societies, helping to dismantle an   system designed to provide cheap black labor for an economy dominated by the white minority. In few places do divisions run as deep as in South Africa. Wealthy communities with living standards equal to those in the West and inhabited disproportionately by whites rub shoulders uneasily with desperately poor townships. A government survey released in January found that black South Africans, who make up 80 percent of the population, earned only   of what whites did in 2015. Some smaller African economies, like those of Cameroon, Ghana and Ivory Coast, already have a national minimum wage. But only a small percentage of their workers are in the formal economy and therefore eligible for the minimum, experts say. And even for them, the rules tend not to be enforced. A national minimum wage would be more meaningful in a big economy like South Africa’s, experts say, because the formal work force is much larger, around 80 percent of all workers. Millions of people would be eligible. Still, South Africa,   Africa’s most advanced economy, is enduring the same forces as the rest of the continent. It is not growing fast enough to absorb its rapidly growing population, which is leaving rural areas to look for work in places like Khayelitsha, one of the country’s biggest townships with about 400, 000 people. There is added urgency for the government to act: The African National Congress, which helped liberate black South Africans from   rule and has governed the country since 1994, is still stinging from losing most of the nation’s biggest cities in elections last July. The party could once bank on loyal support from the nation’s black majority. But corruption and economic stagnation for millions of people have steadily eroded that support over the years, resulting in the party’s worst showing in elections since the end of apartheid in 1994. The frustrations are evident in Khayelitsha. It is roughly situated between two of South Africa’s richest areas: the city of Cape Town and the famed wine country of Stellenbosch. Established in 1983 by the apartheid government, Khayelitsha, which means new home in Xhosa, still provides many of the workers for both communities. On weekday mornings, soon after daybreak, the men and women of Khayelitsha leave their neighborhoods and walk to the nearest train or bus station. For many, the commute  —   a legacy of   urban planning to separate white and black areas  —   takes up to a couple of hours each way. Many on Mr. Lugogo’s street, known as Twecu Crescent, said their commute cost them a quarter or a third of their monthly wages. For black South Africans nationwide, the cost of taxis, buses and other passenger road transportation accounts for 5. 4 percent of their expenses, compared with 0. 2 percent for whites, who tend to own cars. A bus called the Golden Arrow stopped not far from Twecu Crescent with a few passengers already on board. It made several stops in Khayelitsha and, after passing a densely packed stretch of shanties, some precariously stacked two high, it pulled out of the township on its way toward Cape Town. Headed to residential areas, the bus transported mostly women who worked in malls or in homes as housekeepers. Along the way, in a scene repeated in many buses that morning, a woman, in this instance Julia Xakata, began preaching and leading the others in song. Some sang softly while checking their cellphones. Sitting near the front of the bus next to a window, Makatiso Sekhamane moved her lips while knitting a black cap. “I knit whenever I have some free time,” Ms. Sekhamane, 47, said, explaining that she usually completed a cap in two days and sold it for about $4. “It’s something. ” The caps supplemented the $400 a month she made working six days a week cleaning white people’s homes. Her husband earned maybe $150 repairing refrigerators. Their combined income supports five children and two grandchildren at home. Much of the discussion surrounding a national minimum wage  —   led by government, business, labor and academics  —   is expected to focus on the amount. According to the panel’s report, a monthly minimum wage of about $260 “would maximize benefits to the poor and minimize any possible” disincentives to work. The amount proposed by the panel is below the working poverty line of $325 a month, but because the median income of South African workers is only $280 a month, the minimum would help reduce inequality, the panel said. On Twecu Crescent, many of the employed already earn the proposed minimum, or more. But their wages are far below the salaries earned by the few residents in the nicest homes  —   $600 a month for a government worker, $900 a month for a young police officer. The proposed minimum “is not enough,” said Nombeko Mndangaso, who earns about $165 a month working five hours a day as a cleaner in a nursing home. “It won’t make a difference. ” With her husband, who makes $245 a month as a   security guard, they earn more than $400 a month. But with rent, transportation, electricity and two daughters, there is little left at the end of the month. A minimum wage of “at least” $340 a month per person, she said, would improve her family’s situation. Sparsely populated a generation ago, Twecu Crescent now has little or no space between homes. Many homeowners earn extra income by renting out shacks on their property to the endless stream of new arrivals to Khayelitsha. On Twecu Crescent, a short street divided into two blocks, the handful of sturdily built homes belonging to the upwardly mobile stand out. There is, in a   house, the woman who works at a bank down the street, the man employed by the government power utility and, on the corner, the police officer whose still unfinished house has a new red Peugeot in the driveway and a low wall with spikes to discourage people from sitting on it. The street is otherwise lined with more modest homes under corrugated roof sheets, inhabited by those making a third or half of what those in the nicer homes do, and shacks of varying quality occupied by those worse off. Discolored concrete blocks are neatly piled in many front yards, a sign of the slow and unsteady pace of progress for most on Twecu Crescent. Sinovuyo Gada’s family moved here in 1998. “There was no road here, just gravel,” she said. “There were no houses, just shacks. ” Her father, a welder, and her mother, who sells homemade food from a shack in their front yard, built the house in which she and her brother grew up. After finishing high school in 2012, she sent out her résumé to countless companies for three years before finally securing a   job through a friend. She now works four days a week at a supermarket at a mall in Cape Town, earning $60 a week. About 30 percent of that, or $18, goes to transportation. Ms. Gada, 22, is part of the “ ” generation of black South Africans who came of age after apartheid’s fall. But like many in her cohort, she was deeply dissatisfied with the pace of change in her family’s circumstances. “The apartheid, it’s still there,” she said. The wages she earned from the job that took so long in finding would do little to improve her situation, she said. She did not believe that a monthly minimum of $260 would help. Employers control the balance of power over people like her, she said. “They think sometimes we are desperate,” she said. “Yes, we are desperate, because we have families and children to take care of. ” It was early evening, and, all over Khayelitsha, men and women started coming home, most of them walking from bus stops to their streets, their gait slower than in the morning. On Twecu Crescent, girls sat on a corner playing a game of rocks. A boy pushing an old tire with a stick cast a long shadow up the street. The woman who was knitting on the bus, Ms. Sekhamane  —   better known on Twecu Crescent as Mama Kakiso, or the mother of Kakiso, her son  —   arrived home. She had had a busy day and, arriving late at the bus stop, had found no available seats on the Golden Arrow. She took a taxi instead, paying an amount equivalent to half the price of one of her black caps. “I’m going to wash my body and sleep now,” Mama Kakiso said as she slipped into her home. “I can’t do anything. ”",0

The World is Waking Up and it’s Magic to Watch It’s inspiring to witness many of the earth’s people, especially in the Western world, becoming awar... Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/10/the-world-is-waking-up-and-its-magic-to.html It’s inspiring to witness many of the earth’s people, especially in the Western world, becoming aware of the deep corruption in our social system, particularly because society is building its innate capacity to actually do something about it. More and more people now understand that we are ruled via a corporatocracy where the money supply, banking, governmental policy and other vital public infrastructure has been hijacked by the oligarchs and the corporate elite. In addition, public discourse and the official narratives are dictated by the corporate media who are owned by the same people who control macro public policy via their political puppets, as well as the unprecedented wealth they have at their disposal. Their ultimate agenda is of course ultimate power, which is dressed up in a pretty dress of “let’s save the planet!”.Of course the degradation of our natural systems needs a fresh approach, yet their covert game to win a planetary control-system has been brilliantly exposed for the world to see. In stride, the people are fighting back in both explicit and subtle ways. Some examples include: Independent media has exploded, where more people now get their news from it compared to the propagandized mainstream press; The information which exposes the lies of the ‘programmed beliefs’ is increasingly circulated by an awakening populace; Global and local action groups are forming to reverse the sellout of our system; Greater numbers of people are growing or sourcing organic, chemical-free food and are personally filtering any contaminants out of their water supply; Parents are home-schooling their children in greater numbers, or at least giving them more holistic and healthy information as their core education; Conversations of substance are increasingly occurring at pubs, supermarkets and community events, making it harder for the sleeping masses not to face the uncomfortable truths about our sick system; and Individuals and families are unplugging from the control-grid the best they can, as well as reconsidering and re-prioritizing what’s truly important in life. That’s a good segue into the other dimension of the waking up process. A great awakening is occurring in terms of the deeper layers of reality, including the way the scientific philosophy on life has been intentionally designed to keep us disempowered and disconnected with our true nature. Exit scientific materialism . This theory has long been debunked by the quantum and parapsychological sciences because human consciousness has clearly been shown to play a co-creative role in the manifestation of our interconnected reality. Not that this hasn’t been known in one way or another by basically every culture on earth since the beginning of time. Yet, materialism is still the dominant philosophy of not just the dogmatic discipline we call mainstream science, but also of many minds within the truth and freedom network. When it’s pretty much common knowledge that medical, energy and other corporate-related science has been distorted and suppressed for the benefit of the control-system, why would it be any different when it comes to the philosophical implications of scientific exploration and its associated evidence? After all, we know that the elite use ritual and symbolic spells to achieve their goals, so clearly they themselves believe beyond the adolescence of a matter-based reality. And when we consider how successful they’ve been, obviously they’ve tapped into the energetic dance in a productive way, at least for themselves. The fact remains however that there is a huge network of people who are becoming conscious of the nature of consciousness itself. A term to describe this is spirituality, but in summary it’s simply about understanding the connection we have with each other and reality at large, as well as rediscovering the various layers which make up the self. If you haven’t viewed through this lens in your quest for clarity, you’re unfortunately missing a profound piece of the philosophical puzzle. In any case, the awakening community is doing some amazing work, even if it’s split between the system-focused and spiritual-focused mindsets. There are of course many balance-minded individuals and groups who are doing both, but for the time being this remains the exception, not the norm. That will change though. The veterans of truth-seeking, as well as the newly initiated to the conscious society, are energetically primed to create a balance between these two areas of exploration. After all, there is always an opportunity for the magic to be at strength with the madness, just like the positive charge is equal to its negative counterpart, in accordance with natural principles. That’s duality, in one action. To reflect on which ways in which you’ve personally woken up, watch the following short documentary. By Phillip J. Watt, Waking Times About the author: Phillip J.

17117,Best Forgotten,"I feel emotions with such depth and intensity they seem so familiar as if lived before, like deja vu they leave their residue, images form and bounce back and forth between heart and mind. It is mercy that I have forgotten so much more than remembered, time has allowed me to change and redefine them, such a crushing and heavy load to carry otherwise. If I am defined by those lost memories what am I? A loop between my heart and mind, thoughts and feelings rise and fall. Thoughtful ruminations give way to painful images and recollections. Oh there are good, even wonderful memories. I hang on to them like an album of pictures, I turn the pages and revisit those good times. They chronicle by not so much as what they show but what they don't. some are filled with regret, others live in denial, always hoping for a happy ending. My emotions sometimes rip through my chest and a sadness as black as night covers me, but I have determined not to cower, but to meet them with head and heart! I will not give up, I will not give up!",0
17118,"Meet Julio Torres, the New ‘S.N.L.’ Star No One Sees - The New York Times","At a sleepy show last month in the grim basement of the Broadway Comedy Club, a Midtown spot that feels frozen in time from the 1980s comedy boom, Julio Torres looked at his feet, speaking to a small crowd in a near monotone. “The hardest part about being vegan is the apologies,” he said, to silence. “People ask if I miss meat or dairy. I miss being liked. ” Mr. Torres, a millennial comic with a slight build, shy persona and a hint of an accent (he emigrated from El Salvador) is better known in alternative spaces than in clubs, but this line got a big laugh. He raised his   blond head and made eye contact before going for the kill: “I don’t miss cheese. I miss being asked to do things. I miss my friends and family. ” Judging by the    surroundings, you would never know that Mr. Torres is the newest star of “Saturday Night Live. ” He has never appeared on the show, but if you’ve been surprised by incongruously dreamy comedy this season, chances are he had something to do with it. Mr. Torres, who has the same delightfully alien sensibility as his sometimes nickname, Space Prince, joined the writing staff in the fall and has already introduced a new style to the show, which returns on Saturday after a holiday break. Early in his tenure, he wrote a distinctively moody digital short, half in Spanish, starring   Miranda as a sensitive boy named Diego calling his mother in Mexico from a telephone booth in a North Dakota cornfield, describing America with wonder and romance. (He explains a marshmallow salad with the baffled awe of someone seeing a U. F. O.) This monologue played as flashbacks of   signs and football players took nostalgic tropes of Americana and repurposed them into an immigrant’s love letter. There were slight homoerotic overtones but not a note of gay panic. Mr. Torres, with Anna Drezen, also wrote a “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” satire the next week that imagined the sparring partners of that 1962 drama as hamsters trapped in a glass box. One week later, he returned to highbrow animals in a digital short, released online, that imagined what a swan inside a motel painting would say if he could talk. Turns out, he would harass the duck nearby. “Have you inspired countless ballets?” said the swan, voiced by Dave Chappelle. “What was it called?” he asked, adding, “It wasn’t called Duck Lake. ” This rarefied comedy stands out on a   show that has long had a populist voice, leaning toward topical jokes, and broadly accessible references. But Mr. Torres’s approach is also not entirely successful, often more interesting than funny. Then again, he was just getting started. Much of his comedy on “Saturday Night Live” hinges on empathetic shifts in perspective, showing us the roiling inner life of an animal, an object (as in a   sketch from the point of view of a  sink having an existential crisis) or a person not known for introspection. His first real triumph was another surprising immigrant story: “Melania’s Moments,” a series of digital shorts that detailed the thoughts of the future first lady in a concise form that resembles the mellow   from the “S. N. L. ” writer Jack Handey’s “Deep Thoughts. ” Mr. Handey aimed for pure absurdity, but Mr. Torres makes Melania Trump a tragic,   heroine trapped in her gilded cage. Approaching a window in Trump Tower, like a cursed princess, she gazes onto Fifth Avenue, wondering about Sixth Avenue the way a Chekhov character dreams of Moscow. In another short, she wakes up in a cold sweat with the sense that her replacement is being born in rural Latvia, then decides to protect her. Even though the writing staffs of “Saturday Night Live” have been as rich in talent as the casts, the star system has always worked only for those on camera. Performers became famous, while writers, even those like James Downey, who defined political humor for a generation, toiled in relative obscurity, partly because the show never revealed who was responsible for which sketch. (Mr. Handey was an exception.) But this has been changing. The   John Mulaney has gained more than a little acclaim for writing jokes for the popular character Stefon, played by Bill Hader (who has given him credit in interviews). Comedy journalism online now covers writers’ rooms obsessively, and social media has also made the artistic process more transparent  —   with comics praising specific sketches.   New York comedy fans were already familiar with Mr. Torres (who appeared on Louis C. K.’s “Horace and Pete”) when he got the job. But he didn’t emerge from the usual clubs or improv factories. The buzz over his work grew in December, when he wrote two superb bits with Jeremy Beiler, digital shorts that earned laughs as much as knowing nods. Their sly ad for a new   toy for sensitive, lonely boys, “Wells for Boys,” uses a classic “S. N. L. ” format  —   the ad satire  —   for an arch idea, that the delicate child’s version of a monster truck is a plastic well to sit near and brood. But Mr. Torres and Mr. Beiler delivered an even more impressive feat with the formally clever, but also topical, companion to “Melania’s Moments” that was presented from the point of view of Donald J. Trump. We now spend so much time looking at Mr. Trump that putting us behind his eyes was a fertile concept. This short has a paranoid vibe out of “Rosemary’s Baby,” but, like all of Mr. Torres’s sketches, it has a tone that’s sneakily sympathetic. Mr. Trump (played by John Cena) doesn’t appear to be having any more fun than his wife does in “Melania’s Moments. ” Television blares insults about him. His handlers work him over, and his voters and colleagues bore him with tedium about politics and policy. Then comes relief (and the punch line) in the form of Kellyanne Conway, played by Kate McKinnon, who hypnotically encourages him to sleep. Mr. Trump dreams of a version of himself embracing him and declaring his love. Then the two Donald Trumps twirl together. This danse macabre is a study in   but it also proposes an idea that is not only characteristic of Mr. Torres’s work, but also helps explain how he has successfully translated his idiosyncratic vision for a broad audience: Never underestimate people’s capacity to see themselves as outsiders, because, in our own minds, we all at some point see ourselves a bit as space princes.",0
17119,Russian Dissident Artist Will Seek Asylum in France - The New York Times,"PARIS  —   He has nailed his scrotum to the cobblestones of Red Square, sewn his lips shut to protest   restrictions and set fire to the doors of Russia’s Federal Security Service. Now, Pyotr Pavlensky, Russia’s     performance artist, has fled to France, where he intends to seek political asylum. Russian authorities questioned Mr. Pavlensky and his partner, Oksana Shalygina, last month after an actress at an   Moscow theater filed a complaint accusing them of sexual assault. The couple deny the allegations, saying that the encounter was a consensual threesome and that the case is politically motivated. Amid the ambiguities  —   and at a time when violence against women is a topic of intense debate in the country  —   Russia’s cultural opposition is now divided over a figure once seen as a symbol of the resistance to President Vladimir V. Putin’s Russia. Mr. Pavlensky and Ms. Shalygina have not been formally charged, but were questioned by the police in Moscow on Dec. 15 and informed that they could face up to 10 years in prison. Told not to leave Moscow while the case was pending, they said they saw what was likely to happen and took their daughters, ages 6 and 8, to France over the weekend after spending a month in Ukraine. “We’ve become victims of this investigation,” Mr. Pavlensky said in an interview on Monday in a Paris cafe, speaking Russian through an interpreter, and with Ms. Shalygina at his side. “It’s like a horrible dream that you can’t even imagine. ” The situation  —   with its charges of a honey trap and “kompromat” (compromising material gathered by the authorities)  —   reflects the climate of suspicion and growing authoritarianism in Russia, where artists like the female punk band Pussy Riot have faced jail, but, for the most part, outright   censorship has given way to artistic   in the face of changing laws and cuts to culture funding. The accusations, however, have prompted even some supporters of Mr. Pavlensky to question his behavior. The theater where the actress works, Teatr. doc, is known for   plays that have criticized and angered the Russian government, and it has supported Mr. Pavlensky in the past. But its leadership has seconded the assault accusations and defended the actress against the couple’s assertions that she was working for the state. This is not the first time Mr. Pavlensky has found himself in the cross hairs of the Russian authorities. Over the years, they have ordered him to undergo a dozen psychiatric evaluations, a technique long used to quash political dissent. In 2014 he chopped off his right earlobe for a piece called “Segregation,” inspired by van Gogh and intended, he said, to show that “psychiatry is a collection of subjective opinions. ” After setting fire to the doors of Lubyanka, the Moscow headquarters of Russia’s infamous security service, in 2015, he served seven months in pretrial detention on charges of vandalism. (He called that action “Threat” and said it was intended to illuminate “what people prefer to forget,” that the security apparatus hadn’t changed since Soviet times.) He was released last June with a fine, a move human rights activists said was intended to avoid an international incident of the kind that ensued after members of Pussy Riot were jailed in 2012 on charges of hooliganism for performing an   song in a Moscow church. Soon after, Mr. Pavlensky said, he gave some lectures at Teatr. doc. It was at one of them last September that he met the actress who later filed the assault complaint. Mr. Pavlensky said that on Dec. 4, the actress texted Ms. Shalygina. The couple  —   who say they have an open relationship  —   invited her to their Moscow apartment that evening. “We talked about art,” he said. “We sat and drank coffee. We drank Cognac, but not a lot. ” “There was some form of intimacy,” he added. “And then she said she wants to leave. We said, ‘Fine, no problem.’ We parted as friends. ” Both Mr. Pavlensky, 32, and Ms. Shalygina, 37, said it was the first time the three had had sex together. Yuri A. Lysenko, a lawyer for the actress, said that Mr. Pavlensky had committed a “crime,” a rape, and that he wanted to portray the police investigation as politically motivated to avoid punishment. Adding to the confusion over the allegations, this week Teatr. doc posted on its Facebook page a video dated Oct. 31 that it said showed Mr. Pavlensky and others beating up a man they said was the actress’s boyfriend, in the theater’s parking lot. Mr. Pavlensky said that the video was “murky” and that he didn’t recognize himself in it. But he said he had been involved in a physical altercation with the actress’s boyfriend in October, when he and others confronted the man over allegations that he had beaten her. The Interfax News Agency reported that the police told him that a criminal case had been opened about the fight. Mr. Pavlensky said that was not the case. Mr. Lysenko said the fight with the boyfriend and the sexual assault allegations were “not related. ” He then added: “You have to ask Mr. Pavlensky if he has seen a psychiatrist recently. What he did is part of his carefully crafted plan to paint his crime in political colors. ” In a Facebook post that she said would be her last word on the matter, Yelena Gremina, the director of Teatr. doc, called the couple’s claims that the actress worked for the security services “slander. ” On Russia’s vibrant social media, artists are divided over the case. “The hysteria with Pavlensky is an alarming sign that anyone who becomes a significant ‘fighter against the regime’ is immediately put on a pedestal and declared a saint,” the artist Lena Hades wrote on Facebook. Others came out against Mr. Pavlensky. “Alas, yesterday a national hero and a great performance artist, today  —   it’s true  —   a criminal, a psychopath and a rapist,” Olga Papernaya, a former art director at a Moscow film club, wrote on Facebook, suggesting that she was friends with the actress. “For now, the authorities are winning,” Mr. Pavlensky said. The press is weak, he added, and “the   opposition” divided, even over Russia’s annexation of Crimea. “But each move is not the last,” he said of the country’s situation. “It’s not clear who will have the last word in this conflict. ”",0
17120,Donald Trump’s Remarks Show He’s Mistaken on Sexual Assault in Military - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Sexual assault in the military has plagued the Pentagon in recent years as a series of   cases, and new data, revealed the extent of the problem. In response, President Obama and members of Congress demanded that military officials more aggressively address the threat and its causes. Yet few military experts went as far as Donald J. Trump did Wednesday, when he suggested that the integration of women into the armed forces was an underlying cause of sexual assault. Speaking at a candidates’ forum, Mr. Trump defended one of his Twitter posts from 2013 concerning the high number of sexual assaults in the military, and said that he had been “absolutely correct” in posting a message that said, “What did these geniuses expect when they put men  women together?” The remarks drew criticism on Thursday from lawmakers and military experts, who said Mr. Trump had displayed ignorance of the Pentagon’s   struggle to curb such assaults and the military justice system that is in place to prosecute them. “That’s more than victim blaming, and it misunderstands the historical role of women in the military,” said retired Col. Don Christensen, a former chief prosecutor of the Air Force. American women in the military have taken on expanded roles in recent years as the Pentagon has integrated them into more combat positions. But they have worked alongside servicemen since the Revolutionary War, and in significant numbers since World War II, something Mr. Trump did not acknowledge. Their roles have grown over the centuries from nurses, cooks and seamstresses, who maintained the camps of the Continental Army, to fighter pilots, soldiers, sailors and Marines who are battling the Islamic State in the Middle East and Afghanistan. “We couldn’t run a military without women,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He noted that an argument that the proximity of women was to blame for sexual assault could be applied to women on college campuses and in workplaces, where they are also assaulted. “Quite frankly, it’s absurd,” he said. As the Pentagon has released more detailed records on the problem, the statistics reveal that sexual assault in the military is not just a problem faced by women. In 2014, the latest numbers available, the Pentagon estimated that 20, 300 servicemen and servicewomen were assaulted that year. “Over half the victims are men,” said Colonel Christensen, who is now the president of Protect Our Defenders, an advocacy group. Of the estimated 20, 300 attacks in 2014 recorded by the Pentagon, roughly 10, 600 of the victims were men, though women faced a higher rate of assault given their lower overall numbers in the armed forces. Mr. Trump’s proposed solution of creating a military justice system to deal with sexual assault also puzzled national security experts. A military justice system has been in place in some form since the 1774 British Articles of War. It is an essential and distinct part of the military. “George Washington beat him to it!” said Mr. Graham, who has worked as a military lawyer. That system and its laws, known as the Uniform Code of Military Justice, have in fact been at the center of a protracted battle in Congress over its role in adjudicating such crimes. One solution was first proposed by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York. She has pressed for a measure, opposed by top Pentagon leaders, that would take sexual assault cases outside the military chain of command and give military prosecutors the power to decide which cases to try, rather than keeping that authority with the accuser’s own commander, as is the policy now. Ms. Gillibrand’s logic  —   and that of her supporters, including a number of victims’ groups  —   is that more men and women in the military would come forward to report crimes if they did not fear retaliation by those supervising them. The Pentagon’s newest statistics also showed that a majority of victims did not report attacks. The Defense Department said that in 2014, only 6, 131  —   under    —   of attacks were reported. The 2014 statistics, which were based on a study conducted for the Pentagon by the RAND Corporation, a think tank, found that 62 percent of women who reported sexual assault said they had faced retaliation for doing so. The study, released in May 2015 and endorsed by the Pentagon, offered no comparable statistic for men. Ms. Gillibrand’s efforts have been rebuffed in favor of more modest measures, including those written by Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, that stripped commanders of their ability to overturn jury verdicts and mandated dishonorable discharge or dismissal for anyone convicted of sexual assault. Other recent legislation guarantees that every sexual assault victim in the military receives an independent lawyer, known as a special victims’ counsel, and assures a civilian review of any case in which a commander overrules a prosecutor seeking to   an accused offender. “Donald Trump displayed a stunning lack of knowledge about how the military justice system works, the nature of sexual assault in the military or the dozens of systemic reforms that Congress has made to curb such crimes,” Ms. McCaskill said on Thursday. Mr. Trump, pressed on Wednesday about whether his 2013 Twitter post was meant to suggest that women should not serve, said the solution was “not to kick them out. ” “Right now, part of the problem is nobody gets prosecuted,” he said. “You have the report of rape, and nobody gets prosecuted. ” Mr. Trump’s remarks on sexual assault in the military, like so many he has made on other topics, became instant campaign fodder. Matt Heinz, who is challenging Representative Martha E. McSally, Republican of Arizona and a former Air Force combat pilot, issued a news release on Thursday morning that said, “Voters deserve to know if McSally will stick to her principles and denounce Donald Trump and his campaign. ”",0
17121,Apple Offers Free App to Teach Children Coding (iPads Sold Separately) - The New York Times,"Apple plans to release a free coding education app on Tuesday that it developed with   students in mind, in the latest salvo among technology companies to gain share in the education market and to nurture early product loyalty among children. Apple’s app, called Swift Playgrounds, introduces basic computer programming concepts, like sequencing logic, by asking students to use word commands to move cartoon avatars through a fanciful, animated world. Unlike some children’s apps, which employ    blocks to teach coding, the Apple program uses Swift, a professional programming language that the company introduced in 2014. “When you learn to code with Swift Playgrounds, you are learning the same language used by professional developers,” Brian Croll, Apple’s vice president of product marketing, said in a telephone interview. “It’s easy to take the next step and learn to write a real app. ” The introduction of Apple’s app coincides with a larger Silicon Valley campaign to press public schools to teach coding. Tech executives have argued that such training could help address   differences among students, by providing them with marketable job skills. In January, President Obama said he was asking Congress to provide $4 billion in the budget for a computer science initiative in public schools. (Congress has not yet passed a budget.) “We believe every student should have the opportunity to code,” Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive of Apple, said during a company event last week to introduce the iPhone 7. Tech companies are in heated competition for the education market. Apple devices and ones based on the Microsoft Windows software have recently lost market share at United States public schools to Chromebooks, inexpensive laptops that run on the Google Chrome operating system. The Apple coding app is free, but it requires an iPad, the company’s tablet computer, which has declining sales and which many schools and families may not be able to afford. “How much of the motivation is for selling of product, and what does that do for schools that cannot afford this technology?” asked Jane Margolis, a senior researcher at the Graduate School of Education  Information Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has studied disparities in computer science education for more than two decades. “The threat is that it is going to replicate current inequities. ” Mr. Croll of Apple said the company was making the app free so that the coding lessons are accessible. While it is available for use in schools, individual students, parents and consumers could also use the app to teach themselves to code at home, he said. He added that Apple had created the app for the iPad to ensure a   user experience. Apple said that more than 100 schools and districts worldwide had agreed to try the coding app with their students. “We are hoping it will be a good transition between   and ” said Trang Lai, the director of educational services at the Fullerton School District, a     public school system in Fullerton, Calif. Her district provides an iPad for every student in grades five through eight. Ms. Lai said the district had previously bought coding apps that did not work well on iPads, and that it was now eager to try Swift Playgrounds. “Right now, that is what is current,” she said. “That is what is available, and that is what is free. ”",0

But all too often these   are subconscious, which means we don’t discuss them openly and fail to question them relentlessly. “It’s like money is just this big blob,” said Sallie Krawcheck, a   and chief executive of Ellevest, an online investment service for women that tries to make these   visible. “People think about it conceptually and not in terms of wanting to start a business, retire well, buy a house or have a baby. ” The blob, she concluded when she was starting her business, needed clearing up. “This is not money to get more money,” she said. “It’s money to do these things. Help me figure out what I can afford and when and what the   are to getting there. ” The people you’ll encounter in this section have been sorting it out for themselves for some time now. Their household income is at or close to the median in their area. Meeting the most basic of needs is usually not a problem, but it’s a challenge to figure out how often to allow themselves things they want and to weigh those desires against longstanding debt or the contributions they probably ought to make to their futures. Below are some of the most common   that they  —   and all of us  —   face most often. In January 2010, Jordan Hightower’s younger sister, Molly, was killed in an earthquake while volunteering in Haiti. Jordan soon resolved that she would end her “one day” saving mentality and focus on today. That meant travel, to a dozen bachelorette parties around the United States and to 23 countries around the world in the last seven years. While she’s traveled on a hostel budget and managed $4, 000 in annual retirement savings, her down payment savings have suffered, even as prices for starter homes in Tacoma, Wash. have risen. Jordan, 31, has no regrets, though. A wedding and kids are on the horizon in the next few years, and she plans to adjust her house savings accordingly now that she’s been able to see and do so much. “I’m not worried or sad about changing those things,” she said. Martin and Raquel Vergara met as rivals, operating neighboring mall kiosks. She eventually became a personal banker, while he is a mixed martial arts fighter and a personal trainer. Now that they’re the parents of two small children, Raquel, 26, has hit the pause button on her career to care for the kids. They don’t want to miss too much time with them, wondering if their hours with their children will add up to more than those of   providers. “We are investing time in our kids,” said Martin, who is 25. “That means more than money. ” Even single parents make similar decisions if they possibly can, and some believe it’s necessary. Natalie Davis was 31 and pregnant when her husband died unexpectedly five years ago. Now, she has a    boy and a    girl. She’s also no longer a   executive, even though she ran up some   debt and sacrificed savings after her decision to work less. For her, the choice wasn’t a close call. “They needed it,” she said, even though her husband did not have life insurance. Being with her children more often also helped clarify what counted as a mere want when it came to the family budget. “Sometimes my son will really want something and I used to feel guilty, being that he doesn’t have his dad,” she said. “I used to do everything I could to get him what he wants, and now I don’t stress on that anymore. ” Chris and Tanya Brashers have faced health problems, landlord problems and employment problems. Both have declared personal bankruptcy. Soon, they will move from Bryan, Ark. to Fairhope, Ala. They are both veterans, and they are crossing their fingers that the optimistic new postal address will bring new career opportunities for Chris, who is 46. He trained as an engineer, but his passion is photography, and his research suggests that he will be able to get freelance work there. While the couple is in debt, Tanya, who is 41, professes a certain serenity about their circumstances given all they have experienced. “I’ve learned not to depend on money for your happiness,” she said. “Now, living as simply as we do, I’m kind of at peace. ” Alonzo, 46, the minister with multiple other jobs, works 65 to 70 hours each week so his children can grow up in a safe neighborhood. The family has a security system, but they sometimes forget to turn it on and then leave the doors unlocked. Nobody comes in. “Would I be that comfortable in another neighborhood?” he said. “The neighborhood where I grew up in? Nope. ” So the family has physical security, paying now so that the kids can have a better later, as Alonzo puts it. But hanging over that   is another one that he said so many   families face. “What can I leave for them?” he wondered. “Most black people leave their families a bill when they die, not a legacy. Not an estate. We don’t have estates. The only thing we know about estates is when we see the sign for estate sales, and we get happy because this is a real big garage sale. ” All joking aside, Alonzo doesn’t need to look far to see where a lack of retirement savings can get you, given that his father is still a pastor at the church as well. Black preachers just die, he said. They don’t retire. Still, at least his choice is deliberate: Trade a better later for himself for a better later for his children. It’s the same   parents have made for centuries, and it’s a swap that many parents continue to make without much hesitation. Read what other people are saying about how they make ends meet.",0
17124,"Angela Merkel’s Problems in Germany Could Challenge Europe, Too - The New York Times","BERLIN  —   Even Angela Merkel, the usually unruffled veteran of European crises after almost 11 years as chancellor of Germany, had to admit it last week: “The world finds itself in a critical condition,” she said, and there is no point “in painting anything rosier than it is. ” The outlook for Ms. Merkel is not especially rosy, either. After years of broad and deep support at home, bolstering her as she grew to become the Continent’s most powerful leader, she is heading toward national elections next year more politically vulnerable than at any time since her early days in office, with implications that extend far beyond Germany’s borders. When she arrives in Slovakia on Friday for a summit meeting of leaders from 27 European Union nations  —   all save Britain, which voted in June to leave the bloc  —   her ability to navigate her troubles at home will hang over the gathering. Since Britain’s decision, other European governments have done little to respond to the surge in populism and nationalism across the Continent or to reassure their citizens that the European Union can be a force for good in their lives. With Ms. Merkel’s attention split between strengthening her domestic position and addressing Europe’s woes, the task of developing a united and effective response could become that much harder. Her continued defense of her decision to admit more than a million migrants to Germany last year has left her increasingly isolated from other leaders coping with     sentiment in their electorates, especially after terrorist attacks. With growth across the eurozone still “tilted to the down side,” as the European Central Bank chief, Mario Draghi, said on Thursday, Ms. Merkel’s new vulnerability may undercut Germany’s ability to impose its   economic policy on the bloc and fuel calls for more government spending from countries still struggling with high unemployment and slow growth. And an inward turn by Germany as it debates its response to the migration crisis and holds elections in a year’s time could create a further leadership void in Europe at a critical moment. Already, President François Hollande of France is all but a lame duck, deeply unpopular and a long shot for   next year, and Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy remains politically fragile, struggling to push through constitutional changes and to assert himself on the European stage. And the rift between the more pluralistic nations of Western Europe and governments in Central and Eastern Europe, some of which are increasingly authoritarian, has heightened the challenge of keeping the Continent knit tightly together. In the middle of all this, as ever, is Ms. Merkel, whose political peril in Germany remains hard to judge  —   especially, her supporters emphasize, while the country’s economy remains relatively strong. But she is under increased attack, from within her own   bloc and from a resurgent   over her immigration policy. And while German officials remain aghast at Britain’s lack of a plan for disengaging from the European Union, she has not offered a   vision for how to hold the bloc together. Hostile commentators and critics in her own bloc could hardly contain their glee at her new vulnerability after the     Alternative for Germany party pushed Ms. Merkel’s conservatives into third place in an election in the impoverished and sparsely populated northeastern state of   on Sept. 4. It was the first time Ms. Merkel’s bloc of Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, had been overtaken on the right in any such election in modern Germany. That the result came a year to the day after she threw open the country’s borders to admit migrants trapped in Hungary, and that it occurred in her political home state, which shelters very few refugees, accentuated the loss. “Angela Merkel is wobbling,” said Wolfram Weimer of the news channel  . “Her aura of winner is destroyed, and her image as farseeing, clever strategist of power along with it. ” Talk of the twilight of Ms. Merkel’s time in office may be exaggerated, said Tina Hildebrandt of the influential weekly Die Zeit, “but that so much is open is spectacular enough. ” “Merkel’s loss of reputation is immense,” Ms. Hildebrandt added. “Her situation almost reminds us of the beginning of her career,” when the distinctly   Ms. Merkel, a physicist from the Communist East, was much criticized for her style  —   and much underestimated in her ability and will to get to the top. The chancellor showed that grit on Wednesday with a spirited speech to Parliament, defending her policy at home and the controversial pact she negotiated with Turkey to stop Middle Eastern migrants from crossing to Greece and into Europe. Since that agreement was signed, she said, almost no migrants have drowned in the Aegean Sea, compared with hundreds in the two months before. “In that situation, you can’t just look on,” said Ms. Merkel, the daughter of a Lutheran pastor. “You must work with another country and find a way forward. ” Ms. Merkel has taken responsibility for the election loss on Sept. 4 and doubled down on her refusal to emulate neighboring Austria by limiting the number of asylum seekers who can come each year. (Austria, her partner last year in admitting the migrants, may elect a   politician as president this year.) But as politicians scramble ahead of German national elections next fall, that limit on immigration is becoming a litmus test for her conservative Bavarian sister party, and even for the   Social Democrats, with whom Ms. Merkel governs nationally in a coalition. Ms. Merkel has met almost every European leader ahead of the summit meeting in Bratislava, where the 27 nations are expected to agree on stronger security measures and try again to stimulate economic growth and jobs for the young. Daniela Schwarzer, a senior director of the German Marshall Fund in Berlin, said she saw the chancellor as still very much in charge. “I would not say that she has lost control, or the capacity to lead Germany,” Ms. Schwarzer said. “But she will have to take into account that there are vocal people in populist parties and critical voices in her own camp. ” The   Alternative for Germany party now has seats in nine of the country’s 16 state legislatures and seems likely to win more when the   of Berlin votes on Sunday. The chancellor might turn with relief to the next item on her calendar: a Sept. 19 summit meeting at the United Nations, hosted with President Obama, on the global crisis of up to 60 million migrants, many of them in Africa. Ms. Merkel wants vastly more aid and action to prevent   from surging through Niger and Mali to Libya and then to Europe. Mr. Obama may be more sympathetic to her challenges than many of Ms. Merkel’s compatriots. “Perhaps because she once lived behind a wall herself,” Mr. Obama said on a visit to Germany in April, “Angela understands the aspirations of those who’ve been denied their freedom and who seek a better life. ” He added, “I know the politics around this issue can be difficult in all of our countries. ”",0
17125,"WikiLeaks: Clinton Confidant Raised Money for Foundation, Got Bill Paid Gigs","Email 

An internal memo released Wednesday by WikiLeaks reveals how a longtime Clinton confidant played an ""unorthodox"" dual role – raising money for the Clinton Foundation and finding paid work for Bill Clinton, The Hill reports. 
The 12-page document written in 2011 by Doug Band of Teneo, a private consulting firm that raised millions for the foundation and also scouted out paid gigs for what was dubbed ""Bill Clinton, Inc."", the Washington Examiner reports. 
In one instance, Band secured a $540,000 donation to the Clinton Foundation from banking giant UBS. He later arranged for Bill Clinton to give three paid speeches to the firm for a total of $900,000, The Hill reported. 
But in his memo, Band argues his double duties were ""independent"" of one another; the memo was written after Chelsea Clinton criticized Band's role within the family's network of interests, The Hill reports. 
""In the unique roles in which we have had the opportunity to serve, we have been able to help balance the multiplicity of activities that demand [Bill Clinton's] time and engagement to best fulfill his personal, political, business, official former President, and Foundation/non-profit goals,"" Band writes. 
According to The Hill, Teneo's overlapping responsibilities worried some in the Clintons' inner circle, and in one email published by WikiLeaks, Chelsea Clinton raised ""serious concerns"" with Teneo's liberal use of the Clinton name to court clients. 
Band lashed out, calling the former first daughter a meddlesome ""spoiled brat"" in one hacked email released by WikiLeaks. 
""We appreciate the unorthodox nature of our roles, and the goal of seeking ways to ensure we are implementing best practices to protect the [tax exempt] status of the Foundation,"" Band wrote in his memo to justify his role and bat back criticism, The Hill reports. 
Band co-founded Teneo with former State Department employee Declan Kelly while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state – and paid Bill Clinton as an adviser through 2012, The Hill reports. 
Band's memo lists several Teneo clients that he and Kelly ""leveraged"" into major donors for the foundation, and also details the personal introductions the two principals made between the Clintons and the prospective donors, The Hill reports. 
One that Kelly ""cultivated"" was Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent, which led to seven-figure donations beginning in 2009. 
In a previous hacked email to Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, Band worried the press might catch wind of his role and misconstrue it. 
""I'm starting to worry that if this story gets out, we are screwed,"" Band wrote. 
""[Kelly] and I built a business. Our business has almost nothing to do with the Clintons, the foundation or [the Clinton Global Initiative] in any way. The chairman of UBS could care a less [sic] about CGI."" 
A week after Band sent his memo, Clinton lawyer Cheryl Mills sent a document to Podesta and Band laying out ways to unwind the former president's charitable and business interests — all of which distanced Band from the foundation. 
In December 2011, the former president resigned his position on Teneo’s advisory board, The Hill reports.",0
17126,Trump To Make It Legal To Marry Your Daughter As 1st Act In Office,"0 Add Comment 
DESPITE not taking office until January of next year, President elect Donald Trump has revealed the first executive order he will issue when he takes power. 
“I know this is an issue close to the American people’s heart, believe me, so I’ll be making marrying your beautiful daughter legal. It’s going to be great, we’ll have the best incest, believe me,” an emotional Trump declared. 
Trump surprised political commentators who expected his first act in office to be something he pledged to do during his campaign such as the wholesale rounding up of Muslim Americans, a $6 billion tax cut for the wealthy or the punishment of women who have abortions. 
“We’re going to incest bigly. This is my number one priority America, no one has more respect for the bond between a father and his more attractive of two daughters,” beamed the soon to be president, who had as recently as last week stated the right to free speech, as outlined in the US constitution, could do with some changing. 
Insiders close to Trump sought to reassure some of his supporters, stating that he would waste no time in Making America Great Again. 
“We understand people’s passion for having their fortunes turned around by a president who pledged to bring jobs back, but he also wants to make people as equally vulnerable as you suffer first, so please be patient,” a Trump aide explained.

17129,Insiders Threaten to Expose Hillary's Pedophile Sex Ring!!!,"BREAKING BOMBSHELL! FBI NYPD INSIDERS LEAK - Email Scandal About to Take a SICK and TWISTED Turn    
Source: Victurus Libertas  


All of the following information was given to us by our insiders who have specific first-hand knowledge of the Hillary Clinton email scandal. It seems that things are about to heat up. We are told that of the 662,871 emails lifted from Anthony Weiner's computer, 11,112 emails are Huma Abedin's… and pay to play – including Saudis and Israelis. Meaning Huma was the one Hillary USED to communicate with foreign leaders via email for inside information and deals via Huma's computer. 

It has been established through many avenues, but mainly through Wikileaks, that the Clinton Foundation was just a farce set up in order to perform pay-to-play games with multiple entities, including foreign nations. Pay-to-play nations include: Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, Kazakhstan, and the Ukraine. 
Furthermore, we are told by one of our insiders that one email unequivocally confirms ISIS was created by CIA and Israeli Secret Intelligence Service , with help from Joe Lieberman, John McCain, and Lindsey Graham! An NYPD insider said the content they viewed did include State Department TOP SECRET emails. One file was called ""Life Insurance"". A second file was titled "" DNC Nuclear Arsenal "". 

A third file I'm sure Hillary definitely DOES NOT want released was a file labeled ""Intimate"" … according to this NYPD insider, this file contained X-rated photos of Huma and Hillary with a TEENAGER . 

NYPD detectives were sickened by what they saw, according to our insider, and they had threatened FBI field agents that they would leak this information, if the FBI did not ""step up and take off the kid gloves"" . At that point, 13 of the FBI agents in NYC were also threatening to leak the information. 

As you can imagine, the scandal has the entire Obama Administration in full panic. We are told there are emails that could send Loretta Lynch to prison , as well as Bill and Hillary. The Twitter post below, our sources sent us, verifying it is all true: 




Even MORE! 

The following information comes straight from an FBI Anonymous source, who is the senior analyst who posted on 4chan in early July of this year: 

Jim Comey learned that some of his own investigators were tipping off both Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton, thus making his job impossible. 

Comey sent a letter to Congress, knowing that ultimately it would expose Loretta Lynch as a dirty actor and the breadcrumbs would lead directly to Obama . The State Department is terrified now. Comey has assembled a small team of 40 agents, whom he has declared ""The Untouchables"" after the famous federal agent Eliot Ness. 

Comey has clamped down on all FBI agents and he expects a full-scale war between the FBI and the Department of Justice (DOJ), the White House, and the State Department. He has confirmed and understands that many sitting senators, congressmen, lobbyists, and power players are going to be indicted and prosecuted . One of the main targets of the probe is the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative. Among the targets under investigation are John Podesta, Huma, Cheryl Mills, CNN, ABC, NBC, etc. 

As it turns out, Weiner, Huma's husband, had been forwarding Huma's emails each time she came home and left her computer open. Huma appears to have been in touch with Saudi actors, and therefore, ESPIONAGE is strongly suspected. 
Comey and his 40 "" Untouchables "" are now preparing to take down the largest corruption ever witnessed in American history… which is what I think MUST happen if Comey is planning to stay part of the FBI. He lost so much respect and so much credibility with the first Hillary investigation, it would take something of this magnitude to allow him to face the public again. The Pentagon has internal players and outside players they call "" creatives "". Creatives are civilians who tend to be geniuses, malcontents, extreme hackers, or otherwise demonstrate brilliance in other useful areas. A Pentagon program called Cicada 3301 , which we have reported on previously, was created by several of these talented civilians. The program is now used to allow thousands of honest government people to report on their corrupt superiors, using what is called a DEAD BOX whistleblower encryption method so the non-corrupted government officials can report corruption and still remain safe. 

I've heard it said ""A vagina almost took down Bill, now will a Weiner take down Hillary?"" LOL! 

Again, thank you to all of the insiders, the whistleblowers, the good FBI agents, the good CIA agents, the good NYPD officers, and the non-corrupted government officials who want to see the truth exposed! Without these brave, wonderful, and morally erect individuals, our country would still be in the corrupted darkness. 



Vistors to Epstein's Little St. James Island include: 

• Ehud Barak , the former Prime Minister of Israel (1999-2001) – pedophile being procured underage girls by Epstein. Former Israeli Minister of Defense and also Deputy Israeli Prime Minister under Binyamin Netanyahu from 2009 to 2013. 

• Prince Andrew – British royalty – Jeffrey Epstein and his girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell pimped Epstein sex slave Virginia Roberts to Prince Andrew multiple times. The victim girls say Prince Andrew was very sexually sadistic; they despised this sick, twisted creature. 

• Kevin Spacey – actor in House of Cards. People tell me Spacey is gay, and my response is ""Have you ever heard of the word bisexual?"" Spacey is very good friends with 2 big-time pedophiles: Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Clinton. Spacey, big Hollywood star, has 3.78 million Twitter followers. 

• Alan Dershowitz – longtime friend of Epstein, as well as one of his defense lawyers. Dershowitz was the one who negotiated that absurd plea bargain for Epstein that gave him a 13-month (served) sentence and a 16 hour/day day pass so he could spend most of his time in his mansion. Epstein sex slave Virginia Roberts has said that Epstein made her have sex with Dershowitz numerous times. The real question is how many other underage girls was Dershowitz having sex with? Virginia Roberts says Dershowitz also witnessed Epstein's pedophilic activities.

17130,The Rajdeep Sardesai column for URT: “Indian Journalists have a reason to be proud”,"Tweet 
In this guest post for The UnReal Times, Rajdeep Sardesai explains why Indian journalists have a reason to be proud of themselves. 
It may be a sad day for Indian journalists given than Donald Trump won the presidency. But look at the brighter side. We have reasons to be proud. 
About 52% of British voters voted to leave the European Union and about 47% of Americans voted to elect Donald Trump as president while only about 30% Indians voted Narendra Modi for Prime Minister. 
Despite this Indian journalists at least asked whether there was a Modi wave and at least saw Modi becoming PM after the exit polls, albeit with a smaller majority than the actual results. 
Britain is a small country and so excuses like the tyranny of distance do not hold. Also, Americans got the results on the tyranically distant east coast and the west coast right but missed the results from the rural heartland completely. 
Further, in India every state is potentially a swing state wheres in the US, the journalists only had to analyze a few swing states to analyze the poll outcome, a task they failed at. 
The American and British journalists have clearly lost their moral compass. 
If journalists had just travelled across the country and tried Key Lime Pie in Florida, Pulled Pork Sandwich in North Carolina, Cheesesteaks in Pennsylvania, Buckeyes in Ohio and Grilled Sweet Corn on the Cob in Iowa, they would have got a better sense of which way the elections were going. 
You cannot shut down people’s opinions by your intellectual arguments. You have to engage people, debate, occasionally fist fight to get a sense of what is happening, even against people who may or many not have paisa and class. 
This is where the American journalists failed. 
The American media has not done its homework responsibly. Even when elections were less than a month away, we were still seeing skeletons tumbling out of the closet like Trump’s offensive remarks about women and FBI’s reopening and closing investigations about Hillary Clinton’s private email server. What was the media doing all this while? How did these 2 candidates get this far? In India, we rigorously investigated every aspect of our prospective prime minister before he even was in the reckoning for the post of the prime minister. 
Indian journalists do not need to give explanation to their readers like The New York Times had to do because we are neutral. 
As the world is bewildered by this resullts, I am writing a new book for their benefit titled “2016 – Elections that changed America”. Remember to preorder your copy.

17131,"If I have to hear from one more ad hominem ‘conservative,’ I’m gonna ad your hominem, bub","I would like to briefly sum up the message from the thought leaders of conservatism in this election cycle. 
This is their basic thesis: 
The problem with conservatism today is all these people who are wrong and stupid and horrible about everything. 
They usually don’t put it so bluntly. They frame it in terms of some people being fossils, or some people being opportunistic, or some people being narrow-minded, or one-dimensional in their thinking, or one thing or another that’s a tad more inventive than “wrong, stupid, and horrible.” But not much more inventive, really, when you get right down to it. 
It’s time to declare all stop, because this isn’t helping anything. 
David Brooks, who tries hard to speak without brutality, has produced the latest such meditation. I don’t want to pick on him. But he’s written an op-ed that seems to encapsulate a lot of what’s wrong with the current conservative discourse, starting with a passage like this: 
This is a sad story [about the state of conservatism]. But I confess I’m insanely optimistic about a conservative rebound. That’s because of an observation the writer Yuval Levin once made: That while most of the crazy progressives are young, most of the crazy conservatives are old. Conservatism is now being led astray by its seniors, but its young people are pretty great. It’s hard to find a young evangelical who likes Donald Trump. Most young conservatives are comfortable with ethnic diversity and are weary of the Fox News media-politico complex. Conservatism’s best ideas are coming from youngish reformicons who have crafted an ambitious governing agenda (completely ignored by Trump). 
We could pick this apart in a number of ways, but just start with the fact that it’s an exercise in contingent, situational innuendo about other conservatives. 
Older conservatives, apparently, are not “comfortable with ethnic diversity,” and are barkingly enthusiastic about “the Fox News media-politico complex.” My goodness, they sound awful. But what does that even mean? How do you distinguish between the implied states of being here? By what criteria? And what difference does it make, to the meaning and purposes of conservatism? 
It’s as if Barack Obama appeared on the scene, and a mere eight years later, no one can remember what it was like to talk about conservatism without talking about other conserva tives as if we’re all snotty gossip reporters. Heck, the folks at TMZ give their celebrity targets more mercy and benefit of the doubt. 
We can’t cover everything in one post. I want to look at just one aspect of the conservative dialogue, one that isn’t about the “Trump test,” or the “Fox News” test (who knew?), or the “ethnic diversity” test, or the “my Christianity is more righteous than yours” test, or any other test I see being applied out there. 
Here’s the topic: the loss of moral touchstones in our culture due to the breakdown induced by cultural Marxism. 
If we want to know why conservatives can’t talk to each other today, I’d suggest we start with that. 
The Berkeley test 
Many readers will have their own ideas of how to frame this with examples. I’m going to use this one . 
A mob of young people, who have been encouraged for years to believe very destructive things about their world, comes together at Berkeley. The mob’s purpose: to block white students from making their way to their classes. 
Here, in the next sentence, is the result of the breakdown induced by cultural Marxism. Conservatives, for the most part, can’t really think what to do about this. 
Conservatives have a good-hearted desire for a positive outcome. But this thing at Berkeley is a tough problem; it’s a real problem; it’s a perennial type of human problem (albeit with modern refinements) – and conservatives today are often too muddleheaded in their thinking to navigate this form of whitewater in human dynamics. 
The progressive left isn’t even in this discussion, because it sees no need to defend any rights for the white students in the case. 
It’s conservatives who have been stymied and silenced by the application of cultural Marxism. As little as 20 years ago, I think a lot more conservatives could have made a cogent case for what to do, based on core moral principles. Today, too many conservatives wander in a fog of doubt about those principles – and so they criticize each other instead, over irrelevancies like weariness vs. enthusiasm for Fox News. 
I propose the following as the conservative response to the event at Berkeley. Detain and identify everyone involved in blocking students’ passage to class – classes those students or the taxpayer, or both, are paying good money for them to attend. Stand up, as the school administration, and inform the miscreants that this won’t happen again, and if it does, they’ll be expelled. Put the campus police behind this policy. Follow through as necessary to stop the tortious interference with paying customers’ access to the service they are paying for. Expel students who don’t obey the rules. Penalize faculty who abet them and lead them astray. 
Conservatives who think we can have a working society without such impartial enforcement need only look around them to realize that we can’t. The evidence is staring us in the face, that there is no such condition as one in which we can deconstruct the rules of respect and decency through endless, unresolved, resentment-based “dialogue,” and yet also be able to function. 
“We” can’t function at all, when that so-called “dialogue” rules us. The “dialogue” serves to paralyze people who want good and positive things, and to leave only the people with destructive goals free to act. 
Reclaiming some core moral ideas 
There’s a beating heart of society that badly needs reclaiming, and it’s the function of moral authority and common expectations. Conservatives once thought systematically about that very issue, because they understood that one way or another, we are under authority. At Berkeley, students are under the de jure authority of the administration – or they are under the de facto authority of a mob. 
But on the “de jure” side, there should be a conservative alternative to what the progressive left wants to do with authority. The left wants to use government’s enforcement authority to dictate common expectations to everyone, about everything. That’s the progressive left in a nutshell. 
What I outlined above, for the Berkeley situation, is a conservative concept for the use of authority to enforce some minimum common expectations, in the interest of impartiality, equality of treatment, and rightful use of services lawfully obtained. It’s a decentralized concept too, with authority being wielded by the institution, and only implicitly backed by the government – but without the government being directly involved. 
That conceptual outline ought to be a recognized alternative to what is actually being done at Berkeley. But how many conservatives could really make the case for it today? How many conservatives can look at the Berkeley situation and do something besides shake their heads over how stupid everything has gotten? 
Conservatism itself is paralyzed by the nervous moral fear induced in people by cultural Marxism – which has been meant from the beginning to undermine moral confidence at the most basic level. Conservatism’s problem isn’t Donald Trump. Conservatism’s problem is that Donald Trump isn’t paralyzed by the guilt-mongering of cultural Marxism – but conservatism is . 
The answer is not for conservatism to insist that nothing move out there, until we decide what forms of paralysis will continue to suit us. The answer is that conservatives must fearlessly reclaim the necessary social concepts of authority and common expectations, and start producing results. 
The reality of 2016 
People know today that conservatives couldn’t handle the situation at Berkeley the way it should be handled. Conservatives would be afraid to. People also know that progressives won’t handle it properly. Progressives don’t want to. 
But oddly enough, weird old Donald Trump probably would handle it the right way. He’d recognize clearly the principle of lawful access to the service you’ve paid for. And he wouldn’t fear to enforce that principle, even though there’d be some caterwauling from the mob. 
People get that. 
Conservatives won’t make headway by being angry or alarmed that Trump seems to be walking off with the “effectiveness” rep. Sure, he probably has a lot of wrong thoughts in his head on the general topic of authority. Most people do. 
But the cost of remaining paralyzed by that concern is going up by the hour. Somebody’s got to take order to this problem. The people can’t afford to wait for conservatives to shake off the fear, and start acting again like what we believe in ought to be enforced. 
What do conservatives believe in? Litmus tests involving Fox News, and the excitement of an “ambitious governing agenda”? Other equally situational, buzz-thought-sounding checklists? If so, we are in a box, right where cultural Marxism wants us. 
I submit that that, and not intransigent personalities, is our problem. There’s a vacuum where our moral philosophy should be. We offer no alternative to the left’s grand vision for government, and the mob’s destructive rule by default. That’s not because of Donald Trump. It’s because we fear to engage with the reality that for human social life, there must be authority and common expectations. 
Our ears hear the wrong thing in those words. Cultural Marxism has taught us, as it has everyone else, to hear inferences like “Hitler” and “fascism.” 
But in fact, authority and common expectations, wielded accountably and from the right elements of society (like the family, parents, and faith, as well as the thoughtful consent of individuals), are necessary for liberty, prosperity, and hope . 
And only conservatives will think systematically about how to both limit authority, and use it beneficially. 
Don’t complain about Donald Trump if your contribution to conservatism is to fuss about the other conservatives who annoy you. The conservatives who disagree with you haven’t lost their way, in a static situation frozen back in 1955, because of something that’s wrong with them. There is no static situation. Given that reality, they’re just doing the best they can. 
Our entire civilization is in a great crisis, one that has been creeping up on us for decades. And that crisis is laying bare flaws in our conservative thinking that we have left unattended for too long. The flaws aren’t about failing to accept cultural Marxism and its prejudicial tropes (like “ethnic diversity,” used as a bell-ringer for implied guilt). The flaws are about failing to reject and defeat cultural Marxism. Its proper end is on the ash heap of history. Yet conservatives are paralyzed by being in thrall to it. We fix that, or we perish. 0 shares",0
17132,"Fake News: Despite Reports, Donald Trump Roars Back on Twitter","President Donald Trump spent much of his Sunday sending unfiltered messages on Twitter, despite reports that said White House attorneys would start vetting his messages and tweet less. [“The Fake News Media works hard at disparaging  demeaning my use of social media because they don’t want America to hear the real story!” Trump wrote on Twitter on Sunday night.  Trump remained mostly idle on Twitter during his trip overseas, using his account to thank his foreign hosts for an excellent trip. That caught the attention of reporters, who speculated that Trump would be more filtered in the future. “I’ve been told a factor in the lack of tweeting abroad overall was the presence of Melania Trump,” wrote a Politico reporter on Twitter. Trump was expected to travel on Saturday, presumably to his golf course, but the trip was canceled, likely due to rain. Instead, the president spent his afternoon on Twitter challenging the accuracy of stories about the White House. “It is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the White House are fabricated lies made up by the #FakeNews media,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Whenever you see the words ‘sources say’ in the fake news media, and they don’t mention names it is very possible that those sources don’t exist but are made up by fake news writers. #FakeNews is the enemy!” Trump also highlighted another big victory for Republicans in Montana, despite   hysteria suggesting that the Republican candidate would lose a special election in the state after “body slamming” a reporter. “Does anyone notice how the Montana Congressional race was such a big deal to Dems  Fake News until the Republican won?” Trump wrote, calling the story “poorly covered. ” He also criticized leaks of British intelligence from American sources to the news media. “British Prime Minister May was very angry that the info the U. K. gave to U. S. about Manchester was leaked,” he wrote. “Gave me full details!” The president also wrote about his plan for health care and tax cuts. “ObamaCare is dead  —   the Republicans will do much better!” he wrote, floating the option of adding more money to fund health care and promised that tax reform was moving along swiftly. “The massive TAX   that I have submitted is moving along in the process very well, actually ahead of schedule. Big benefits to all!” he wrote. Trump sent 10 messages on Twitter on Saturday, one of the busiest days on the social platform as president. Trump’s social media director Dan Scavino confirmed for reporters that Trump’s use of Twitter would continue. “Various news reports of attorneys vetting Donald Trump’s tweets are compliments of your #FakeNewsMedia  terrible ‘sources,’” he wrote. “#FACT”",0
17133,Extensive Study Contradicts Hillary Clinton Claim ‘Fake News’ Prompted Election Loss,"Hillary Clinton’s claim on Wednesday that she lost the 2016 presidential election in part because of the proliferation of “fake news” is contradicted by an extensive study that found   fake news didn’t significantly impact the outcome of the election. [That study recently received a positive nod from the Poynter Institute, the group helping Facebook determine whether certain news stories are “disputed. ”  Speaking at the Code Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif. Clinton claimed that she lost the election due a plot in which   fake news was disseminated on social media in a conspiracy orchestrated by Russian agents and bots. “Here’s what the other side was doing, and they were in a different arena,” she stated, according to a transcript from the event organizers. “Through content farms, through an enormous investment in falsehoods, fake news, call it what you will. ” Without citing evidence, Clinton claimed that “1, 000 Russian agents” were behind the conspiracy to disseminate fake information about her: The other side was using content that was just   false, and delivering it in a very personalized way, both sort of above the radar screen and below. And you know, look, I’m not a tech expert by any stretch of the imagination. That really influenced the information that people were relying on. And there have been some studies done since the election that if you look  —   let’s pick Facebook. If you look at Facebook, the vast majority of the news items posted were fake. They were connected to, as we now know, the 1, 000 Russian agents who were involved in delivering those messages. Clinton’s claim that voters were influenced by   fake news contrasts with a study titled “Social Media and Fake News in the 2016 Election,”   by economists Matthew Gentzkow of Stanford University and Hunt Allcott of New York University. The research utilized web browsing data, a database of what the authors claimed were fake news stories and a   online survey about news trends. The study concluded: Our data suggest that social media were not the most important source of election news, and even the most widely circulated fake news stories were seen by only a small fraction of Americans. For fake news to have changed the outcome of the election, a single fake news story would need to have convinced about 0. 7 percent of Clinton voters and   who saw it to shift their votes to Trump, a persuasion rate equivalent to seeing 36 television campaign ads. Poynter’s Chief Media Writer James Warren reported on the study: In sum, they conclude that the role of social media was overstated, with television remaining by far the primary vehicle for consuming political news. Just 14 percent of Americans deemed social media the primary source of their campaign news, according to their research. In addition, while fake news that favored Trump far exceeded that favoring Clinton, few Americans actually recalled the specifics of the stories and fewer believed them. “For fake news to have changed the outcome of the election, a single fake article would need to have had the same persuasive effect as 36 television campaign ads,” they conclude.

17134,"If the Pool Is Warm in Paris, Thank the Washing Machine - The New York Times","What do washing the dishes and uploading pictures to Facebook have in common? In most places, not much. But in Paris, they both could help heat your local swimming pool. To keep its bathers from shivering and its energy bills from ballooning, the city has developed some clever ways to reuse excess heat from two unconventional sources, computer servers and sewage. The wastewater from sinks, toilets, washing machines and so on pours into the Paris sewer system at an average temperature of 55 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit. At the Aspirant Dunand swimming pool in the 14th Arrondissement of Paris, the stuff runs through pipes underneath the pool, where the warmth is captured with the help of metal plates in the sewage pipes. A   system then transfers it to the pool water. The heat source at a swimming pool in the Butte aux Cailles neighborhood of the 13th Arrondissement will have to be kept much drier. A French   company called Stimergy is scheduled to install several hundred computer servers in the building’s basement over the next year. The heat thrown off by the servers will go to the boiler that heats water for the pool and   showers  —   a “data furnace,” if you will.   Martins, the city’s deputy mayor in charge of sports, has said it is all part of a plan to make the city’s swimming pools more “ ” in preparation for the 2024 Olympic Games, which Paris is in the running to host. (Los Angeles and Budapest are the other contenders.) “We wish to reduce the environmental impact and ecological footprint of these facilities, while reducing chemical product use,” Mr. Martins said of the pools. Making Paris more environmentally friendly is also high on the   list for Mayor Anne Hidalgo, a Socialist. To cut tailpipe emissions, her administration recently imposed  a   ban on vehicle traffic along a large section of the roadway that runs along the Seine.",0
17135,Shell Fired by ISIS at U.S. and Iraqi Troops May Have Contained Chemical Agent - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Fighters with the Islamic State fired a shell onto a military base in northern Iraq, home to American and Iraqi troops, that may have contained a chemical agent, military officials said on Wednesday. The shell did not explode, and the officials said no American or Iraqi troops were injured in the attack. The soldier who brought the shell in for testing has not shown any blistering in the 24 hours since handling it, said the military officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the situation. While the unexploded shell initially tested positive for a mustard agent, a second test was negative. Additional tests have been ordered. The attack, which was first reported by CNN, occurred at a base being used to prepare Iraqi forces for the offensive to retake Mosul from the Islamic State. Defense Department officials said that in the past few months Islamic State fighters have fired several shells containing mustard agents at Iraqi, Kurdish and American troops, and said the attacks generated a “moderate level of concern on a    basis. ” Last summer, the Islamic State used chemical agents  —   again, mustard gas  —   in an attack on Kurdish fighters in northern Syria and Kurdish news media outlets reported another mustard gas attack a few weeks later on Kurdish fighters in Makhmur, Iraq.",0
17136,‘This is slavery’: U.S. inmates strike in what activists call one of biggest prison protests in modern history,"Print 
In his 29 years in prison, David Bonner has mopped floors, cooked hot dogs in the cafeteria and, most recently, cut sheets of aluminum into Alabama license plates. 
The last job paid $2 a day — enough to buy a bar of soap at the commissary or make a short phone call. 
“This is slavery,” said Bonner, who is 51 and serving a life sentence for murder. “We’re forced to work these jobs and we get barely anything.” 
He was speaking on a mobile phone smuggled into his 8-by-12 foot cell in Alabama’s Holman Correctional Facility, where he and dozens of other inmates were on strike. 
David Bonner, an inmate at Alabama’s Holman prison, went on strike from his job last month at a factory on prison grounds where inmates manufacture state license plates. (Alabama Dept. of Corrections) 
They’re among a growing national movement of prisoners who have staged work stoppages or hunger strikes this fall to protest dismal wages, abusive guards, overcrowding and poor healthcare, among other grievances.

17137,White House CANCELS all Obama Appearances at Hillary Campaign Events! ! ! | RedFlag News,"
Superstation95.com 
Now, we know it's bad! The FBI Director's announcement that the Bureau had found more emails pertinent to its Hillary Clinton private e-mail server investigation, and was re-opening that investigation, sent shockwaves across the political spectrum this afternoon. 
The fact that the FBI made such an announcement is extraordinary in itself. Generally, the Bureau does NOT publicly reveal that someone is under investigation, never mind someone who is so high-profile, like an active candidate for President! So the revelation that the Hillary investigation is now re-opened is an absolute stunner on many levels. Frankly, all experts agree that it must be something extraordinary they found; something likely criminal. 
Adding to the drama was that the FBI Director did NOT coordinate the announcement with the White House or with the Department of Justice (DOJ) - which could be an effort by the Bureau to regain its lost reputation for Integrity. Keeping the White house and Justice Department out of the loop means they could not interfere prior to the announcement, and now that the announcement has been made publicly, neither the White House nor the DOJ can prevent the public from knowing something big is taking place. ""DEVASTATING REVELATIONS"" 
And ""big"" might be an understatement. Late Friday night, the White House very quietly CANCELED all of Barack Obama's scheduled campaign appearances on behalf of Hillary Clinton! The scheduled events, confirmed for months, were all quietly DELETED. See the Before and After images below: 
Whatever information the FBI has found must be completely devastating for Clinton. So devastating, that President Obama can no longer even be seen as supporting her candidacy! 
This FBI announcement has ""criminality"" written all over it. 
Stay tuned. ",0
17138,"Trump’s News Conference, Russia, Facebook: Your Evening Briefing - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump, in his fourth tumultuous week in office, boasted that his new administration was a “  machine. ” A news conference to announce his new nominee for labor secretary, R. Alexander Acosta, a former assistant attorney general for civil rights, turned into an extraordinarily raw and angry  . “The tone is such hatred,” he said of cable TV commentary. “I’m really not a bad person. ” _____ 2. Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina was confirmed as budget director. He is a fiscal hawk who will play a central role in the administration’s plans to reshape the federal government. But Mr. Trump’s nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, heads to a confirmation vote Friday amid an extraordinary wave of protest from former E. P. A. staff members. Such   confirmation battles have helped make Republican lawmakers unable to deliver on their promises of sweeping legislation on health care, overhauling the tax code or upgrading the nation’s infrastructure. They are particularly fractured on how to repeal and replace Obamacare. _____ 3. An uncounted number of immigrants across the country  —   carpenters and cooks, students, cleaners and grocery store owners  —   stayed home in protest of the Trump administration’s immigration policies. “We’re at a stage where we’re like, what else is there to do except organize and boycott?” said an activist in New York. The Justice Department said it would not seek a rehearing on the president’s targeted travel ban in a federal appeals court, saying a new order was in the works. _____ 4. Intelligence officials, on edge over Mr. Trump’s criticism of leaks related to his associates’   contacts with Russian intelligence agents, are resisting his plans to assign Stephen A. Feinberg, a New York billionaire, to review intelligence agencies. That Russian naval intelligence ship hanging off the East Coast? For some, it’s a symbol of current tensions, but the Coast Guard says there’s nothing all that unusual about it. Today’s episode of the podcast The Daily asks, did the Trump campaign collude with Russia? Listen from a computer, on an iOS device or on an Android device. _____ 5. In environmental news, a Greenpeace report tied the toxic waves of air pollution sweeping northern China to an increase in already excessive steel production last year, made counter to promised cuts. Scientists are also coming to understand the crucial importance of the vast, and endangered, seagrass meadows that surround every continent except Antarctica. _____ 6. The Islamic State has destroyed many of the prized antiquities and ruins in the Syrian city of Palmyra. But a new digital exhibition is helping preserve its legacy. The Getty has gathered   etchings of Palmyra and the oldest known photographs of the city. Most have not been seen widely before. “More than just testaments to a threatened archaeological inheritance,” our critic writes, they are “traces of explorations and crosscultural exchange too many now seek to shut down. ” _____ 7. Mark Zuckerberg updated Facebook’s mission statement in a   letter that was close to a political statement from the    executive. He expressed alarm over growing rejections of globalism and argued that “progress now requires humanity coming together not just as cities or nations, but also as a global community. ” And Snap Inc. Snapchat’s parent company, is aiming for a valuation of more than $20 billion as it nears what’s expected to be the biggest initial public offering in the tech world since Alibaba and Facebook. _____ 8. You don’t need us to tell you the world is full of paradoxes. But one of our sports reporters found a special case: Hunts for bighorn sheep  —   prized as challenging, and prohibitively expensive  —   are helping revive wild sheep populations and expand their territory. A permit sold for a record $480, 000 in 2013. _____ 9.   TV continues to showcase jokes about the White House and Russia. Stephen Colbert took particular aim at Mr. Trump’s efforts to blame the leakers who revealed Trump associates’ contacts with Russian intelligence over the last year. “Here’s the thing,” Mr. Colbert said. “It can’t be both fake news and an illegal leak of classified information. ‘Your honor, I did not murder that man. The real criminal is whoever filmed me strangling him. ’” _____ 10. Finally, the announcement of a double jailhouse wedding more than a century ago got Lena Dunham thinking about what it means to love and to be a “good woman. ” The notice is part of our review of 165 years of Times wedding announcements. In a turnabout, it was the women who were incarcerated. They were serving short sentences, but the 1912 article made no mention of their infractions. The grooms, the creator of HBO’s “Girls” writes, were able to get beyond societal expectations of the brides’ behavior: “They didn’t need them to be good girls. They were their girls. ” Photographs may appear out of order for some readers. Viewing this version of the briefing should help. Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.

17139,Survey: Democrats Rally Behind Fake News Industry  - Breitbart,"A new survey by Pew Research Center shows a stark divide between what Republicans and Democrats think of the media and its role as a watchdog of the federal government. [The two sides “now disagree more than ever on a fundamental issue of the news media’s role in society: whether news organizations’ criticism of political leaders primarily keeps them from doing things they shouldn’t  —   or keeps them from doing their job,” Pew reported about its survey.  Nine of 10 Democrats  —   or 89 percent  —   said the news media criticism keeps politicians in line, while only one in four Republicans assess the media that way. “That is a    gap, according to a new online survey conducted March   2017, among 4, 151 U. S. adults who are members of Pew Research Center’s nationally representative American Trends Panel,” Pew reported. Pew noted that this gap is much different than opinions of the media at the start of the 2016 presidential election year, when both parties assessed the media’s job as holding politicians accountable  —   74 percent of Democrats and 77 percent of Republicans. Pew has been asking this question since 1985, noting “while Republicans have been more likely to support a watchdog role during Democratic presidencies and vice versa, the distance between the parties has never approached the   gap that exists today. ” Until now the widest gap between Democrats and Republicans happened during the George W. Bush administration, when Democrats were 28 points more supportive of the watchdog role of the media than Republicans. Some changes in survey results could be related to the difference in people’s response to online surveys compared with previous surveys done by telephone, but “even taking possible mode effects into account, though, this year’s difference is so stark that it would still be the largest gap in the center’s polling on this question. ” Though not as dramatic a split, the two parties are also divided on whether the media favors one side in its political coverage, on how much trust they have in national news media, and whether or not national news organizations are doing a good job of keeping them informed. After Trump won the 2016 election, Pew surveyed voters about what news source they relied on and found: “When voters were asked to write in their ‘main source’ for election news,    Trump voters named Fox News. The next   main source among Trump voters, CNN, was named by only 8% of his voters. “Clinton voters, however, did not coalesce around any one source. CNN was named more than any other, but at 18% had nowhere near the dominance that Fox News had among Trump voters. Instead, the choices of Clinton voters were more spread out. MSNBC, Facebook, local television news, NPR, ABC, The New York Times, and CBS were all named by between 5% and 9% of her voters. ”",0
17140,Thousands Of “Organic” Beauty Products Found Containing Banned Chemicals,"Beauty products that claim to be ""organic"" or ""natural"" are far from it. Credit: Wise Geek 
When it comes to the term “organic,” there’s actually not as much regulation surrounding use of the word as consumers would like. The U.S. Department of Agriculture regulates organic claims in farm products, but it’s the controversial Federal Drug Administration that has control over cosmetics. 
Though the USDA has strict standards for organic food products, the FDA does not even have an official definition for the term “organic.” On their website, the question “Does FDA have a definition for the term organic?” is met with this answer: 
“No. FDA regulates cosmetics under the authority of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA). The term ‘organic’ is not defined in either of these laws or the regulations that FDA enforces under their authority.” 
The FDA does have some regulations that are overseen by the USDA via the National Organic Program, but the policing efforts when it comes to cosmetics are seriously lacking. By looking at EWG’s Skin Deep database, it was determined that over 5,000 products use the word “organic” in their brand name, product name, product label or list of ingredients. 
Depending on the placement of the word, certain regulations can be bypassed , and that’s why most of these products are actually horrible and receive the lowest Skin Deep score possible despite claiming to be “organic.” The use of chemicals is still allowed even in these seemingly wholesome products and some of these chemicals are so poor for your skin that they are banned in many countries. 
When a beauty product claims to be “made with 100% organic or natural ingredients,” it can be misleading because they are often referring to a single ingredient that is organic or naturally-derived rather than all of their ingredients. Other tactics used to confuse consumers include using the terms like “eco-friendly” or “vegan,” both of which are even less regulated than using organic on a label. Unless there is a third-party company that you trust backing these claims, they are likely a farce and have no substance. 
Since there is so much confusion surrounding these loaded words, consumers should be wary when they encounter products that make bold claims like this. Instead of taking their labels at face value, simply take a look at the ingredients and research a few to see what they really are. If the majority of them are things you cannot pronounce, it’s likely that most are made with synthetic chemicals and far from being “natural” or “organic.”

17141,Re: Obama Administration Allowing US Troops to Fight Alongside Shiite Militias & Hezbollah in Mosul,"Email 
It is never so clear cut in war as it is in the movies. There are no black and white hats that participants wear. So, we should not be surprised that in our war on terror we are sometimes forced to work with such bad people. But, there should be a line as to who we are working with. We should not be working with those who hate us as much as ISIS does. 
This seems to be the case as the assault against Mosul in Iraq begins in earnest. Groups that have been supported by our enemy and dedicated to our downfall should be excluded from the list of those fighting alongside our coalition. But, this administration does not draw such a hard line. 
Breitbart reports : 
A Reuters report has confirmed that Shiite militias closely aligned with the Iranian government and the terror group Hezbollah are actively participating in the liberation of Mosul, Iraq, from the Islamic State, following repeated denials from the Pentagon. 
The Shiite Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) have begun moving closer to Mosul, the capital of the Islamic State in Iraq and the nation’s second-largest city. The Islamic State captured the city in 2014, and the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi announced an operation to liberate the city earlier this month. The Iraqi army has agreed to cooperate with Kurdish Peshmerga forces and the U.S. government in the endeavor. 
These groups have been opposed to us and our allies. They are trained and paid by our enemy, Iran. And have committed atrocities against the Sunni citizens they were supposed to be helping. 
Once again, the president has turned a blind eye to those he has helped to take our place in this region.

17142,"Back on Her Feet at 85, Thanks to a Chair - The New York Times","In the middle of Marilyn Oshman’s otherwise cozy apartment on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, between an antique candelabra,   curtains and framed family photos, was a hospital bed. “I was dying,” Mrs. Oshman, 85, said. “I felt like I was in a prison in that lousy hospital bed. I couldn’t get out. ” She was bedridden and unable to walk because of venous stasis and cellulitis, a painful bacterial infection that covered the lower half of her body with large,   sores. Ordinary tasks, like getting out of bed every morning, became impossible. It was a drastic setback for someone who loved to move around on her own. As a child born and raised on Monroe Street on the Lower East Side, she loved exploring the city by foot. When she was 20, she had a job at a toy factory on Broadway, and it was there that she met her husband, David Oshman. They divorced in the late 1980s after 35 years of marriage, but Mrs. Oshman recounted fond memories of their active, early years together: Dancing the jitterbug on Fridays and Sundays at a club on the Lower East Side (“And he was some jitterbug dancer!” she said) fishing for pogies off a Coney Island pier and when they had children, a son and a daughter, taking family vacations to the mountains. Most of all, though, she said she loved doing the simpler things around the house: washing the walls, scrubbing the floors and cooking her favorite Jewish delicacies, stuffed cabbage and pot roast. But her health took a bad turn around 50 and deteriorated over the last three decades. For the last two years, Mrs. Oshman has made many trips between Mount Sinai Beth Israel hospital at 16th Street and First Avenue, and Gouverneur Health on the Lower East Side, and then back to her apartment. “Two years of hell,” she said. “And I mean hell. ” The back and forth became so strenuous that her doctor helped Mrs. Oshman get a hospital bed  —   not the centerpiece she would have preferred  —   so that she could receive medical care in her apartment. She was home, but she was miserable she could not lie comfortably in the new bed and often resorted to sleeping upright in a wheelchair. The ordeal became a dangerous cycle: She struggled to stand on her own, meaning she spent more time bedridden and immobile, which intensified the swelling, redness and pain. “I don’t want money, I don’t want jewelry,” Mrs. Oshman said, glancing at her still swollen legs, wrapped in compression socks. She added, through tears: “The only thing I want, at this stage in my life, is to be able to walk again. ” Over the summer, Mrs. Oshman’s doctor recommended a special recliner that could help her stand up, but Mrs. Oshman could not afford it. Every month she receives $1, 251 in Social Security benefits and $180 in food stamps, which is not enough to cover her monthly grocery bills. She pays $406 a month to Medicaid for the home care services, and $350 monthly toward her apartment. She was 62 when she retired from Citibank, where she was a greeter and an assistant to bankers, after she got too sick to continue working. Mrs. Oshman left with no retirement savings and does not receive financial support from her children. She has been getting help from the Educational Alliance, an organization that offers a social service program for people over 60. The Educational Alliance is a beneficiary agency of   of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. When the Alliance learned of Mrs. Oshman’s need for the recliner, the group used $799 from the Neediest funds to buy it. It arrived in August. “This chair saved my life, and I’m not kidding when I tell you that,” Mrs. Oshman said. “I was suffering with the hospital bed, and because of this chair, I’m able to walk again. It’s a blessing. I’m doing more for myself than I ever did. I’m changing myself. ” She has had to relearn tasks once taken for granted: standing up on her own, dressing herself and getting into the kitchen. “I’m living since I got this chair,” she said, tilting it up and down.

17143,"Biden Blames “Lazy American Women” For The Economy: “They Sit Around Doing Nothing, Only Hillary Can Force Them To Work” | EndingFed News Network","Email Print Democratic Vice President Joe Biden wants American women to get back in the workforce to help boost the economy. “If we just put all the women back to work, if they were able to afford childcare, we would increase the GDP in America by close to eight tenths of one percent,” he said. “That’s trillions of dollars over the next decade.” Biden made his remarks during a campaign event for Hillary Clinton at Chatham University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Tuesday. “The state of our economy could be characterized by a single word: pitiful,” he argued. “We’re still battling recession, I don’t care what the official stats are saying, America is still in recession. And we’re not doing anything about it.” He added that it was “lazy American women” who brought about the downfall of the economy, because “they sit around on their behinds, doing nothing and squandering their days away when they could be improving the country that has given so much to them.” “I’m not sure how exactly we got to this point, but we’re here and we need to move. Like, yesterday,” he said. “Mark my words and mark them well,” he addressed the crowd. “Hillary Clinton is the only one who can force American women to go to work. This is true because of a number of reasons. First, she’s a woman herself and not just any woman; she’s a self-made woman. So you better believe what she’s saying is true and has been tried and tested in practice plenty of times.” “Second, Hillary Clinton understands how difficult it can be to give up the status of a free-loader when your husband is the bread-winner of the household and the wife is expected to tend to the house, the children, make sure dinner is served and always be in the mood for marital duties. She’s been all that and she’s learned how to break free from it, the hard way, I might add,” Biden continued. “Today’s women are pampered and aren’t used to rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done on their own,” the vice president said. “They’re too dependent, too weak and too lazy to contribute to the economy. The reason for that is they’ve learned how to manipulate men by employing one of the most fundamental laws of economics: when a sought-after commodity becomes short in supply, the demand for it rises even higher.” “Now, that’s all fine and dandy when it comes to their personal interests, but if you look at the big picture, it’s the economy that’s missing out on valuable workforce. And that’s why we need to get them off their lazy behinds and get them into their workplaces. And like I said, Hillary Clinton is the only one who can do it, which is what makes her the ideal candidate for the next President of the United States. We need to heal this country, folks, not run it into the ground even deeper,” Biden concluded. Join us on Facebook to Stop The Takeover. Click on the button to subscribe. ",0
17144,Review: Jonah Lehrer’s ‘A Book About Love’ Is Another Unoriginal Sin - The New York Times,"Jonah Lehrer has had time to work on “A Book About Love. ” His schedule no longer teems with lucrative speaking engagements. He no longer writes for The New Yorker or contributes to “Radiolab” on NPR. With this project  —   his shot at redemption, provided to him by Simon  Schuster after his public tumble from grace  —   Mr. Lehrer could have written something complex and considered. Books are still the slow food of the publishing business. Yet here is Mr. Lehrer, once again, serving us a nonfiction McMuffin. I wasn’t expecting it. I was one of those weirdos who thought Mr. Lehrer would make a respectable comeback. He’s bright. He’s a decent stylist. He languished in the public stockade for weeks for his sins. Why wouldn’t he try something personal, something soulful, something new? No clue. But he didn’t. His book is insolently unoriginal. For those who don’t know the author’s story: Mr. Lehrer, 35, was once one of our culture’s cuddliest pop intellectuals, specializing in neuroscience. From almost the moment he published his first book at 26, magazine editors couldn’t get enough of him. He wrote two more books and became a   speaker on the guru rental market. But in the summer of 2012, he was caught recycling old material for his new blog at The New Yorker. Then it was discovered he’d plagiarized several blog posts while working at Wired magazine. And then the journalist Michael Moynihan found that Mr. Lehrer had invented quotes from Bob Dylan for his third book, “Imagine,” and misused the words Mr. Dylan actually did say. Later investigations showed that “Imagine” contained many other factual errors. The book was pulled from shelves. So, too, was his second book, “How We Decide. ” Errors in even the finest works of nonfiction are ridiculously common. Gay Talese, who’s been writing for almost twice as long as Mr. Lehrer has been alive, just had to concede that parts of his coming book, “The Voyeur’s Motel,” could not be wholly accurate after a reporter from The Washington Post phoned to point out he’d missed essential information about his subject. What rankled about Mr. Lehrer was his “cavalier attitude about truth and falsehood,” in the words of the writer Charles Seife, who reviewed his work for Wired. In retrospect  —   and I am hardly the first person to point this out  —   the vote to excommunicate Mr. Lehrer was as much about the product he was peddling as the professional transgressions he was committing. It was a referendum on a certain genre of canned,   social science, one that traffics in bespoke platitudes for the middlebrow and rehearses the same studies without saying something new. Apparently, he’s learned nothing. This book is a series of duckpin arguments, just waiting to be knocked down. Perhaps the flimsiest: that Shakespeare’s famous   teenagers have come to define our understanding of love. “But this description of love  —   the Romeo and Juliet version  —   is woefully incomplete,” he writes in the introduction. Love is not just lust, madness, or a great tidal flow of dopamine, he is quick to tell us. “Love is a process, not a switch. ” Fine. But is there really any evolved adult who believes otherwise? When a widow wakes up sobbing in the middle of the night, mourning the loss of her husband of 50 years, is she mourning the loss of passion, giddy infatuation and great sex? No matter. Mr. Lehrer bangs this same note throughout the book. On Page 53, he says we wrongly assume that “what we feel at first sight” will help us predict   relationship outcomes on Page 104, he reminds us that our psychological needs have little to do with the romance of   songs. On Page 246, he’s still saying it’s commonly believed that “once we fall in love, the love is supposed to take care of itself. ” But no: “This is wrong on every level. ” You know what he says love requires? Hard work. “When a relationship endures,” he explains, “it is not because the flame never burns out. It is because the flame is always being relit. ” There’s a lot of   counsel in this book, often followed by academic citations. It’s like reading an advice column by way of JSTOR. To the extent that he has one, Mr. Lehrer’s argument is that humans crave connection. He borrows heavily from attachment theory to explain how we approach relationships. We seek secure attachments to our parents, to our spouses, even to God, the ultimate “secure base. ” The more securely attached we are, the healthier and more productive we are. He then hurls one   study after another at us to build his case, which really never required much building. At times, his book becomes such a dense plague of studies, I had no idea where Mr. Lehrer was heading. He devotes an entire subsection to the plasticity of our memories, noting how they alter every time we recall them. I fail to see how this relates to love, exactly. He says it’s because “if our memories never changed, then we might adapt to their pleasures. ” But I suspect it’s really because Mr. Lehrer can phone this material in, having already riffed on it ad nauseam: In his first book, in a segment on Radiolab, in a number of blog posts and columns. It’s his secure base. Most criminally: Love, we must assume, was Mr. Lehrer’s salvation during his time of crisis. But he never once explains how. He barely  —   and I mean barely  —   mentions his wife. In a couple of places, he mentions that his brief exile made him a better father, but it’s all terribly perfunctory. The most he’ll say is that he’s become “a little more aware of what matters. ” He’s written a book about love that has no heart. As for the question that’s on everyone’s mind  —   did Mr. Lehrer play by the rules in this book?  —   I think the answer is complicated, but unpromising. In an author’s note, Mr. Lehrer says that he sent his quotes to everyone he interviewed and that his book was independently  . And it’s true that this book contains far more citations than his previous work. But I fear Mr. Lehrer has simply become more artful about his appropriations. At one point, for instance, he writes: “We don’t love our kids despite their demands we love them because of them. Caregiving makes us care. ” I stopped dead when I read that sentence. Reread it. And read it again. It sounds to me like a clever adaptation of one of the most beautiful lines in “The Philosophical Baby” by Alison Gopnik: “It’s not so much that we care for children because we love them as that we love them because we care for them. ” I’m pretty certain Mr. Lehrer read Ms. Gopnik’s quote. Why? Because I cite it in my own book  —   which he cites, twice. (Though not for that.) He also wrote about “The Philosophical Baby” for The Boston Globe. In his chapter on memory, I noticed a similar rewrite of a phrase from Sarah Bakewell’s “How to Live. ” Though at least he credits Ms. Bakewell’s ideas. These may seem like minor offenses. But what they betoken is a larger sort of intellectual dishonesty. If you squint, you’ll see that Mr. Lehrer often rehashes arguments made by others, both in structure and content, when writing parts of his book. Sometimes he credits these people sometimes he doesn’t. But the point is, he’s relying on their associations and connections. I’m guessing media reporters and other diligent reservists in the press corps will find a number of such examples. It suffices, for now, to say this: Mr. Lehrer devotes many pages in “A Book About Love” to how we grow and evolve. “People change,” he writes in his Coda. “That simple fact is one of the great themes of the longitudinal studies in this book. ” Perhaps Mr. Lehrer has changed  —   personally. But not sufficiently as a writer. I fear it may be time, at long last, for him to find something else to do.",0

17147,Clarion: Christian Militia Celebrates in Reclaimed Iraqi City - Breitbart,"This story originally appeared at the Clarion Project.  The Nineveh Plain Protection Units (NPU) a Christian militia in Iraq, is celebrating the hoisting up of a new cross in the destroyed city of Qaraqosh (also known as Baghdeda) that once had 50, 000 Christians living there. The event heralded the opening of a new chapter in the city and, hopefully, for the Christians and other victims of Islamist genocide in Iraq. The NPU thanked a French organization named “SOS Chretiens Orient” (SOS Eastern Christians) that sponsored the cross and the rebuilding of homes in the area. I took a tour of one NPU member’s home in this city in January, a video of which can be seen here. Those I met expressed that their churches and homes may have been destroyed, but their faith is stronger and they are determined to return and fill the church pews more than they did before. The excitement is palpable on the NPU’s social media, with Easter holiday celebrations taking place again and preparations being made for the Christians who will soon return.

17150,UNREAL: NRCC Ad Brags That GOP Congressman Opposed…,"The Blaze reported : 
The National Republican Congressional Committee cut an ad for one of its endangered congressional candidates, touting him as an “independent voice” who “stood up to” Republican nominee Donald Trump “months ago.” 
Rep. Bob Dold, who represents a heavily Democratic district in northeastern Illinois, is in danger of losing his House of Representatives seat to former Democratic Rep. Brad Schneider. This is the third time in three cycles the two politicians have faced off in the pendulum-like district — first Schneider unseated Dold in 2012, then Dold unseated Schneider in 2014. 
The NRCC went on to criticize the Democrat nominee for voting with his party 90 percent of the time and touted their candidate as “one of the most bipartisan members of Congress.” 
In the ad, a clip from March 2016 showed Dold take a swipe at Trump in an interview with the Clinton News Network: “I think Donald Trump has disqualified himself.” 
CNN reported on Aug. 10, 2016: 
One of the first Republicans to oppose Trump, the Illinois representative told WLS May 6: “I will not support Donald Trump,” referring to Trump’s comments about women, Muslims, Latinos and POWs. “We’re looking for a uniter, not a divider,” he said. 
Supporting: Will write in a candidate. 
Republicans like Dold are a big part of the reason why Trump has been so successful. The Republican Party has sold out this country and the American people who used to support them. 
The veil has been lifted and many Americans have woken up to the fact that establishment Republicans are in on the globalist agenda and are one in the same with the Democrats. They attempt to squabble over minor issues to make it seem as if there’s a difference, but the reality is that they’re all in on it. 
They’re selling out our country, and many of the so-called principled Republicans truly want a Hillary Clinton presidency because they want her globalist agenda to succeed. 
The NRCC’s praise for Dold and criticism of his opponent evidences the fact that they’re in on it. They criticize the Democrat for siding with his party but praise Dold for being “bipartisan,” which might as well be Washington-ese for Republicans rolling over while Democrats fundamentally transform this country. 
This country is at a precipice. There are those who want to maintain national sovereignty and get back to what made America great, and there are those that want globalism and to eviscerate America as we know it. 
So to the NRCC: there is nothing “principled” about giving our country away, and many of us are on to your game.",0
17151,It’s Not Zika – Substantial Evidence Suggests Pesticides Really To Blame For Birth Defects,"posted by Eddie Argentinian and Brazilian Doctors claim that the application of a pesticide to Brazil’s drinking water is to blame for the increase in Zika-associated birth defects. With 2014’s Ebola panic all but forgotten, many Americans are now in a frenzy over the spread of the Zika virus. The Zika virus, and the media-driven panic of its spread, began in late 2015 following widespread birth deformations in Brazil, which were quickly linked to Zika. The link between Zika and microcephaly, the most striking birth defect allegedly caused by the virus, was largely based on a scientific paper by A.S. Oliveira Melo that found Zika in the amniotic fluids and other tissues in two cases. That’s right, only two women were examined in the study and the virus wasn’t even found in their blood, just the amniotic fluid. The New York Times reported in February of this year that only 17 of the 404 confirmed cases of microcephaly, only 4.2%, tested positive for Zika. In response to these numbers which show no correlation between the presence of Zika infection and microcephaly, the government and “many researchers” said that this statistic “may be largely irrelevant, because their tests would find the presence of the virus in only a tiny percentage of cases.” Another indicator that the increase in microcephaly and other birth defects may have another cause altogether was Zika’s effects in Colombia. According to Colombia’s government , public health officials have so far diagnosed more than 17,000 pregnant women with Zika but only 18 cases of Zika-associated microcephaly have been reported, less than 0.2%. The birth defect most frequently associated with Zika is microcephaly, an incurable condition that causes brain damage and small head size. Amidst the glaring lack of basis for linking Zika to microcephaly, a group of Argentinian doctors, Médicos de Pueblos Fumigados, have published a report citing a pesticide used to mosquito larva as the real cause of the birth defects. According to the report , the area where most of the affected Brazilian families live, Pernambuco, had its drinking water treated for 18 months with a chemical larvicide that produces fatal birth defects in mosquitoes. Pernambuco reported over 4,000 cases of microcephaly in 2015. The use of the pesticide in water supplies was done as part of a government mosquito control program against other mosquito-borne diseases. The doctors go on to say that in previous Zika epidemics, no birth defects were recorded, despite infecting 75% of the population. They also warned about other anti-Zika control measures of the Brazilian government, such as the introduction of GM mosquitoes, have completely failed and may have dangerous consequences for the environment. A separate group of Brazilian medical professionals, the Brazilian Association for Collective Health, have seconded these claims and have also expressed their belief that the Zika scare is a commercial maneuver from agrochemical companies, which, they say, are deeply integrated into the Latin American ministries of health, as well as the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organisation. The symptoms of Zika are identical to the symptoms of mild pesticide poisoning. The pesticide used by the Brazilian government is called pyriproxyfen. Pyriproxyfen was sold under the brand name SumiLarv to the Brazilian government by Sumimoto Chemical Inc., a Japanese strategic partner of Monsanto. The partnership between the two companies began in October 2010 and the collaboration focuses on the US, Brazil, and Argentina. In the US, pyriproxyfen is chiefly marketed as Nylar , an anti-flea product for pets. The EPA found it to be highly toxic to all aquatic life, including fish, plankton, and insects, but ultimately decided to label pyriproxyfen only as “slightly toxic.” According to the CDC , long-term exposure to pyriproxyfen can have long-term effects on the blood and liver, resulting in anemia, impaired functions, and tissue lesions. There are no studies regarding its reproductive effects. However, in animal studies , pyriproxyfen doses of 300 mg/ kg / day and higher caused an increase in “visceral and skeletal” variations in rats, such as deformations of the skull. Despite this evidence, the EPA declined to list pyriproxyfen as having negative reproductive effects. Interestingly, symptoms of pesticide poisoning are very similar to the alleged Zika symptoms that Brazilian women have experienced: rash/skin irritation, conjunctivitis, headaches, and muscle/joint pain. Is the Zika virus being used to cover up what may actually be one of the worst mass poisonings on record? What are your thoughts? Please share, like, and comment on this article! source:",0
17152,Katy Perry: Trump’s Victory Brought Back Childhood ’Trauma’,"Pop star Katy Perry  —   one of Hillary Clinton’s top celebrity endorsers during the 2016 presidential campaign  —   says Donald Trump’s victory brought back painful childhood trauma. [“I was really disheartened for a while it just brought up a lot of trauma for me,” the    “Chained to the Rhythm” singer said in a cover story interview for this month’s Vogue magazine. “Misogyny and sexism were in my childhood: I have an issue with suppressive males and not being seen as equal. ”  “I felt like a little kid again being faced with a scary, controlling guy,” Perry added. “I wouldn’t really stand for it in my work life, because I have had so much of that in my personal life. ” Months after the election, Perry has established herself as a vocal member of the   “Resistance” movement. A month after Trump’s inauguration, Perry performed at the 2017 Brit Awards alongside giant skeletons meant to skewer Trump and U. K. Prime Minister Theresa May. Just ten days prior, Perry performed at the 2017 Grammy Awards while wearing an armband that read “PERSIST,” along with a Planned Parenthood button. The singer’s “purposeful” pop has introduced what the singer hopes will be a new era of political activism, a time that has coincided with an “awakening” of young people she says are now more politically engaged than ever before. “It’s an awakening that was necessary because I think we were in a false utopia, we can’t ever get that stagnant again,” Perry explained. “I am so grateful that young people know the names of senators. I think teenage girls are going to save the world! That age group just seems to be holding people accountable. They have a really strong voice  —   and a loud one. ” Just this week, Perry posted a picture of Clinton sporting a pair of pumps, called The Hillary, that the singer says were inspired by the former secretary of state. ⚡️POWER PUMP⚡️your way over to https:  .  for the last few hours of the spring 25% sale❗@HillaryClinton is wearing #TheHillary pic. twitter.   —   Katy Perry (@katyperry) April 11, 2017,  The $139 pumps, now for sale on Perry’s website, include a clear heel embedded with golden moon and stars meant to inspire those who wear them to “step in and reach for the stars. ”   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson",0

17155,ManTracker: How to Be One and How to Avoid One: “The Hunter Can Become The Hunted At Any Time”,"This article was originally published by Jeremiah Johnson at Tess Pennington’s ReadyNutrition.com . 

ReadyNutrition Readers, we’re going to cover some of the basics on how to track man, and some tips on how to keep from being tracked by men . All of your camouflage is to no avail if you are awakened by a boot kicking you in the ribs as you’re curled up in your sleeping bag in a hidey-hole. Please keep in mind: this is a post-SHTF action and/or a life-threatening situation that would call for the tracking of another human being.
Man is the Most Dangerous Creature of All Be aware: this is not deer-hunting or tracking a game animal . The rules are different, because a deer won’t double back on you, climb a cliff, and snipe you with a suppressed .308 as you cross a predetermined, pre-ranged spot. If you are adept at tracking game, these skills can help you, but keep in mind you’re tracking the most dangerous, intelligent, and resourceful creature of all: man. You’re tracking down a creature with the natural and learned instincts of a hundred thousand generations of hunters and killers…no matter what culture or creed. Man is the most dangerous creature of all. Never forget that. Respect the potential of the guy or gal you’re tracking. Respect it, and let it temper your emotions and judgment as you’re tracking.
To track a man, you need to be aware of your surroundings, the changes in it, and use deductive reasoning all in combination as you’re moving. There are some questions you always need to ask yourself as you are following a man as well as observations you must make:
Are you keeping aware of the potential for ambush? Most people don’t like to be followed, and in a SHTF situation you can bet the other guy is playing for keeps. Are you walking right into a trap? As you study the terrain in front of you, are you “gaming” it in your mind? Remember Rule #1: the hunter can (and often does) become the hunted at any time . NOTE: THIS QUESTION # 1 AND RULE # 1 BOTH APPLY CONCURRENTLY AT ALL TIMES! THEY ACCOMPANY AND SUPERCEDE ALL OF THE SUBSEQUENT QUESTIONS AND RULES!
Minor deviations in the terrain (path) that would not normally be there: Broken hardwood branches at chest or head height, broken or “moved/displaced” vegetation, the tracks on the ground, bark rubbed from the face of fallen logs…. all of these are good indications that man has come this way. Major deviations in the terrain/path : perhaps a small mound of earth in the woods with what appears to be a “dent” followed by a long groove and crushed grass to either side…a good indicator your quarry stepped on the mound and slipped. Perhaps some good-sized trees chopped down, or good sized branches removed with an edged tool. These could be either fighting positions/lean-to’s/fortifications, or ground cover respectively. Look for signs of the hand of man where it is obvious. Changes to the earth . This means the ground . You’ve been tracking your quarry through a swamp, and now you emerge in a grassy field. Look for signs of tracks, and for mud to be tracked through the grass as well. If you’ve been walking through a dry riverbank with clay for a bed, then the color of clay will show up in front of you in the tracks of your target. Trash/detritus . Man is a messy creature, and no matter how careful he always messes up. It could be a food wrapper, or a cigarette butt he forgot to tote out with him. It could be a piece of paper or a dropped tool or even ammunition. It could also be part of a meal…even something so innocuous as crumbs. Your job as the tracker is to spot these deviances as they come out to meet your eyes. Smell . Man is (especially after several days in the bush or after physical exertion) a stinky creature. Yes, you can smell many things of man: his sweat, his deodorants and perfumes, his tobacco products (you can smell a cigarette for a long distance in the woods), and, of course, his stool. This last one (don’t laugh) is a really good giveaway, as most people will relieve themselves and not worry about covering up what they produce. This is not mentioned relative to hygiene, however, but in relation to tracking. Such people not caring about how they relieve themselves won’t give much consideration to someone using it to trail them. Noise . Man is, indeed, a noisy creature. He breathes heavily, belches, flatulates, grunts, groans, complains, talks loudly, and snores. All of these can be used to your advantage to find your quarry. He also drops things, bangs and bumps into things, and clatters metal against metal. He falls down, breaking branches and he curses or moans, depending on how badly he hurts himself. He also communicates to his fellow humans, either with a radio or with his voice. Light Discipline : man is as stubborn as they come on this one. Those flashlights are never “red lensed” and kept under a poncho or jacket as they should be…just everyone flashing the lights all over the place. Same for the cigarettes. Instead of cupping their hands around them and keeping the cigs low, there’s that orange dot right out to your front, head height. Man loves to use the flashlight when he’s moving around at night. It can be his undoing, and to your advantage if you look for your quarry being careless with the light. Changes to the quarry’s flight . A hunted man will always know he is being hunted. You need to be aware of an increased pace, a change of direction, changes in elevation…all factors that will indicate either distress or concern on the part of your quarry. The pace change can be noticed by footprints, especially the distance widening or shortening between them. Widening means he’s taking off. Shortening means the terrain is becoming more difficult or he’s tiring, or both. The runner usually uses the balls of his feet with a shallow heel-print. The walker sets his heels into the soil more deeply. Tread Depth : we covered this a little in #9, and in addition, if the guy has a size nine boot print and is really sinking into the earth? Well, he’s probably carrying some serious stuff in the form of supplies and/or weapons. If your search is proceeding too well and too smoothly? It’s an ambush . We’ve covered these fundamentals, because believe it or not, it is easier to avoid the hunter if you first have been the hunter. What we just covered forms the basis for avoiding someone who is pursuing you. Believe it or not, you can practice this stuff in the woods with family and/or team members. It makes for both a good workout and a challenge to actually implement stuff you learn. Part Two we’ll focus on how to get away from the bad guys trying to find you. Until then keep studying and practicing. It’ll pay off in the end…especially after the SHTF. JJ out!

17156,Popularity contest: Dems introduce bill to abolish Electoral College,"VIDEOS Popularity contest: Dems introduce bill to abolish Electoral College The Electoral College goes back to the 1787 Constitutional Convention, where delegates “distrusted the passions of people” and lacked faith in a direct democracy’s ability to select a president.   12:01 PM EST 


The Electoral College has been under fire since Donald Trump became president-elect, and now Democrats in Congress are moving ahead to dismantle the “outdated, undemocratic system.” 
Last Tuesday’s surprise victory for Trump left many Democrats side-eyeing the Electoral College, as the 2016 election marked the second time in recent history that the popular vote failed to align with the actual electoral result. 
Senator Barbara Boxer (D-California) filed new legislation on Tuesday that would replace the Electoral College with the popular vote. 
“ The Electoral College is an outdated, undemocratic system that does not reflect our modern society, and it needs to change immediately ,” she said in a statement. 
In 2012, Trump agreed with her. Then on Tuesday, the president-elect tweeted in defense of the institution. 
He has so far attained 290 electoral votes, surpassing the 270 required to win the presidency. The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy. 
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2012 The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different! 
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 15, 2016 
The popular vote is still being tallied. Late Tuesday, the Associated Press reported Hillary Clinton had 61,438,917 votes, nearly a million more than Trump’s 60,646,655. 
In the past week, over 4 million US citizens have signed a petition asking electors of the Electoral College to vote against the will of their state and in favor of Clinton to reflect the popular vote. The petition has met a lot of criticism, largely because the December vote of electors is mostly ceremonial, and the likelihood of such an unprecedented turnaround is extremely low.

The history of the Electoral College goes back to the 1787 Constitutional Convention, where delegates “ distrusted the passions of people ” and lacked faith in a direct democracy’s ability to select a president. So, when the electors would gather to cast their votes, they were left to use their best judgment to make the choice. As the system evolved into a two-party one, the Electoral College ballot continued to grow with them and created a winner-takes-all policy for most states. 
Trump is the fourth US president to win the Electoral College vote and lose the popular vote. John Quincy Adams, the sixth US president, won his election in 1824 through a vote of the House of Representatives when neither he nor Andrew Jackson won a majority of the Electoral College votes, although Jackson had won the popular vote.",0
17157,American Destroyer Fires Warning Shots at Iranian Boats - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   In a vivid illustration of the tensions between the United States and Iran, an American Navy warship fired warning shots at Iranian boats that were racing toward it near the Strait of Hormuz, Defense Department officials said on Monday. The episode occurred Sunday when four Iranian fast boats came within 900 yards of the U. S. S. Mahan, a guided missile destroyer that was escorting an amphibious warship with 1, 000 Marines on board and a Navy oiler. When the Iranian boats did not respond to a radio call and flares signaling them to stop, the American destroyer fired three warning shots with a .  machine gun. A Navy helicopter also dropped smoke grenades. There was no damage to the Iranian vessels, and they did not return fire. It was the first time the Navy had fired warning shots at an Iranian boat since Aug. 24. Though the boats’ approaches are essentially a form of harassment, they point to the risk of military confrontation in a region that is bristling with Western, Arab and Iranian forces.   Donald J. Trump vowed during the presidential campaign to take military action against Iranian ships that approached American vessels in a threatening manner. “With Iran, when they circle our beautiful destroyers with their little boats and they make gestures at our people that they shouldn’t be allowed to make, they will be shot out of the water,” Mr. Trump said at a rally in September. There were 35 close encounters between American and Iranian vessels in 2016, most of which occurred during the first half of the year, and 23 encounters in 2015. “We had a significant number of these before,” Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters. “They had largely stopped. ” The most serious episode took place in January 2016, when Iran detained and ultimately freed 10 sailors who had unintentionally entered its territorial waters while cruising from Kuwait to Bahrain. On Sunday, Iranian boats approached the American ships six times before they got so close that the Mahan fired warning shots. “This was an unsafe and unprofessional interaction, and that is due to the fact that they were approaching at a high level of speed, with weapons manned, and disregarding repeated warnings,” Captain Davis said. There was no immediate comment from the Iranian authorities. But the Iranian military has signaled its intention to be active in the area and is planning a war game in the region this month. “The navy will practice    tactics during the drill, including modern warfare tactics, for the first time,” Habibollah Sayyari, the Iranian Navy commander, said, according to Iranian news organizations.",0

C.  —     DNC Chair Tom Perez called President Donald Trump’s first joint address to Congress “Steve Bannon on steroids with a smile” during an interview with Rachel Maddow on MSNBC, where he appeared with his appointed deputy chair, Keith Ellison. [Ellison laughed, raised his eyebrows, and looked at Perez after he made that statement.  According to one MSNBC reporter, when asked about Trump’s speech, Perez sarcastically clapped: “Oh, he read a TelePrompTer!! It’s like my kid ate and didn’t spill!” When asked about the speech DNC Chair Perez sarcastically clapped:  ”oh, he read a TelePrompTer!! It’s like my kid ate and didn’t spill!”  —   Michael LaRosa (@MichaelLaRosaDC) March 1, 2017,  Perez said Trump started out his speech with “alternative facts. ” He charged that Trump “took credit for things [he] had nothing to do with  …     . All these new companies are adding jobs. ” He added, sarcastically, that “since January 20, the Washington Wizards have one of the best records in the NBA, including they beat the Golden State Warriors tonight. Must have been Trump. ” Trump started his speech on Tuesday night reminding the nation of Black History Month and condemning the recent spate of   attacks: Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our Nation’s path toward civil rights and the work that still remains. Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week’s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a Nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms. Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice  —   in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present. That torch is now in our hands. And we will use it to light up the world.  I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. In his interview with MSNBC, Perez continued, “Then you move on to immigrant baiting. You know, that immigrant baiting is like the salt and pepper on the table of that Trump administration. ” He said, “And then you close it up with a bunch of promises that you’ll never keep. And frankly, some of the promises, I’m glad they can’t keep, because the Affordable Care Act is a lifesaver. It’s not a job killer. ” Ellison took the opportunity to recruit for the Democratic Party. “This is a good time to get   with the Democratic Party,” “We have a level of organization, unity, commitment and passion that, I think, is going to serve the American people very well. ” Perez added: “Our most important area of agreement, and we have many, is that we need to redefine the mission of the Democratic Party. ” Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope @AdelleNaz",0

17161,"Planned Parenthood Annual Report Shows Abortions, Taxpayer Funding, Profits Up - Breitbart","After a   delay, Planned Parenthood has released its annual report, which shows increases in the number of abortions performed, taxpayer funding, and profits since its last report. [With Planned Parenthood’s annual reports usually published in late December or early January, the delay this year has stirred considerable speculation as to the reason.  The total number of patients seen by Planned Parenthood has dropped since last year. According to the   report, that number was given as 2. 5 million, while the latest report gives the number of patients seen as 2. 4 million. In   Planned Parenthood reports performing 328, 348 abortions  —   an increase of 4, 349 abortions over the 323, 999 abortions the group states it performed in  . The organization also reported 2, 945, 059 contraception services in   and 2, 808, 815 of the same services in its latest report, a drop of 136, 244 within a year. Similarly, Planned Parenthood reports 9, 419 prenatal services in its latest report, a significant drop since a year ago, when the group claimed 17, 419 of the same services. In   the group also reported having performed 682, 208 cancer screening and prevention services. However, in   Planned Parenthood reports 665, 234 of the same services, a drop of 16, 974. With regard to its revenue, the new report shows Planned Parenthood’s total revenue to be $1, 354. 3 million, an increase over the $1, 296. 1 million reported in  . The organization shows an increase in government reimbursement and grants this year, reporting $554. 6 million in taxpayer funding, while in   it reported $553. 7 million. Planned Parenthood reported an “Excess in Revenue Over Expenses” of $58. 8 million in  . That amount rose to $77. 5 million this past year. “Planned Parenthood’s newly released   annual report reveals that abortion continues to be a big business for the nation’s number one abortion chain, as taxpayer funding rises and other services continue their downward trend,” said Americans United for Life’s president and CEO Catherine Glenn Foster, adding: Despite reports that the number of abortions performed in the United States is declining, Planned Parenthood once again reports an increase in the number of human lives ended in their facilities: 328, 348 abortions last year. Additionally, despite their repeated claims that American women rely on them for   health care services, many of their   services have continued to decrease. The latest report is published only days after the release of a video produced by Center for Medical Progress that revealed members of the National Abortion Federation discussing the difficulties they face in their jobs, such as “the head that gets stuck that we can’t get out,” and “an eyeball just fell into my lap, and that is gross!” YouTube, LiveLeak, and other sites removed the video after U. S. District Judge William Orrick censored it. Part of the newly released annual report is devoted to a narrative about what Planned Parenthood refers to as “attacks” by “  extremists” who “began releasing heavily edited undercover videos of Planned Parenthood officials and providers. ” The report continues: In investigation after investigation by the media, the medical community, and forensic experts, their allegations were widely and resoundingly discredited. But as we know all too well,  ’s health politicians will jump at any opportunity  —   no matter how baseless  —   to attack our organization. However, it has been only Planned Parenthood’s allies in the media and government who have “widely and resoundingly discredited” the videos. A Democrat opposition research firm named Fusion  —   hired by Planned Parenthood itself to review the videos  —   said while their analysts observed the videos had been edited, “the analysis did not reveal widespread evidence of substantive video manipulation. ” Additionally, Fusion noted, “[A]nalysts found no evidence that CMP inserted dialogue not spoken by Planned Parenthood staff. ” An analysis by Coalfire, a   forensics company hired by Alliance Defending Freedom, found that the videos were “not manipulated” and that they are “authentic. ” “Planned Parenthood’s new report reveals that abortions, taxpayer funding, and profit have all gone up,” says Family Research Council’s Arina Grossu, director of the Center for Human Dignity. “Meanwhile its cancer screenings, basic breast exams, prenatal services, and even customers have decreased. ” “This sham organization’s focus is increasingly on higher abortion numbers and higher profits,” she added. “Why are we continuing to hand over half a billion dollars in taxpayer money to an organization that kills America’s unborn children at record rates while lining their pockets with more than $77 million in profit?”",0
17163,The War on UNESCO: Al-Aqsa Mosque is Palestinian and East Jerusalem is Illegally Occupied,"[Photo: Mateo Renzi (2013) by Sailko ] Ramzy Baroud, PhD Politics for the People Editor's Note Renzi is just one more politician who blatantly panders to Israeli leadership at the expense of their responsibilities to citizenry nor organizations. And to what end? Do they want Israel to smile on them? No. The want the U.S. to smile on them. Think for 10 seconds on what that means for U.S. policy. D id Italian Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, actually read the full text of the UNESCO resolution on Palestine and Israel, before he raved with anger ? “I think this is a mistaken, inconceivable resolution,” he said. “It is not possible to continue with these resolutions at the UN and UNESCO that aim to attack Israel. It is shocking and I have ordered that we stop taking this position (his country’s abstention) even if it means diverging from the position taken by the rest of Europe,” he added. Renzi, who became Prime Minister in 2014 at the relatively young age of 39 knows exactly how the game is played. In order to win favor with Washington, he must first please Tel Aviv. 
His country has abstained from the October 12 vote on a resolution that condemns Israel’s violations of the cultural and legal status of Occupied East Jerusalem. This decision has ignited the ire of Israeli Ambassador to Rome, Ofer Zaks , who riled up the Jewish community in Italy to protest the abstention. Renzi, in turn, was converted into a champion of the ‘Temple Mount’, the name Israel uses to describe the Palestinian Muslim holy site. 
Renzi cravenly went on damage control mode without truly understanding the nature of the resolution, which merely condemned Israel’s obvious violations of international law, and only calls for Israel to respect the status of Palestinian culture in the occupied city. 
None of procedures that led to the vote on the UNESCO’s resolution – voted by 24-6, with 26 abstentions – violated protocol, nor was any of the wording inconsistent with international law. In fact, UNESCO was merely doing its job: attempting to protect and preserve the historical and cultural heritage of the world. Jerusalem is a sacred and a holy city to a majority of humanity, simply because it is significant to the spiritual wellbeing of the adherents of the three monotheistic religions. In fact, the resolution stated so : “Affirming the importance of the Old City of Jerusalem and its Walls for the three monotheistic religions …” Renzi’s outburst is quite disappointing, to say the least, for the young, eager politician simply tried to score cheap political points with Israel – thus the United States – without a full, or even partial comprehension of what the UNESCO resolution resolved. Nor did he seem aware of the fact that such text is largely a repeat of what has been discussed by the world’s leading cultural organization in April, and repeatedly before that date. “If anyone wants to say something about Israel, let them say it, but they should not use UNESCO… To say that the Jews have no links to Jerusalem is like saying the sun creates darkness,” he said, paraphrasing the sentiment displayed by the Israeli Prime Minister. It would be rather sad if Renzi sees a mentor in Benjamin Netanyahu, for the latter is one of the least liked world leaders who has made a mockery of international forums and derided the United Nations itself as anti-Semitic and its process as ‘theater of the absurd’. This is what Netanyahu had said in response to the resolution and shortly before he suspended his country’s membership in UNESCO. Using a language that is as amusing as his cartoon depiction of the Iranian nuclear bomb in his famous UN spectacle in 2012, he said: “To say that Israel has no connection to the Temple Mount and the Western Wall is like saying that China has no connection to the Great Wall of China or that Egypt has no connection to the Pyramids.” Other Israeli officials followed suit with a chorus of denunciations, included Israeli President, Reuven Rivilin, who described the decision as an “embarrassment” for UNESCO. Culture Minister, Miri Regev, cut to the chase, by labeling the resolution “shameful and anti-Semitic.” In fact, it was neither. In addition to Renzi’s odd reaction, the United States and other western governments reacted with exaggerated anger, again without even addressing the situation on the ground , which prompted the resolution – and numerous other UN resolutions in the past – in the first place. Even the Czech parliament jumped on board , voting to condemn what they described as a “hateful, anti-Israel’ sentiment.” I have read the resolution repeatedly to pinpoint the specific text that could possibly be understood by Israel’s friends as hateful, to no avail. The entirety of the text was based on past international conventions, resolutions, international law, and refers to Israel as the Occupying Power, as per the diktat of the Geneva Conventions. The Italian, Czech, American anger is, of course, misdirected and is largely political theater. But, of course, there is an important context that they refuse to address. Israel is working diligently to appropriate Muslim and Christian heritage in East Jerusalem, a city that is designated by international law as illegally occupied. The Israeli army and police have restricted the movement of Palestinian worshipers and is excavating under the foundation of the third holiest Muslim shrine, Haram al-Sharif, in search of a mythological Temple. In the process of doing so, numerous Palestinians, trying to defend their Mosque from the attacks staged by Israeli occupation forces and extremist Jewish groups, have been killed. How is UNESCO to react to this? The resolution merely, ‘called on Israel’ to “allow for the restoration of the historic status quo that prevailed until September 2000, under which the Jordanian Awqaf (Religious Foundation) Department exercised exclusive authority on Al-Aqṣa Mosque/Al-Ḥaram Al-Sharif.” Moreover, it ‘stressed’, the “urgent need of the implementation of the UNESCO reactive monitoring mission to the Old City of Jerusalem and its Walls.” Where is the ‘hate’ and ‘Anti-Semitism’ in that? Israel’s anger is, of course, fathomable. For nearly fifty years, following the illegal occupation and annexation of the Palestinian Arab city, Israel has done everything it could possibly do to strip the city of its universal appeal and Arab heritage, and make it exclusive to Jews only – thus the slogan of Jerusalem being Israel’s ‘eternal and undivided capital.’ Israel is angry because, after five decades of ceaseless efforts, neither UNESCO nor other UN institutions will accept Israel’s practices and designations. In 2011, following the admission of ‘Palestine’ as a member state, Israel ranted and raved as well, resulting in the US cutting off funding to UNESCO. The latest resolution indicates that Israel and the US have utterly failed to coerce UNESCO. What also caused much fury in Tel Aviv is that UNESCO used the Arabic references to Haram al-Sharif, Al-Aqsa Mosque and other Muslim religious and heritage sites. The same way they would refer to Egypt’s Pyramids of Giza and China’s Great Wall by their actual names. Hardly anti-Semitic. Since its establishment atop Palestinian towns and village, Israel has been on a mission to rename everything Arabic with Hebrew alternatives . Recent years have seen a massive push towards the Judaization of Arab Christian and Muslim sites, streets and holy shrines, a campaign spear-headed by the Israeli right and ultranationalist groups. To expect UNESCO to employ such language is what should strike as ‘absurd’. Not only should the UNESCO resolution be respected, it should also be followed by practical mechanisms to implement its recommendations. Israel, an Occupying Power should not be given a free pass to besiege the holy shrines of two major world religions, restrict the movement and attack worshipers, annex occupied territories and destroy what is essential spiritual heritage that belongs to the whole world.

17165,Can The American People Defeat The Oligarchy That Rules Them?     : Information," Can The American People Defeat The Oligarchy That Rules Them? By Paul Craig Roberts
 Arent you surprised that Hillary and the presstitutes havent blamed Putin for FBI director Comeys reopening of the Hillary email case? But the presstitutes have done the next best thing for Hillary. They have made Comey the issue, not Hillary.
According to US Senator Harry Reid and the presstitutes, we dont need to worry about Hillarys crimes. After all, she is only a political woman feathering her nest, just as political men have done for ages. Why all this misogynist talk about Hillary? The presstitutes cry is that Comeys alleged crime is far more important. This woman-hating Republican violated the Hatch Act by telling Congress that the investigation he said was closed is now reopened. A very strange interpretation of the Hatch Act. During an election it is OK to announce that a candidate for president is cleared but it is not OK to say that a candidate is under investigation.
In July 2016 Comey violated the Hatch Act when he, on orders from the corrupt Obama Attorney General, announced Hillary clean. In so doing, Comey used the prestige of federal clearance of Hillarys violation of national security protocols to boost her standing in the election polls.
Actually, Hillarys standing in the polls is based on the pollsters over-weighting Hillary supporters in the polls. It is easy to produce a favorite if you overweight their supporters in the poll questions. If you look at the crowds attending the two candidates public appearances, it is clear that the American people prefer Donald Trump, who is opposed to war with Russia and China. War with nuclear powers is the big issue of the election.
Hillarys problem has the ruling American Oligarcy, for which Hillary is the total servant, concerned. What are they going to do about Trump if he wins? Will his fate be the same as John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King, George Wallace? Time will tell. Or will a hotel maid appear at the last minute in the way that the Oligarchy got rid of Dominique Strauss-Kahn?
All of the American and Western feminists, progressives, and left-wing remnant fell for the obvious frame-up of Strauss-Kahn. After Strauss-Kahn was blocked from the Presidency of France and resigned as Director of the IMF, the New York authorities had to drop all charges against Strauss-Kahn. But Washington had succeeded in putting its French vassal, Sarkozy, in the presidency of France.
This is how the American Oligarchy destroys those it suspects might not serve its interests. The corrupt self-serving Oligarchy makes sure that it owns the government and the media, the think tanks and increasingly all of the major universities, and, of course, through the presstitutes, Americans minds.
The Oligarchs are now hard-pressed to rescue Hillary as US president, so lets see if the Oligarchs can once again deceive the American people.
While we wait, lets concern ourselves with another important issue. The Clinton crime syndicate in the closing years of the 20th century allowed a small handful of mega-corporations to consolidate the US media in a few hands. This vast increase in the power of the Oligarchy was accomplished despite US anti-trust law. The media mergers destroyed the American tradition of a dispersed and independent media.
But really, what does federal law mean to the One Percent. Nothing whatsoever. The One Percents power makes them immune to law. Hillarys crimes might cost her the election, but she wont go to jail.
Not content with 90% control of the US media, the Oligarchy wants more concentration and more control. Looks like they will be getting it, thanks to the corrupt US government. The Federal Trade Commission is supposed to enforce US anti-trust law. Instead, the federal agency routinely violates US anti-trust law by permitting monopoly concentrations of business interests.
Because of the failure of the federal government to enforce federal law, we now have banks too big to fail, unregulated Internet monopoly, and the evisceration of a dispersed and independent media.
Not so long ago there was a field of economics known as anti-trust. Ph.D. candidates specialized in and wrote dissertations about public control of monopoly power. I assume that this field of economics, like the America of my youth, no longer exists.
In the article below, Rahul Manchanda, explains that yet again another huge media conglomerate is being swallowed and acquired by another huge media conglomerate, to create another gargantuan media outlet, in another consolidation of the enormous power, money, wealth, intimidation, conspiracy and control that eviscerates the US Constitution and the First Amendment.
Dr. Paul Craig Roberts was Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy and associate editor of the Wall Street Journal. He was columnist for Business Week, Scripps Howard News Service, and Creators Syndicate. He has had many university appointments. His internet columns have attracted a worldwide following. Roberts' latest books are The Failure of Laissez Faire Capitalism and Economic Dissolution of the West , How America Was Lost , and The Neoconservative Threat to World Order .",0

17167,"Shootings in Dallas, Minnesota and Baton Rouge: What We Know - The New York Times","A week of shocking violence in the United States took a bloodier turn on Thursday night, when five police officers were shot and killed by a sniper in Dallas. The attack came during a peaceful demonstration against the widely publicized police shootings of black men in Louisiana and Minnesota earlier in the week. • Shots were fired around 9. p. m. on Thursday as hundreds of demonstrators were peacefully marching west on Main Street in downtown Dallas. Scores could be seen fleeing and screaming as police officers, who were on the scene to maintain order, took cover and returned fire. • Five police officers were killed, seven other officers were shot and two civilians were wounded. A lawyer for five of the wounded officers said they were expected to recover. • A senior law enforcement official identified the gunman as Micah Johnson, 25, an Army veteran who lived in the Dallas area. The police killed him using a   bomb during a standoff early on Friday. • The city’s police chief, David O. Brown, originally described the shooting as a coordinated attack by two snipers. On Friday, the secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh C. Johnson, said that there had been only one gunman and that he had no known links to international terrorist organizations. • Three other people are in custody, but their identities and connections to the attack are unknown. • Before Mr. Johnson was identified, Chief Brown said the suspect was upset about the recent police shootings and “wanted to kill white people, especially white officers. ” • Some downtown locations that were part of the crime scene will remain closed to the public until Wednesday. • President Obama, speaking in Warsaw, called the shootings a “vicious, calculated and despicable attack on law enforcement. ” He will visit Dallas early next week at the invitation of Mayor Mike Rawlings, the White House said. • The shootings occurred just a few blocks from where President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, and they appear to be the deadliest attack for American law enforcement officers since Sept. 11, 2001. • Streets downtown were mostly quiet as the authorities began their second day of investigation on Saturday. A night earlier, demonstrators gathered in cities around the country for   protests. • On Wednesday evening, a police officer fatally shot a black man, Philando Castile, 32, during a traffic stop in Falcon Heights, Minn. a suburb of St. Paul, the state capital. The aftermath was streamed on Facebook Live by Mr. Castile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, a passenger in the car, along with her young daughter. • St. Paul has been convulsed by protests. Demonstrators gathered around the home of Gov. Mark Dayton, who said he was shaken by the video. “Would this have happened if the driver were white, if the passengers were white?” he asked. “I don’t think it would have. ” • Mr. Obama, after arriving in Warsaw for a NATO summit meeting, told reporters, “There’s a big chunk of our citizenry that feels as if, because of the color of their skin, they are not being treated the same, and that hurts, and that should trouble all of us. ” That was before the demonstration  —   and the killings of police officers  —   in Dallas. • Mr. Castile had notified the police officer that he had a gun on him, and was a licensed gun owner. Whether this information played a role in the shooting is not clear. Mr. Castile’s girlfriend said he was trying to retrieve his license and registration when the officer opened fire. • On Tuesday morning, two police officers fatally shot a black man, Alton B. Sterling, 37, in Baton Rouge, the capital of Louisiana, while trying to arrest him. The shooting was captured on video that drew widespread attention after it was released online on Wednesday. • The Justice Department opened a civil rights investigation into the shooting, the latest in a series of killings of civilians that have fueled the Black Lives Matter movement. • There have been protests and a vigil, but the city has otherwise remained calm. • Mr. Sterling had a long criminal history, but it is not clear whether the officers knew that when they tried to arrest him.",0
17168,New Evidence on van Gogh’s Ear Continues Debate on Painter’s Mental State - The New York Times,"AMSTERDAM  —   Everyone knows that Vincent van Gogh cut off his left ear. But since that fateful event nearly 128 years ago, there has been continuing debate among scholars about the severity of that mutilation, which took place in Arles, France, in December 1888. Did he simply slice off a little chunk of his ear, or did he lop off the entire ear? The author and amateur historian Bernadette Murphy, while researching the last period of that Dutch Post Impressionist’s life for a new book, discovered a document in an American archive that may help resolve the issue. A note written by Félix Rey, a doctor who treated van Gogh at the Arles hospital, contains a drawing of the mangled ear showing that the artist indeed cut off the whole thing. The letter and drawing will be displayed for the first time at the Van Gogh Museum’s exhibition “On the Verge of Insanity,” which opens here on Friday and runs through Sept. 25, along with previously unexhibited documents and artifacts that try to provide more detailed evidence about van Gogh’s mental illness. The exhibition will also include about 25 paintings and other objects, like a corroded revolver that van Gogh may have used to kill himself, museum officials say. These will try to explore, in particular, the final stretch of his life while his troubles escalated, from the   incident to July 29, 1890, when he apparently committed suicide in    France. The subject of the artist’s mental state has always fascinated people who admire his art, but until now the Van Gogh Museum, which contains the largest collection of his work in the world, has not directly addressed the subject. Until recently, the museum has focused on van Gogh’s aesthetic and technical progression, but interest in his biography is driving a different approach to exhibitions. “This is really the start of a new series of small, focused exhibitions, which will only take one floor of the building but will enable us to give the visitors more information about van Gogh’s life,” said Nienke Bakker, curator of paintings for the Van Gogh Museum and curator of this exhibition. “This seemed for us to be the perfect subject to start with. ” Ms. Bakker said that most museum visitors wanted to know the details of van Gogh’s life: “The three most frequently asked questions are: What happened with his ear? What kind of illness did he have? and, Why did he commit suicide?” The exhibition coincides with the release of the book, “Van Gogh’s Ear: The True Story,” by Ms. Murphy. Steven Naifeh, an American historian and   with Gregory White Smith of the 2011 “Van Gogh: The Life,” said in an email after looking at the new document, “I was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, that they had indeed found new information from Rey, but it is not new, and it is not credible. ” In the biography Mr. Naifeh and Mr. Smith argue that witnesses who saw van Gogh after Dr. Rey, including his brother Theo’s wife, Johanna van   the artist Paul Signac and van Gogh’s doctor in    Dr. Paul Gachet, said that the entire ear was not missing. They all “saw a portion of the mutilated ear remaining  —   so much, in fact, that, when Vincent was seen from   the damage could go unnoticed,” they wrote. “Dr. Gachet, who saw Vincent in Auvers in 1890, made a very detailed etching of the artist’s mutilated ear at that time showing that the entire pinna (outer portion) of the ear was not taken off, but the missing portion was more than just a lobe. ” Various reasons for van Gogh’s   have been given in the past. In Paul Gauguin’s autobiographical novel,“Avant et Après,” he describes a disagreement between him and van Gogh in Arles after Gauguin decided to leave. Gauguin wrote that van Gogh chased him with a razor until Gauguin stopped him, and then van Gogh went home and wounded himself. In her research, Ms. Murphy, who was born in Ireland and has lived in Provence, just outside Arles, for many years, was also able to identify the woman to whom van Gogh gave his ear. She said her name was Gabrielle, a young maid who worked in a brothel. She suffered for many years, Ms. Murphy said, with being called a prostitute because of the contact with van Gogh. According to a local newspaper report, he told her, “Keep this object carefully,” and she immediately fainted. “There’s something semireligious to the way he offers a part of his body to repair a part of her body,” Ms. Murphy said at a preview of the exhibition. “She had a nasty scar on her body, and it’s as if he’s giving her fresh flesh. ” Ms. Bakker now says she thinks this was the delirious, unconscious behavior that became characteristic of van Gogh’s series of mental breakdowns. Van Gogh had no recollection of the events surrounding the ear episode, and said his memories of his actions during breakdowns were usually vague. In the hospital after the ear episode, he was ashamed to learn what he had done, and immediately put himself in the care of Dr. Rey. Van Gogh’s fame has always been linked to his complicated biography, and particularly to his madness. “The fact that    children know who Vincent van Gogh is is partly because of this mangling of his ear,” Mr. Naifeh said in a phone interview. “If you were going to cite just a few facts about his life, this would be one of them. ” Many have tried to guess what kind of mental illness van Gogh had. Some suppose he may have had temporal lobe epilepsy, which can lead to seizures, erratic behavior and loss of consciousness, while others believe his symptoms were more similar to bipolar disorder. Ms. Murphy said she thought it might have been a combination of the two. During the exhibition, the museum will host a symposium with doctors weighing in on the matter. “We’ve been studying all these diagnoses that have been put forward in the 126 years since his death,” Ms. Bakker said. “Of course, it’s very hard to diagnose a person who is dead and has been dead a long time. We know what the symptoms were, because he was describing them in his own letters. He says he has hallucinations, that he’s speaking incoherently, that he doesn’t know what he’s doing. ” Exhibited for the first time are a police report on van Gogh’s incident in Arles, and a petition by van Gogh’s neighbors there in 1889, which asked the city’s mayor to institutionalize the artist. Dr. Rey’s letter and drawing of van Gogh’s severed ear will be displayed next to the artist’s portrait of Dr. Rey, painted in January 1889 and given to the doctor as thanks for his care. The goal of the exhibition is not to link the artwork to his mental state but rather to make clear that van Gogh was struggling to work despite a debilitating illness. “It’s not the case that he was having these hallucinations and painting them,” Ms. Bakker said. “A lot of people still think that. It’s amazing the amount of art he was able to create, especially considering that there were sometimes quite long periods when he wasn’t able to work. ”",0

17170,"Flynn Was Brought Down by Illegal Leaks to News Media, Trump Says - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   President Trump lashed out at the nation’s intelligence agencies again on Wednesday, saying that his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, was brought down by illegal leaks to the news media, on a day of new disclosures about the Trump camp’s dealings with Russia during and after the presidential campaign. “From intelligence, papers are being leaked, things are being leaked,” Mr. Trump said at a White House news conference with Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel. “It’s a criminal action, criminal act, and it’s been going on for a long time before me, but now it’s really going on. And people are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton. ” With his statement and a burst of   posts he made on Twitter, Mr. Trump tried to shift attention from damaging questions about contacts with Russia by Mr. Flynn and others close to the president, arguing that the outrage is not those contacts, but the leaks about them. He revived his charge that the allegations of a “Russian connection” were nothing more than a Democratic conspiracy, fed to a receptive news media to distract from the mistakes made by Mrs. Clinton during the campaign. The White House has said that Mr. Trump demanded Mr. Flynn’s resignation on Monday night, after it was revealed that Mr. Flynn, a retired   Army general, had misled Vice President Mike Pence and other officials about his conversations with a Russian diplomat. But on Wednesday, the president said that Mr. Flynn had “been treated very, very unfairly by the media,” undercut by “documents and papers that were illegally  —   I’d stress that, illegally  —   leaked. ” Earlier, he had posted on Twitter, “Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes  @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI? ). Just like Russia” The New York Times and The Washington Post had reported on the contacts Mr. Flynn had with Russia’s ambassador to Washington, Sergey I. Kislyak. Mr. Flynn initially told Mr. Pence and others that he and Mr. Kislyak did not discuss matters of substance, like United States sanctions against Russia, but in the days after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, the Justice Department notified the White House that he had not been forthright about the conversations. The Times also disclosed broader contacts between Russian intelligence officials and people with ties to the Trump campaign and Mr. Trump’s business empire during and after the campaign, and other news organizations followed with similar reports. The president declined to address that revelation and, as he has at other times in recent days, took questions at his news conference only from conservative news organizations and ignored more challenging questions shouted to him as he left the podium. So far, the White House has had little success in trying to shift the narrative from the Russian contacts to accusations about the leaking of sensitive information by the intelligence agencies, as well as by the F. B. I. Mr. Trump used a similar strategy during the transition, after disclosures that the intelligence agencies presented him with a dossier containing potentially compromising  —   but unsubstantiated  —   information that Russian officials had collected on him during his travels to Russia. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said on Twitter, “The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC  @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!” The president also praised a column by Eli Lake of Bloomberg View, which criticized the selective leaking of intercepted communications between Mr. Flynn and Mr. Kislyak. Mr. Lake went on to suggest, however, that Mr. Flynn had been sacrificed to protect other officials, potentially including the president himself. Mr. Trump, as he has before, rejected allegations that his policy toward Russia was being compromised. “Crimea was TAKEN by Russia during the Obama Administration. Was Obama too soft on Russia?” he posted on Twitter.",0

17174,J. Christian Adams: Trump Reforms Will Remove Any Arrested Illegal Here Less Than 2 Years,"Election lawyer and Justice Department whistleblower J. Christian Adams, author of Injustice: Exposing the Racial Agenda of the Obama Justice Department, was a guest on Wednesday’s Breitbart News Daily with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow. [Marlow asked Adams to clarify the new immigration guidelines coming from President Trump’s administration.  LISTEN: “The president and DHS have really issued some bold new rules that I think are designed to protect the country,” Adams said. “They’re doing things the Obama administration refused to do but should have. ” For example, he said the Trump administration would be “removing people quickly, without any nonsense rigamarole. ” “These are people who haven’t been here very long. The Obama administration used to confine it to just two weeks. So if you could manage to get past two weeks under Obama, you can stay,” he explained. “But under Trump, they’re going to make it two years. So if you’ve been here within two years, in the country illegally, you’re gone quickly. Expedited removal. Outta here. ” “Obama used to confine it to 100 miles within the border  —   only if you were caught within a hundred miles would you be removed immediately, on an expedited basis,” he continued. “All you had to do is get past the   line, and you were safe under Obama. What Trump did was extend it to the entire country. If you’re caught illegally, and you’ve been here less than two years, you’re going to be immediately removed. ” Adams said there was no chance the Left would refrain from “melting down” over these changes. “As you know, Alex, the Left is all about changing the demographics of the country so they can win elections,” he charged. “And that’s what this has all been about from the beginning. The open borders crowd is finding a way to undermine mainstream America, middle American values, political views, to inject the country with a foreign influence  —   that’s right, I said that  —   foreign influence  —   so the demographic of the electorate changes. ”  “It helps them win the White House. It helps them win the Senate in places like Florida, California, Arizona, Virginia, another great example, Pennsylvania, Illinois  —   places with high immigration and illegal immigration. So I think the Left will go crazy. It’s what they do. They can’t help themselves. So expect more of it,” he said. Marlow characterized the longstanding “bizarre and terrible” approach to immigration enforcement as an implicit promise that “all you have to do is not commit another crime, and then you can stay. ” “I think that the decision to focus on criminal behavior  —   and we can talk about what that means because that’s important  —   but the decision to focus on criminal behavior is a first step. It’s a starting point that most Americans would agree with. It makes the Left look utterly crazy. It gaslights them,” Adams said. “But you know, it’s not just convicted criminals,” he pointed out. “It’s people who get picked up for like driving without a license, which is a huge problem when it comes to illegal aliens. And so it’s not just those who were convicted it’s those who were charged, those who were picked up on a minor infraction. ” Marlow asked when construction of the border wall President Trump promised might begin and whether it’s truly politically feasible. Adams insisted the wall was quite feasible, pointing to the Great Wall of China as an example of   wall construction technology from ages past. However, he warned that “the entire bureaucracy inside the Beltway is going to   this. ” “Every chance they get to sabotage and interfere, they’re going to do it. Folks who think that just because Trump is the president that that stuff is over with are wrong. Contracts being let, lawsuits being filed over some lizard in Arizona that might be affected by the wall  …    you’re going to see the entire apparatus of the   institution activate to stop this because they know, again Alex, getting people here illegally helps them win elections ten, fifteen years down the road. I’m afraid that this is going to be a wicked experience for the country when you have bureaucrats opposing this. ” Adams agreed with Marlow that construction of the wall was politically dicey, warning that “every day counts. ” “We are one day worse than we were yesterday of Trump being president. Speed is of the essence. When Obama came in, he realized that every day counted, and so they radicalized the government as fast as possible. That has to be undone just as quickly,” he urged. Marlow cited a new poll that shows 80 percent of Americans oppose the concept of “sanctuary cities” where federal officials are not notified after illegal aliens come into contact with local law enforcement. “How come this is the only law in America you can break where you have a sanctuary city for it?” he asked. “This is a culture that’s permitting lawlessness to be out in the open in these urban areas like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Houston,” Adams replied. “These sanctuary cities are openly saying, ‘We don’t care about the law, and we’re going to provide a haven for lawlessness because we believe in changing the culture, changing the demographics of elections. ” “How can it happen? How does it exist? Look, those cities are run by lunatics,” he said. “San Francisco is run by lunatics. What is the political backstop? Trump may have figured it out. If you say, “Hey, okay, dear lunatics, if you still want your federal money, then you’re going to stop this’  —   but you can see Alex, in some cases, the lunacy is more important to them than the dollars. We’ll see what happens there. ” Adams portrayed the assault on immigration law as an attack on “the fundamental notion that the West, that America, has the power to set off a piece of the earth and say, ‘We are different from the rest of you. We believe in individual liberty, the role of limited government, of the separation of powers, of the rule of law, and we are allowed to do borders to protect those ideas. ’” “That’s what’s under attack, Alex. Around the world is this notion that the West should be able to survive as the West. That’s why people like Trudeau, who’s also a nut, are part of this globalist open borders ideology that really is a   effort to undermine Western values,” he added, referring to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. A caller asked how it would be possible to determine that any given illegal alien had been present in the United States for two years or less to remove them with expedited deportation, given that illegal aliens have little documentation of their movements. “That’s a great question,” said Adams. “That’s where the lawyers working at DHS and immigration judges  —   you know, we have rules of evidence, Alex. I can figure out, pretty much, if you give me subpoena power, how long somebody’s been in the country. I could talk to people. I could look at bank records. I could look at job histories. I could look at a variety of evidence that will inform the question of how long they’ve been here. Sometimes you get an admission, right? That’s the best kind of evidence, an admission against interest. So it’s not impossible to figure out who’s been here less than two years.

17175,"In hats and t-shirts, Trump fans rally in Jerusalem’s Old City","Reuters 
On a rooftop overlooking the walls of Jerusalem’s Old City, around 200 American-Israeli fans of Donald Trump gathered to proclaim their support for the Republican candidate, convinced he will be Israel’s best friend if elected. 
Wearing “Make America Great Again” baseball caps, the small crowd, ranging from Holocaust survivors in their 80s to grinning teenagers in Trump t-shirts, said they didn’t care about the sexual assault allegations against the candidate or the online anti-Semitism of some of his supporters. 
“Trump will let Israel be itself and make its own decisions, that’s what I like,” David Weissman, a 35-year-old from Queens, New York, who moved to Israel three years ago, said at the event late on Wednesday. 
“He’s not a saint, but look at his achievements. He’s not afraid to identify the enemy as radical Islam, and he’s not going to support the two-state solution,” he said, referring to long-standing efforts to forge peace with the Palestinians. 
Trump has said that the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct fabricated their stories to damage his campaign. 
Others at the rally said they liked the fact that Trump was promising to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, officially recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, and would not berate Israel for building Jewish settlements in occupied territory. 
“It’s very important that he becomes president,” said Connie Gordner, 82, who moved to Israel from Jacksonville, Florida, 21 years ago. “If Hillary Clinton becomes president, we’re dead.” 
The rally was organized by Republicans Overseas Israel, which estimates that there are 300,000 U.S. citizens living in Israel or in Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians seek for their own state. 
Even if only a third of those cast absentee ballots, organizers believe it could have an impact in some swing states, come Nov. 8. Marc Zell, co-chairman of the non-profit group, believes around three-quarters of American-Israelis support the Republican party and its candidate. 
In an impassioned speech to the small crowd, David Friedman, Trump’s adviser on Israel, heaped criticism on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for her decisions as secretary of state and said Trump was Israel’s greatest hope. 
“Under Trump, the United States will never pressure Israel into accepting a two-state solution or any other solution that is against the wishes of the Israeli people,” he said, to whoops, cheers and a few shouts of “Crooked Hillary”. 
While the motley crowd was unabashed in its Trumpian fervor, polls indicate that most Jewish Israelis favor Clinton over Trump, by 40 percent to 31 percent. 
The critical element is American-Israelis who retain the right to vote in U.S. elections. Some estimates suggest more than a quarter of them live in settlements, which tend to have a more conservative, national-religious outlook. Trump’s messages have been designed to appeal to their sentiments. 
On Wednesday, he delivered a minute-long video to the rally, playing up his connections to Judaism through his daughter’s marriage, saying it enhanced his respect for the faith. 
“My administration will stand side-by-side with the Jewish people and Israel’s leaders to continue strengthening the bridges that connect not only Jewish Americans and Israelis but also all Americans and Israelis,” he said. 
“Together we will make America and Israel safe again.”",0

17177,Так кто же в итоге создал международную коалицию против ДАИШ? | Новое восточное обозрение,"Страна: Ирак Как отмечает в своей новой статье пакистанский исследователь Салман Рафи, штурм иракского города Мосула вынудил международных и региональных игроков координировать свои усилия ради достижения собственных интересов. Однако, как того и стоило ожидать, с Вашингтоном никому из участников штурма оказалось «не по пути», потому что Белый дом попытался настоять на том, чтобы Турция не участвовала в штурме Мосула. А потому никакого другого выбора, кроме как дать иранским военным «зеленый свет», Обама просто-напросто не имел. Автор отмечает, что едва бы осторожные предупреждения Вашингтона смогли остановить Турцию. Однако Эрдоган все-таки не пошел на штурм Мосула. Это говорит о том, что Москва смогла добиться крупного успеха в переговорах с турецкими коллегами, которые всегда рассматривали данный иракский город как «турецкую вотчину». В то время как иранские и иракские военные занимаются планомерным освобождением Мосула, Москва, Анкара и Дамаск координируют свои действия с ними на сирийской территории. Автор отмечает, что сейчас самое время задаться вопросом, так кто же на самом деле создал международную коалицию против ДАИШ? С полной версией статьи вы можете ознакомиться здесь .

17178,‘We Still Have a Lot of People Dying’ - The New York Times,"BALTIMORE  —   I first met Brandon Scott the day after Freddie Gray died. It was April 20, 2015. Mr. Scott, a member of the Baltimore City Council, was quietly observing a news conference where Baltimore police officials announced the suspension of six officers involved in the arrest of Mr. Gray, a    black man who sustained a fatal spinal cord injury in a police transport van. In the blighted West Baltimore neighborhood where Mr. Gray grew up, protests were growing. Mr. Gray’s death was wrenching for Baltimore a lot has transpired here since then. On the day Mr. Gray was buried, riots broke out, prompting Maryland’s governor to call in the National Guard. The fiery state’s attorney, Marilyn Mosby, promptly indicted the six officers on charges including murder. The city paid $6. 4 million to the Gray family. With the murder rate soaring, the mayor fired the police chief  —   and decided not to run for office again, as the city struggled to heal. Then came the officers’ trials, which ended this week without a single conviction. Throughout, I have repeatedly interviewed Mr. Scott. He is 32,   and the vice chairman of the Council committee that oversees the Baltimore police. Before being elected in 2011, he worked in city government and   the 300 Men March, an   group here. On Thursday, we spoke again, about the latest developments and what has changed. Below is an edited and condensed excerpt from that conversation. Ms. Mosby’s team has just accused the Police Department of undermining the prosecution. Does that concern you? My concerns are first and foremost that moving forward, we are doing what we need to do to repair our city  —   to improve   relations. I have spent a good deal of time over the last year working on body cameras, working on trainings with young people. The most important thing  —   what gets lost in all of this, is that we are talking about the loss of a life. But I will be following up with the police commissioner, even though this happened before the current commissioner, to provide a response to those claims. You mentioned body cameras. Are the Baltimore police using them? They will, just like in New York or any other major city, they’re going to be rolled out. We already have body cameras out there at this point, we are close to 200 officers. Body cameras were in the works before Freddie Gray, but most definitely it ratcheted up the pace. What else has changed? The department decided to improve the vans, so that’s a change. And I’m partnering with an organization called Community Mediation, fostering dialogue between youth and the police. Community Mediation is now mediating some internal affairs complaints. A lot of things have changed, things that people don’t see because they’re behind the scenes. I’ve talked to a lot of people who feel as though in the end, justice was not served  —   either for Freddie Gray or for the police. What do you say to that? I think what people must know about American justice is that the way the system is set up, you have to have a certain burden of proof and if it’s not met, then it’s not met. You can be as angry as you want to be, but you have to understand the system and respect it. What about you? Do you personally think justice was served? I can’t personalize it. Like myself, what I would do in a situation like that is talk to the family and see how they feel. If Mr. Gray’s family feels like everything, from the charges, from the state’s attorney proceeding with the trials, everything that has come out of it equals justice to them, then it’s justice. That’s a careful answer. You’ve always been so measured in answering my questions. I’m the grandson of poor farmers in rural North Carolina. I truly understand what it means for me being a young black man in this country. But I try not to be divisive, I try not to be polarizing, because that’s the last thing we need right now. We have enough of that going on. We’ve talked about changes in the city. Have you changed? Of course I have changed. I have shifted my work I’ve tried to do things a little differently. You have to be uncomfortable. If you’re not uncomfortable, if you haven’t changed the way you operate from April 2015 to now, then you’re saying the way our city was, was O. K.  —   and it wasn’t. So what are you doing differently? For example today, I’m on the labor committee in the City Council and we voted to send a bill to the full council raising the city’s minimum wage to $15 by 2022. I don’t think that would have happened before last April. Is Baltimore perhaps a better place now, as a result of Freddie Gray’s death? I can say that there have been changes in Baltimore for the better. But I can’t say that Baltimore is a complete better place, because we still have a lot of people dying. So Ms. Mosby never got any convictions. What, if anything, did she achieve? Many folks feel that her charging the officers would not have happened under the previous state’s attorney. That alone is a big deal for thousands of people in the city. But I would also remember  —   I talked to you and every other media outlet last year, I said, everyone should stay middle ground, because it’s just the beginning of the process. Are you surprised at how it turned out? I thought that at least there would be one charge that would stick with at least one officer, but I can’t say I’m surprised that it turned out the way that it did.",0
17179,Doug Casey: A Civil War Could Be in the Cards After the Election,"Doug Casey: A Civil War Could Be in the Cards After the Election 11/03/2016 
LEW ROCKWELL 
( Source: The 2nd American Civil War by Richard Hubal, via MN Artists ) 
Nick Giambruno: The US presidential election is only days away. What are the country’s greatest problems right now? 
Doug Casey: Domestically, I’d say the continual and accelerating loss of freedom, compounded by the prospect of what I suspect will be the biggest financial/economic crisis of modern times. What might that crisis be like? That’s unpredictable, although the odds are it will be unlike any others that are still fresh in people’s memories, simply because people tend to be most prepared for the things that have most recently scared them. The big problems usually come from an unexpected quarter, and/or at an unexpected time. Like the monetary crisis of 1998, that materialized in Thailand. 
That said, the question remains of where to look. It could come from outside American borders, in the form of war. War is perhaps the worst thing that can happen, not only for the destruction it will cause in itself, but because it will immensely exacerbate America’s domestic problems. As Bourne famously said, “War is the health of the State.” Certainly, the US government is actively provoking other governments in a score of places around the world. The next war could be serious, not just a sports war, like those in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
Nick Giambruno: In 2000, the federal government’s debt was just over $5 trillion. Now, it’s about $20 trillion. It doesn’t matter who’s in power. The debt continues to grow exponentially. Unless the government makes radical cuts to welfare and the military—which won’t happen no matter who is elected—it will grow indefinitely. 
If Americans are destined to be indebted serfs no matter who’s in power, do the elections even matter? 
Doug Casey: If the economy goes off of the deep end over the next year—and I think it will—the US government is going to be running much bigger deficits. Spending is going to go up for welfare. Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security—that’s already about two-thirds of the US government’s budget. Military spending is also going up. All that is going to go up, regardless of who wins the election on November 8. 
We could easily see a trillion dollar deficit, perhaps much more. Now, where are they going to get all that money? The Chinese aren’t going to lend it to the US anymore. They’re basically going to finance the deficit by selling the debt to the Federal Reserve. And that means creating more currency units out of thin air. 
But, on the other hand, the average guy—and for that matter, most businesses—aren’t borrowing money now. They’re too afraid. They don’t want to be in debt. The question is: As this comes to a real climax, are we going to have something resembling a runaway inflation in the dollar? Or are we going to have a massive credit collapse, which could be caused by defaults on bonds, house mortgages, student loans, or auto loans? I’m not sure which is going to happen. I mean, you buy a car now in the US, it costs you what a house did a couple generations ago. It all floats on a sea of debt. I’m just betting on financial chaos. That is the safe bet. 
No matter which way this election goes, it’s going to be ugly. 
Both candidates, Trump and Clinton, are disastrous. To me, it’s a sign of how degraded the US has become. About a year ago, they gave us a choice between Hillary, the wife of a previous president, pretty much playing the role of Argentina’s Evita, Juan Peron’s brassy wife. And Jeb Bush, the brother of one previous president and the son of another. The US has gone so far downhill that we can only choose which family dynasty we prefer to rule. If only a Kennedy, a Roosevelt, or a Rockefeller could be thrown into the mix as well… Maybe next time. Although I think we’re due for a general or two. 
Elections are, quite frankly, meaningless. These two corrupt parties, the Republicrats, and the Demopublicans, run by political hacks and funded by interest groups, simply appoint the people that they want and then present the American people with the illusion of a choice. The people who run these parties have become increasingly bold and arrogant. They’re absolutely horrible creatures, the same types that used to thrive in the Soviet Union. Americans should be ashamed of themselves for treating them with any respect at all. 
However, if forced to choose between the two candidates, I would definitely go for Trump, simply because he’s something of an outsider. The media, Hollywood, academia, and the Establishment hate him. And I believe he hates them. If elected, he will likely overturn a lot of apple carts in Washington and break a lot of rice bowls of people who live off the Deep State. That would be an excellent thing. It’s also possible he would retract most of Obama’s Executive Orders, and fire a bunch of supernumeraries. But he might replace them with a bunch of his own. 
However, it’s clear Trump has all kinds of dangerous authoritarian tendencies—don’t forget his endorsement of torture and the killing of families of accused terrorists as a policy. He also has all kinds of really silly and destructive economic notions—he appears to think he can cut “deals” with foreign governments. That has nothing to do with the concept of free trade. He’s threatened punitive tariffs, something that would immensely aggravate The Greater Depression. Worse, since as a businessman he’s associated with the free market—unfortunately, and incorrectly—capitalism will wind up being blamed for this depression as well as a result. 
Incidentally, I believe—as I have for over a year—that Trump is going to win. Why? It’s not just the immense enthusiasm of his supporters, as opposed to the lukewarm support that Hillary gets. It’s that Bernie Sanders was the other “protest” candidate in this election. His numerous and enthusiastic supporters believe—correctly—that Hillary and the Democratic machine stole the nomination from him. They’re genuinely pissed off. I believe only the most oblivious ones will vote for Hillary. A few might be mad enough to want to burn the house down by voting for Trump. 
I haven’t heard anyone talking about the absence of the Bernie-istas. I don’t keep my finger on the pulse of the hoi polloi . But, if I’m right, it will result in a landslide for Trump. 
Unfortunately, Trump is no libertarian—but neither is the dim-bulb candidate of the Libertarian Party. That said Trump is a lot better than Hillary—this is no time for a corrupt, hostile, elderly, debilitated, mildly demented Statist to become president. So, sure, I’d prefer Trump. 
Am I going to vote for him? I don’t believe in being complicit in a criminal act, so I don’t vote. 
Nick Giambruno: Please elaborate… 
Doug Casey: There are at least five reasons not to vote: Voting in a political election is unethical. The political process is one of institutionalized coercion and force. If you disapprove of those things, then you shouldn’t participate in them, even indirectly. Voting compromises your privacy. It gets your name in yet another government computer database. Voting, as well as registering, entails hanging around government offices and dealing with petty bureaucrats. Most people can find something more enjoyable or productive to do with their time. Voting encourages politicians. A vote against one candidate—a major, and quite understandable, the reason why most people vote—is always interpreted as a vote for his opponent. And even though you may be voting for the lesser of two evils, the lesser of two evils is still evil. It amounts to giving the candidate a tacit mandate to impose his will on society. Your vote doesn’t count. Politicians like to say it counts because it is to their advantage to get everyone into a busybody mode. But, statistically, one vote in scores of millions makes no more difference than a single grain of sand on a beach. That’s entirely apart from the fact that officials manifestly do what they want, not what you want, once they are in office. 
Nick Giambruno: What about voting for the Libertarian Party? 
Doug Casey: The Libertarian Party once had a claim to being the party of principle, back in the days when people like John Hospers, Harry Browne, and Ron Paul were their candidates. Then they for some reason put forward the empty suit Bob Barr, an ex-Congressman. 
It appears that the Libertarian Party has been captured by the Republicans, which is surprisingly clever on the Republicans’ part. Now they have two parties that are registered in all 50 states. It’s kind of a backup system to the regular Republican Party. They’ll need a backup since the old GOP is a dead duck. 
Regarding Gary Johnson, I don’t know what his philosophical beliefs, if any, are. I suspect neither, does he. The only thing we really know is that he wants to see pot legalized on a national scale. Well, bravo. I’m all for that, even though I’m not a toker. It’s a step in the right direction toward dismantling the insane War on Some Drugs. But does he have any other libertarian tendencies? He doesn’t seem to even have a grasp of the basic principles… although he seems better than the average politician. But that’s not saying much. 
I’m especially concerned about his running mate, William Weld, who’s an actual neocon. He’s an overt statist, an active promoter of warfare, welfare, taxes and regulations. He has no libertarian tendencies at all that I’m aware of. He’s a pure Deep State guy. 
One thing you’ve got to say about the Democratic Party is that, while their ideas are destructive and evil, at least they’re honest about them. Democrats make no bones about being the party of socialism, and they naturally attract the envy-driven, the class warriors, the politically correct, the cultural Marxists, the race baiters, the gender Nazis, and the like. The Democratic Party is beyond redemption. It needs to be flushed. It has zero redeeming value. 
The Republicans attract a different group. Religious people. Cultural traditionalists. People who generally favor what they think is the free market. They tend to be much more nationalistic and pro-military than the Democrats. But, unlike the Dems, the Reps have no real philosophical foundation. They’re basically just non-Democrats… 
The Democrats can be viewed as the evil party and the Republicans as the stupid party. But they’re really just two sides of the same coin, at least when it comes to their leadership—who are all Deep State members. 
The Libertarians must now be viewed, at best, as the smart wing of the stupid party. It’s a sad testimony to the nature of politics… 
The situation has actually gotten out of control, and the government is so big and so powerful at this point that it can’t be reversed. Even if Ron Paul were elected, it wouldn’t do any good. 
The first thing that would happen is that he would be sat down with a bunch of generals and heads of Praetorian agencies, like the FBI, the NSA and the CIA, who would inform him—politely, but firmly—how things really work. If he didn’t play by their rules, his life would be at risk. And if for some reason he dodged those bullets, he would be impeached by Congress before he had the chance to actually change anything. And if for some reason that didn’t work, the average American would be out in the street rioting, because his doggy dish was going to be broken. Don’t forget, almost 50% of Americans are net recipients of government benefits. 
I’m afraid that when the looming crisis blows up, the American people— Boobus Americanus as H. L. Mencken said—is going to clamor for somebody to kiss it all and make it better. We could very well wind up with some type of a military dictatorship. 
Nick Giambruno: I agree, Doug. I also do not vote. And there are far more powerful ways to vote anyway. 
You can vote with your money by swapping fiat currency stored in a fractional reserve banking system (like the US dollar) for physical gold and silver. 
You can also vote with your feet by leaving the country. 
Instead of voting for a politician, which only creates the illusion of making a difference, those two steps can actually make a positive change in your life. 
What’s your take? 
Doug Casey: I agree. The thing is that all of our ancestors—all of us who are Americans—came from foreign countries. Everybody came to America because they wanted to get away from being turned into slaves in their home countries. The problem is that the US government is going in the same direction as those governments that our ancestors ran away from. Now we have to go someplace else ourselves. We have to find a new America. 
I’m very pleased that I can watch all this nonsense on a widescreen in a coffee shop in Argentina and not be very adversely affected by it. Argentina, incidentally, is now going the right way from many points of view. 
It’s dangerous to stay rooted in one place when the natives get restless. Ask Russians in the 20’s, Germans in the 30’s, any European in the 40’s, Chinese in the 50’s, Cubans in the 60’s, Vietnamese in the 70’s, Rhodesians in the 80’s—or Venezuelans today. And that’s just an incomplete list off the top of my head. It’s especially risky if you have some assets during real economic upset, or ideas that aren’t mainstream when there’s real political turbulence. 
Nick Giambruno: Most Americans are effectively stuck in the US. So, looking at these disturbing socio-political trends, what else could happen? 
Doug Casey: It’s amazing, and disturbing, that most of the young people in the US support Bernie, an avowed socialist, whose ideas are, if anything, worse than Hillary’s. But it just shows how unhappy young people are with the status quo. Justifiably unhappy. 
Bernie and Trump hit the same nerve—they sensed that we’re on the edge of a revolution in this country. We really are. The situation is not unlike that before the War Between the States, very unstable. 
Both sides are extremely antagonistic. People either hate Trump or they hate Hillary. It doesn’t matter who wins; the other side is going to be very, very unhappy. And with tensions already running high in the country, and racial, cultural and social clashes in the background, it almost feels like a civil war is in the cards for the US. 
Of course, it seemed like we could have had a civil war back in the late 60’s and early 70’s when there were not just a few, but thousands of bombings. Not just little riots, like in Ferguson and Baltimore, but conflagrations like in Watts, DC, and Detroit, where the National Guard was raking the ghetto with .50 cals. 
But the country’s prosperity was still increasing in those days. Now we’re on the cusp of The Greater Depression. Things could get ugly. 
Contrary to what most believe, the US hasn’t had a real civil war yet. The unpleasantness of 1861–65 was actually a war of secession. A civil war is one where two or more groups are vying for the control of the same government, as in Spain during the 30’s, between the fascists and the communists. 
But this time in the US it could turn into a real civil war. I don’t know what form it would take, but a lot of things could be really tough going: economically, financially, politically, socially, militarily. Most important, there’s a cultural divide that’s arisen in the US. 
I don’t think most people are even aware of what is going on. When you walk outside, the sun is shining. Children are still playing. You can go down to the Wal-Mart and buy cheap goods. Everything looks pretty good on the surface, despite the fact everyone’s credit card is maxed out. But I think it’s all a hologram that’s about to be exposed. So, hold on to your hat.",0
17180,Watching My Surgeon Cut Into My Knee - The New York Times,"What if the surgeon started slicing into my knee before it was completely numb? That was my biggest fear, while weighing whether to remain alert and watch the operation on the cartilage in my right knee, or to be put to sleep, preserving my peaceful ignorance. Rational or otherwise, my reasons for staying awake  —   an option increasingly taken by patients, the subject of the accompanying article  —   prevailed. 1) I don’t like general anesthesia’s side effects. 2) For a long year, my knee pain had resisted straightforward diagnosis and treatment. I wanted an  ! glimpse of the problem. 3) Ever since I was a child, I have watched when the doctor gives me an injection. Not because I am brave, masochistic or even curious. On the contrary. Looking away, I imagine something far scarier. So watching a medical procedure has always been a form of  . (Related: As more patients stay awake for surgery, doctors have to watch what they say.) There I lay on the operating room table at Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, jabbering nervously to the anesthesiologist, waiting for the spinal block, an injection that was supposed to render the lower part of my body numb, to kick in. I didn’t know the etiquette. Was I permitted to talk? Or would that distract everyone? How would they know when the block was working? Was I already talking too much? Was that beleaguered exasperation in the anesthesiologist’s eyes? I thought they had given me a sedative. Is this me on sedatives? A blue surgical cloth had been draped over my hips. A nurse hoisted a bare limb and began washing it with sterilizer. How odd, I thought: Why have they brought a mannequin leg into the O. R.? Maybe a Halloween joke? I peered closely and recognized the chipped summer toenail polish. Wait. That leg belonged to me. The regional block was working. My surgeon, Dr. Robert G. Marx, strode in, greeting everyone, just another day at the office. We were ready to begin. He called for music. It so happens that about seven lifetimes ago, I was a disc jockey. The experience left me a little judgmental, perhaps, about others’ musical tastes. What would I put on the playlist “Music for Watching One’s Own Surgery”? (Rod Stewart, “The First Cut Is the Deepest” Louis Armstrong, “Mack the Knife”?) It would certainly not include Dr. Marx’s   choice: Rush, the Canadian   band. But Dr. Marx was raised in Canada. (So many other   musicians to choose from: Neil Young! Oscar Peterson! Drake! No, not Justin Bieber. Please.) Now he was bopping around, looking pumped. And there was my favorite right knee, naked, powerless in his hands. So I said nothing. To a civilian like me, arthroscopic surgery is astonishing. Although I couldn’t see what Dr. Marx was doing, he narrated as he made two incisions: one for a tiny camera, the other for a tiny instrument. Then, on an overhead monitor, video appeared. Now we could all have a good look around my knee innards. Very cool. Cartilage is relatively bloodless, shiny and white. “There’s your honker!” Dr. Marx explained, using his highfalutin medical term for the floating fragment of my medial meniscus. Whenever I attacked stairs, that piece tugged on the highly sensitive knee capsule, dense with nerves. I felt relief and affirmation. This pain had not been in my head. The fragments looked like rubbery slivers of squid sashimi, fluttering in dark video tunnels. Dr. Marx quietly pointed out that because I’d had this surgery once before (under general anesthesia) after today I would not have much medial meniscus remaining. Anxiously hanging on his every word, I did not find the news reassuring. The wistful, shimmering mirage of my 5K morning runs dimmed. But I felt better prepared for whatever the surgical outcome might be. For I could see exactly what he was talking about. Then he went after the honker and its progeny, elegantly chewing them up with an arthroscopic biter and smoothing down the edges with a shaver so that the remnants resembled a normal meniscus. Afterward, as I waited for the regional block to wear off, I was alert, with none of the chills or grogginess that bedeviled me with general anesthesia. I left the hospital a   patient, with new respect for the operating room staff members. And a speech to deliver to Dr. Marx about his musical taste.",0

17182,Muslim Gathering Laments a ‘Normalization of Bigotry’ - The New York Times,"ROSEMONT, Ill.  —   An imam of a mosque in New York City and his associate shot dead while strolling following afternoon prayers. A presidential candidate calling for Muslims to be barred from entering the United States. Muslim women harassed and physically attacked in Chicago while walking to their car. During the Islamic Society of North America convention that started here on Friday, official speakers said these actions had become all too commonplace in the United States. “In this political climate, we’ve seen a normalization of bigotry,” said Altaf Husain, an associate professor at Howard University and a vice president of the society, whose convention here is the largest Muslim gathering in the United States and Canada. But Mr. Husain, expressing what he said was the sentiment of many other American Muslims, said the Obama administration had made it a priority to bolster engagement with Muslims across the country. The latest example of the administration’s engagement came Saturday night when Jeh Johnson, the secretary of Homeland Security, became the first sitting cabinet member to address the Islamic Society’s convention. Mr. Johnson said his speech was part of a sustained outreach effort that has taken him from the suburbs of Washington to Minneapolis to Los Angeles, where he has met with community leaders and visited mosques, while fielding questions about racial profiling and   speech on the presidential campaign trail. In his address, Mr. Johnson told the audience that their lives were “the quintessential American story. ” He listed the contributions of   American Muslims, such as the boxer Muhammad Ali and Dalilah Muhammad, who won a gold medal in the   hurdles last month at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, and said they were not just Muslim heroes, but American heroes. “It’s frustrating to listen to those who foment fear, suspicion and intolerance,” Mr. Johnson said, “who don’t know the mistakes of history and are in the midst of repeating them. ” Mr. Johnson said his own history had made him more sensitive to the angry speech and physical attacks directed at Muslims. He cited his grandfather, Charles S. Johnson, the first black president of Fisk University, who was called before the infamous House   Activities Committee in 1949. In his testimony, he denied being a communist and defended the patriotism of   who were accused of being   for advocating civil rights. The irony is that the room where his grandfather testified is now the same room where the House Homeland Security Committee meets, Mr. Johnson said. “My grandfather likely testified in that hearing room to defend his patriotism now his grandson testifies in the same room to explain what the U. S. government is doing to defend our nation,” Mr. Johnson said. “This is the promise and wonder of this country. ” Mr. Johnson spoke to an audience that featured Khizr and Ghazala Khan, who made international headlines in July during the Democratic National Convention by criticizing the Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump, for his proposals to bar Muslims from entering the United States. The Khans lost their son, Humayun, an Army captain, while he was serving in Iraq. Although Mr. Johnson’s speech was greeted warmly, there were several small instances of protest. A few “boos” could be heard when Mr. Johnson entered to speak, and a couple of people held up a sign protesting the Department of Homeland Security’s deportation policies. The conference also featured a heated debate among several Muslim scholars and activists about the Department of Homeland Security’s efforts to counter extremism and recruitment by groups like the Islamic State. Several panelists said the government’s efforts focused on potential extremism within Muslim communities to the exclusion of white nationalist groups, which have been linked to several domestic terrorist attacks. George Selim, who heads the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Community Partnerships, said the department worked to counter the spectrum of extremism, and that his office’s work was done at the request of communities. “We focus on all forms of extremism,” he said. Despite the controversy over the programs to counter extremism, Mohamed Elsanousi, the director of the Washington office of the Network for Religious and Traditional Peacemakers, said he welcomed Mr. Johnson’s speech and the government’s help. “We need to partner with the government to address the issues of radicalization,” he said. “We cannot fight this fight alone. ”",0

17185,Donald Trump Calls Comments About Russia and Clinton Emails ‘Sarcastic’ - The New York Times,"GRAND RAPIDS, Mich.  —   Facing a torrent of criticism over his comments seeming to condone the hacking of Hillary Clinton’s emails by Russian intelligence services, Donald J. Trump and his allies on Thursday sought to tamp down his remarks, with Mr. Trump saying he was simply being “sarcastic. ” In public interviews and private conversations on Thursday, Mr. Trump his running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana and campaign staff members contended that Mr. Trump was being facetious when, during a news conference on Wednesday, he said he hoped Russia would be able to find Mrs. Clinton’s missing emails. “Of course I’m being sarcastic,” Mr. Trump told “Fox and Friends” Thursday morning as his aides accused the news media of misconstruing his remarks. And in an interview Thursday with the conservative radio host Laura Ingraham, Mr. Pence repeatedly said that Mr. Trump was merely joking. “He went on, using a statement laced with sarcasm, to point out that there are 33, 000 missing emails, according to the F. B. I. that Hillary Clinton deleted or did not make available in the course of that investigation,” Mr. Pence told Ms. Ingraham. But the assertions that his remarks should not be taken at face value were at odds with statements put out by Mr. Trump and his aides right after his news conference on Wednesday. Those statements insisted that Mr. Trump was urging Russia to return any purloined property to the F. B. I. Aides to both Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence were clearly caught off guard by Mr. Trump’s impromptu comments on Wednesday  —   when he said, “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30, 000 emails that are missing”  —   and were surprised by the swift and immediate reaction to them, especially in the news media. The extraordinary moment  —   in which the Republican nominee basically urged Russia, an adversary, to conduct cyberespionage against a former secretary of state  —   again left Mr. Trump isolated from even some fellow Republicans, struggling to explain away another comment that had dominated yet another news cycle, and not necessarily in a positive way. Ed Brookover, a Trump campaign liaison to the Republican National Committee, said that the substance of Mrs. Clinton’s emails was what was most important  —   not Mr. Trump’s remarks. “The truth about the emails is that Hillary’s record as secretary of state was abysmal, and her lack of security left our secrets vulnerable,” Mr. Brookover said. “Let’s hope that no foreign countries did get access to her private email account. ” On Thursday, even while trying to reframe his original comments, Mr. Trump reiterated his remarks from a day earlier that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is “a better leader” than President Obama. “I said he’s a better leader than Obama because Obama’s not a leader, so he’s certainly doing a better job than Obama is, and that’s all,” Mr. Trump said in the “Fox and Friends” interview. “But you have 33, 000 emails deleted, and the real problem is what was said in those emails from the Democratic National Committee,” Mr. Trump said. “You take a look at what was said in those emails, it’s disgraceful. It’s disgraceful. ” For the second day in a row, Mr. Trump seemed to be conflating the roughly 30, 000 emails on Mrs. Clinton’s private server during her time as secretary of state that her lawyers deleted as personal, and the roughly 20, 000 Democratic National Committee emails that were hacked. Mr. Trump’s efforts to recalibrate his original remarks Wednesday began just hours after his news conference. Mr. Trump posted on Twitter on Wednesday that he was simply urging Russia, if it had indeed hacked Mrs. Clinton, to hand her emails over to the proper authorities. “If Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton’s 33, 000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the F. B. I!” Mr. Trump wrote. Republicans were largely muted Thursday in their defense of Mr. Trump, save for Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, who is a supporter. “That server of hers was less secure than the D. N. C. server that was hacked,” Mr. Giuliani said at a news conference in Philadelphia, adding that he was “sure” Mr. Trump wanted the emails sent to the F. B. I. “Those emails are being held by people. They should be released before the election. ” In her radio interview Thursday morning, Ms. Ingraham asked Mr. Pence, “Should Americans be concerned that the Republican nominee is inviting a foreign government to hack into government emails?” Mr. Pence echoed the campaign’s public posture, saying several times that Mr. Trump was just being “sarcastic”  —   and he sought to recast Mr. Trump’s remarks. “Well, it’s absolutely not what he said,” Mr. Pence said. “What he said  —   what I said  —   was, clearly, if Russia or any foreign country was interfering or intervening or engaging in illegal activity in the United States, in our elections or otherwise, that there be serious consequences. ” At an afternoon rally Thursday in Davenport, Iowa, supporters of Mr. Trump offered almost uniform absolution for the comments, saying they believed he had been speaking facetiously. “I don’t think he was being serious,” said Tom Taylor, 68, a retiree from Wilton, Iowa. “It’s just media spin. He’s not a professional politician like the rest of them, so sometimes people misinterpret what he says. ” Still, some supporters allowed that Mr. Trump might have been imprudent in his remarks. “Maybe he shouldn’t have said that about Russia,” said Joan Watson, 63, from Walnut, Ill. “It just gives the Democrats more material for ads. I think he was just trying to get a reaction. But even if he was kidding, he knows Russia could probably do it. ” In a common refrain among the people waiting for the rally to begin, Dan Brethaner said of the comments, “That’s just Donald being Donald. ”",0
17186,"The Batcave, a Graffiti Landmark in Brooklyn, Grows Up - The New York Times","Standing on the Third Street Bridge over the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn, you can almost watch a community changing before your very eyes. On one side sits a    Whole Foods,   spinning in its vast parking lot. On the other, a cluster of   apartment towers is in the works, while the Ferrara Bros. concrete company, one of the largest in New York City, is preparing to relocate. The canal itself remains a murky Superfund site. The lone sentinel of the neighborhood’s postindustrial,   days is the   Batcave. A former Brooklyn Rapid Transit power station built in 1904, it was decommissioned in the 1950s and became a punk squat decades later, playing host to raucous dance parties and graffiti on practically every surface. Like many of the buildings lining the fetid waterway, it is poised for a rebirth. This year, the nonprofit Powerhouse Environmental Arts Foundation plans to break ground on a project that will provide a haven for two of the canal’s most endangered species: artists and manufacturers. The foundation plans to renovate and expand the power station, turning it into a factory of sorts for the production of art. The project, the Powerhouse Workshop, will include metalwork, woodwork, printmaking, ceramics and fiber art, as well as exhibition space. “The building has long been a destination for artists, and we wanted to keep it that way,” Katie Dixon, the foundation’s executive director, said during a recent tour of the cavernous former turbine hall. The Powerhouse Workshop will share at least one thing with its tonier neighbors:   designers, namely Herzog  de Meuron, the Pritzker   Swiss firm, who may now qualify as the most famous architects to work within a Superfund site. In many ways, the workshop brings that   firm full circle. Herzog  de Meuron’s breakout project was the Tate Modern, which took the old Bankside Power Station and turned it into one of the most popular museums in London. In Brooklyn, the designers are attempting the reverse, transforming a hub of underground culture back into an industrial complex, albeit for manufacturing art. The foundation spent four years studying what to do with the power station after purchasing it in 2012 for $7 million. The initial thought was studio space, but after surveying artists, the Powerhouse team discovered a greater unmet need: fabricating the art. That need has been growing more acute, as the same real estate pressures pushing out artists are displacing the artisans and manufacturers who helped realize their work. The foundation anticipates that the project will create more than 100 jobs. Operations will spread across the existing turbine hall and a new structure that traces the form of the boiler house that stood next door before its demolition in the 1950s. “The building always seemed very incomplete without the other third,” said Ascan Mergenthaler, a senior partner at Herzog  de Meuron who is overseeing the project. “Any addition should occupy the footprint of the original, so both become a whole again. ” The new   structure is essentially a large rectangle imbued with Herzog  de Meuron’s pyrotechnic modesty. Where the original building had a pitched roof and a pair of giant smokestacks, the new structure is flat. The original roofline will be visible, however, a ghost incised in the pattern of the facade. There had been discussions about creating new ventilation systems in the shape of the smokestacks, but that was deemed superfluous. “It’s always a very slippery slope how much you let the original building influence your designs,” Mr. Mergenthaler said. “We only take the things that make sense for operations today and throw the rest away. ” One thing the Powerhouse will not be throwing away is the Batcave’s graffiti. While the building needs considerable structural work, and a portion of the bricks will have to be removed to make repairs, any old surfaces that can be preserved will be. “It’s an incredible legacy for us to build on,” Ms. Dixon said. “There are so many layers here, we don’t want to take any away. We simply want to add our own. ” Though few individual pieces in the Batcave are particularly notable, Henry Chalfant, a graffiti expert, remarked on a recent tour how the totality of the art is what makes it special, a reminder of the “outlaw spaces” that once populated much more of the city. “It’s kind of a flashback coming in here for me, and being among all the graffiti,” Mr. Chalfant, who was a producer of the 1983 street art documentary “Style Wars,” said. The top floor of the turbine hall soars 25 feet to a   roof currently open to the sky. The hope is to glass it over to create a staging ground for art in progress, as well as for events and exhibitions. The foundation, established by the philanthropist Joshua Rechnitz, has spent $400, 000 on the site so far and plans to start construction this fall. No zoning changes are required since the Powerhouse conforms to the area’s industrial use. The foundation declined to release a budget for the project, which is still out to bid. It plans to open the Powerhouse Workshop in 2020. Not far from the Powerhouse, the project is already generating excitement. At the BRT Printshop in Red Hook, Brooklyn, which produces screen prints, Luther Davis recently recalled telling some of his artist clients about the complex. “Instantly, they had ideas for new pieces and new processes, like painting on metal sheets or textiles,” Mr. Davis said. “Just imagine having all these amazing craftspeople sitting around, looking at work or sipping coffee, all the ideas they might have. You can’t do that over the phone or email. ” The Powerhouse Workshop hopes to welcome powerhouses of the art world as well as striving artists. The latter might even pay reduced fees that would be offset by the more established  —   and expensive  —   work of others. To Ms. Dixon, it is an epochal opportunity for the New York art scene. “Even Andy Warhol,” she said, “had to leave the Factory to produce his work. ”",0
17187,Top 10 toxins that are poisoning your kids,"Top 10 toxins that are poisoning your kids 
  Amy Goodrich Tags: toxins , childrens health , poisoning (NaturalNews) Toxins are everywhere. They are lurking in the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat. Young children are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects our modern lifestyle creates. They can suffer profound and permanent adverse health effects which affect their developing brain and nervous system.A leading group of U.S. scientists, medical experts, and health organizations said that they are witnessing a dramatic increase in learning and behavioral issues in children. Therefore, they called for chemicals to be banned at the first sign of danger rather than waiting for direct, scientific proof.""Our failures to protect children from harm underscore the urgent need for a better approach to developing and assessing scientific evidence and using it to make decisions,"" the experts said.Here are the top ten toxins that our kids are exposed to on a daily basis. 1. Mercury fillings Europe, Norway, and Sweden banned mercury-leaching amalgams nearly a decade ago. Nonetheless, dental offices across the U.S. continue to use these toxic substances in their everyday practice. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), exposure to high levels of mercury can cause lung damage, while prolonged low exposure may result in memory loss, neurological impairment, kidney abnormalities, and skin rashes. 2. Vaccines As stated by the National Vaccine Information Center , a typical child receives about 49 recommended doses of 14 toxin-laden vaccines before the age of six. Here's a short list of the most common toxic chemicals found in vaccines: formaldehyde (used to preserve dead things), mercury, aluminum (associated with Alzheimer's), GMO yeast, antibiotics, and monosodium glutamate (MSG). 3. Prescription drugs Overprescribing doctors, with close ties to the Big Pharma are a real treat when it comes to your child's safety. Writing for Blogs Natural News , Dr. Brent Hunter explained that some of these drugs are the legal versions of addictive street drugs. Take ADHD medication as an example. These commonly prescribed drugs are quite similar to drugs like meth and speed. 4. Monosodium glutamate (MSG) MSG is a common, artificial food additive with neurotoxic effects. It has been linked to numerous health problems like brain lesions, obesity, malformed organs, abnormal reproductive systems, infertility, aggression, antisocial behavior, and high cholesterol. 5. Processed and fast foods We all know that processed or fast foods are bad news . They are loaded with artificial synthetic chemicals, preservatives, nitrates and artificial colors and flavors which have been linked to a host of adverse health effects. 6. Toxins in personal care products When you read the label of personal care products such as body washes, moisturizers, deodorants, and toothpaste, you might not recognize most of their ingredients. When these chemicals seep into the skin, they can cause devastating, long-term effects. Opt for non-toxic, organic alternatives instead. 7. Toxins in Laundry detergent If your laundry detergent has a strong, nice fragrance, chances are it is packed with cancer-causing toxins. Some of these chemicals can be absorbed through your skin. 8. Toxic cleaning products ""Keep out of reach of children,"" is not an uncommon phrase on the label of cleaning products. While we all know that they can be harmful or fatal when swallowed, Dr. Brent Hunter said that we don't need to drink them to experience the damaging side-effects. These chemicals can also end up in our body through inhalation or contact with the skin. 9. Pesticides Pesticides are everywhere. They are in our home, the environment, and the food we eat. Opting for natural pest control and organic, homegrown foods is your best chance to avoid these toxins from entering your home. 10. Soda Sodas are loaded with phosphoric acid which weakens your child's bones and teeth. Furthermore, they contain high amounts of high fructose corn syrup that causes obesity and diabetes.

17188,Russia and Turkey Vow to Repair Ties as West Watches Nervously - The New York Times,"MOSCOW  —   Against a backdrop of rising tensions between Turkey and the West, Presidents Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey pledged on Tuesday to repair relations after nine months of open antagonism. Although their meeting in St. Petersburg on Tuesday produced little beyond vows of friendship and cooperation, the symbolism of the two former antagonists coming together for a friendly talk was enough to raise alarms in Western capitals. Besides being a member of the NATO alliance, Turkey is vital to Europe’s efforts to stanch the flow of migrants from Syria and Afghanistan. Washington and Ankara, long at odds over American support of the Kurds in Syria and Iraq, have had a series of problems lately.   has been on the rise in Turkey, amid accusations that the United States played a role in the failed coup in Turkey and widespread resentment of the White House’s criticism of the resulting crackdown. Turkish officials have been further infuriated by President Obama’s reluctance to hand over Fethullah Gulen, a reclusive Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania whom Mr. Erdogan has accused of leading the coup attempt. For Mr. Putin, who has made little secret of his ambitions to weaken NATO and crack European unity, the opportunity to forge a new, closer relationship with a humbled Mr. Erdogan was probably deeply satisfying, and a vindication of his decision to intervene militarily in Syria. No one predicted a radical shift in relations, at least not immediately. Russia and Turkey have been on opposite sides of the Syrian conflict, and the two leaders had been at each other’s throats since November, when Turkey shot down a Russian warplane that it said had violated its airspace on the Syrian border. After the jet was shot down, Mr. Putin called Mr. Erdogan a   and demanded an apology, which was refused. That episode drew an angry response from Moscow, which banned most fruit and vegetable imports from Turkey and halted the flow of millions of Russian tourists. Although Russian gas sales to Turkey continued, the countries’ $30 billion in annual trade decreased by 43 percent, Mr. Putin said. “It is true that we lived through a complicated moment in our interstate relations,” Mr. Putin said at a joint news conference televised from St. Petersburg. “But we all would like to  —   and we feel that our Turkish friends want the same  —   overcome those complications. ” Feeling increasingly isolated this summer, Mr. Erdogan wrote a letter in June offering the apology Mr. Putin had demanded for the downing of the Russian jet. With that done, steps could begin toward a normalization of relations. Efforts to restore ties then accelerated after the July 15 coup attempt in Turkey, after which Mr. Putin was the first leader to call to offer support. “It was very important from a mental perspective, this kind of psychological support,” Mr. Erdogan said at the news conference. Any future agreements between the two countries could have significant repercussions for the Middle East and Europe. Mr. Erdogan most likely hopes to use the leverage of improved relations with Russia to force a better deal with Europe over the migrant crisis. European leaders have joined the United States in criticizing the sweeping arrests that followed the failed coup. Closer ties with Russia also carry the potential to create tensions within NATO that Mr. Putin would be happy to exploit. Ultimately, Moscow would like to draw Turkey into its orbit and into the security and trade organizations it is promoting in Asia, although such a shift is not expected anytime soon. “Erdogan can use Russia as a trump card in his negotiations with the West,” said Aleksandr D. Vasilyev, an expert on   ties at the Institute for Oriental Studies in Moscow. “For him, the main goal is the West, not Russia. ” If the White House was uneasy about the potential warming of relations between Turkey and Russia, nobody was saying so publicly. At the State Department on Tuesday, officials referred questions about the meeting to the Turkish government, and argued that the meeting itself had not changed the American calculus on the Middle East or Europe. “We don’t view this as a   game,” said Elizabeth Trudeau, a State Department spokeswoman. She noted that Turkey and Russia were both members of the United   coalition fighting the Islamic State, and had both been involved in the effort to end Syria’s civil war. “There’s a lot of common goals, common interests there. ” “I don’t think it’s a question at all that our relationship with Turkey would be weakened at all by this,” Ms. Trudeau added. She said she had no update on Turkey’s request for the United States to extradite Mr. Gulen, a “legal, technical process” about which American officials have been in direct contact with the Turkish authorities. The administration, Ms. Trudeau said, feels   rhetoric is “unhelpful” to the United States’ relationship with Turkey. “We believe our relations and our partnership and our friendship with Turkey is strong,” she said. As for Russia and Turkey, Syria remains a major potential fault line, despite the pledges to work together. Mr. Putin noted that the views of the two sides “do not always coincide” when it comes to Turkey’s southern neighbor. Mr. Erdogan is a bitter enemy of Syria’s president, Bashar   and has insisted that he step down before peace negotiations can begin. Russia, though, is a longtime ally of Mr. Assad’s, and it intervened with Iran in the Syrian conflict to bolster his fortunes. Yet the Kremlin also signaled on Tuesday that it was in Syria to stay. Mr. Putin called on Russia’s Parliament to approve an extended deployment of the Russian Air Force at Khmeimim Air Base outside Latakia, Syria, where its planes have flown sorties for almost a year to bolster Mr. Assad. Parliamentary approval is virtually guaranteed. “This is a demonstration that Russia has come to Syria for a very long time,” said Aleksandr M. Golts, a Russian military analyst. “This is a demonstration that it will support Assad and that it is ready to tie itself to a regime that is involved in a bloody civil war. ” Russia would like Turkey to seal its borders and stem the flow of fighters and weapons to the insurgents, and to reverse its demand that Mr. Assad must go. Ankara wants Moscow to stop bombing its insurgent allies to lessen support for the Kurds and to halt the bombing of civilian populations, which drives refugees into Turkey. As a possible sign of good will, a major Kurdish representative office closed in Moscow on Sunday, although the local representative said it was because of rent costs rather than politics. In the bleak days, planning was suspended on the Turkish Stream pipeline meant to deliver Russian gas to Europe, as well as on the Akkuyu nuclear power plant that Russia is building in southern Turkey. Russia’s gas industry, starting with Gazprom, the   behemoth, is eager to get the Turkish Stream back on track, because other routes to Europe have been blocked, and Turkey is just as keen on becoming a hub for gas distribution. “I think the interests of Gazprom and the energy companies are the cornerstone of what is happening,” said Mr. Vasilyev, the analyst. On Tuesday, the two leaders said they were planning to restart all that. Mr. Erdogan repeated their   pledge to eventually increase annual trade between the countries to $100 billion. “Both countries are committed and determined to returning our relationship to its   level,” Mr. Erdogan said at the news conference. Mr. Putin said Mr. Erdogan had pledged to grant the Akkuyu project the status of a “strategic investment,” helping it avoid taxes and reap other benefits. Russia agreed to lift sanctions that had barred some agricultural imports and had stopped the flow of millions of Russian tourists. As recently as May, the “complications,” as Mr. Putin called them, meant that Turkey in general, and Mr. Erdogan in particular, were often portrayed as enemy No. 1 on Russia’s   television. For all the professed warmth during the talks with Mr. Erdogan, Russia seemed to drop one subtle hint that things were not entirely back to normal. Greece and Turkey share a long, ancient enmity, and Russian news reports noted that Mr. Putin had met his Turkish counterpart in a restored czarist palace on the outskirts of St. Petersburg. They met in the Greek sitting room.",0
17189,"Globalists In Exile: ‘Party of Davos’ a Gloomy Event This Year After Brexit, Donald Trump’s Win - Breitbart","The globalists in world politics and international finance are celebrating a somber occasion in Davos, media reports indicate, as their influence on the global stage is waning rapidly in the wake of the U. K. referendum to leave the European Union and the U. S. election of Donald Trump to the presidency. [“The global economy is in better shape than it’s been in years. Stock markets are booming, oil prices are on the rise again and the risks of a rapid economic slowdown in China, a major source of concern a year ago, have eased,” Reuters’ Noah Barkin writes from Davos, Switzerland, at the annual summit of the world’s elite. “And yet, as political leaders, CEOs and top bankers make their annual trek up the Swiss Alps to the World Economic Forum in Davos, the mood is anything but celebratory. Beneath the veneer of optimism over the economic outlook lurks acute anxiety about an increasingly toxic political climate and a deep sense of uncertainty surrounding the U. S. presidency of Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated on the final day of the forum. ”  The Sydney Morning Herald’s Clancy Yeates has a piece detailing how this year’s World Economic Forum at Davos —  at which Chinese president Xi Jinping will speak, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel will not —  there is a focus on the “backlash” voters worldwide have delivered against globalization. “Chief executive pay has become a powerful symbol of the widening gap between the winners and losers created by globalisation, and boards must put more focus on justifying the bonuses they pay executives amid a backlash against   policies,” Yeates writes. “That is the view of the chairman of the Australian Institute of Company Directors, Elizabeth Proust, one of the Australian business leaders attending the powerful summit in Switzerland this week. The annual meeting of the global economic and political elite, in a town in the Swiss Alps, takes place against a backdrop of growing inequality in many countries, seen as a key driver for   political shocks including Brexit and Donald Trump’s win. ” The globalists at Davos still don’t seem to fully understand what is happening, as the World Economic Forum’s website published a column from Robert Muggah of the Igarape Institute with a headline stating boldly: “Populism is poison. ” He and   Misha Glenny, a writer and broadcaster, advocate for “plural cities” to defeat populism. Populism is poison. Plural cities are the antidote, says Robert Muggah https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   World Economic Forum (@wef) January 15, 2017,  “If cities are to defeat populism, they need to know what it is,” Muggah and Glenny write. “According to Princeton’s   Muller, at the core of populism is a profound rejection of pluralism. It is animated by two basic ideas  —   an opposition to diversity and a rejection of the   establishment. Populists contend that outsiders threaten the national way of life and that ‘the people’ need to exclude outsiders. The antithesis of the people is, oddly, migrants. ” Populists aren’t likely to slow their winning streak any time soon. Globalization is on the decline everywhere in the world, from Guatemala —  which elected a television comedian, Jimmy Morales, as its president back in late 2015 —  to Italy, whose recent referendum led to the resignation of prime minister Matteo Renzi. Obviously, America just elected Donald Trump and the British voted to leave the European Union. French and German presidential elections in 2017 threaten to see the potential rise of   Marine Le Pen and the possible demise of   Angela Merkel all in one fell swoop.  It’s unclear if Merkel will go down, or if Le Pen will win in France. But that we’re even at this point where it’s possible is remarkable in and of itself. Le Pen spent the past few days in New York City, making a surprise appearance at Trump Tower hoping for a meeting which she didn’t get with the  . Merkel, meanwhile, is clearly scared enough of a potential electoral loss in 2017 that she’s skipping her regular appearance in Davos at the World Economic Forum so as to avoid providing populist opponents of her globalism with any ammunition heading into this year. It comes on the heels of her pledge to ban burkhas in her speech announcing she intends to stand for   a complete reversal from a leading open borders advocate who’s perhaps singlehandedly overseen the importation of millions of Muslims into mainland Europe including Germany. The New York Times’ Michael J. de la Merced and Russell Goldman detail how the World Economic Forum has, for decades, been the exclusive annual   for the world’s political, financial and cultural elites —  a place where they gather together, and celebrate themselves. “The annual meeting runs on a tiered system of colored badges denoting just how important one is, or is not,” Merced and Goldman write. “White badges are for attendees able to attend any official event and make full use of the forum’s facilities. Orange badges are reserved for the 500 journalists who cover the forum, but are not allowed at some parties. Other badges, like purple ones, denote technical or support staff and limit their holders to a few areas. If that system were not complicated enough, local hotels like the Belvedere and the InterContinental often sell their own badges to the bankers and consultants who descend upon Davos  —   but not the forum itself  —   to strike deals and chat up clients. These souls camp out at the hotels, renting rooms for business meetings by day and soiree hopping at night. ” While most of the official events are things like lectures, speeches, panels and discussions, the Times writers highlight some of the “more esoteric attractions” like “a simulation of a refugee’s experience, where Davos attendees crawl on their hands and knees and pretend to flee from advancing armies. ” There are also lots of parties and schmoozing behind the scenes, where the elites bond together. “There are several official cocktail receptions, but the action really lies in a galaxy of events hosted by corporations. Some are small, intimate dinners that feature the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio and Bono,” Merced and Goldman write. “Others are dazzling affairs: JPMorgan Chase, for example, has previously taken over the Kirchner Museum Davos for drinks with its chief executive, Jamie Dimon, and Tony Blair, the former British prime minister. Google’s annual party at the InterContinental Hotel has become the hottest ticket in town. The investor Anthony Scaramucci, now an adviser to Donald J. Trump, for years has hosted a reception at the famed Hotel Europe featuring a sometimes   list of   Champagne and Bordeaux red wine. A more recent    is hosted by Salesforce. com, a business software maker, whose chief, Marc Benioff, is one of the forum’s most ardent boosters. Last year’s Salesforce party included Mr. Benioff flying in scores of fresh flower leis and a band from Hawaii, as Eric Schmidt of Google and other tech notables danced in a corner. Several years ago, Sean Parker of Napster and Facebook fame, hosted an    gathering that featured stuffed animal heads shooting laser beams out of their eyes. And the Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska has thrown opulent gatherings at a nearby villa where the Champagne flowed freely For a nightcap, the Davos crowd traditionally retires to the Tonic Bar at Hotel Europe, sipping cocktails while the forum fixture Barry Colson leads the crowd in Billy Joel singalongs. ” At last year’s Davos, the elites were certain the people of the world would never vote for things like Brexit or Trump or the Italian referendum. In other words, all was well. “Last year, the consensus here was that Trump had no chance of being elected. His victory, less than half a year after Britain voted to leave the European Union, was a slap at the principles that elites in Davos have long held dear, from globalization and free trade to multilateralism,” Barkin wrote in Reuters. This year, though, it’s a much gloomier affair in Davos. These world elites have found out, thanks to voters worldwide, they’re no longer the center of the universe. Financial elites are losing control on the world markets while political elites are losing control of international governments and cultural elites are seeing their star power fade. “Trump is the poster child for a new strain of populism that is spreading across the developed world and threatening the   liberal democratic order,” Barkin adds. “With elections looming in the Netherlands, France, Germany, and possibly Italy, this year, the nervousness among Davos attendees is palpable. ” And now, the gloomy affair in the Swiss Alps is getting even more depressing. According to Bloomberg’s Matthew Campbell and Simon Kennedy, those at Davos are even beginning to wonder if they’re “part of the problem. ” “Did the global elite’s devotion to borderless capitalism sow the seeds of a populist backlash?” reads the subhead of a recent Bloomberg piece from Campbell and Kennedy. The piece quotes Harvard professor and former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Kenneth Rogoff as admitting that Davos is never correct. “A joke I’ve told 1, 000 people in the months since leaving Davos is that the conventional wisdom of Davos is always wrong,” Rogoff said. “No matter how improbable, the event most likely to happen is the opposite of whatever the Davos consensus is. ” The elites at Davos are worried as the working class folks worldwide have stormed their castles and disrupted their lovely lives, the Bloomberg writers say, and they don’t find it very funny. “The repeated failure of business and political elites to predict what’s coming —  last year, that included the U. K.’s vote to leave the European Union —  doesn’t strike those returning this month to the Swiss Alps as very funny,” Campbell and Kennedy wrote. “After a year in which political upsets roiled financial markets and killed off the careers of     politicians, the concern for delegates attending this year’s meeting isn’t that their forecasts are often wrong, but that their worldview is. ” Populists shouldn’t take this as proof the war is over: The globalists will always try to fight back. There’s even rumblings that Party of Davos regular former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a disgraced   leader who lost his own primary election back in 2014 to now Rep. Dave Brat ( ) may try for a political comeback down the road. But if past is prologue, it’s unlikely these world elites will regain power and authority over the people who took their power away in the first place.",0

17191,"Trump, a Free-Form Leader, Experiments and Invites Drama - The New York Times","It began at dawn, with a Twitter post about  . In a period of just over 24 hours, stretching from the early hours of Tuesday into Wednesday morning,   Donald J. Trump raced through perhaps the most frenetic day of activity since the election. With a series of surprise announcements and impulsive public gestures, he brought into sharp focus the freewheeling and compulsively theatrical style he will bring to the Oval Office. There was the incendiary pronouncement about the flag: After Fox News aired a segment about protests that included   Mr. Trump suggested stripping people who burned the flag of their citizenship, even though the act is constitutionally protected free speech. There were hazy but   statements of policy: Mr. Trump announced a tentative pact with the   company Carrier to protect some jobs at an Indiana factory, and pledged again to sever ties with his real estate empire, without offering specifics. There was a new and indiscreet round of tryouts for secretary of state, featuring reviews from the   in something like real time. Having paraded David H. Petraeus, the former military commander and C. I. A. director, past a throng of reporters for a meeting on Monday, Mr. Trump dined on Tuesday with Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012 and another candidate for the job. They huddled at a French restaurant on Central Park West in Manhattan, briefly admitting the news media to take photographs of the smiling pair over scallops. On display, if not on the menu, was government à la Trump. While Mr. Trump’s focus appeared to careen unpredictably from hour to hour, the larger pattern he followed was a familiar one. As a candidate, Mr. Trump operated largely on gut instinct, with   provocation as his chief tactic. Trusting few people outside a circle of intimates, Mr. Trump thrived in a daily cycle of controversy and cultivated an atmosphere of   drama and division within his campaign. Much as he did during the campaign, Mr. Trump has kept the political world hanging on his every move, no matter how impetuous or trivial. He has aired his partial or fleeting thoughts, toying with the idea of making Rudolph W. Giuliani his secretary of state before appearing to lose interest. He has tolerated and even welcomed unsubtle combat over his selections, allowing a senior adviser, Kellyanne Conway, to roundly attack Mr. Romney on television while he remains a top contender for the cabinet. When Mr. Trump has incited controversy  —   with his   Twitter post, or an earlier allegation of mass voter fraud  —   he has declined to elaborate or justify his claims, and has left aides struggling to defend them, when they have tried at all. Mr. Trump’s method, friends and allies say, matches the reputation he built first in New York and then on reality television  —   less as a traditional corporate executive, like Mr. Romney, than as an eager impresario who experimented freely, welcomed conflict and flopped repeatedly. Newt Gingrich, a former speaker of the House who has advised Mr. Trump, said Mr. Trump’s transition process “very much resembles the way he operated in ‘The Apprentice,’” the NBC show in which Mr. Trump functioned as an imposing protagonist subjecting aspiring entrepreneurs to contests of business acumen. Mr. Gingrich said Mr. Trump plainly relished personal contact with possible appointees and favored a   leadership style. Mr. Trump did not emerge, Mr. Gingrich said, from a “corporate, staffed background,” but from a more   improvisational environment. “In a lot of ways, what you’re seeing is the continuation of techniques and lessons he learned from doing what was, at one time, the No. 1 TV show,” Mr. Gingrich said. For longtime critics of Mr. Trump, the spectacle of his transition has come as a kind of nightmarish vindication, seeming to confirm their warnings about what it would mean to have a reality television star in the nation’s most powerful office. Mr. Trump’s rivals in the Republican primary campaign often criticized him as a showman and not a real executive. At a Washington dinner in 2011, President Obama ridiculed the notion that Mr. Trump could run for president, recounting an episode of “The Celebrity Apprentice” in which Mr. Trump fired the actor Gary Busey and joking, “These are the kind of decisions that would keep me up at night. ” Jon Lovett, a former speechwriter for Mr. Obama who was an author of his speech belittling Mr. Trump, described a sense of horror at seeing the joke turn into reality. “It is extremely chilling that Donald Trump views the spectacle of choosing cabinet appointments in a way that is similar to deciding whether or not to fire Lil Jon or Joan Rivers,” Mr. Lovett said, referring to contestants on the show. It would be difficult to overstate the extremity of Mr. Trump’s departure from recent presidential practice. His immediate predecessors prided themselves on orderly, fastidious deliberations: George W. Bush as the first president with a business degree, Mr. Obama as a candidate branded by aides as “no drama Obama. ” Even Republicans concede that it is not clear how Mr. Trump’s   approach to the transition will carry over to governing. Mr. Gingrich predicted during the Republican primary contests that a Trump administration would function as a kind of daily adventure. “If Trump does end up winning, you will have no idea each morning what’s going to happen,” he said in a January interview, “because he will have no idea. ” But enacting sweeping changes or passing even modest legislation requires intensive, sustained attention from presidents and their teams, of a kind Mr. Trump has never dedicated to matters of policy. Since the election, Mr. Trump has made only a few   announcements aimed at soothing controversy or bolstering his popularity, like the Carrier deal or his pledge to preserve elements of the Affordable Care Act. But he has not situated any of his pronouncements within a larger, cohesive agenda, or answered even basic questions about them, like whether the terms extended to Carrier should be made available to other companies. Mr. Trump has appeared comparatively uninterested in a set of   appointments in which his close advisers, like Mike Pence, the vice   and Reince Priebus, the incoming White House chief of staff, have quietly installed Republican stalwarts. On Tuesday, after Mr. Trump raged on Twitter about   his transition team announced the selection of Elaine L. Chao, a former labor secretary, to lead the Department of Transportation, and Representative Tom Price of Georgia, a conservative   as Mr. Trump’s choice for health secretary. On Twitter, Mr. Trump made only one perfunctory mention each of Ms. Chao and Mr. Price, the man who would most likely be tasked with carrying out some of the  ’s most important campaign promises. By comparison, on Monday and Tuesday, Mr. Trump posted on Twitter twice about the Carrier deal and five times to criticize CNN for its coverage of him. Michael O. Leavitt, a former governor of Utah who prepared Mr. Romney’s transition team before the 2012 election, said a presidential transition usually “takes on the personality of the principal. ” Mr. Trump, he said, was taking an exceptionally public approach and showing far less regard than usual for the privacy of job candidates. “This is Donald Trump doing it his way, and no one should expect any different,” Mr. Leavitt said. “That doesn’t mean it’s right or wrong  —   it’s just Trump. ”",0

Green party presidential candidate Jill Stein delivers a stump speech to her supporters during a campaign stop at Humanist Hall in Oakland, Calif. on Thursday, Oct. 6, 2016. 
AUSTIN, Texas — Green Party presidential candidate Dr. Jill Stein accused The Daily Beast, a popular news and opinion website, of hiding its ties to the Clintons after publishing an attack on Stein’s investment portfolio on Wednesday. 
“ Jill Stein’s Ideology Says One Thing—Her Investment Portfolio Says Another ” declared the headline for an analysis of Stein’s investments and finances by Yashar Ali. The article suggests that Stein has millions of dollars invested in mutual funds which support industries she opposes on the campaign trail, including fossil fuels and the military-industrial complex. 
“If Mr. Ali is truly interested in conflicts of interest of political candidates and their families, where is his disclosure on the conflict of interest posed by Chelsea Clinton’s position as a director of the corporate owner of the Daily Beast, IAC ?” Stein fired back in a detailed response sent to the Daily Beast prior to publication and published to her campaign website in full on Wednesday . 

— Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) October 27, 2016 
Ali’s analysis was based on Stein’s financial disclosure filing with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, a requirement for all presidential candidates, which the office published in March. Ali also used Stein’s 2015 tax return , which the candidate released voluntarily earlier this year. Ali reported that Stein and her husband, Richard Rohrer, “have investments (with the exception of real estate) valued at anywhere from $3,832,050 to $8,505,000,” then criticized the candidate for her investment in a series of index funds or mutual funds which offer investors relatively safe and consistent returns on their money. However, in exchange for reliable earnings, investors also give up control over where their money is used. 
“Like many Americans who hold retirement accounts, pension funds, or who invest in the American economy, my finances are largely held in index funds or mutual funds over which I have no control in management or decision-making,” Stein wrote in her response. 
She added: “Over the years I have taken steps to divest from the worst of these holdings — transferring my checking and savings accounts from Bank of America largely to a credit union, and divesting from GE, Dupont and Merck stocks I had been given decades ago.” 
While “green” mutual funds exist, Stein noted that many of these funds actually invest in fracking and biofuels, making them “not much better than the non-green funds.” She continued: 
“I have not yet found the mutual funds that represent my goals of advancing the cause of people, planet and peace. Admittedly I have not spent a lot of time researching elusive ethical investments. I prefer using my time fighting for social, economic and ecological transformation, and recycling capitalist money into the fight to do so.” 
She also wrote that she inherited “over a half-million dollars” from her parents, and that she’s used her investments and capital to “help build the social and political movements needed for transformative change.“ 
Ali’s article was designed to distract voters from larger issues of corruption within the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party, she suggested. She elaborated; 
“He has created an imagined conflict of interest, perhaps to distract from the very real, harmful conflicts of interest in the Clintons’ pay-to-play schemes, back-room fundraising, and quarter-million dollar speeches for the predatory banks, health insurance industry, and fossil fuel tycoons, who have directly benefited from Hillary Clinton’s policy record as Senator and Secretary of State, as well as from Bill Clinton’s actions as President.” 
In October, Forbes staff writer Dan Alexander estimated that Bill and Hillary Clinton were worth about $45 million, though he noted that their tax returns and financial disclosure filings left millions in earnings unaccounted for. In February, CNN reported that the Clintons earned $153 million in speaking fees between 2001 and the spring 2015 launch of Hillary Clinton’s latest presidential campaign. 
Under Stein’s “Green New Deal” platform , the United States would transition away from foreign wars and fossil fuels by investing heavily in renewable energy. 
In addition to its ties to Chelsea Clinton, The Daily Beast’s editor, Michael Weiss, has been criticized for supporting neoconservative U.S. foreign policy, including military intervention and empire building. In August, Richard Silverstein , writing for alternative media analysis site The Unz Review, noted that Weiss is frequently tapped to advocate for war on TV news programs. He wrote: 
“Weiss, age 36, has been an itinerant freelance journalist and military interventionist gun-for-hire, plying his trade from Washington DC, to London, to the outlying lands of former Russian empire, to the ruins of Syria. 
With his role as CNN commentator and senior editor at the Daily Beast, he is a leading light among a new young generation of neoconservative intellectuals.” 
In April 2015, Stein told MintPress News that the media deliberately marginalizes third-party voices in order to keep voters from being fully informed about all their choices. 
She told Carmen Russell-Sluchansky: 
“It illustrates what they are terrified of. If people learn that they have an option that reflects what they want, they will vote for it. Half the population doesn’t vote because they don’t like what they see as their options.”",0

17195,S Korea coast guard opens fire on China boats,"S Korea coast guard opens fire on China boats 11/02/2016 
PRESS TV 
South Korean coast guard vessels have opened fire on Chinese trawlers allegedly fishing illegally off South Korea’s coast, prompting Beijing to censure Seoul. 
On Wednesday, senior coast guard official Kim Jung-shik said the order to fire machine guns had been given during a confrontation with some 30 Chinese fishing boats. 
The Chinese vessels had been allegedly operating illegally near South Korea’s Yellow Sea border with North Korea on Tuesday. 
“They tried to ram our ships although we repeatedly warned them,” Yonhap news agency quoted Kim as saying. 
The South Korean coast guard forces initially fired into the air but were later ordered to fire on the bows of the trawlers. 
“I thought our officers would be in danger if I allowed any more resistance so we ended up using the crew service weapon,” Kim said. 
Two Chinese boats were seized in the incident, which reportedly caused no casualties. 
The machine gun shootout is the first of its kind since the South Korean coast guard declared in September that it would apply a “more aggressive” firearms policy with Chinese boats. 
The shooting left Beijing “strongly dissatisfied” with China’s Foreign Ministry calling on Seoul to “discipline” its coast guard. 
“Using destructive weapons can easily hurt fishermen and we urge the ROK (South Korea) side to … avoid using any excessive or extreme tools in their law enforcement activities,” said China’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying. 
Numerous incidents have occurred in recent years between South Korea’s coast guard and Chinese fishing boats venturing across international waters in search of fish. 
On October 10, Seoul said it had lodged a formal complaint with Beijing over the alleged sinking of a South Korean coast guard vessel by Chinese fishermen on October 7.

Opposition leaders, addressing protesters massed along the capital’s broad main highway, promised to increase the pressure on Mr. Maduro’s   government with a   general strike on Friday. “This government has lost the most important thing, and that is what we have today: the people,” said Henrique Capriles, a   presidential candidate and leader of the Primera Justicia Party. “Gentlemen of the government, we are giving you a deadline. ” Thousands of demonstrators rallied in many other Venezuelan cities. In Mérida, 73 people were injured during a clash between protesters and the police, Mérida’s mayor, Carlos García, said. Armed groups created to protect the government were also involved in the fighting. A police officer was shot and killed during a protest in the state of Miranda, the interior minister, Néstor Reverol, said Wednesday night. If the government does not allow the referendum to go forward, the opposition parties said they would lead a march to the presidential palace next Thursday. The protest was a powerful display of unity from the opposition, which has responded with fury to the decision last week by Venezuela’s Electoral Council to suspend the process for organizing a recall referendum. The council’s ruling, which halted the collection of voters’ signatures needed to initiate the referendum, was a sharp break with the government’s commitment until now to holding elections. “This is a dangerous new phase,” said David Smilde, a scholar of Venezuela at Tulane University and a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America. “I think the government last week really changed the game. ” “Apparently they see this as a safer line of resistance than going forward with the referendum,” he added. On Tuesday, the   National Assembly voted to begin a political trial against Mr. Maduro, accusing him of carrying out a coup against the Constitution. Mr. Maduro has described the referendum drive as a coup against his elected government. Polls show that an overwhelming majority of Venezuelans, scrambling to find food and medicine in a collapsing economy, would vote to remove Mr. Maduro. “The right does not want dialogue because they want a coup and foreign intervention,” Mr. Maduro said before a small crowd of   supporters gathered outside the presidential palace on Wednesday. “But here there will be no coup nor intervention. ” Mr. Maduro has responded to the opposition’s activism with calls for dialogue, which opposition leaders believe is a bid to wait them out. Mr. Maduro met on Wednesday with leaders of the different branches of government, which are all firmly under his party’s control, with the exception of the National Assembly. Photos in a Twitter message by Mr. Maduro’s spokesman highlighted the empty chair reserved for Henry Ramos Allup, the opposition president of the National Assembly, who was at the protest instead of at Mr. Maduro’s meeting. “I am not going to attend this theater, this farce,” Mr. Ramos said. The Vatican has stepped in to mediate, but it is unclear which opposition leaders, if any, will attend the first round of the discussions scheduled for Sunday on Margarita Island. The opposition has instead unified around street protests. The challenge will be to “take this outpouring and channel it into a sustained movement on the streets,” Mr. Smilde said. In the past, rivalries among opposition leaders have made it difficult for them to come together on a strategy. “They are underperforming given the level of discontent,” he said. That discontent was on full display as people streamed to the protest on Wednesday morning. “Enough of this regime, which puts obstacles to everything,” said Vanessa Furtado, 45, a schoolteacher from the poor neighborhood of Las Minas de Baruta. “There is no security, no economic or work stability. Maduro is scared. The solution here is electoral, it’s all we have. ” Elliot Manuel Pérez Medina, a college student, was disappointed that the opposition put off marching to the presidential palace on Wednesday. As he spoke, a group of armed government supporters began to surround his group of protesters. “Why are we going to talk with people who always put a gun to our head and always repress us?” he asked. But not everybody who wanted to attend the protest could do so. Miurka Castillo, 47, said she suffered from seizures this year the shortages were so severe that she cannot find the medicine she needs she spent the morning bartering flour for three pills. “Nobody wants to go more than me,” she said. “I need this government to leave. I think that would change things. ”",0

17198,Brain Scans of Brazilian Babies Show Array of Zika Effects - The New York Times,"The images tell a heartbreaking story: Zika’s calamitous attack on the brains of babies  —   as seen from the inside. A study of brain scans and ultrasound pictures of 45 Brazilian babies whose mothers were infected with Zika in pregnancy shows that the virus can inflict serious damage to many different parts of the fetal brain beyond microcephaly, the condition of unusually small heads that has become the sinister signature of Zika. The images, published Tuesday in the journal Radiology, also suggest a grim possibility: Because some of the damage was seen in brain areas that continue to develop after birth, it may be that babies born without obvious impairment will experience problems as they grow. “It really brings to the forefront the importance of truly understanding the impact of Zika virus and the fact that we need to follow children who not only are exposed to Zika in pregnancy, but even those who don’t appear to have any complications at birth,” said Dr. Catherine Y. Spong, acting director of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, who was not involved in the study. Most of the babies in the study were born with microcephaly, although three were not. Each also suffered other impairments, almost all of which emerge earlier than microcephaly because a smaller head is really a consequence of a brain that has failed to develop fully or has been damaged along the way, experts said. “The brain that should be there is not there,” said Dr. Deborah Levine, an author of the study and a professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School. “The abnormalities that we see in the brain suggest a very early disruption of the brain development process. ” The scans show the range of Zika’s brain targets, some of which experts knew about, including the corpus callosum, which facilitates communication between the two hemispheres the cerebellum, which plays a significant role in movement, balance and speech and the basal ganglia, which are involved in thinking and emotion. “I think we were all aware that Zika causes brain abnormalities, but it’s been more generic,” said Dr. Rita Driggers, an associate professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study. “Now we know more specifically what we’re looking for in terms of brain abnormalities before the microcephaly occurs. ” Together, the images provide a more detailed guide that might help doctors diagnose   fetal damage earlier  —   possibly in the second trimester at a point early enough to help women decide whether to terminate a pregnancy, said Dr. Adre du Plessis, director of the Fetal Medicine Institute of Children’s National Health System, who was not involved in the study. At the same time, the study may eventually help doctors rule out damage caused by Zika infection. “If there’s any uncertainty on ultrasound, we’re concerned that couples that are not   and don’t want to gamble might be terminating perfectly normal babies, which is of course a concern to us,” he said. “So there is a lot riding on being able to image accurately. ” One finding that surprised several experts could become an especially meaningful diagnostic clue. Many infections that target the brain produce clumps of calcium, called calcification. But in   babies, calcification often occurred in an unusual place: at the intersection of the gray matter of the outer layer of the brain, the cortex, and the white matter of the layer just below that. That pattern could emerge as a particular stamp of Zika infection, experts said. Dr. Spong said that because the area involves two different types of blood vessels, it might suggest that Zika targets vascular areas. And it could signal why the virus wreaks such ruthless effects on brain development. “That is a critical area for brain formation,” Dr. du Plessis said. At the   matter intersection, healthy cells “release certain chemicals that allow the neurons to find their precise destination. ” “When that gets scrambled they end up in the wrong place, they don’t function the way they should, and messaging and connectivity is severely deranged. ” Most of the babies in the study had such damage in the cortex, which plays a crucial role in learning, memory and coordination, and also continues to develop at least through infancy, suggesting that   babies who seemed to emerge unscathed might be vulnerable to difficulties as they grow. Another abnormality seen in most of the babies’ brains involved the ventricles or cavities of the brain becoming so full of cerebrospinal fluid that they “blow up like a balloon,” Dr. Levine said. The ventricles may be filling with fluid because Zika is obstructing their ability to drain normally, or because damage to other brain areas leaves a kind of vacuum that the enlarged ventricles fill. The   ventricles can make the head size seem normal earlier in pregnancy, Dr. Levine said. But as scans of one pregnancy taken at 36 weeks gestation show, the fluid can be so prominent that the scan shows what “looks like the skull and very little brain tissue inside it,” she said. At some point, these ventricles, “like a balloon, can pop,” she said. And if they do, “the brain will collapse on itself. ” The images come from 17 babies whose mothers had confirmed Zika infection during pregnancy and 28 without laboratory confirmation but with all indications of Zika infection. Dr. Levine worked with colleagues in Brazil, which has more than 1, 800 cases of microcephaly, to analyze images from the Instituto de Pesquisa in Paraiba in the northeastern part of the country. Three of the babies died in the first three days of life, and researchers studied autopsy reports in those cases. The images include scans of twin girls, who both developed microcephaly. The pictures show folds of overlapping skin and a sloping forehead, indications not only that the brain is smaller, but also that the forebrain has not developed normally, Dr. Levine said. Images of another baby girl show contracted hands and arms, the result of another common symptom. Zika seems to damage the nerves in a developing fetus so that sometimes “muscles aren’t developing normally because they don’t have the nerve impulses to move normally,” she said. “And then when they’re born, they’re stuck in this contracted position. ” Dr. Levine said the images suggest that Zika is like a formidable enemy able to do damage in three ways: keeping parts of the brain from forming normally, obstructing areas of the brain, and destroying parts of the brain after they form. With such a vicious and unpredictable virus, “it’s key to realize that Zika is more than microcephaly, that there’s a number of other abnormalities as they’ve shown in this paper, and its effects are going to be even more broad,” said Dr. Spong, whose agency has begun a study of what will ultimately be 10, 000 babies born in Zika epidemic areas including Brazil and Puerto Rico. “It’s going to be essential to follow them to look at their development, to look at their ability to learn, to look at hearing problems, balance problems, behavior problems, all those issues, to make sure that we don’t miss anyone. ”",0
17199,Like a ‘Concentration Camp’ Police Mark DAPL Protesters with Numbers & Lock Them in Dog Kennels,"Posted on October 30, 2016 by Claire Bernish 
Cannon Ball, N.D. — On Thursday, police from no less than five states sporting full riot gear and armed with heavy lethal and nonlethal weaponry, pepper spray, mace, a number of ATVs, five tanks, two helicopters, and military-equipped humvees showed up to tear down an encampment of Standing Rock Sioux water protectors and supporters armed with … nothing. 
Under orders from the now-notorious Morton County Sheriff’s Office, this ridiculously heavy-handed standing army came better prepared to do battle than some actual military units fighting overseas. 
But the target of their operation — a group of slightly more than 200 Native American water protectors and supporters opposing construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline — never intended to do battle with the armed, taxpayer-funded, corporate-backed, state-sponsored aggressors. 
Reports vary, but no less than 141 people were arrested Thursday, and — according to witnesses — police marked numbers on arrestees’ arms and housed them in cement-floored dog kennels , without any padding, before they were transported as far away as Fargo. 
“It goes back to concentration camp days,” asserted Oceti-Sakowin coordinator Mekasi Camp-Horinek, who, along with his mother, was marked and detained in a mesh kennel, reports the Los Angeles Times . 
Although Thursday’s incident remained relatively peaceful for some time, with only shouts, chants, and occasional attempts by water protectors to convince this standing army to examine its motives and reconsider, clashes nonetheless broke out — solely because of gratuitous police aggression. 
After facing off for a couple hours, these militant cops began closing in on the water protectors to shut down the Treaty of 1851 camp — in reference to the Fort Laramie Treaty of that year, which established a large parcel of land designated exclusively Native American territory not to be disturbed by the U.S. government. Prior to his arrest, Camp-Horinek had established the camp, stating, as cited by Indigenous Rising : 
“Today, the Oceti Sakowin has enacted eminent domain on DAPL lands, claiming 1851 treaty rights. This is unceded land. Highway 1806 as of this point is blockaded. We will be occupying this land and staying here until this pipeline is permanently stopped. We need bodies and we need people who are trained in non-violent direct action. We are still staying non-violent and we are still staying peaceful.” 
Despite the water protectors’ commitment to nonviolence, the militarized police response went as would be expected — horribly awry. 
“A prayer circle of elders, including several women, was interrupted and all were arrested for standing peacefully on the public road,” stated a press release from Indigenous Environment Network. “A tipi was erected in the road and was recklessly dismantled, despite law enforcement statements that they would merely mark the tipi with a yellow ribbon and ask its owners to retrieve it. A group of water protectors was also dragged out of a sweat lodge ceremony erected in the path of the pipeline, thrown to the ground, and arrested.” 
Claims to the contrary by Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier aside, Native American and Indigenous water protectors and supporters have refrained from violent acts on the whole, preferring instead peaceful prayer vigils and acts of civil disobedience. 
No matter how peacefully the opposition acts, armed defenders of Big Oil interests seem determined to brutalize , disrespect, and generally incite and inflict violence against those who desire unsullied water for generations to come. 
In fact, at the beginning of September, a private security firm hired by Energy Transfer Partners, the company responsible for pipeline construction, indiscriminately unleashed vicious attack dogs on water protectors, press, and supporters — for reasons as yet unknown. 
During the savage attack, a pregnant woman, young girl, and many others suffered serious dog bites thanks to the ineptitude of the dogs’ handlers. Afterward, a warrant for inciting a riot was issued Democracy Now! journalist Amy Goodman — for doing her job, filming events as they happened — though charges were subsequently thrown out. 
Although ETP and some law enforcement officers defended the barbarous actions of the private security mercenaries, the Guardian now reports that — because the guards lacked proper licensing — they could now face criminal charges. On Wednesday, the Morton County Sheriff’s Office made the determination that “dog handlers were not properly licensed to do security work in the state of North Dakota.” 
Bob Frost, owner of Ohio-based Frost Kennels, told the Guardian , “All the proper protocols … were already done. I pulled my guys out the next day because we weren’t there to go to war with these protesters.” 
Frost insisted he had cooperated with authorities investigating the incident — but the sheriff’s department disagrees. Seven handlers and dogs were deployed to the scene in early September, allegedly in response to reports of trespassers; but, according to the Guardian , police have only managed to identify two people. 
The sheriff’s department claims Frost has not provided necessary information, and unnamed security officials cited in the report said that “there were no intentions of using the dogs or handlers for security work. … However, because of the protest events, the dogs were deployed as a method of trying to keep the protesters under control.” 
In a statement cited by the Guardian , Morton County Captain Jay Gruebele said, “Although lists of security employees have been provided, there is no way of confirming whether the list is accurate or if names have been purposely withheld.” 
Water protectors, in the meantime, are left to deal with absurdly disproportionate state violence — and the altogether unacceptable, disrespectful, and demeaning insult of being relegated to dog kennels after being arrested for exercising their rights. 
As Lakota Country Times editor Brandon Ecoffey wrote in an editorial Thursday, 
“Over the course of the last several months the abuse of detainees by Morton County Law Enforcement has overstepped every boundary guaranteed by the American constitution. Water protectors have been seen being bound and hooded by police. People are being stripped searched and abused within their jail for misdemeanor crimes. And police have employed the use of mass surveillance through drones on the protector camps. This isn’t a war zone this is North Dakota.” Don't forget to follow the D.C.

17200,"After a Disappointing Debate, Donald Trump Goes on the Attack - The New York Times","Donald J. Trump lashed out on Tuesday in the aftermath of a disappointing first debate with Hillary Clinton, scolding the moderator, criticizing a beauty pageant winner for her physique and raising the prospect of an   attack on Bill Clinton’s marital infidelities in the final stretch of the campaign. Having worked assiduously in recent weeks to cultivate a more disciplined demeanor on the campaign trail, Mr. Trump cast aside that approach on Tuesday morning. As Mrs. Clinton embarked on an ebullient campaign swing through North Carolina, aiming to press her newfound advantage, Mr. Trump vented his grievances in full public view. Sounding weary and impatient as he called into a Fox News program, Mr. Trump criticized Lester Holt, the NBC News anchor, for asking “unfair questions” during the debate Monday evening, and speculated that someone might have tampered with his microphone. Mr. Trump repeated his charge that Mrs. Clinton lacked the “stamina” to be president, a claim critics have described as sexist, and suggested that in the future he might raise Mr. Clinton’s past indiscretions. Defying conventions of political civility, Mr. Trump leveled cutting criticism at a beauty pageant winner, Alicia Machado, whom Mrs. Clinton held up in Monday night’s debate as an example of Mr. Trump’s disrespect for women. Mr. Trump said on Fox he was right to disparage the former Miss Universe because of her weight. “She was the winner and she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem,” said Mr. Trump, who was the pageant’s executive producer at the time. Mrs. Clinton has already been broadcasting an ad highlighting crude remarks from Mr. Trump about women she answered his taunts about her marriage with a rhetorical shrug, telling reporters Mr. Trump was free to run whatever kind of campaign he preferred. On board her campaign plane, she plainly relished her moment of apparent triumph, and poked fun at Mr. Trump’s morning lamentations. “Anybody who complains about the microphone,” she said, “is not having a good night. ” Mr. Trump’s setback in the debate represents a critical test in the final six weeks of the race. Having drawn closer to Mrs. Clinton in the polls, Mr. Trump now faces an intensified clash over his personal temperament and his attitudes toward women and minorities  —   areas of grave concern for many voters that were at the center of the candidates’ confrontation on Monday. Against Mr. Trump’s brooding, Mrs. Clinton cut a strikingly different profile on the campaign trail on Tuesday, emerging emboldened from her encounter with the Republican nominee. At a rally in Raleigh, N. C. Mrs. Clinton, brandishing her opponent’s debate stumbles, assailed Mr. Trump’s comments suggesting he avoided paying taxes and welcomed the 2008 financial crisis as a buying opportunity. “What kind of person would want to root for nine million families losing their homes?” Mrs. Clinton asked the crowd. “One who should never be president, is the answer to that question. ” Having shaken at least temporarily the malaise of the past month, Mrs. Clinton must seek to gain a durable upper hand over Mr. Trump, who before the debate had been delivering a more focused message on trade, immigration and national security. Mr. Trump’s comportment on Tuesday threatened to undermine his gains of the past month, and recalled his practice during the Republican primaries and much of the general election of belittling political bystanders in language that alienated voters, like attacking the Muslim parents of an Army captain killed in Iraq and a Hispanic federal judge. It remains to be seen if Mr. Trump will approach the remainder of the race with the unfiltered abandon of his comments Tuesday morning. By the day’s end, Mr. Trump had returned to a caustic but somewhat more conventional script, attacking Mrs. Clinton in bitter language at a rally in Melbourne, Fla. Blasting Mrs. Clinton as a “vessel for her friends, the donors,” Mr. Trump exhorted the crowd, “We’re going to get rid of that crooked woman. ” And Mr. Trump again complained at the event about how he had been treated by Mr. Holt, whom he referred to as “the M. C. ” The fear among Republicans is that Mr. Trump will confront adversity by continuing to swing impulsively at politically inopportune targets, dragging the party again into needless and damaging feuds, as he did for most of the summer. The notion of raising Mr. Clinton’s infidelity is particularly controversial among Mr. Trump’s advisers, who have sent conflicting signals about that line of attack. Kellyanne Conway, Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, said in a CNN interview that he deserved credit for holding back from that particular subject, saying Mr. Trump had been “polite and a gentleman. ” But Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former New York City mayor and a close confidant of Mr. Trump’s, called for a far harsher approach. Mr. Trump, he told a reporter for the website Elite Daily, had been “too reserved” in his confrontation with Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Giuliani recommended attacking Mrs. Clinton for having questioned Monica Lewinsky’s credibility in claiming an affair with Mr. Clinton. He also called Mrs. Clinton “too stupid to be president. ” Mr. Giuliani has his own complex marital history: He is on his third marriage as mayor, he surprised his second wife by announcing his plans to separate from her at a news conference. Should Mr. Trump follow the path prescribed by Mr. Giuliani, it could transform the final six weeks of his candidacy into an onslaught of unrestricted personal vituperation  —   a risky course that would probably please Mr. Trump’s political base at the cost of his broader appeal. But Democrats signaled on Tuesday that they would welcome an extended battle with Mr. Trump over matters of temperament and personal character. Priorities USA Action, a “super PAC” supporting Mrs. Clinton, released a television ad highlighting a debate exchange in which Mr. Trump said his temperament was his “strongest asset,” along with clips of Mr. Trump using obscene and violent language. And Mrs. Clinton’s running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, said in a television interview that Mr. Trump had appeared “flustered” and “ran out of gas. ” During a campaign stop in Orlando, Fla. Mr. Kaine suggested that Mr. Trump was too unsteady for the White House. “If you’re that rattled in a debate,” he said, “try being president. ” Still, among Mr. Trump’s core voters, there is clearly an appetite for blunter and more personal attacks on Mrs. Clinton, and at his rally in Florida, several said they hoped Mr. Trump would be harsher in the next debate. “I’m glad he was a gentleman,” said Fran Hadjilogiou, 75, of Indian Harbour Beach. “He should just go get her next time. ” Jim Clapper, 66, of Palm Bay, said he hoped Mr. Trump would bring up Mr. Clinton’s infidelity “every chance he gets. ” “He ought to bring it up every day so that the young people in this country know what went on with that family,” Mr. Clapper said.",0
17201,US Military Preps Transgender Army For Prolonged War On God [insert “U! S! A!” chant here],"Print 
Just in case anyone might be tempted to defend their denial by latching onto the now-laughable proposition that the US Army going with an openly lesbian general was a fluke or that the US Navy naming a new warship after famed gay rapist Harvey Milk was an anomaly or that Army Cadets being pressured into crossdressing was a weird little mistake that somehow slipped through the cracks of an otherwise honorable and good approach to reality, we keep getting wave after wave after tsunami after avalanche of crystal clear confirmation of the US military’s proud, headlong plunge into oblivion (and oblivion advocacy, of course). 
The latest example of God-given uber-clarity on the matter comes in the form of a lovely little article entitled First transgender soldiers seek formal Army recognition , wherein AP reports (with bold emphasis added): 
Within weeks of the Pentagon allowing transgender service members to serve openly, Army officials said 10 soldiers have formally asked to be recognized as their new, preferred gender. The small number represents only those who have publicly said they are transgender, and doesn’t include soldiers who may be considering or beginning gender transition or those who don’t yet want to make an official paperwork change. Gen. Mark Milley, chief of staff of the Army, said the key now is to educate the force, particularly commanders who will have to make decisions about soldiers in their units who request a gender change. “Is the army ready? Well, we are educating ourselves, and we are trying to get ready,” Milley said in an interview with The Associated Press. “We’re well-past the issue of debating and arguing about transgender. We are now into execution, to make sure the program is carried out with diligence, dignity, respect.” Dignity and respect, eh? Do tell. So the US military is now of a mind that the Christian worldview is inherently anti -dignity and anti -respect. Anti-kittens, anti-rainbows, and anti-love, too, I’m sure. That’s how anti-Christ perspectives roll: They tar the Christian worldview (and the God whose Nature it reflects) as mean and evil. They make good evil and evil good. At least they try to anyway. [insert “ U! S! A! ” chant here] Now back to the AP article: The Pentagon policy took effect Oct. 1, and Army Secretary Eric Fanning approved the service’s new transgender guidelines earlier this month. Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced in June that he was ending the ban on transgender individuals serving openly in the military. Transgender troops are now able to receive medical care and begin changing their gender identifications in the Pentagon’s personnel system. Next year, the military services will begin allowing transgender individuals to enlist, as long as they meet required standards and have been stable in their identified gender for 18 months. “We’re monitoring implementation closely, and everything we’ve seen so far points to a military organization fully committed to treating everyone equally and providing medically necessary care to all troops, not just some,” said Aaron Belkin, director of the California-based Palm Center, an independent research institute. “My conclusion, so far, is that implementation has proceeded smoothly and successfully.” . . . Milley said the Army numbers so far are low, but the service doesn’t track the number of soldiers who may be starting the gender transition process. “We may not know the full scope yet,” said Milley. “Others that may consider themselves as transgender but haven’t self-identified publicly may be holding back because they want to see how things progress.” 
Progress. 
That’s the name of the game, isn’t it? 
The US Army is committed to progress. 
Explicitly anti-Christian progress, of course. 
The US Army is at war. 
With God. 
And His people. 
That’s how these fights always end in God’s cosmos. 
That’s how they always unfold in His creations of time and history. 
So take heart, Christian. 
Either way – whether through the beauty of a repentant and restored America being spared judgment and finding life again in loving, willful subjugation to Christ as King, or by way of King Jesus breaking yet another in a long line of unrepentant, proud, God-hating cultures to pieces under the weight of His unbreakable Law , His people always win and His Kingdom always advances…all by His grace and all for His glory.

(CNN) The Democratic National Committee is suing the Republican National Committee for aiding GOP nominee Donald Trump as he argues that the presidential election is “rigged,” claiming that Trump’s argument is designed to suppress the vote in minority communities. 
The suit, filed Wednesday in US District Court in New Jersey, argues that the RNC has not sufficiently rebuked Trump for the line of attack, which he has used as a rallying cry and is assumed to be a way to explain away a potential loss on Election Day.

17203,Senate Confirmation Hearings to Begin Without All Background Checks - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   As Senate Republicans embark on a flurry of confirmation hearings this week, several of Donald J. Trump’s appointees have yet to complete the background checks and ethics clearances customarily required before the Senate begins to consider   nominees. Republicans, who are expected to hold up to five hearings on Wednesday alone, say they simply want to ensure that the new president has a team in place as soon as possible. “I believe all the  ’s cabinet appointments will be confirmed,” Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said. But Democrats are calling for the process to be slowed and for the hearings to be spread out. That, they say, would allow more time to vet the nominees. “Our first overarching focus is getting tax returns and ethics forms,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota. In a letter to Senators Chuck Schumer of New York and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the leader of the Office of Government Ethics, Walter M. Shaub Jr. said on Friday that “the announced hearing schedule for several nominees who have not completed the ethics review process is of great concern to me. ” He said the packed schedule had put “undue pressure” on the office to rush its reviews of the nominees and he knew of no other occasion in the office’s four decades when the Senate had held a confirmation hearing before the review was completed. Mr. Schumer responded on Saturday by saying that the letter had made clear that the Trump transition team colluded with Senate Republicans to “jam through” the nominees. Several of the nominees are millionaires or billionaires and have vast webs of financial interests that must be untangled. The Trump transition team issued a statement on Saturday evening defending its handling of the nomination process. Richard W. Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who served as chief ethics counsel to President George W. Bush, said he thought none of the nominees could receive a full vote on the Senate floor before the vetting was complete. Norman Eisen, Mr. Obama’s ethics counsel in his first term, said the paperwork delays were “totally  . ” The status of the background checks and ethical clearances can change by the day. Republicans say they expect the missing documents to be submitted for all the nominees eventually. The hearings are scheduled to begin on Tuesday, with testimony from Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the nominee for attorney general, and Gen. John F. Kelly, the pick for homeland security secretary. On Wednesday, the parade of nominees is expected to include Rex W. Tillerson, the choice for secretary of state Betsy DeVos, the pick for education secretary and Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas, the nominee to lead the C. I. A. Later in the week, the billionaire investor Wilbur L. Ross Jr. chosen as commerce secretary, and Andrew F. Puzder, the labor secretary pick, are scheduled to come before congressional panels. While some of Mr. Trump’s nominees, notably Representative Tom Price of Georgia, the choice for health secretary and an ardent opponent of the Affordable Care Act, are certain to receive hostile receptions, large numbers of Democrats will probably vote for many others. Still, Democrats are preparing a furious assault against the nominees by going after the   himself and trying to drive a wedge between them over his most incendiary promises, like banning Muslim immigrants and bringing back torture. “Where will they come down?” Mr. Schumer, the new Democratic leader, asked in an interview. “Will they try to persuade the president that’s the wrong way to take America?” Democrats plan to keep the focus on the   to a degree with few historical parallels. New presidents usually serve as a backdrop this year, by contrast, Mr. Trump’s words will loom over the hearings as Democrats press the nominees to take a position on them. Democrats have little chance of blocking any of the nominees, having given up the use of the filibuster in such cases when they were in the majority, but they say Mr. Trump has handed them ample political ammunition. Mr. Sessions is certain to be asked whether he, as attorney general, would make good on Mr. Trump’s pledges to get a special counsel to “jail” Hillary Clinton over her email server. General Kelly can expect questions about whether he favors Mr. Trump’s call to build a wall on the Mexican border and create a database on Muslims. Mr. Pompeo is likely to be asked about his views on Mr. Trump’s support for waterboarding and his skepticism about the intelligence agencies’ findings on Russian election meddling. Mr. Tillerson will probably face a grilling over Mr. Trump’s vow to “cancel” the Paris climate accord. Mr. Tillerson has spent hours trying to quietly assure lawmakers that he would take a more distant stance than Mr. Trump on the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, with whom Mr. Tillerson had close relations as the head of Exxon Mobil. The Trump transition team, which did not comment on the background checks, is bracing its nominees for questions about the  ’s more controversial positions, according to people with knowledge of the preparations. But officials would not say what tack the nominees would take in responding. “I have no doubt that the   and a number of his comments will come up,” said Sarah Isgur Flores, a spokeswoman for Mr. Sessions’s confirmation team. “But Senator Sessions has a long record of service himself. ” Mr. Sessions will testify before the Judiciary Committee, which is generally friendly territory for sitting senators. But he is likely to face blistering questions from Democrats who are concerned about his civil rights record. In the 1980s, racially charged accusations derailed his nomination to a federal judgeship. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said she would press Mr. Sessions to say where he stood on Mr. Trump’s pledges to have a special counsel further investigate Mrs. Clinton’s emails. “Hillary’s situation is done, and other than some kind of gross retribution, there’s no reason for that to even be something to look at,” Ms. Feinstein said in an interview. By posing tough questions, said Sarah A. Binder, a political scholar at George Washington University, Democrats will try to lure the nominees into inflicting political damage on themselves by adopting some of Mr. Trump’s more divisive language. She said the terrain was so risky that the nominees might be better served by adopting a stance usually seen only from judicial nominees: “Don’t take a position. ” Democrats intend to use all the procedural moves available to slow the process on the Senate floor, possibly spending up to 30 hours per nominee, denying Mr. Trump a full cabinet when he takes office. Republicans are indignant. “Holding up confirmations just for delay’s sake is irresponsible and it is dangerous,” said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas. He added, “This is a dangerous world we are living in, and why in the world would we want to make it even more dangerous just to let our colleagues delay for delay’s sake   Trump getting to fill his cabinet, particularly these important national security offices?”",0
17204,EXPOSED: George Soros Bribed Al Gore Millions Of Dollars To Lie About Global Warming,"Share on Facebook Newly leaked documents from whistleblowing website, DC Leaks, reveal that Liberal billionaire, George Soros, used his Open Society Institute to pay Al Gore $10 million dollars per year to lie to the public about the effects man-made global warming has on the planet. According to the documents, George Soros gave former Vice President, Al Gore's environmental group millions of dollars in the space of three years to create a ""political space for aggressive U.S. action"" on global warming. YNW reports : “U.S. Programs Global Warming Grants U.S. Programs became engaged on the global warming issue about four years ago, at George Soros's suggestion,” reads a leaked OSI memo. “There has been a budget of $11 million for global warming grants in the U.S. Programs budget for the last several years,” the memo reads. “This budget item captures George Soros's commitment of $10 million per year for three years to Al Gore's Alliance for Climate Protection, which conducts public education on the climate issue in pursuit of creating political space for aggressive U.S. action in line with what scientists say is necessary to put our nation on a path to reducing its outsize carbon dioxide emissions.” It's unclear what year the memo was sent, but the Gore co-founded Alliance for Climate Protection (ACP) was established in 2006 and lasted until it became The Climate Reality Project in July 2011. In 2008, the Alliance launched a $300 million campaign to encourage “Americans to push for aggressive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions,” The Washington Post reported. ACP got $10 million from the Open Society Institute (OSI) in 2008, according to the nonprofit's tax filings. OSI handed over another $5 million to ACP in 2009, according to tax filings. The investigative reporting group ProPublica keeps a database that has OSI tax returns from 2000 to 2013. TheDCNF could not find other years where OSI gave money to ACP. OSI is primarily a grant-making nonprofit that hands out millions of dollars every year to mostly left-wing causes. Now called the Open Society Foundations, Soros's nonprofit has handed out more than $13 billion over the last three decades. OSI didn't only plan to fund Gore's climate group to promote global warming policies in the U.S., OSI also planned on giving millions of dollars to spur the “youth climate movement.” “This budget item also allows for the renewal of U.S. Programs’ long-standing support of the Energy Action Coalition, which is the lead organizer of the youth climate movement in the U.S.” , the memo reads. “We are also including a placeholder for an additional $2 million, pending discussion about and development of OSI's global warming agenda,” the memo reads. “There is a memo from Nancy Youman in the strategic plans binder that recommends pathways forward for OSI on the climate issue – in the U.S., as well as in other parts of the Open Society Network.” Related:",0
17205,"World War II Bomb Removal in Greece Forces 72,000 From Homes - The New York Times","ATHENS  —   In Greece’s biggest peacetime evacuation ever, about 72, 000 people left their homes in the city of Thessaloniki on Sunday as experts defused and removed a World War II bomb from below a gas station. Hundreds of police officers in Thessaloniki, the country’s   city, began knocking on doors early in the morning to remind residents within a radius of two kilometers, about 1. 2 miles, to leave their homes. Though residents had been given several days’ warning, with leaflets posted around the city and an online campaign by the local authorities, some were reluctant to leave and had to be convinced by the police that their properties would remain intact. “The security measures might be excessive, but it’s better to be excessive and be safe,” Greece’s public order minister, Nikos Toskas, warned in a televised message. The bomb was found last week under the gas station during excavation work aimed at expanding storage tanks. It was about five feet long and weighed about 550 pounds  —     of which was explosive, and the rest casing. The bomb had been dropped onto Thessaloniki by Allied forces in 1943 or 1944, toward the end of Greece’s occupation by Nazi Germany, according to the Greek news media. On Sunday, residents were transported by bus to schools and sports venues. Greek television broadcast images of bemused pensioners, many of whom lived through the Nazi occupation of Greece, sitting on plastic chairs and drinking bottled water provided by the local government. Others carried pet cats in boxes through empty streets or led   children by the hand as army officers stood guard near the   gas station. Hundreds of refugees who have been living at a former toilet paper factory, including many Syrians who fled strife in their country, were taken by aid workers to the city’s archaeological museum for the day. They were given snacks and taken to see the artifacts, aid workers said. “The refugees accepted the situation with stoicism and understanding,” Vassilis Karambidis, who runs the center, told Greece’s   news agency. “There were no protests, and those who were reluctant initially ultimately came round to the need to vacate the center. ” Over the course of an hour and a half, three Greek military pyrotechnic experts defused the bomb in an operation that “went very smoothly,” Apostolos Tzitzikostas, the regional governor, told reporters. He had declared a state of emergency in the city for the operation, suspending train routes and church services. The bomb was loaded onto an army vehicle and taken to a military shooting range near the city to be destroyed, Mr. Tzitzikostas said. About five hours after the defusion, residents started returning home. A local military spokesman, Colonel Nikolaos Fanios, played down the operation, noting that army experts had defused similar bombs found near the city’s international airport in the past. “This is a routine event for the army,” he told the Greek news media. The discovery of the bomb in a densely populated area, however, made Sunday’s evacuation necessary, he said, noting that an accidental explosion would have resulted in deaths within the   radius.",0
17206,"Istanbul, Hillary Clinton, Loretta Lynch: Your Friday Evening Briefing - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. _____ 1. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said she would accept the recommendations of prosecutors and the F. B. I. about whether to bring charges against Hillary Clinton over her private email server. Ms. Lynch’s statement came after she was criticized for meeting with Bill Clinton at an airport this week. She said the encounter was unplanned and they did not talk about the case. But Republicans and some Democrats said it raised questions about the integrity of the email investigation, which hangs over the presidential election. _____ 2. What should we expect from the Republican convention, just two weeks away? It won’t be “boring” like previous ones, pledged Donald J. Trump, who also said he won’t speak every night. Beyond that, the usually polished and choreographed affair is in flux. But if Mr. Trump’s comments at a Thursday event were any indication  —   he suggested that a plane overhead was a Mexican aircraft ready for an “attack”  —   his     style may be hard to avoid, even if he’s planning to hew more closely to a script. _____ 3. The number of civilians killed by U. S. airstrikes outside conventional war zones since 2009 is between 64 and 116 people, the Obama administration said Friday. The number comes from 473 strikes that took place between Barack Obama’s inauguration in 2009 and the end of 2015, and it is much lower than estimates from independent watchdogs. Mr. Obama also issued an executive order requiring the government to disclose the number of civilian deaths annually. Above, a protest against drone strikes in Pakistan. _____ 4. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for an attack in which armed men took hostages in a restaurant in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. A kitchen worker said eight to 10 men entered the restaurant  —   where about 20 foreigners were dining  —   opened fire and detonated several explosives. Two police officers were killed in the standoff. The State Department said all its American employees there were safe. _____ 5. If you’re carrying dollars in your wallet, they’re worth more than they were last week  —   but that’s not necessarily a good thing. Britain’s decision to leave the European Union has investors dumping the pound and the euro, and turning to American currency instead. But that makes U. S. imports more expensive on the global market, complicating the American economy’s already fragile expansion. _____ 6. Austria will have a   on its presidential election, in which a   candidate, Norbert Hofer, above left, narrowly lost to Alexander Van der Bellen of the Green Party in May. The situation reflects the wider turmoil in Europe over immigration, which was also a prominent issue in Britain’s vote to leave the European Union. Mr. Hofer and his party, the   Freedom Party, had campaigned heavily on the migrant issue. _____ 7. Tighter security at airports doesn’t necessarily make us safer  —   as seen in the attacks on Tuesday at Istanbul’s Ataturk Airport, where three suicide bombers killed 44 people and wounded hundreds of others. Vehicle screenings begin a mile from the airport and people go through security before they enter the terminal, which is where the attackers were initially turned away, but later returned with guns. Here’s a look at how a typical U. S. airport compares with those in Istanbul and other places. _____ 8. A Mississippi law that would have protected people who object to   marriages on religious grounds was struck down by a federal judge minutes before it was to take effect. The judge, Carlton W. Reeves, called it “a vehicle for   discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. ” Some state leaders pledged to appeal, though the state’s Democratic attorney general expressed reservations. _____ 9. Yuliya Stepanova, above, a Russian    athlete who blew the whistle on doping and got other athletes from her country barred, will be among the few from her nation, if any, who can compete at the Olympic Games in Rio. The sport’s governing body ruled that she can compete, and if Olympic officials agree, it’s still an open question whether she would represent Russia  —   which she fled two years ago  —   or be a neutral athlete. _____ 10. Gay Talese, above, the storied journalist and author, is defending his coming book, “The Voyeur’s Motel,” after an article raised questions about key facts. It’s a reversal of his initial response to the discrepancies, in which he called the book’s credibility “down the toilet. ” The issue relates to the veracity of the central character, who said he had spied on his motel guests for years. _____ 11. Mosha, a    elephant in Thailand, got her ninth artificial leg this week. She lost her leg when she stepped on a land mine at just 7 months old in a part of Myanmar where rebels have been fighting the government for decades. She’s among more than a dozen elephants who have been wounded by land mines in the region. _____ 12. Ah, the Fourth of July. It’s a time to celebrate our nation’s independence, perhaps gathering with family and friends for a barbecue before admiring fireworks at dusk. But there’s an unpleasant side to the holiday: a history of ghastly injuries and, sometimes, death  —   generally because of those same fireworks.

17207,"Iranians Spend $2.1b on Beauty Products Annually, 3 Times more than Their European Counterparts","11 Shares
1 9 0 1
Iranians spend 4.5% of their annual earnings on beauty products, three times more than their European counterparts, as per official statistics. The Germans spend 1.5% and the French and British 1.7% of their income every year on cosmetics.
According to data from the Iranian Association of Cosmetics, Toiletries and Perfumery Importers, Iran accounts for $2.1 billion of the Middle East’s $7.2 billion beauty products market–second in the region after Saudi Arabia, the Persian daily Shahrvand reported.
It is said that there are 15 million consumers for cosmetic products in Iran. Dividing the annual turnover by this number shows that each consumer spends $140 on cosmetics per year. Germany’s online statistics portal (Statista) states that the per capita cosmetic spending in Europe is €90 ($99) on average. The index is $173.5 in Germany, $176 in France, $177 in Britain, $169 in Italy and $150 in Spain.
If the raw figures alone are taken, Iranians spend less than Europeans on make-up products. But the results change as other parameters such as the price of products and household average earnings are taken into account as well.
As confirmed by the Iranian Association of Cosmetics, Toiletries and Perfumery Importers, 70% of the cosmetics in the market are smuggled into the country and often sold at a lower price than they would be if they were legally imported, not to mention the health risks contraband products are likely to pose. Europeans on the other hand pay the real price of the products which includes tax and are thus more expensive.

Pakistani warships berth in Iran’s port as part of amicable relations, joint drills President Rouhani’s “open-door” economic policy: Recipe for indebtedness, deindustrialization and dependence Iranian Nowruz: A new day has come! Moreover, the spending has to be measured as compared to the average earnings. Based on Gallup Incorporation’s opinion polls, Iranians’ median per capita income has been estimated as $3,100 while that of the Germans, French and British $14,000, $12,500 and $12,300 respectively. The Spanish and Italians earn $6,800 and $7,200.
This means that Iranians spend 4.5% of their income on beauty products while the figure is 1.5% for Germans, 1.7% for the French and British, 3% for Italians and 2.5% for the Spanish.
These calculations show that people in Iran spend three times as much on cosmetics as German, French and British consumers.
 Cosmetic Surgery
Additionally, Iran’s Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons’ Association has announced that 80,000 cosmetic surgeries are performed each year constituting 0.3% of the operations in the world. This is a rather large percentage given that only 1.08% of the world population lives in Iran. Besides, the figure is said to be approximate due to the absence of an official registration system and the fact that other types of beauty surgeries such as body contouring and facial rejuvenation, among many others, are not included.
Data from the Central Bank and the Statistics Center of Iran suggest that cultural pursuits constitute a small portion of Iranian household expenditure. The reports indicate that each family spent only 2% of their income on recreation and cultural activities in 2015, less than half their expenses on cosmetic products.
Iran’s share of the world book market is 0.1% which is one-third the country’s share of the cosmetics market. The $2.1 billion incurred on beauty products is said to equal Japan’s cinema turnover and exceeds that of Bollywood and the UK’s film industry.
Culture, cinema and books don’t comprise high-income businesses in Iran while cosmetic surgeons and beauty product dealers make fortunes on their business.",0
17208,Rihanna’s Fenty Line Debuts in Paris and Receives a Pop Star Welcome - The New York Times,"PARIS  —   On an upper floor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild, the   manse formerly occupied by the banking Rothschilds, a line of sweating models fiddled with the rings in their lips and the septums of their perfect noses, and waited to have their lip gloss reapplied. They chatted among themselves, fanning one another with torn bits of cardboard in the close, sticky corridor and examining their nails, which had been sharpened to talons and encrusted with miniature gems. They received compliments with the languorous equanimity of court ladies, which for a night they were. Not for the first time, and surely not for the last, the thought occurred that the European fashion shows, with their ritual peregrinations from palace to palace, were not so different from the French court, which took its pomp and circumstance on the road at regular intervals. The thought occurred with particular force Wednesday evening because Rihanna  —   pop megastar, fledgling designer  —   had decreed that the look she wanted for this, her Fenty show for the German sportswear giant Puma, was Marie Antoinette “if she was going to the gym. ” Rihanna was in a chamber two rooms back. She was wearing a pink   of her own design, twirling a long strand of pearls and receiving guests who had come to pay court: journalists executives   Pinault, chairman and chief executive of Kering, which owns Puma. (“The collection is very interesting,” he said gamely, on his way to the salons downstairs where the show would eventually begin.) Attendants were barking out orders  —   “Nails, nails, we need nails! We’re losing nails!”  —   but Rihanna was serene and unusually humble for a reigning monarch, which, for the evening at least, she was. “I would never expect that I would be allowed in Paris to show a collection this early as a designer,” she said. “That wasn’t a thing that I expected at all. I couldn’t believe  —   I still right now can’t believe it happened. ” When the time came for the show to start, the models sashayed through, fanning themselves coquettishly, their chinoiserie boiler suits and filmy, frilly windbreakers dipping off their shoulders. The reaction from those outside the court, from the queen’s   subjects, was rapturous (on Twitter, a sampling: “I love this” “LIFE GIVING” “The look of the century”) and the designer, who took the final lap herself, did so with a giant smile on her face. Earlier in the evening Rihanna had been asked if she related to Marie Antoinette and she nodded. “She was very dramatic,” she replied.",0

Putin, addressing an audience of foreign policy experts gathered in southern Russia, said he found it hard to believe that anyone seriously thought Moscow was capable of influencing the Nov. 8 election.

[NOTE: By necessity this is a very long PDF document - nearly 500 pages - and I have tried to squeeze as much data as is useful per page while keeping the data on a single page format. You can enlarge the text by enlarging the Acrobat reader window.] 
I have made this spreadsheet so that you can filter and sort the data. For example you can use the sender information (as received) using the ""From"" Column (L). In addition I have separated out the email address and the sender name into two columns at the end of the spreadsheet. What you will find is that some email addresses are associated with multiple user names. Sorting according to these columns will provide a means to determine all emails from a particular email address which will not be visible if you only use the alphabetical sort order of the file names. (This data is only in the spreadsheet. I kept it out of the PDF for presentation). I also include a number which corresponds to how many instances of each (the email address, the user name, and the third (last column) is the number of instances of the original ""From"" column (which combines both email address and user name). This extra data is essential to determining how many emails were sent from particular individuals rather than just one email address and vice versa. 
The first column (C) is the actual file name - an eight digit number - of the original .eml file. This is followed by the second column (E) which contains the Email ID - this is a number assigned by Wikileaks and can be used in their search engine and is essential to identify the URL to the Wikileaks page for that email. The ""Get"" column will allow you to download the original .eml file from the Wikileaks database. The ""Link"" column will open the Wikileaks page to that email on their website. 
The information is presented with a series of colored bands. This is useful for getting a visual image of the whole. Each different colored band represents a different set of emails by data dump (the number of the dump provided in the column of that name ). The DARK ORANGE bands stand out the most - as they represent emails that have yet to be released . This provides a quick visual guide to what is remaining and gaps within a particular sender's set of emails (the emails are listed from the first 1.eml to the last in numerical order - which generates a sort based on the first letter recognized from the ""From"" column - and this is thus listed alphabetically. This can be confusing, however, as while most names are listed with the first letter of the first name some use the first of the last name (i.e. Paul Begala can be found in the ""B"" set toward the beginning of the list when sorted by file name (number)).",0
17211,Bad Luck and Worse Manners Tarnish Obama’s Asia Trip - The New York Times,"VIENTIANE, Laos  —   President Obama has grown accustomed to having his foreign travels overshadowed by terrorist attacks or police shootings. This might be the first time one of his trips has been marred by bad manners. On his final visit to Asia as president this week, Mr. Obama had intended to confront America’s wartime legacy in Laos and to reaffirm his strategic pivot to the region. Like all presidential trips, it has been meticulously planned to showcase achievements: a   partnership with China and vigorous American engagement with China’s neighbors. But in four messy days, the president lost the clear message choreographed by his advance team. There was the chaotic arrival ceremony in China, in which missing aircraft stairs unexpectedly trumped the theme of global warming. And then, an ugly personal outburst that prompted Mr. Obama to cancel a meeting with the new leader of the Philippines, an ally the United States will need in the coming contest with China for regional influence. On Tuesday, the White House scrambled to limit the fallout from skipping a meeting with Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippines’ president. Mr. Obama pulled the plug after hearing that Mr. Duterte had unleashed a profane diatribe against him, threatening to repeat it to Mr. Obama’s face if he dared ask him about recent extrajudicial killings in his country. Mr. Obama is dealing with other headwinds, not least that he is a   leader in the last five months of his term. Back home, his struggles are viewed through the unforgiving lens of   politics. Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee, tweeted that the Chinese snubbed Mr. Obama and that Mr. Duterte called him a “’u2009‘son of a whore.’ Terrible!” For a president eager to burnish his legacy, the trip has in fact yielded progress on several fronts, most notably climate change. But the miscues illustrate how poor planning, or even plain bad luck, can undermine a president’s performance abroad. Worse, the dispute with Mr. Duterte carries genuine risks for the United States, given the sensitive role of the Philippines as an American treaty ally that is engaged in an increasingly dangerous standoff with Beijing over maritime claims in the South China Sea. Scrapping the meeting, American officials insisted, was less an expression of Mr. Obama’s pique than a recognition that the news media would treat it as a spectacle. “All of the focus was on those comments,” said Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser. “We felt that did not create a constructive environment for a bilateral meeting. ” Mr. Rhodes insisted that the alliance between the United States and the Philippines was “rock solid” the two countries work together on a range of issues, from drug interdiction to counterterrorism. He said it was possible that Mr. Obama might run into Mr. Duterte anyway, since the two are attending a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations here in Vientiane. Hillary Clinton said Mr. Obama’s decision to cancel the meeting was “exactly the right choice. ” She said the president was likely to raise concerns about extrajudicial killings of alleged drug dealers, “and when the president of the Philippines insulted our president, it was appropriate in a very   way to say, ‘Sorry, no meeting. ’’u2009” Mr. Duterte seemed eager to defuse the situation. In a statement, he said he regretted that his comments “came across as a personal attack on the U. S. president. ” He said he had overreacted to reports that said Mr. Obama planned to lecture him in their meeting about his unorthodox methods in combating the drug trade. “We look forward to ironing out differences arising out of national priorities and perceptions,” Mr. Duterte said, “and working in mutually responsible ways for both countries. ” For Mr. Obama, it was an unseemly distraction from what he hoped would be a somber day of remembrance and reconciliation. The first president to visit Laos, Mr. Obama came with a pledge to double American aid, to $30 million a year over three years, to help Laotians find unexploded bombs in their forests and fields. The United States dropped more than two million tons of explosives on this country during its secret war from 1964 to 1973, a legacy Mr. Obama said too few Americans understood. “As one Laotian said, the ‘bombs fell like rain,’’u2009” he said to a polite audience at the Lao National Cultural Hall. There was no evidence that Mr. Duterte’s tiff with Mr. Obama mattered much to Laotians. But it could matter more to   relations than Mr. Rhodes’s reassuring words suggest. Mr. Duterte appears determined to carve out a more independent foreign policy than his reliably   predecessor, Benigno S. Aquino III. He has talked about trying to settle an impasse with China over the Scarborough Shoal, a disputed clump of rocks in the South China Sea. The United States worries that China will use its influence to pressure its neighbors into agreements over disputed reefs and shoals throughout the South China Sea that could eventually hinder the freedom of navigation for American ships. Mr. Rhodes said the United States would give the Philippines leeway to negotiate an agreement with China, with the important caveat that it adhere to international law. That is a message Mr. Obama would likely have given Mr. Duterte in person. “We should prepare for a wild ride since the constantly changing outbursts of President Duterte undermine the stability of the government’s foreign policy, including U. S.  relations,” Ramon Casiple, head of the Institute for Political and Electoral Reform in Manila. The diatribe against Mr. Obama, he said, was “kneejerk as an outburst, but calculated to produce a certain breathing space for negotiations with China. ” Mr. Obama had his own awkwardness with the Chinese when he arrived at a Group of 20 summit meeting Saturday. A   dispute over who would drive the staircase to the doorway on Air Force One forced him to exit from a door in the plane’s belly. White House officials attributed the dispute to inexperienced, overzealous security officials rather than any premeditated effort to humiliate Mr. Obama. But the images of Chinese guards shouting at reporters and hassling the president’s national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, added to the sense that the Chinese were sticking a thumb in his eye. As with the Philippine affair, administration officials said the airport scene would have no spillover effect. Mr. Obama himself described the visit as “extraordinarily productive,” noting that he and President Xi Jinping had continued their landmark collaboration on climate change. “None of this detracts from the broader scope of the relationship,” he said. And yet, administration officials showed delight in the fact that when Mr. Obama left Hangzhou on Monday evening, the Chinese moved a shiny staircase with blue lighting to the side of Air Force One.",0
17212,Russian MP Who Compared Putin’s Russia to Nazi Germany Publicly Assassinated in Ukraine,"A Russian politician and prominent critic of Vladimir Putin, Denis Voronenkov, was killed in the streets of Kiev on Wednesday, having fled Russia last October in fear of his life. [Voronenkov  —   a former Russian MP who had previously testified against the   former Ukrainian President, Viktor Yanukovych, and criticized Vladimir Putin’s policies  —   was shot three times with a 9mm handgun in broad daylight in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev.  His bodyguard, a Ukranian security agent, was also shot and remains in the hospital but managed to return fire and fatally wound the gunman, who has not yet been identified. Voronenkov and his wife Maria Maksakova fled Russia in October last year, citing the ‘schizophrenic’ Russian government as their reason. The couple recently had a son, whose first birthday will be in April. Following the incident, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko described it as “an act of state terrorism” undertaken by the Kremlin. However, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refuted the claims, stating that “all falsehoods that can already be heard about   Russian involvement are absurd. ” The murder was quickly denounced as an act of Russian violence, with Ukranian MP Volodymyr Ariev accusing Putin of “spreading fear all over the world”: New Litvinenko case. Former Russian MP Voronenkov shot to death in Kyiv right on the street. Putin spreading fear over the world.  —   Volodymyr Ariev (@VolodymyrAriev) March 23, 2017,  Meanwhile, Ilya Ponomarev, another former Russian MP exiled in Ukraine and fellow critic of Putin, confirmed he had been on his way to meet Voronenkov before hearing news of his murder. “There are no words,” he wrote: Денис Вороненков убит в   у Премьер Паласа. Он шёл на встречу со мной. Нет слов. Охранник успел ранить  …     https:  .   —   Ilya Ponomarev (@iponomarev) March 23, 2017,  It will likely heighten tensions existent between Russia and the Ukraine since Putin illegally annexed Crimea in 2014. In his final interview with Radio Free Europe last month, Voronenkov compared Russia to “Nazi Germany” while denouncing the annexation of Crimea as “illegal” and a “mistake. ” “In Russia, there is a system of total fear,” Voronenkov said in the interview. “Like in George Orwell’s book [1984] right now these are times of total lies, when speaking the truth is [labeled] extremism. ” Voronenkov’s murder is one of a number of unexplained deaths of Russian dissidents in recent years. In February, thousands marched in the city of Moscow to commemorate the death of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, who was murdered outside the Kremlin two years ago. Other influential Russian figures have also died in mysterious circumstances during recent years, including former Putin adviser Mikhail Lesin, businessman Alexander Perepilichny, and FSB agent Alexander Litvinenko. All figures appeared to pose a threat to Russian governmental interests. You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com.",0
17213,Lawsuits in 4 States Accuse Trump & GOP of Voter Intimidation,"
According to four newly filed lawsuits in Arizona, Nevada, Ohio and Pennsylvania, GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump and the Republican Party are conspiring to intimidate and suppress minority voters.
Documents filed cite the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which prohibit the intimidation and suppression of minority voters.
The GOP, Trump and Roger Stone are accused of “conspiring to threaten, intimidate, and thereby prevent minority voters in urban neighborhoods from voting in the 2016 election.”
Democrats are asking courts to declare the Republican “exit polling” and “citizen journalist” initiatives illegal as a relief for this alleged intimidation.
Could this merely be a publicity stunt to attempt to curb the election in Clinton’s favor? Delivered by The Daily Sheeple

17214,Donald Trump Destroyed as Fact Checker Reveals Trump Lies 20 to 37 Times Per Day,"By Hrafnkell Haraldsson on Mon, Oct 31st, 2016 at 7:59 am In Donald Trump ""you have a candidate who is frequently saying 20 false things in a day, up to 37 on some days."" Share on Twitter Print This Post 
CNN’s Brian Stelter calls Donald Trump a “uniquely fact-challenged candidate,” which is a prelude to introducing Daniel Dale, Washington correspondent for the Toronto Star , who fact checks every single word Trump utters and tallies them up for his paper . 
Dale says most fact-checkers look at two or three things Trump says, “meticulously fact-checks them and posts an article,” but “that doesn’t work when you have a candidate who is frequently saying 20 false things in a day, up to 37 on some days.” 
For example, Dale tallied 35 Trump lies on Tuesday, October 25: Donald Trump said 35 false things yesterday. #TrumpCheck pic.twitter.com/EwfYFEDFx9 
— Daniel Dale (@ddale8) October 26, 2016 
Which, as Dale pointed out , followed “his record-tying 37 false claims on Monday,” not coincidentally, a day on which Trump called fact checkers “scum.” 
Watch courtesy of CNN’s Reliable Sources: ""There is a massive imbalance in the frequency of dishonesty."" @DDale8 says Trump lies a lot more than Clinton https://t.co/Kp6KvPNtmO 
— Reliable Sources (@ReliableSources) October 30, 2016 
The mainstream media likes to play the false equivalence game but there is no equivalence between Trump and Clinton. As Dale told Stelter, “There is a massive imbalance in the frequency of dishonesty.” Trump, says Dale, “is not a normal political liar.” 
For example, look at the presidential debates , in which Dale found 104 Trump false statements as opposed to 13 by Clinton. 
Dale’s judgment is that “there is no comparison in her level of accuracy with her opponent.” 
Trump also lies “pointlessly,” argues Dale, explaining to Brian Stelter that, 
“He gets things wrong where there is no political advantage to be gained and in those cases, it is not clear whether he’s lying or confused or unwilling to take the time to learn the facts.” 
This was Mark Cuban’s complaint, of course, that Trump has no interest in learning. 
In the end, it matters less why Trump lies than that he does, especially since he is busily convincing his base that Hillary Clinton is the dishonest candidate. And it is working. This is a trope frequently repeated by Trump’s supporters. You can correct them as often as you want; it will have no effect. 
The lie has taken hold – one of many – many more than you likely expected, and observational bias takes care of the rest. The Trump base is effectively lost to our shared reality, and as Dale tweeted last night, 
“If Trump loses, the Smart Republican Excavation is going to have to involve some long, hard base re-education.” 
Given the GOP’s history with facts, good luck with that.

17216,Test: ¿Qué tipo de vecino eres?,"vivienda 
Las comunidades de vecinos son un hervidero de gente y personalidades, cada una diferente a las demás. ¿Tú de qué tipo eres? Con este test, te ayudamos a descubrirlo. 
1. Hay que pagar, entre toda la comunidad, una rampa de acceso para un vecino minusválido. ¿Qué haces? 
A. Muestras tu disconformidad y alegas que no es culpa tuya que todavía no se hayan inventado las sillas de ruedas voladoras. Como alternativa, propones que sus familiares lo suban por la ventana con una cuerda. “Así subí yo el sillón y va de puta madre”, añades. 
B. Accedes, a condición de que el vecino minusválido vaya a ver tu obra “Desenfrena 2”, un espectáculo que, según tú, “mezcla el clown, la improvisación y toneladas de buen rollo”. El vecino minusválido va, pero no puede entrar porque la hacéis en el sótano de un bar de La Latina. 
C. No has respondido a la circular que te metieron por debajo de la puerta para comunicártelo. Como tampoco respondiste a la de hace tres meses, en la que se te informaba de que se iba a reformar el ascensor, ni a la de hace un año, en la que se te recordaba que llevas dieciocho meses sin pagar los gastos de comunidad y sin responder a ninguna circular. 
D. Afirmas estar totalmente de acuerdo, pero indicas que, antes de comenzar el proyecto, te gustaría “conocer la opinión de las bases y de todos y cada uno de los españoles, esa es la única forma de avanzar hacia el cambio”. El vecino minusválido sigue esperando a día de hoy a que te decidas. 
2. El resto de vecinos se ha quejado de ti, ya sea por ruidos, malos olores u otras conductas molestas. ¿Cómo actúas? 
A. Dices que es imposible que hayan oído la televisión, la minicadena o el transistor, pues llevas meses sin encenderlos por no gastar. Como mucho, te oirían a las dos de la mañana destrozando a hachazos un mueble para hacer leña con él, “que la calefacción no la regalan”. 
B. Les explicas que has convertido tu piso en un espacio “off” de teatro y que no puedes controlar los aplausos y los vítores del público. En realidad, los vecinos se quejan de tus sollozos y tus súplicas cuando no va ni una persona a ver tu nueva obra: “Insomnium”, un thriller psicológico de sólo 3 minutos de duración. 
C. Iban a meter un escrito oficial por debajo de tu puerta para comunicártelo, pero ya no caben más cosas, hay unas 587 cartas y circulares que sigues sin leer. 
D. Les reúnes a todos y, con la voz entrecortada por las lágrimas, aseguras que la situación es fruto de una conspiración de El País y otras grandes compañías. 
3. La vecina de al lado está sufriendo un incendio en su piso. ¿Cuál es tu reacción? 
A. Aprovechas las llamas que salen por el balcón de la mujer para descongelar unas croquetas que no habías cocinado hasta ahora “porque el aceite tampoco lo regalan”, Una vez que la vecina ha fallecido devorada por las llamas, le das el pésame a sus hijos y les pides que te abonen los 25 céntimos que un día le dejaste a la señora en el súper. 
B. Llamas a los bomberos y, cuando llegan, no te separas de ellos para preparar tu nuevo papel en “Fuego en la piel”, una comedia romántica que narra la historia de amor entre un bombero y una mujer que se está quemando viva, y que estrenarás dentro de poco en el desván del Bar Pruden e Hijos. 
C. Tu vecina se resigna a morir y ni siquiera trata de pedirte ayuda. Sabe que no harás absolutamente nada. 
D. Medio barrio observa el suceso desde la calle, así que sales a la ventana y aprovechas para dar un discurso de media hora sobre los beneficios del mestizaje ideológico. 
4. Te toca ser el nuevo presidente de la comunidad de vecinos. ¿Cómo te desenvuelves con el nuevo cargo? 
A. Lo primero que preguntas es dónde está tu coche oficial y tu tarjeta black. 
B. En las juntas de vecinos, ya les has interpretado tus obras “5 microsegundos con Mario”, “Los monólogos de la crisis” y “What happened to our love?”. En una semana, medio edificio ha empezado a buscar otro piso al que mudarse. 
C. Los vecinos llevan esperándote 4 horas, 56 minutos y 27 segundos en la primera reunión que debías presidir. Comienzan a sospechar que no vas a asistir. 
D. Diecisiete vecinos se amotinan contra ti, negándose a reconocerte como presidente de la comunidad. Entre lágrimas, acabas dimitiendo y llamas a Jordi Évole por si le interesa una entrevista sobre el tema. 
Mayoría de respuestas A: Eres el vecino rata . Es ridículo que te hayamos incluido en el test porque no vas a leer esto jamás, llevas más de tres años sin encender el ordenador por no gastar electricidad. 
Mayoría de respuestas B: Eres el vecino actor de microteatro , sueñas con despuntar sobre los escenarios pero, por ahora, no te llega ni para pagar el teléfono. 
Mayoría de respuestas C: Eres el vecino muerto . Nadie sospechó del terrible olor que salía de tu casa desde hacía meses porque, antes de fallecer, se te conocía como el vecino guarro. 
Mayoría de respuestas D: Eres Pedro Sánchez .",0
17217,"Restored: 5 Ways Trump, Netanyahu Improved U.S.-Israel Relations","President Donald Trump hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Wednesday  —   the fourth visit by a foreign leader, less than four weeks into the new administration. [At their joint press conference, it was clear that U.  relations are once again on solid ground, after eight years of hostility from the Obama administration. Not only were relations restored to their customary warmth, but the two leaders also indicated five new directions for future policy.  1. The   solution is no longer the only option. President Trump said that while the   solution once seemed “easier,” he was also open to a   solution  —   presumably meaning Israeli annexation of the West Bank  —   and that he would accept whatever solution Israelis and Palestinians themselves chose. An Israeli journalist challenged Netanyahu as to whether he still accepted the   solution. He replied that his goal was not a “label,” but a peace in which Palestinians recognized the Jewish state, and where Israel had full security control of the area west of the Jordan River. The shift from “two states at any price” is a fundamental change in U. S. policy and places new (and overdue) pressure on the Palestinians. A new era. New ideas. No need for 3rd Palestinian state beyond Jordan  Gaza. Big day for Israelis  reasonable Arabs. Congrats.  —   Naftali Bennett בנט (@naftalibennett) February 15, 2017,  2. The U. S. opposes new settlements, but accepts existing ones. Trump asked Netanyahu, publicly, to “hold back” on settlements (to which Netanyahu joked, “That’s the art of the deal”). The implication is that the U. S. now accepts existing Israeli settlements. That is a stark contrast to the attitude of the Obama administration, which argued that the entire Israeli presence across the 1949 armistice lines  —   including the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem  —   was illegal. The settlements will no longer be regarded by the U. S. as an excuse for Palestinians to avoid negotiations and concessions.  3. The U. S. and Israel will aim at a regional peace involving Arab states. Netanyahu mentioned that plan, which the two leaders had apparently discussed in private. The rise of Iran as a regional aggressor has certainly created common interests between Israel and Sunni regimes like Saudi Arabia, but Netanyahu’s suggestion that those common interests could become formal alliances, under American leadership, was a new direction. Trump seemed to be on board with the idea as well. 4. Both countries are now focused on “radical Islamic terror. ” Netanyahu explicitly thanked Trump for identifying the enemy clearly (which President Barack Obama refused to do throughout his time in office). It is a definition that takes in Sunni terror groups as well as   Iranian terror. Both also criticized the “ ” treatment of Israel by the United nations, and both expressed a shared opposition to any attempts to boycott Israel, at the UN and in other forums. 5. The relationships between the U. S. and Israeli governments are warm, and personal. One of the most powerful moments in the press conference was when Israeli journalist Moav Vardi challenged Trump’s campaign rhetoric and implied that he was responsible for an alleged spike in antisemitism in the U. S. accusing him of “xenophobia, and maybe racist, tones. ” Trump answered rather vaguely, referring to divisions in the country as a whole pointing out his Jewish    and grandchildren and promising: “You’re going to see a lot of love. ” But Netanyahu went out of his way to defend the U. S. president: “I’ve known President Trump for many years   …     There is no greater supporter of the Jewish people and the Jewish state than President Donald Trump. I think we should put that to rest. ” Trump looked, and sounded, genuinely appreciative. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News. He was named one of the “most influential” people in news media in 2016. His new book, How Trump Won: The Inside Story of a Revolution, is available from Regnery.

17219,Political Prisoner Takes on US Military-Industrial Complex,"The ultimate underdog 23 Shares
9 12 0 2
Ever since the telling of biblical fairy tales, few stories have lived up to the hype around the mismatch between the shepherd boy David and the giant Goliath. In the biblical encounter, David prevailed by keeping his foe Goliath at a distance with a formidable weapon, his sling.
Today a modern-day version of David and Goliath is playing out.
Although granted political asylum by Ecuador, a target of US empire finds himself ensconced under a form of arbitrary detention in Ecuador's London embassy under constant surveillance by British police. The fully weaponized US empire, which boasts of its full-spectrum dominance, has arrayed itself and its allies against one unarmed (as in having no conventional weaponry) man who heads a publishing organization.
This uppity publisher has had the temerity to expose the secret machinations and war crimes of the military-economic (albeit faltering on both fronts) behemoth to the world's public. The pro-transparency publisher Wikileaks, its founder (and de facto political prisoner) Julian Assange, and anti-secrecy collaborators infuriated the United States establishment with a slew of documents, emails, and graphic exposes like the "" Collateral Murder "" video that demonstrated a US military engaged in war crimes.
Nations states are adamant and fastidious about keeping their internal workings under wraps. But it is a one-way street, as many nation states seek to gather and store any and all information about the citizenry without seeking court approval or the approval of the citizenry in question.
MORE... Swedish government implicated in charges against Assange UN body to rule on ""arbitrary detention"" of Wikileaks founder Web-savvy Wikileaks objects to this double standard, and it welcomes, vets, and publishes troves of secret information premised on the principle of the public's right to be informed about what their government is up to.
Evidence makes it clear that the violent American establishment engages in browbeating, inciting so-called color revolutions to destabilize and overthrow disobedient governments, military encirclement, and saber rattling. This self-described indispensable nation which preens its might before major nation states such as China and Russia was not about to have its full-spectrum dominance challenged by punk computer hackers.
Leaning on its allies, the US enacted a financing squeeze on Wikileaks. Many nation states have been severely crippled and devastated by US sanctions, but tiny Wikileaks proved more resilient and cleverer than the Washington schemers.
In an attempt to topple Wikileaks, the US establishment has sought to lop off the head of Wikileaks. It has kept close tabs on Julian Assange and is purportedly behind a scheme to bring Assange down in Sweden: ""We have been warned that the Pentagon, for example, is thinking of deploying dirty tricks to ruin us.""
In Sweden consensual sex has been parlayed as rape. In self-defense Assange spoke to the facts of the situation :
Here we have a case, the Swedish case, where I have never been charged with a crime, where I have already been cleared [by the Stockholm prosecutor] and found to be innocent, where the woman herself said that the police made it up, where the United Nations formally said the whole thing is illegal, where the State of Ecuador also investigated and found that I should be given asylum. Those are the facts, but what is the rhetoric?
... the UN formally found that the whole thing is illegal, never even mentioning that Ecuador made a formal assessment through its formal processes and found that yes, I am subject to persecution by the United States.
Disinformation and distraction are among the underhanded tactics of empire.
While in Britain, Assange was eventually placed under house arrest. Sweden played out the drama while refusing to press charges or interview Assange in Britain on the allegations. It insisted he come to Sweden, which Assange was unwilling to do without an assurance that he would not be deported elsewhere, knowing full well that the US Department of Justice was preparing a case against him. Sweden refused to give such an assurance, which speaks strongly about Sweden's intent to seek justice for any alleged crimes committed against its citizens.
Despite all this intrigue, Wikileaks has continued to publish and Assange has continued to give interviews. Assange did not cower, instead he chose to fight back against Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. This is because Hillary Clinton and the Democrats are the principals in power and the grand jury investigation into himself and Wikileaks has been occurring during their time in government.
Clinton and the Democrats are victims of their own zeal and hubris. Along the way many outs presented themselves to the Democrats. They could have dropped the grand jury investigation. They could have provided an assurance that there would be no request for Assange's deportation from Sweden. The US could even have given a presidential pardon to Assange. Extremely telling about the caliber of man that Assange is, is that he offered himself as a prisoner in exchange for the release of another political prisoner, Chelsea Manning.
But empire and its minions were dismissive as is the way of empire. Empire does not negotiate deals. It takes what it wants because it believes it can.
The result
The corruption in the Democratic party has come to light. Wikileaks revealed that the Democratic National Committee conspired against party aspirant Bernie Sanders and heads fell. Clinton tellingly hired the subsequently fallen DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
Clinton's emails were leaked as were those of her campaign chair John Podesta. Revelations include ""pay-for-play, as they call it, giving access in exchange for money to states, individuals and corporations,"" a "" direct connection between Hillary Clinton and the foundation of jihadism, of ISIL, in the Middle East,"" ""Libya, more than anyone else's war, was Hillary Clinton's war,"" and banks buying cabinet positions.
The Clinton campaign has, predictably, been thrown into disarray.
The Clintonites could not refute what was in their own emails. Instead they sought to deflect attention elsewhere. The Clintonites blamed Russian hacking for interfering in the US presidential race. Finally, Julian Assange felt compelled to state :
The Clinton camp has been able to project that kind of neo-McCarthy hysteria: that Russia is responsible for everything. Hilary Clinton stated multiple times, falsely, that seventeen U.S. intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. That is false; we can say that the Russian government is not the source.
Neither is Wikileaks complicit with Russia:
We have published about 800,000 documents of various kinds that relate to Russia. Most of those are critical; and a great many books have come out of our publications about Russia, most of which are critical. Our [Russia]documents have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases: refugee cases of people fleeing some kind of claimed political persecution in Russia, which they use our documents to back up.
Graciously toward Clinton, Assange said he feels sorry for the woman who wanted to "" drone "" him. Imagine what the response would have been if Assange had discussed the possibility of a drone attack against Clinton.
Presently, Assange downplays the damage from the barrage of leaks to the Clinton campaign for the presidency.
Trump would not be permitted to win. Why do I say that? Because he's had every establishment off side; Trump doesn't have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals, if you can call them an establishment, but banks, intelligence [agencies], arms companies... big foreign money ... are all united behind Hillary Clinton, and the media as well, media owners and even journalists themselves.
However, a counter coup was announced against the coup by ""Clinton cronyism."" It is said to include FBI, CIA, military intelligence, other security organizations ""through Julian Assange"" that have promised to stop Clinton from becoming president and to convict and indict her and her cronies.
A revolution?
No matter what transpires on November 8, the reverberations from this confrontation should be monumental. US democracy has — again — been revealed to be glaringly corrupt. Most importantly, the world's preeminent military-industrial complex has been shown to be susceptible to the power of one person. Properly framed, it is the power of one person to work with other persons to form a greater consciousness, a consciousness that ultimately will transcend and defeat the corruption of empire.",0
17220,"GEORGE SOROS: TRUMP WILL WIN POPULAR VOTE IN ‘LANDSLIDE,’ HILLARY’S ELECTORAL VICTORY IS ALREADY ‘A DONE DEAL’","EMAIL US: CONTACT@GOVTSLAVES.INFO Home › POLITICS | US NEWS › GEORGE SOROS: TRUMP WILL WIN POPULAR VOTE IN ‘LANDSLIDE,’ HILLARY’S ELECTORAL VICTORY IS ALREADY ‘A DONE DEAL’ GEORGE SOROS: TRUMP WILL WIN POPULAR VOTE IN ‘LANDSLIDE,’ HILLARY’S ELECTORAL VICTORY IS ALREADY ‘A DONE DEAL’ 0 SHARES 
Even Republican politicians and former politicians are telling Trump to knock off such talk . 
But, as usual, Trump’s shrewdness and defiance of standard political decorum – in which the “opposition” party merely rolls over and surrenders in the face of Democratic pressure – is winning the day. 
None other than billionaire investor and longtime Democratic supporter George Soros has said that the fix is literally in for the election, in favor of Clinton – no matter how much of the popular vote, and from which battleground states, Trump captures. 
As reported by Top Right News and other outlets, during a recent interview with Bloomberg News , Soros – a Democrat mega-donor – openly admitted that Trump will win the popular vote in a “landslide.” 
However, he said that none of that would matter, because a President Hillary Clinton is already a “done deal.” 
In the interview, which is now going viral, Soros says with certainty that Trump will take the popular vote, despite what the polls say now (which are completely rigged to oversample Democrats ), but not the Electoral College, which will go to Clinton. 
When the reporter asks if that is already a “done deal” – that Clinton will be our next president no matter what – Soros says “yes,” and nods his head. 
Is Soros just making a prediction out of overconfidence? Or does he truly know something most of us don’t know? 
In a recent column , Natural News founder and editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, says that Soros and Democrats have “bribed electoral college representatives” in a bid to “fix” the election outcome in favor of Clinton. In truth, that would be the only way it could be done, short of massive voter fraud through electronic balloting, as some reports have already claimed . 
Adams further pointed out that Soros was one of the main money men behind the Black Lives Matter movement, which is being blamed for generating hatred and mistrust of police officers all around the country – some of which has led to the deaths of several officers already. 
Soros also funds left-wing websites and groups that locate, pay and deploy volunteer “agitators” at Trump rallies, to start fights and engage in physical violence against Trump supporters (acts that the establishment media then blames on Trump ). 
But aren’t electors legally obligated to cast a ballot for the presidential candidate who won the majority vote in that elector’s district? No, they’re not. Nine-nine percent of electors have done what they’re supposed to do throughout our history, but this is no ordinary election 
Per Archives.gov , there is no constitutional provision or federal law requiring electors to vote according to the results of the popular vote. Rather, these pledges fall into two categories: State law and those who are bound by promises made to respective political parties. 
In the past, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution doesn’t require electors to be completely free to cast ballots as they please and, therefore, respective political parties may “extract pledges from electors to vote for the parties’ nominees,” Archives.gov notes. Some state laws hold that “faithless electors” could be subjected to fines or disqualification for casting an invalid ballot, and could then be replaced by a substitute elector. 
“The Supreme Court has not specifically ruled on the question of whether pledges and penalties for failure to vote as pledged may be enforced under the Constitution. No Elector has ever been prosecuted for failing to vote as pledged,” said Archives.gov. 
The site notes that throughout our history, 99 percent of electors have voted as required. But this is no ordinary time, and it’s no ordinary election . And Democrats (and the establishment media) have already proven that they will do anything to stop a Trump presidency. Plus, establishment Republicans don’t want Trump either, so you can bet they wouldn’t balk at or challenge the buying off of electors. Post navigation",0

17222,Obama's DOJ Also Obstructed Clinton Foundation Investigation,"Obama's DOJ Also Obstructed Clinton Foundation Investigation October   
We now know that Lynch and Obama's DOJ are obstructing the investigation of Hillary Clinton's emails. The biased media is predictably spinning this as the FBI being in the wrong and Hillary's backers at the DOJ being in the right. 
But it also appears that the DOJ was obstructing any investigations of Hillary. Including that of the Clinton Foundation. 
The FBI field office in New York had done the most work on the Clinton Foundation case and received help from the FBI field office in Little Rock, the people familiar with the matter said. 
In February, FBI officials made a presentation to the Justice Department, according to these people. By all accounts, the meeting didn’t go well. 
Some said that is because the FBI didn’t present compelling evidence to justify more aggressive pursuit of the Clinton Foundation, and that the career public integrity prosecutors in the room simply believed it wasn’t a very strong case. Others said that from the start, the Justice Department officials were stern, icy and dismissive of the case. 
“That was one of the weirdest meetings I’ve ever been to,” one participant told others afterward, according to people familiar with the matter. 
Justice Department officials told the FBI at the meeting they wouldn’t authorize more aggressive investigative techniques, such as subpoenas, formal witness interviews, or grand-jury activity. But the FBI officials believed they were well within their authority to pursue the leads and methods already under way, these people said. 
Of course the DOJ wouldn't authorize investigations of the Democratic Party's chosen. That's the type of elemental corruption at work in the system.",0
17223,"President Obama Gets Real, Not Revenge, On Republicans","By Rmuse on Sat, Oct 29th, 2016 at 3:23 pm He is taking the conspiracy theories and obstruction that dogged his presidency from day one and throwing them back in Republicans' faces.   *The following is an opinion column by R Muse* 
Although this campaign season has been interesting, to say the least, there is something happening one never thought would occur. After spending nearly eight years demonizing, obstructing, and criticizing every and anything about the President of the United States, Republicans desperate to save their jobs are beginning to tout their “ imagined ” close ties to the Democratic President whose approval rating and popularity are growing. 
It is hypocritical, to say the least, and at some point a result of a toxic Republican candidate for the presidency, but for some GOP candidates it is a very dangerous strategy. If any Republican believed President Obama would allow them to take advantage of him after spending eight years assailing him as illegitimate and corrupt, they were sadly mistaken and underestimated the commander in chief’s tolerance during an election. 
The President is using the final two weeks before the election to decimate Republicans for either “ belated rejection ” or continued support of Donald Trump. President Obama is also reminding Republicans that “ Donald Trump is the endpoint of eight years of [GOP] toxic hostility .” It may be a tad of an exaggeration to claim that “ Obama seems determined to spend the last two weeks of the election laying waste to every Republican who ever crossed him ,” but he is getting some well-placed and well-warranted shots at Republicans. 
Two Republican hypocrites hoping to take advantage of the President’s approval ratings have been some of his harshest critics; so it likely stunned the President that they are boasting working closely with the man they obstructed, opposed, and attempted to get rid of. 
Ohio Senator Rob Portman had the temerity to run a campaign ad boasting about working closely with the President “to break the grip of heroin addiction.” President Obama took the time to excoriate Portman for, 
“ Finally withdrawing his support from Donald Trump ,” but only “ After looking at the polling. Now that it’s politically expedient. But he has supported him up until last week? So I guess it was OK when Trump was attacking minorities, and suggesting that Mexicans were rapists … and insulting Gold Star moms, making fun of disabled Americans. I guess that didn’t quite tip it over the edge. Why was that OK? And now he says he will vote for the vice-presidential nominee instead, except that guy still supports Donald Trump. ” 
The President was a little more exercised after learning that the man who called the President “ one of the most corrupt presidents in modern times,” California Republican Representative Daryl Issa, is sending out campaign mailers with the President’s face on them and boasting about his close work with President Obama “ to protect victims of sexual assault .” 
Daryl Issa is in a fairly competitive race compared to past elections and he certainly has earned the President’s wrath after obstructing progress and wasting taxpayer money on Issa-created scandals. During a fundraiser in La Jolla California Sunday last, the President assailed Issa for having the audacity to use a campaign mailer with the President’s image on it. The President said, 
“ Issa’s primary contribution to the United States Congress has been to obstruct and to waste taxpayer dollars on trumped-up investigations that have led nowhere. This is now a guy who, because poll numbers are bad, has sent out brochures with my picture on them touting his cooperation on issues with me. Now that is the definition of chutzpah.” 
As remarked by Tim Murphy at Mother Jones, President Obama is not just evening up the score with Republicans who made his tenure miserable, “ He is attempting to have the last word on the personal and political fights of the last eight years—to take the conspiracy theories and obstruction that dogged his presidency from day one and throw them back in Republicans’ faces .” 
The President clearly has a lot of “ words ” to harangue Republicans with. He said , 
“ Here’s the thing. For years, Republican politicians and the far-right media outlets have pumped up all kinds of crazy stuff about me. About Hillary. About Harry. They said I wasn’t born here. They said climate change is a hoax. They said that I was going to take everybody’s guns away! They said that while we were doing military exercises that we’ve been doing forever, suddenly this was a plot to impose martial law. This is what they’ve been saying for years now! So people have been hearing it they start thinking well maybe it’s true! And if the world they’ve been seeing is I’m powerful enough to cause hurricanes on my own and to steal everybody’s guns in the middle of the night and impose martial law—even though I can’t talk without a ‘prompter—then is it any wonder that they end up nominating somebody like Donald Trump? 
And the fact is that there are a lot of politicians who knew better. There are a lot of senators who knew better but they went along with these stories because they figured you know what this’ll help rile up the base, it’ll give us an excuse to obstruct what we’re trying to do, we won’t be able to appoint judges, we’ll gum up the works, we’ll create gridlock, it’ll give us a political advantage. So they just stood by and said nothing and their base began to actually believe this stuff. So Donald Trump did not start this. Donald Trump didn’t start it, he just did what he always did which is slap his name on it, take credit for it, and promote it. That’s what he always does. And so now, when suddenly it’s not working and people are saying wow this guy’s kind of out of line, all of a sudden these Republican politicians who were okay with all this crazy stuff up to a point suddenly they’re all walking away. Oh, this is too much. So when you finally get him on tape bragging about actions that qualify as sexual assault and his poll numbers go down, suddenly that’s a deal-breaker. Well what took you so long! What the heck! What took you so long! All these years!” 
The Mother Jones piece made out like President Obama is seeking retribution, or “ revenge ” against Republicans for their impropriety as legislators over the past eight years. Without knowing what goes on in the President’s head to motivate his campaign rhetoric; that is a hard call to make with any surety. Barack Obama does not strike one as being vindictive. 
The President is, though, an accomplished campaigner and as his tenure in the White House is winding down and Republicans are struggling to find an identity apart from Donald Trump, it is prudent of the President to remind voters exactly what Republicans are about and what they are about is precisely why Donald Trump is their standard bearer; and why Republicans are hypocrites for both abandoning Trump and embracing the man they obstructed and tried to remove from the White House.",0
17224,Diwali Special: Dos and Donts during Diwali and Oats Peanut Laddu recipe,"Tweet (Image via youtube.com) 
Deepavali is here, which naturally means plenty of sweets and crackers and, even more naturally, a visit to the doctor due to overeating or burn-related injuries for some of you. 
But this column firmly believes it is always better to be safe than try to be spectacular and look for some smart-Aleck jokey end to this sentence. Keeping in line with this thinking, we urge you celebrate the upcoming festival in a responsible manner without going overboard on festivities or snacking. 
And here is a simple recipe for a healthy Deepavali sweet, oats peanut ladoo (ugh), and a small emergency reckoner on what to do when bursting crackers (Scream). 
Oats peanut ladoo: 
Before you get down to make this, you have to answer the very basic question whether it is ladoo or laddu. No, the actual question you should be asking is: Why oats ladoo? To be precise, why at all oats? When the world eventually is destroyed, global warming or ecology disasters will not be the cause, oats is most likely to be the culprit. Rampant use of oats in food will make many people give up the all-important desire to live. But oats is expected to figure in anything that is deemed to be healthy (come to think of it, oats soap and shampoo may not be far away). 
But wait, we are here to make ladoo and not rant against the rising problems of oats. 
Ingredients for oats peanut ladoo: 1 cup oats, 1 cup peanut, 2 cups of grated jaggery, cardamom, cashewnuts, 1 cup and a standard instagram account. 
1. Heat the oats in low medium flame until it gets golden brown. Have you ever noticed that whatever you are trying to make, the recipe always tells you to heat whatever you are trying to heat till it becomes golden brown? 
2. Now heat the peanut in similar low flame until it becomes peacock blue. Just kidding. Heat till golden brown only. 
3. Luckily, jaggery is kind of golden brown. No need to heat it. 
4. Put the oats and peanut together into a mixie and run the blender. 
5. Oops, wait. In your hurry to get on with it, you ran the blender without closing it. Now go clean the mess you created. 
6. Close the lid firmly and run the blender till the oats and peanut are finely commingled. 
7. Wonder what the heck is commingled. 
8. Now remove a portion of oats-peanut mix and keep it aside. Add to the remaining portion in the jar some jaggery. Run the blender till they are finely mixed. Now make a similar blend out of the removed portion too. 
9. Spread the fresh mix on a plate and start making ladoo balls out of them. Since you are making them the balls will come off and not stick together. 
10. No worries, nobody gets it right on the first attempt. Also, it is a good excuse not to consume oats peanut ladoo, which, to tell you a fact, was never going to taste great. 
PS : In the few seconds they stay as ladoo balls, make sure to photograph them and put it on your instagram account. 
PS 2: Not that it would have mattered, but we forgot to add cardamom and cashew to the mix. 
Now, dos and don’ts during bursting crackers: 
1. It is always advisable to burn crackers in an open and spacious place. Ideally, take on rent MA Chidambaram Stadium. 
2. If your neighbours have pets, out of the general kindness to those hapless animals, ask your neighbours to take them elsewhere so that you can burst crackers in peace. Those infernal dogs, at any rate, are never going to stop barking when you are busy preparing notes for your presentation. So there! 
3. Don’t set off fireworks near electrical transformers unless otherwise your idea is to set off even more spectacular fireworks that will make the entire neighbourhood watch transfixed. 
4. Whenever you set out to burst crackers, have a bucket of water nearby so that it will come handy for you to trip over it when running away from the splinters of that saram . Statistically, more persons are treated for injuries after sprawling down than for fire burns on Deepavali. 
5. In the event of burn injuries, take care to roll the victim in a wet rug and throw him/her into a swimming pool. If the injury is not serious, he/she should emerge out quickly. If he/she sinks, either the injury is serious or he/she doesn’t know swimming. Either way you are innocent. 
6. Prepare a small medical kit with plasters and Burnol in them well ahead of Deepavali and keep it aside, so that when you set out to burst crackers on the Deepavali day you can basically spend your time looking for it. 
7. Avoid vengaiya vedis . Remember those ball-shaped vengaiya vedis are banned. Most likely because they resembled oats ladoo. 
PS : Happy Deepavali!",0

However policy does matter for investing and the economy. As an example, it was obvious to invest in oil when George W. Bush became President.

17226,Tories to stop Santa migration by Christmas,"October 30, 2016 
David Cameron has announced plans to curb the flood of European migrant workers, specifically mythological 4th-century Greek bishops, from invading our homes. The Prime Minister has promised to apply an ‘emergency brake’ on rotund present-givers who have been sneaking across our borders with the aid of a magical flying sleigh and a blithe disregard for passport control. 
A Home Office spokeswoman said: ‘We need to beware of Greeks bearing gifts – or pretty much anyone from Eastern Europe – smelling of mince pies. We can’t just have quasi-mystical figures coming over here, parking their clapped-out reindeer wherever they want, stealing our low-wage jobs – jobs which could easily be filled by a British Druid or Boggart – and blackmailing hard-working British families into plying them with sherry.’ 
Some children have expressed their disappointment that the festive season will be minus one pivotal figure. Yet Mr Cameron has committed to an in/out referendum, in 2017, over whether stockings will be filled. Tory backbencher Bernard Jenkin has suggested Parliament pass a law introducing a cap on beards, rosy cheeks and Polish tooth fairies, while a tweeted offer from former minister Brooks Newmark to ‘fill your stockings any time you like, sweetie pie’ was hastily withdrawn, as indeed was Mr Newmark himself. 
Outgoing European Commission head, Jose Manuel Barroso, has warned of the ‘historic mistake’ the UK would make if it outlawed Father Christmas. ‘The UK signed up to the laws of the EU, which specifically permit the free movement of labour,’ he said. ‘Any traffic infringements Santa may commit are a matter for the international air traffic control authorities.’ 
However Nigel Farage countered: ‘Santa has long be associated with increased crime, elf trafficking and prostitutes – or ‘ho ho ho’s’, as he calls them. Arbitrarily deciding who is naughty or nice is just the sort of thing a European bureaucrat would support. And it’s typical of those Eastern Europeans that he only works seasonally, then swans off back to Lappland, wherever that is, leaving us to clear up the mess. We propose to simply keep white Christmas white, you know what I mean’.   30th, 2016 by Wrenfoe   Wrenfoe  ",0

17230,Wolf Richter: What the Heck’s Going on with Foreclosures? Why this Spike?,"Massachusetts +11% New York +10% 
When home prices rise for years, foreclosure filings become rare because defaulting homeowners can usually sell the home for more than they owe and pay off the mortgage. The problem arises when home prices fail to rise locally, and it balloons when home prices fall. We’ve seen that last time around. After bouncing along super low levels during Housing Bubble 1 through 2005, foreclosure filings skyrocketed during the housing crash starting in 2006. At first it was just an uptick that no one paid attention to. By 2008, it helped take down the financial system. 
Foreclosure filings peaked in late 2009, began dropping in 2010, and then tapered down to 2006 levels as foreclosures were processed, and as the home price surge of Housing Bubble 2 made new defaults less likely. But the spike in October stands out as much as those in the early phases of the housing bust in 2006 and 2007. Note the blue bar on the right : 

While some states are still trying to digest the foreclosures from the last housing crisis, according to Daren Blomquist, senior VP at ATTOM, “the foreclosure activity increases in states such as Arizona, Colorado and Georgia are more heavily tied to loans originated since 2009 ”: 
“The loans used in this housing recovery that appear to be most susceptible to foreclosure are those such as FHA and VA with low down payments. Our data shows FHA and VA loans combined represent 49% of all active foreclosure inventory for loans originated in the seven years ending in 2015.” 
This chart shows the soaring proportion of FHA and VA mortgages issued since 2009 among the active foreclosure inventory. 

On average across the nation, the foreclosure rate was one foreclosure filing for every 1,258 housing units. But in some states, the foreclosure rate was much worse. Here are the “top” ten: Delaware: one in every 355 housing units New Jersey: one in every 564 housing units Maryland: one in every 679 housing units Illinois: one in every 704 housing units South Carolina: one in every 801 housing units Nevada: one in every 826 housing units Florida: one in every 895 housing Ohio: one in every 930 housing units Pennsylvania: one in every 1,018 housing units Georgia: one in every 1,028 housing units. 
And here are the “top” ten highest foreclosure rates among the 216 metropolitan areas with a population of over 200,000: York-Hanover, PA: one in every 274 housing units Atlantic City, NJ: one in every 301 housing units Rockford, IL: one in every 481 housing units Columbia, SC: one in every 498 housing units Trenton, NJ: one in every 499 housing units. Reading, PA: one in every 542 housing units Chicago, IL: one in every 571 housing units Dayton, OH: one in every 573 housing units Philadelphia, PA: one in every 597 housing units Salisbury, MD: one in every 625 housing units. 
These “foreclosure filings” are based on data that ATTOM gathered in 2,200 counties where over 90% of the US population lives. They include data on the three phases of foreclosure: Foreclosure starts: lender issues Notice of Default (NOD) and Lis Pendens (LIS) Auction notices for future public foreclosure auctions: Notice of Trustee’s Sale (NTS) and Notice of Foreclosure Sale (NFS); Real Estate Owned (REO) properties that have been foreclosed on and were repurchased by a bank at auction and are now held by the bank. 
Broken down based on these three phases of the foreclosure process: 
Foreclosure starts jumped 25% in October from the prior month, to 43,352. While still down 11% year-over-year, it was the highest monthly increase in foreclosure starts since December 2008. 
Foreclosure starts increased even year-over-year in 23 states and Washington D.C. In some states they soared. The “top” five: Colorado +71%",0

17232,A Senior Russian Envoy’s Take on Relations With the United States: ‘Pretty Bad’ - The New York Times,"UNITED NATIONS  —   In my nearly three years covering the United Nations Security Council, I have seen the Russians and Americans brawling rhetorically many times. Russia has regularly blasted American efforts at “regime change” in Libya and derided the West for backing what it called “fascists” in Ukraine. The United States Mission to the United Nations has hosted some of the Kremlin’s   critics, like the punk band Pussy Riot. And American diplomats proposed a resolution that would have declared the Russian annexation of Crimea illegal  —   knowing Russia would veto it. But rarely have I been so taken aback as I was the other day, when Russia’s longtime ambassador to the United Nations said that the last time relations between Russia and the United States were this strained was more than four decades ago, when the   conflict nearly brought the two Cold War powers to military confrontation. “The general situation is pretty bad: I think the tensions are probably the worst since 1973,” said the ambassador, Vitaly I. Churkin. His remarks, made in an interview with The New York Times and two other news organizations on Friday, made clear that there are many areas on which Russia will not compromise.   zone over Aleppo? No chance, Mr. Churkin said, so long as   militants were operating there. He accused Western powers of hypocrisy for demanding that warplanes be grounded over Syria. “In one situation their eyes are burning they, like, speak at the top of their lungs and advocate a ” he said. But not so over Yemen, where an   military coalition has bombed hospitals and other civilian sites. War crimes? Mr. Churkin called the accusations against Russia “rhetorical things” and turned the tables on the West, saying what the International Criminal Court ought to investigate instead are the alleged atrocities during the   invasion of Iraq. He also questioned the evidence that hospitals had been bombed by Russian and Syrian forces besieging   parts of Aleppo. “I’m cynical enough,” he said. And the computer hacking? Mr. Churkin smiled. The United States has yet to show proof that Russia broke into the Democratic Party’s email server. Anyway, he said, “we are not astute enough in American politics to understand it will have any significance for the election campaign. ” In diplomacy as in the movies, he said, Americans are fascinated by “conspiracy theories. ” Perhaps just words. But words are a chief currency of diplomacy. And no matter what Moscow and Washington think of each other, the Security Council is one of the few platforms that American and Russian diplomats have to talk to each other, in good times and in bad, like an estranged couple forced to coordinate the school pickups and soccer matches of their children. They still manage. As they did this month, when they chose a new secretary general, António Guterres, of Portugal. Mr. Churkin, who is president of the Security Council for October, stood at the podium outside the Council chambers to make the announcement, alongside 14 other diplomats representing the Council. Just to his right stood Samantha Power, the American ambassador, who just days earlier had accused Russians of “barbarism” for the bombardment of Aleppo. Mr. Churkin called the selection of Mr. Guterres “maybe the best success of the Security Council of the past five years. ” Even so, Russia and the United States emerged from talks in Switzerland over the weekend with no agreement on how to stop the bloodshed in Aleppo. On Monday, Russia said its military, along with Syrian forces, would halt their offensive on eastern Aleppo for eight hours on Thursday, which is not even enough time to get United Nations aid trucks into   parts of the city. Late Monday, Mr. Churkin told reporters at the United Nations that Moscow could do no more until the Nusra Front, a terrorist group affiliated with Al Qaeda, was flushed out. On Friday, Mr. Churkin spoke for more than an hour at the Russian Mission, without press aides or notes. He told jokes. He spoke of his past as a child actor who knew he was not good enough to continue in the entertainment business. At 64, he is the longest serving ambassador on the Security Council, having been appointed in 2006. But he gave no hints about his future plans, saying only with a hearty laugh that since he had helped choose Mr. Guterres, he felt responsible for staying on for the duration of the next secretary general’s first   term. He seemed unfazed by the bitter exchanges he has held with many Western colleagues on the Security Council in the past few weeks. A few were extraordinarily acidic. On a crisp Saturday in   after American warplanes had errantly bombed Syrian military targets instead of Islamic State militants  —   the Pentagon quickly acknowledged the mistake  —   Russia called for an emergency Security Council session. Ms. Power, en route to Council chambers, called Russia’s move “a stunt replete with moralism and grandstanding. ” Mr. Churkin responded by calling her words “demagoguery of the highest order. ” A week later, Ms. Power accused Russia of “barbarism. ” Mr. Churkin struck back by accusing the United States and its Western allies of unleashing terrorist groups across the Middle East. At the end of September, Mr. Churkin said he did something he had never done. He attended a customary     session for the month, where Ms. Power, he said, had “blasted” Russian actions in Syria. Diplomats present said Ms. Power had referred to the Chechen city of Grozny, when speaking of Aleppo. Shortly thereafter, they said, Mr. Churkin marched into Council chambers. Mr. Churkin said he had no idea she would criticize Russia in that meeting. She could have warned him, he argued. They had been on the phone regularly. “I walked into the room and I said what I had to say about her behavior,” Mr. Churkin recalled. “I said I try never to criticize my colleagues, but I have to tell you what I think about the whole thing. And I think she took note of it. ” Ms. Power’s office declined to comment on the episode. Mr. Churkin took pains to say the current situation is unlike the Cold War in that Russian and American diplomats today speak regularly and manage to accomplish things they can agree upon. He signaled too that no matter who wins the American presidential race, he would like to see relations improve, or as he put it, “get back to normal in our relations. ”",0

17235,"Stephen Bannon and Breitbart News, in Their Words - The New York Times","The appointment of Stephen K. Bannon as chief White House strategist for   Donald J. Trump has been condemned by civil rights groups, Democrats and some Republicans, because of Mr. Bannon’s record as chairman of Breitbart News, the   news and opinion site. Here, in his own words, are a selection of Mr. Bannon’s public statements about the country, the Republican Party and his own political philosophy. • “Fear is a good thing. Fear is going to lead you to take action,” he said in a 2010 interview. • Referring to Ann Coulter, Michele Bachmann and Sarah Palin in a 2011 radio interview on Political Vindication Radio, he said: “These women cut to the heart of the progressive narrative. That’s why there are some unintended consequences of the women’s liberation movement. That, in fact, the women that would lead this country would be   they would have husbands, they would love their children. They wouldn’t be a bunch of dykes that came from the Seven Sisters schools up in New England. That drives the left insane, and that’s why they hate these women. ” • Mr. Bannon made a movie in 2012 about the Occupy Wall Street protests. He told an interviewer: “After making the Occupy movie, when you finish watching the film, you want to take a hot shower. You want to go home and shower because you’ve just spent an hour and 15 minutes with the greasiest, dirtiest people you will ever see. ” • “I think anger is a good thing,” he told a gathering of conservatives in Washington in 2013, according to a profile in The Atlantic. “This country is in a crisis. And if you’re fighting to save this country, if you’re fighting to take this country back, it’s not going to be sunshine and patriots. It’s going to be people who want to fight. ” • “I’m a Leninist,” Mr. Bannon was quoted as saying by a writer for The Daily Beast who met him at a party in 2014. He later said he did not recall the conversation. “Lenin wanted to destroy the state, and that’s my goal, too,” the site quoted him as saying. “I want to bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today’s establishment. ” • “What we need to do is   the Republican Party,” he said in a 2010 radio interview on Political Vindication Radio. • “We don’t believe there is a functional conservative party in this country, and we certainly don’t think the Republican Party is that,” he told the same gathering. “It’s going to be an insurgent,   populist movement that is virulently   and it’s going to continue to hammer this city, both the progressive left and the institutional Republican Party. ” • “There is a growing global   revolt against the permanent political class at home, and the global elites that influence them, which impacts everyone from Lubbock, Tex. to London, England,” he said in a 2014 interview in The New York Times. •“Let the grassroots turn on the hate because that’s the ONLY thing that will make them do their duty,” he wrote about Republican leaders in a 2014 email exchange with a Breitbart News editor. The emails were obtained by The Daily Beast. • “We call ourselves ‘the Fight Club.’ You don’t come to us for warm and fuzzy,” Mr. Bannon told The Washington Post this year. “We think of ourselves as virulently   particularly ‘ ’ the permanent political class. We say Paul Ryan was grown in a petri dish at the Heritage Foundation. ” Mr. Bannon  took over Breitbart News in 2012 after the death of its founder, Andrew Breitbart, and shifted it further to the right. Critics, including some conservatives formerly associated with it, have denounced Breitbart in its current incarnation as a hate site steeped in misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, white nationalism and  . Here is a sampling of some articles published during Mr. Bannon’s tenure that drew criticism: • “Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy” A December 2015 article by Milo Yiannopoulos, who was later barred from Twitter when he was accused of inciting racist and sexist attacks on the actress Leslie Jones, told women that birth control “makes you fat,” “makes your voice unsexy,” “makes you jiggle wrong,” “makes you a slut” and “makes you unsexy all the time. ” • “Bill Kristol: Republican Spoiler, Renegade Jew” A May 2016 article by David Horowitz criticized Bill Kristol for his opposition to Mr. Trump as “a political miscalculation so great and a betrayal so profound as to not be easily forgiven. ” • “World Health Organization Report: Trannies 49 Xs Higher HIV Rate” A December 2015 article by Austin Ruse, using a slur for transgender people in the headline, argued that a public health study on sexual health in the transgender community was actually a warning about “how dangerous it is to become ‘transgender. ’” The site called it a rebuke to “the ‘transgender’ narrative that is sweeping American culture. ” • “Roger Stone: Huma Abedin ‘Most Likely a Saudi Spy’ With ‘Deep, Inarguable Connections’ to ‘Global Terrorist Entity’” A June 2016 article by Dan Riehl chronicled the belief of Mr. Stone, a Trump adviser, that Ms. Abedin, an aide to Hillary Clinton, was connected to a terrorist conspiracy. • “There’s No Hiring Bias Against Women in Tech, They Just Suck at Interviews” A July 2016 article by Mr. Yiannopoulos argued that it was women’s fault that tech firms hired so few of them. • “Lesbian Bridezillas Bully Bridal Shop Owner Over Religious Beliefs” An August 2014 article by Susan Berry criticized a lesbian couple who complained on Facebook about a Pennsylvania bridal shop that refused to sell them wedding dresses. • “The Solution to Online ‘Harassment’ Is Simple: Women Should Log Off” A July 2016 article by Mr. Yiannopoulos argued that women were “screwing up the internet for men by invading every space we have online and ruining it with   and a needy, demanding,   form of modern feminism. ”",0
17236,"Bridgewater Associates, World’s Biggest Hedge Fund, Shakes Up Leadership - The New York Times","Ray Dalio, the billionaire founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s biggest hedge fund, is stepping down from its    operation as he continues to struggle to find a successor to run the firm, known for its unusual culture of “radical transparency. ” Mr. Dalio, 67, said on Wednesday that he was giving up the title of   executive and handing operational control to two longtime deputies who sit on the management committee of the $150 billion firm. He also announced the sudden departure of another   executive, Jon Rubinstein, a former senior executive at Apple who was once a deputy to Steve Jobs. Mr. Rubinstein, who joined Bridgewater 10 months ago, is the third   executive in recent years to leave the firm after spending less than a year on the job. Referring to Mr. Rubinstein’s departure, Mr. Dalio said they “mutually agree that he is not a cultural fit. ” Craig Mundie, a former   chairman who introduced Mr. Rubinstein to Bridgewater executives, resigned at the end of last year, said two people with direct knowledge of the firm who were not authorized to speak publicly. He and Mr. Rubinstein remain advisers to the firm. Mr. Dalio’s announcement is the latest sign of turmoil at the top of Bridgewater, which manages money for more than 300 pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and other institutional investors. Last year, Greg Jensen, one of Mr. Dalio’s longtime lieutenants, who was viewed as his heir apparent, was suddenly stripped of his role as   executive amid reports of a power struggle. Both men denied there was any rift, and Mr. Jensen remains at the firm as   investment officer. With the latest move, Mr. Dalio will not be going far  —   he will remain chairman and   investment officer  —   and it is not clear how much authority he will be willing to yield. Over the years, the firm has developed a corporate philosophy that resembles a cross between a religion and something of a cult. Mr. Dalio named David McCormick, the firm’s president, as   executive with Eileen Murray, who has been a longtime member of Mr. Dalio’s management committee. Some in the industry were encouraged by the announcement. “We are seeing a peaceful transition of power, usually a positive indicator,” said Putri Pascualy, managing director and credit strategist at Pacific Alternative Asset Management. “Nonetheless,” she added, “the real test is over the next few years, on whether the firm can outlast its founder. ” Bridgewater has had a frenzy of hires, departures and promotions in recent years, and several prominent executives have suddenly left the firm after short tenures. In 2010, Julian Mack, once a top executive at the consulting firm McKinsey, and Tony Murphy, a former top executive in the Americas for HSBC, left after less than six months on Bridgewater’s executive committee, according to an internal document seen by The New York Times. Other prominent hires were removed from the management committee not long after they joined the firm. A due diligence report for Bridgewater investors from the end of 2011 detailed how Joe Parsons, hired away from GE Capital in 2010, left Bridgewater’s management committee a year after joining the firm. Mr. Parsons left the hedge fund altogether in 2014. Something similar happened with James B. Comey, a former United States deputy attorney general, whom Mr. Dalio hired from Lockheed Martin in 2010 as general counsel. Mr. Comey left Bridgewater’s executive committee in 2011 and left the firm in early 2013. He was subsequently nominated by President Obama to become director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Turnover at Bridgewater is not confined to the management ranks. It is estimated that as many   of employees at Bridgewater leave within the first two years because they have difficulty with its unusual culture, which focuses on a book of philosophical underpinnings penned by Mr. Dalio called “Principles. ” Bridgewater, which employs about 1, 500 people, most at its secluded corporate campus in Westport, Conn. is widely known for videotaping all employee meetings and encouraging debates on many topics, even some as mundane as what kind of yogurt to stock in the employee dining area. Mr. Dalio has made no secret that life at his firm is not for everyone. “Some people absolutely hate it, and some people could never work anywhere else,” Mr. Dalio said at a hedge fund conference in Manhattan in September. The firm’s culture was the focus of articles in The Times and The Wall Street Journal last year. Mr. Dalio reacted angrily to the coverage, posting lengthy responses on LinkedIn and calling the articles sensational and misleading. Mr. Dalio was annoyed over the Times’s reporting last year on the firm’s handling of a sexual harassment complaint filed by a male employee against his supervisor. On Wednesday, he said he was posting details of the management   on LinkedIn because “our communications often find their way into the media in distorted ways. ” Most of the firm’s employment contracts contain stringent   noncompete clauses, and employees are required to sign nondisclosure agreements that often limit the ability of former employees to discuss their time at the firm. An email sent to Mr. Rubinstein seeking comment was answered by an email from a Bridgewater spokesman, who said, “Jon asked me to decline on his behalf. ” In his letter on LinkedIn, Mr. Dalio said the moves were part of Bridgewater’s   transition strategy in preparation for the day when he would step down. That strategy involved creating a management committee with multiple members in what it has called a “planful transition from a   boutique to a professionally managed institution. ” He added, “Any organization run by a 60+ year old that says that it isn’t in transition is either naïve or disingenuous. ” Bridgewater operates three main investment funds. Last year, its All Weather Fund II was up 12. 8 percent, its Optimal fund was up 7 percent, and its Pure Alpha II fund was up 2. 4 percent Mr. Dalio is well known for popularizing the kind of investment called risk parity, which seeks to protect clients from losses when stocks or bonds sell off. The strategy relies heavily on investing in bonds using leverage. The firm has written many white papers on the topic and posted them on its website. Mr. McCormick, the firm’s president, who was Treasury undersecretary for international affairs under President George W. Bush, was said to have been considered for several jobs in the Trump administration. He met with President Trump shortly after the election. Ms. Murray had a   with top executives that culminated in an investigation into an incident involving her and another employee and whether she had lied about her conversations with that employee. Interviews conducted in the investigation, which was led by Mr. Comey, were videotaped and widely seen by employees at the firm and came to be known as “Eileen Lies. ”",0

17238,What Donald Trump Got Wrong on Stop-and-Frisk - The New York Times,"Among the senseless beatings inflicted on reality during the presidential debate on Monday night was the discussion of New York City’s    tactics. Donald J. Trump attributed a nonexistent increase in murder to actions that never happened, namely, the ending of the    practice by, variously, “a judge, who was a very   judge,” and the “current mayor. ” This was multilayered fiction. Murder declined. A judge did not end   . Neither did the current mayor. In fact, the Police Department began to drastically curtail its use in 2012, under the administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, an independent. This is well documented but only lightly noticed. On July 9, 2012, an editorial in The New York Post warned that the reduction in its use would lead to “more blood in the street. ” By the way, did more blood run in the street? No, less blood did. Murder is down 32 percent since 2011, the last year of the old    era, having dropped to 352 homicides in 2015 from 515 in 2011. In the same period, stops were down by about 97 percent, said J. Peter Donald, a spokesman for the department. During the debate, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, alluded to a few of these numbers. Mr. Trump, her Republican opponent, started shouting. “Under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders,” she said. “So there is  —   —  ” “No, you’re wrong,” Mr. Trump interjected. “You’re wrong. ” “No, I’m not,” Mrs. Clinton said. “Murders are up, all right,” Mr. Trump said. “You check it. ” All right, as Mr. Trump said, let’s check it. A Google search for “Historical New York City Crime Data” will bring you to a site with charts of serious felonies. Frisks went down. So has murder, a steady decline that has continued, with slight annual variations, through this year. In the     used by Mr. Trump, those details land upside down. Also, he repeated a more common mistake about the decline of the    tactics, attributing it to a federal judge hearing a   lawsuit against the city, and to Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, who succeeded Mr. Bloomberg in 2014. “It was terminated by the current mayor,” Mr. Trump said. Actually, no. Last year, the city police conducted 22, 939 stops, or about 63 a day. So    was not terminated by Mr. de Blasio, or by anyone else for that matter. It’s true that the use of the tactic has declined. During the mayoralty of Mr. Bloomberg, the number of reported stops skyrocketed, but then was scaled back as the city faced pressure from the   litigation, brought by the New York Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights. By the end of 2013, the year Shira A. Scheindlin, the federal judge hearing the case, ruled that the city’s wholesale search practices violated the Constitution, the number of stops had declined by 72 percent from its peak in 2011. “But    had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City,” Mr. Trump said during the debate. “Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact. ” During the era praised by Mr. Trump, about 90 percent of the people who were stopped were young black or Latino men who had committed no crime whatsoever, according to police data. Of those few who were arrested, the vast majority were charged with nothing more serious than possession of marijuana, not having guns. Hundreds of thousands of innocent people were being stopped every year so that the city could arrest tens of thousands for having weed. Applied almost exclusively to minorities, the    tactics in New York became an elephantine government project that wasted time and money, degrading both to the personhood of the men and women who were stopped and to the professionalism of the people doing the stopping. It was poor social hygiene, not defensible as a matter of law or as effective law and order. As Mr. Trump said, it was “tremendous beyond belief. ” Just so.",0
17239,Bob Corker: Marco Rubio Only GOP Sen May Defect on Tillerson,"The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee told Breitbart News Thursday Sen. Marco Rubio (R. .) is the only Republican member of his committee he suspects could vote against the confirmation of former Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson for secretary of state. [“I am not aware of anyone else who has the concerns of Rubio,” said Sen. Robert P. Corker Jr. (R. .) who became the chairman in 2015 after the Republicans won the Senate majority in the 2014 midterms. ”You’re going to have to speak to Senator Rubio about that. ”  Corker said it was his understanding that Rubio was going to line up time to meet with Tillerson before the committee votes. Republicans hold a    advantage in the Senate, so three Republican defections spell defeat for any of   Donald J. Trump’s nominees. Corker said he is confident that Tillerson has the votes for confirmation because a number of Democrats, whom he would not name, have reached out to him about Tillerson and they have signaled a willingness to support his confirmation. Rubio told reporters after a closed door meeting of the Foreign Relations Committee that he has not made a decision. “I’ve got some things I got to work through,” the Florida senator said. “We have to work through the process, when we are ready to announce, you’ll be be the first to know,” he said as he watched elevator doors close, momentarily blocking his escape. Rubio met with Tillerson Monday, but the senator would not say whether there would be another meeting. The chairman said the reason Tillerson’s second day of testimony was cancelled was to create space for office visits —  and his belief that each senator got enough time asking questions. “Every committee member got at least 24 minutes yesterday,” he said. Another committee chairman told Corker his senators got one round of five minutes each and that was it. In his questioning of Tillerson, Rubio was combative, especially on the subject of Russian president Vladimir Putin. In a typical exchange, Rubio, the lawyer, asked Tillerson, the engineer, if he agreed that Putin was killing political opponents in Russia and overseas. Tillerson: I do not have sufficient information to make that claim. Rubio: Are you aware that people who oppose Vladimir Putin wind up dead all over the world? Poisoned and shot in the back of the head? Do you think that was coincidental? Or do you think it is quite possible or likely —  as I believe —  that they were part of an effort to murder his political opponents? Tillerson: Well, people, who speak up for freedom in regimes that are oppressive are often at threat and these things happen to them. In terms of assigning specific responsibilities, I would have to have more information. As I have indicated, I feel its important that in advising the president, if confirmed, that I deal with facts that I deal with sufficient information, which means having access to all information and I am sure there is a large body of information that I have never seen because it is in the classified realm. I look forward upon being confirmed becoming fully informed. But, I am not willing to make conclusions on what is publicly available or publicly reported. Rubio: None of this is classified, Mr. Tillerson. These people are dead. Political opponents —   Tillerson: Your question was people, who were directly responsible for that. I am not disputing that these people are dead. Corker said he was concerned that in Wednesday’s testimony, there was the impression left that Tillerson lied about whether or not he or Exxon Mobil lobbied against economic sanctions levied on Russia in response to Russian annexation of Crimea and other parts of eastern Ukraine. Tillerson testified that he and his company did not lobby against the sanctions, but the ranking member of the committee, Sen. Robert Menendez (D. . J.) confronted Tillerson with documents Exxon Mobil filed to report its lobbying efforts on Capitol Hill. The New Jersey senator said he was confused as to how Tillerson could testify that he did not lobby the sanctions bill, sponsored by Mendendez, if his company reported that it was in fact lobbying on the issue. Corker said it was all a misunderstanding with which he was familiar because Tillerson called him about his problems with the sanctions bill. The chairman said Tillerson’s problem was that American sanctions and European sanctions were different, and that while Exxon Mobil ongoing operations in Russia were allowed to continue, the wording of the American sanctions made it more difficult to manage the operations, which were allowed. Also, it would have made it more difficult to protect the safety of the 500 personnel working on the projects. All Tillerson wanted was for the American sanctions to match the wording in the European Union sanctions, Corker said. “It was not to lobby against the sanctions, but to point out that the Europeans were doing it in a much better way,” he said. Corker said he plans on checking with his committee members about timing a vote on the Tillerson confirmation, which could come as early as next week.",0
17240,Assange claims ‘crazed’ Clinton campaign tried to hack WikiLeaks,"Julian Assange has claimed the Hillary Clinton campaign has attacked the servers being used by WikiLeaks. Despite the Ecuadorian embassy shutting down his internet until the US election is over, the website will continue publishing, according to Assange. “Everyday that you publish is a day that you have the initiative in the conflict,” Assange said via telephone at a conference in Argentina on Wednesday.
The whistleblowing website has been releasing emails from Clinton’s campaign chair, John Podesta, on a daily basis since early October.
Assange claimed the release “whipped up a crazed hornet’s nest atmosphere in the Hillary Clinton campaign” leading them to attack WikiLeaks.
“ They attacked our servers and attempted hacking attacks and there is an amazing ongoing campaign where state documents were put in the UN and British courts to accuse me of being both a Russian spy and a pedophile,” he added.
Ecuador’s decision to shut down his internet was described by Assange as a “strategic position” so that its “policy of non-intervention can’t be misinterpreted by actors in the US and even domestically in Ecuador.” 
He said he was sympathetic with Ecuador, insisting they face the dilemma of having the US interfere with their elections next year if they appear to interfere with the US elections next month.
Assange, who claimed the embassy will be without internet until the election is over to avoid accusations of interference, said he did not agree with Ecuador’s decision but did understand it. WikiLeaks will not be affected by the decision as they do not publish from Ecuador, he said.
He did, however, reject the idea that WikiLeaks is interfering with the US election, claiming, “this is not the interference of electoral process, this is the definition of electoral process – for media organizations and, in fact, everyone to publish the truth and their opinion about what is occurring. It cannot be a free and informed election unless people are free to inform.” 
He also attacked US TV networks, many of whom he accused of being “controlled by Clinton supporters.” 
The Podesta emails will make no difference to the election result, according to Assange. “I don’t think there’s any chance of Donald Trump winning the election, even with the amazing material we are publishing, because most of the media organizations are strongly aligned with Hillary Clinton,” he said.
Assange said journalists and people who work in the media are predominantly middle class and view Trump as representing “what in their mind is white trash.”

17241,Battle For Mosul Not What It Seems,"in: War Propaganda , World News (image credit: AP) The battle for Mosul is more about redeploying thousands of US-supported ISIS fighters to Syria, along with perhaps letting Turkish forces move in to control evacuated areas. Erdogan long coveted Mosul. He may think now’s his chance to seize the city and its lucrative oil reserves, claiming it’s a buffer zone against Kurdish fighters, similar to his northern Syria occupation. According to Syrian parliamentarian Hohammad Kheir Akam, “(t)he US has opened a southern side of Mosul (corridor) to the terrorists to” let thousands of its fighters enter Syria. US-led coalition warplanes easily spot their convoys. Yet they’re allowed to move freely – America supporting terrorists it claims to oppose. Iraqi Ansarullah al-Nujaba Movement spokesman Hashem al-Moussavi said “Washington is still continuing its military support for the terrorists in” his country, airdropping them weapons and other supplies. “Our forces have filmed US aircraft while dropping military aids for” ISIS terrorist fighters, he said. Iraq’s Hassan Abdel Hadi said government forces are concerned about US aerial attacks, impeding their advance to ISIS-controlled areas. “Unfortunately, there are still some people in Iraq who have been deceived by the US-led coalition, while Washington supports ISIL and is trying to compensate for the damage done” to their fighters by government forces, he explained. Last Friday, Russia’s Defense Ministry spokesman General Igor Konashenkov said US-led coalition warplanes struck a funeral procession. “Dozens of Iraqi civilians died, including women and children,” he explained. “Russian reconnaissance pinpointed two jets conducting airstrikes on Daquq, located 30 kilometers to the south of Kirkuk, where, according to our data, there are no ISIS fighters,” – a willful war crime. They’re “almost a daily routine for the (US-led) international coalition. Too often weddings, funerals, hospitals, police stations, and humanitarian convoys are being hit by the coalition warplanes.” Russian General Sergey Rudskoy said “(w)e are closely monitoring the situation around Mosul. So far we see no substantial progress in liberating this city from…ISIS” since operations began on October 16 – because no effort is made to do it. Last week, a coalition airstrike targeted a mosque south of Kirkuk, killing over a dozen women and children. A southern Mosul girl’s school was struck. US-led coalition warplanes were operating in the area, clearly responsible for what happened. On October 25, Russia’s Defense Ministry reported over 60 civilians killed, over 200 others injured on airstrikes on residential areas in Mosul – locations where no ISIS fighters were present. So far, no fighting inside Mosul was reported. By the time, so-called liberating forces enter the city, ISIS fighters will be gone – redeployed to Syria to combat government troops and civilians. Moscow letting this happen without resistance so far makes the battle to liberate Syria harder. Is an offensive planned to rectify this blunder, compounded by failing to launch airstrikes against al-Nusra terrorists in eastern Aleppo since October 18? According to General Rudskoy, Russian Aerospace forces are monitoring the situation in the area of the Syrian-Iraqi border day and night with the help of unmanned aerial vehicles and other reconnaissance means.” “Russian planes are on patrol missions in the airspace and are ready to immediately deliver strikes against terrorists.” Aerial operations “in a 10-km zone around Aleppo” remain suspended. “The moratorium…will be extended.” The longer Russia delays full-scale aerial operations against US-supported terrorists infesting eastern Aleppo, the harder the struggle ahead to liberate the city and all key parts of Syria.

17244,“Shoot First Ask Questions Later” : What Happens To A UFO When Tracked on Military Radar,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter “Decades ago, visitors from other planets warned us about where we were headed and offered to help. But instead, we, or at least some of us, interpreted their visits as a threat, and decided to shoot first and ask questions after.”   The quote above comes from Paul Hellyer, former Canadian defence minister. ( source ) Based on all of my research into this topic, which has been conducted for more than 10 years, I’ve come across a number of apparent instances where these UFO’s completely avoided our aircfract, commercial or military. Their (the UFO) actions, based on all the documentation out there, always seem to be evasive in nature, regardless of whether these craft are human controlled, or extraterrestrial controlled. On the other hand, it’s not the same for the human race. When an unknown object enters into sensitive airspace, it’s going to be known about, and it’s not uncommon for military agencies to scramble jets in order to take a look. This is something that’s been very well documented, based on my estimates, this is something that’s happened thousands of times around the world for decades. “The nations of the world are currently working together in the investigation of the UFO phenomenon. There is an international exchange of data. Maybe when this group of nations acquires more precise and definite information, it will be possible to release the news to the world”– General Carlos Castro Cavero, Spanish Air Force General (0)   Another common question that comes about when it comes to crashed craft, is if they are so advanced, how have we been able to bring some of them down? Roswell was not the only incident, I believe this to have happened several dozens of times, and I’m not the only one. From what I’ve looked into, they could disable guided missiles, nuclear weapons and electronic equipment, but were not well prepared for anti-aircraft fire (guns). I’m not quite sure if things have remained the same. Below are the words of Dr. Edgar Mitchell, Apollo 14 astronaut and the 6th man to walk on the moon, clearly I am not alone in my research and beliefs. We now have statements from hundreds of credible whistleblowers on the topic of UFOs and Exxtraterrestrials. “Yes there have been crashed craft, and bodies recovered… We are not alone in the universe, they have been coming here for a long time.” ( source ) ( source ) “I happen to be privileged enough to be in on the fact that we have been visited on this planet, and the UFO phenomenon is real.” ( source) So, What Happens When They Are Tracked On Radar? When the FAA tracks them on radar, a protocol is followedT hey report it to data collection centers, one of them being the Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies. (1) But evidence suggests that it’s not so simple as just following protocol. Retired FAA Senior Division Chief, John Callahan, shared his experience with regards to a specific UFO incident, you can watch hat b read more about that here . Representatives from the FBI and CIA showed up to find out more about the incident, and to obtain all documentation and video footage. Bigelow Aerospace Director, Mike Gold, recently expressed that he is glad somebody is taking the reports, because it is a “serious issue,” but he also said that he could not comment on what they do with them. To see that interview, click here . “If one thing is glaringly obvious, it is that the UFO phenomenon is global and has included many military encounters.”– Richard Dolan, Author, Historian, UFO Researcher. (0) So, what happens when UFOs are tracked on military/defence agency radar? Well, the first thing that happens is that it is recorded and documented. Documents regarding UFOs and the tracking of them on radar have been declassified within the past few years, there are countless examples from multiple agencies, like the NSA. ( source ) If something is violating your airspace, and performing maneuvers that defy our understanding of physics, maneuvers that no known air craft can perform, you’re going to want to take a closer look. As UFOs do present a number of defence, national security and air safety issues. One case in particular I’d like to start out with is the incident over Tehran, Iran. This incident occurred on the night of September 18th, 1976. A four page U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency and NSA report describes the encounter in detail. Furthermore, both of the pilots involved discussed the event years later. (source) What happened on this night is an example of what has happened multiple times with regards to military encounters with UFOs. Residents of the city noticed a big bright object in the sky. The airport traffic controller also noticed, “it was an intensely bright object that was not supposed to be there.” The Iranian Air Force was contacted (at the time they were a close ally of the United States, under the rule of the Shah), and they dispatched two F-4 fighter jets to check out the object. The United States took this encounter very seriously, a report of what happened was sent to multiple national security officials AND U.S. President Gerald R. Ford, CIA Director George Bush, and National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger, among others. (0) Both of the F-4 interceptor pilots reported seeing the object visually, it was also tracked on their airborne radar. Both planes experienced critical instrumentation and electronics go offline at a distance of twenty-five miles from the object. Here is an excerpt from the report: “As the F-4 approached a range of 25 nautical miles it lost all instrumentation and communications. When the F-4 turned away from the object and apparently was no longer a threat to it, the aircraft regained all instrumentation and communications. Another brightly lighted object came out of the original object. The second object headed straight toward the F4. ” (source) The report also described how a smaller object detached from the bigger object, turned inside the arc of the F-4 itself, and then regained the original object. This incident lasted for several hours. I decided to use this example because it has a number of declassified supporting national security documents, which goes to show how serious this event was taken. Another significant event occurred over NATO’s Aviano Air Base in Italy, on July 1, 1977. During this event, several U.S. Air Force personnel saw a UFO hovering outside of the base perimeter. While the object was there, the facility lost electrical power. (5) From November 9th through December 18th in 1978, several major UFO events occurred over the oilfields of Kuwait. They also appeared to disrupt major electrical equipment in this case. This event received major attention from the Kuwaiti government, as well as the U.S. government and Embassy. (6)(0) According to Richard Dolan, one of the world’s leading UFO researchers, perhaps the most dramatic of all were two encounters that year on December 16th by the Chilean Air Force: “Two pilots on a training mission, each flying an F5 fighter aircraft, tracked the object on their airborne radar. It gave a return equal to ten or more aircraft carriers-except this object was in the air, not floating on the water. Each pilot assumed his radar equipment was faulty, until he learned that the other pilot was also getting the same return. Not only this, but ground radar from a nearby airport also picked up the object and confirmed its huge size. The pilots also saw the object with their own eyes. One pilot later said that at a distance of twenty miles, it looked “like a plantain banana swathed in smoke.” The pilots were frightened, having no missiles or weapons. As they approached the massive object, which had been motionless all this while, it took off at an unimaginable speed. All at once, it vanished from the three radar screens.”(7)(0) The very next morning the Chilean Air Force scrambled some F5 fighter jets to intercept another very large UFO. The pilots described this one as very bright, and very large. The Chilean Air Force has officially acknowledged these events, but could not explain what had occurred. (7)(0) On May 19, 1986, there was a large portion of Brazilian airspace that was constantly occupied by UFOs. The Brazilian air-force constantly scrambled their jets to get a closer look at what they were picking up on radar. Here is a quote from the Brazilian Minister of Aeronautics, Brigadier General Otavio Moreira Lima: “At least 20 objects were detected by Brazilian radars. They saturated the radars and interrupted traffic in the area. Each time that radar detected unidentified objects, fighters took off for intercept. Radar detects only solid metallic bodies and heavy (mass) clouds. There were no clouds nor conventional aircraft in the region. The sky was clear. Radar doesn’t have optical illusions. We can only give technical explanations and we don’t have them. It would be very difficult for us to talk about the hypothesis of an electronic war. It’s very remote and it’s not the case here in Brazil. It’s fantastic. The signals on the radar were quite clear.” (8)(0) I’d also like to point out that UFOs have been seen and coincide with the deactivation of nuclear missiles and nuclear missile facilities all over the world. Below is a video of Robert Hastings , you can look into him if you want to learn more. The list goes on and on, UFOs tracked on radar and military jets scrambled to check them out is nothing new. I hope I’ve given you a good amount of info to further your research if interested. Dozens and dozens of governments have recently released their UFO files, admitting to the phenomenon being real. You can access the United Kingdoms latest batch that was released in June 2013 here . According to U.S. defense records, an interesting sighting of a UFO was reported by the Ghana Air Force on July 27, 1987. It was a large, silent object which the pilot described as two or three times large than a Boeing 747. He said that the “object dropped altitude, then gained altitude, then was replaced by small bluish lights arranged in a circular formation.” (9)(0) Below is a quote from Paul Hellyer, X Canadian Defence Minister describing another documented case. “In one of the cases during the cold war, 1961, there were about 50 UFOs in formation flying South from Russia across Europe. The supreme allied commander was very concerned and was about ready to press the panic button when they turned around and went back over the North Pole. They decided to do an investigation and they investigated for three years and they decided that with absolute certainty that four different species, at least, have been visiting this planet for thousands of years. There’s been a lot more activity in the past two decades, especially since we invented the atomic bomb. They are very concerned about that and if we will use it again, because the whole cosmos is in unity and it affects not just us but other people in the cosmos. They’re very much afraid that we might start using atomic weapons again and this would be very bad for us, and them also.” – Paul Hellyer ( source ) What Do They Look Like When The Pilots See Them? “If it does indeed turn out that there is relevant physical evidence, if this evidence is carefully collected and analyzed, and if this analysis leads to the identification of several facts concerning the UFO phenomenon, then will be the time for scientists to step back and ask, what are these facts trying to tell us? If those facts are strong enough to lead to a firm conclusion, then will be the time to confront the more bizarre questions. If, for instance, it turns out that all physical evidence is consistent with a mundane interpretation of the causes of UFO reports, there will be little reason to continue to speculate about the role of extraterrestrial beings. If, on the other hand, the analysis of physical evidence turns up very strong evidence that objects related with UFO reports were manufactured outside the solar system, then one must obviously consider very seriously that the phenomenon involves not only extraterrestrial vehicles but probably also extraterrestrial beings.” ( source ) The quote above comes from Peter Andrew Sturrock , a British Scientist, and an Emeritus Professor of Applied Physics at Stanford University. Sturrock and a number of other notable scientists around the world came together during the 1990’s in order to examine the physical evidence that is commonly associated with the UFO phenomenon. One example used by Sturrock in his analysis, was a photo taken by two Royal Canadian Air Force pilots on August 27th, 1956, in McCleod, Alberta, Canada. ( “Physical Evidence Related To UFO Reports”– The Sturrock Panel Report – Electromagnetic Effects ) ( source ) ( source ) The pilots were flying in a formation of four F86 Sabre jet aircraft. One of the pilots described the phenomenon as a “bright light which was sharply defined as disk-shaped,” that looked like “a shiny silver dollar sitting horizontal.” Another pilot managed to photograph the object, as you can see to the left. The sighting lasted for a couple of minutes, and this specific case was analyzed by Dr. Bruce Maccabee, who estimated (from available data) that the luminosity of the object (the power output within the spectral range of the film) to be many megawatts. The Sturrock Panel also found it to be the case that a strong magnetic field surrounding the phenomenon or object was a common occurrence. Maccabee published his analysis in the Journal of Scientific Exploration (“Optical Power Output of an Unidentified High Altitude Light Source,” published in the Journal of Scientific Exploration, vol. 13, #2, 1999). He also published one in 1994 titled “Strong Magnetic Field Detected Following a Sighting of an Unidentified Flying Object,” in the same journal (8, #3, 347) Dr. Jacques Vallee, notable for co-developing the first computerized mapping of Mars for NASA, and for his work at SRI International on the network information center for ARPANET , a precursor to the modern Internet, also published a paper in the Journal of Scientific Exploration titled “Estimates of Optical Power Output in Six Cases Of Unexplained Ariel Objects With Defined Luminosity Characteristics.” ( source )( source ) This particular case is also referenced in this paper. “Behind the scenes, high ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense.” Former head of the CIA, Roscoe Hillenkoetter, 1960 (source, NY Times) It’s only now that more people are starting to become aware of this information. Here is a quote from Senator Barry Goldwater before the de-classification of all of these files: “This thing has gotten so highly-classified… it is just impossible to get anything on it. I have no idea who controls the flow of need-to-know because, frankly, I was told in such an emphatic way that it was none of my business that I’ve never tried to make it to be my business since. I have been interested in this subject for a long time and I do know that whatever the Air Force has on the subject is going to remain highly classified.” – Senator Barry Goldwater , Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee (source) Below is a great clip from author and researcher Richard Dolan , taken from The Citizens Hearing On Disclosure summing it all up in one short speech.

17245,AMERICANS DESPERATELY TRYING TO REMEMBER ELECTION SAFE WORD,"AMERICANS DESPERATELY TRYING TO REMEMBER ELECTION SAFE WORD Nov 2, 2016 
Washington, D.C. (SatireWire.com) – Pushed to the limits of pain by an election that was initially entertaining but has clearly gotten out of hand, Americans today are frantically trying to remember the safe word that will stop this sadistic presidential race before it ends badly. 
“Honestly, at first I thought it was just a little role-playing,” said Jessica Riley, 44, of Austin, Texas. “Donald Trump as President Trump? I was like, ‘It feels so wrong, but I can’t turn away.’ But then the FBI jumped into the race with more emails and suddenly I was like, ‘Oh God no, Donald Trump actually is going to be president! Apple! Baseball! Putin!’” 
“Honestly, I can’t think of what it was!” added desperate 28-year-old Clay Toombs of Charlotte, N.C. “Pineapple? Oklahoma? Mussolini? Just please stop! And no I am not kidding, and no I am not saying this because I really want you to keep going! I mean it!” 
W ith the election only days away, voters said they probably should have ended this dark, ‘50 Shades of Orange’ fantasy sooner, but conceded they didn’t recognize how abusive things would become. 
“OK, intially it did spice things up,” said Seattle resident Taylor Bryant, 38. “Trump was really pushing the boundaries. He was into all the kinky stuff like gagging the press, handcuffing immigrants, stop and frisk. Plus he had this whole prison fantasy with Hillary. But then he got over-the-top dirty – pussy grabbing, blood coming out of her wherever, and, c’mon, suggesting he’d like to get it on with his daughter? 
“I draw the line at scarring,” Bryant added. “I don’t want any visible scars, and right now I feel scarred for life.” 
Like many voters, D.T. Fillion, 56, of Clemson, S.C., said he wishes the election campaign had never taken place. 
“If what happened in 2016 could stay in 2016, that’d be great,” he said. “We’ll just say it was a phase. And hope my kids don’t find out.” 
Carolyn Frate of Brooklyn, meanwhile, said she’s no longer excited by either candidate. 
“If we could just have Tim Kaine and Mike Pence, I know that would be, like, the electoral missionary position, but right now I could do with boring,” she said. 
For the record, the safe word is “Vote.”

17247,Fake News: ’Rigged Media’ Misrepresented Hungarian PM as Racist,"Zoltán Kovács, official spokesman for the office of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, claims the “rigged media” turned his prime minister “into a racist overnight” by deliberately misrepresenting his recent comments on ethnicity. [During his speech, Prime Minister Orbán clarified his recently reported comments on the importance of preserving Hungary’s “ethnic homogeneity” by saying, “Of course, we Hungarians are heterogeneous   …     even if you read the names [in this room] you’d have everything from Bunjevci to Swabian [a reference to ethnic groups in the region]”.  “[T]his is a colourfulness within certain limits, [but] we are all from one civilisation   …     Of course, as we learned from St. Stephen, we welcome everyone. ” By mischaracterising this as a call for a monoracial society along National Socialist lines, says Kovács, the “liberal media” provide “a perfect example of quoting out of context to deliberately twist the meaning and swindle the reader”. He added that “many of the journalists who ran with that distorted version of events never heard or read the speech”. Kovács asserts that “the loud,   press simply don’t have ears to hear the real meaning of a statement and refuse to report the full picture. Instead, these journalists with an agenda quote out of context and crop the photo”  —   a reference to a previous incident of media distortion from 2015. “Set aside the manipulative editing on the part of the journalist and you know that PM Orbán called for the preservation of ethnic homogeneity according to our ‘colourful’ European tradition and history  …     That’s a big difference. Too bad the rigged media is so blinded by their own bias that they can’t see the difference or don’t want to. ” The Oxford Dictionary defines “ethnicity” as “the fact or state of belonging to a social group that has a common national or cultural tradition”  —   an umbrella which could easily encompass a   society, if not a   one. Given the context provided by Kovács, the Hungarian prime minister’s comments may be understood to reflect similar views on “Hyphenated Americanism” expressed by U. S. President Theodore Roosevelt, whose likeness adorns Mount Rushmore today. “There is no room in this country for hyphenated Americanism. When I refer to hyphenated Americans, I do not refer to naturalised Americans. Some of the very best Americans I have ever known were naturalised Americans, Americans born abroad. But a hyphenated American is not an American at all,” he said in 1915. “The one absolutely certain way of bringing this nation to ruin, of preventing all possibility of its continuing to be a nation at all, would be to permit it to become a tangle of squabbling nationalities an intricate knot of           or   each preserving its separate nationality, each at heart feeling more sympathy with Europeans of that nationality, than with the other citizens of the American Republic. ”",0
17248,AG Sessions to MS-13 Gang: ’We Are Targeting You’,"U. S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions vowed to eradicate the hyperviolent   transnational criminal gang during a speech he gave while in New York. [Sessions visited Long Island on Friday to deliver a message of hope to the area embattled by   The New York Times reported.  Speaking at the United States Courthouse in Central Islip, Sessions had a very simple message for  : “We are targeting you. ” “The   motto is kill, rape and control,” Sessions said. “I have a message to the gangs that are targeting our young people: We are targeting you. We are coming after you. ” The trip by Sessions to Long Island comes after four teenagers were found brutally murdered near a soccer field on April 13. Before Sessions arrival, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) announced on Wednesday that a new unit had been created by the New York State Police to combat  . The announcement by Cuomo came just as officials with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that Long Island is home to over 200 “hardcore members” of  . However, on Friday some 200 protesters gathered at the courthouse to voice their distaste for Sessions and the Trump administration’s tough stances on illegal immigration. Rep. Peter T. King ( ) who invited Sessions to Long Island to meet with local law enforcement, was visibly upset by the protesters. “They should be on their knees thanking him, not out there protesting,” King said. “It’s shameful, it’s disgraceful that leaders in the community would criticize the attorney general. ” On March 2, 13   members, 10 of whom were illegal aliens, were indicted for the murder of two girls and five other individuals in Brentwood, NY. Sessions said that securing the border and restoring lawful immigration is key to combatting gangs like  . “We cannot continue with this transporting across our border illegal immigrants who have not been properly vetted and actually are part of criminal organizations,” Sessions said. A poll published on Monday by Rasmussen Reports found that 47 percent of those surveyed agreed that   should be designated as a terrorist organization while only 17 percent disagreed and 35 percent were unsure. The move to designate   as a terrorist organization was supported by both Republicans and Democrats surveyed.

17249,"PartyNextDoor Is Finding His Voice, and a Bigger Spotlight - The New York Times","After hours at the Brooklyn Museum on Friday night, hundreds of young people bopped along while a D. J. cycled through the summer’s hottest rap and RB songs. As the event reached its climax, the ubiquitous opening notes of a guaranteed crowd pleaser  —   “Work,” by Rihanna, featuring Drake  —   vibrated through the room. But when the vocals on the demo recording started, it was obvious that this wasn’t the version that spent nine weeks as the No. 1 song in the country. In place of Rihanna, the nimble, addictive patois was delivered by PartyNextDoor, 23, the Canadian producer and RB singer who wrote the song’s   melody and helped to usher in a pop moment deeply indebted to the Caribbean. PartyNextDoor, gliding through the crowd to the D. J. booth, was not there to celebrate his role in the song of the summer, however, nor was he touting his contributions to Drake’s latest album, “Views,” which spent 12 weeks atop the Billboard chart. “PartyNextDoor 3,” his own new album, had just been released, capping one of the more quietly influential runs of 2016. Now he was, somewhat reluctantly, the main attraction. As the first artist signed to Drake’s OVO Sound label, a partnership with Warner Bros. in 2013, PartyNextDoor has had his fingerprints on every Drake release since, in addition to the steady flow of slurry, nocturnal RB under his own name. But Drake casts a wide shadow, and PartyNextDoor (born Jahron Anthony Brathwaite) has thus far been comfortable in the shade. “You don’t really know anything about me, and that’s how I like it,” he said in a rare interview before the album release party. But with credits on a No. 1 song  —   as well as   friends and collaborators like Drake, Rihanna and Kylie Jenner  —   come more expectations. PartyNextDoor acknowledged that while his new album might not be his solo breakthrough to the pop mainstream, he hopes it is a step further. “More people’s eyes are on me now,” he said. “The people are literally watching me find my voice. ” So far, that voice has been malleable:   and full of bravado, slipping easily into   cadences (“Recognize”) or pure and sweet, leaning more toward soul (“Joy,” a highlight from the new album). Most often, it is carnal and   as on “High Hopes,” the decidedly noncommercial   intro to “PartyNextDoor 3,” which just sounds   (to say nothing of the lyrics). In daylight, PartyNextDoor was more   sitting at the kitchen table of a   Airbnb rental in Midtown Manhattan as he rolled a blunt on a takeout sushi container. He wore a     styled with safety pins, a   nose ring and a folded bandanna around his   skinny blond dreads. Prone to long pauses, as if avoiding verbal traps, he left more sentences dangling than he finished. Yet, after a string of niche projects that built his name and a dedicated online following, PartyNextDoor has become resigned to the fact that more visibility is a must for his career to progress. “From here on, I will try to do better at interacting with my fans,” he wrote in a note revealing the new album. Previous attempts at putting himself out there have been bumpy at best. This year, PartyNextDoor found himself drowning in internet drama after posting an   Instagram with a rumored ex, the singer Kehlani. (“No one knows the details, and I don’t care to defend myself,” he said.) Not long after, he was caught up with the Kardashians after a series of paparazzi photos and a subsequent music video surfaced, featuring him in the company of Ms. Jenner, the youngest sister. Asked if he had actively courted TMZ attention by casting a reality star as his love interest, PartyNextDoor would only say, “I’m grateful that really pretty girls like my music, and social media just happens to like really pretty girls. ” While flaunting a Kylie endorsement is one thing, he is less willing to chase what’s hot musically. Raised in what he called a “super Jamaican household” in the Toronto suburb of Mississauga, PartyNextDoor has long peppered his songs with dance hall sirens and slang. But recently, he has leaned into his Caribbean roots on “Work” and “Sex With Me,” another Rihanna track, along with Drake’s “With You,” a shimmering summer gem from “Views. ” “Not Nice,” a thumping single from “PartyNextDoor 3,” has a similar vibe, and given the album’s summer release and the trendiness of the sound, an entire record in that mold might have made sense. But a few songs aside, “PartyNextDoor 3” favors a grim,   palette. “I could make a PartyNextDoor album that’s clean, all hits,” he explained. “That’s not what I care about doing. ” The same goes for being a pop songwriter, he said. After dropping out of high school at 17, he signed a publishing deal to write for others, well aware that that wasn’t his ultimate goal. He met Rihanna last year, during a writing camp at her Malibu home. “The first feeling I got was, ‘Why am I here? ’” he recalled. “All these guys have made hits already. ” But he was determined to create streamlined songs for her, requiring a different process than his looser, more experimental   productions. Even “Work” was not an immediate fit. Despite Rihanna’s Bajan heritage, “her label didn’t care for Caribbean music at the time,” PartyNextDoor said. He and Drake considered keeping the track, or giving it to Alicia Keys, but Rihanna’s team came around “when it was all that she could sing around the house,” he said. “She fought for it,” he continued. “She said, ‘This is my family’s favorite song. ’” Collaborating with Drake may seem more fraught from the outside. During his chart dominance, Drake has been dogged by ghostwriting accusations, and observers have wondered whether OVO Sound, also home to Majid Jordan and Roy Woods, is just his “personal hit factory,” having not yet minted a star near the boss’s level. (Drake’s previous RB collaborator the Weeknd, by contrast, set out for  —   and achieved  —   pop stardom on his own.) PartyNextDoor insisted that their partnership was mutually beneficial. “I openly share music with Drake, especially when it’s time for him to have a project,” he said. At the same time, “I have an older brother I can text anytime, someone who’s super invested because my name is tied into his. “It’s just creatives cooking,” he continued of their work together. “If he sees something in a song of mine that he feels he can spin around and make better, who am I to say I’m going to selfishly keep it? As a fan of music, that’s wrong. ” He added, “Of course I want to be a superstar, but it doesn’t happen overnight, and I see that from having a mentor. ” The two work in harmony, not in lock step, each playing his role. “We have similar stories, but not the same story,” PartyNextDoor said. “Being a fan got me to him, but he needs me to be me. I need to be me. ”",0
17250,Republicans Divided Between Romney and Giuliani for Secretary of State - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Rival factions of Republicans are locked in an increasingly caustic and public battle to influence   Donald J. Trump’s choice for secretary of state, leaving a prominent hole in an otherwise quickly formed national security team that is unlikely to be filled until next week at the earliest. The debate inside Mr. Trump’s wide circle of formal and informal advisers  —   pitting supporters of one leading contender, Mitt Romney, against those of another, Rudolph W. Giuliani  —   has led to the kind of dramatic airing of differences that characterized Mr. Trump’s unconventional and often squabbling campaign team. And it traces the outlines of the enduring split in the Republican Party between establishment figures who scoffed at Mr. Trump’s chances of victory and the   insurgents who backed him as a disrupter of the Washington power structure. The most publicly vocal faction has been the group opposed to Mr. Romney, which has questioned whether he would be loyal after his searing criticism of Mr. Trump during the campaign. But Mr. Trump himself has told aides that he believes Mr. Romney “looks the part” and would make a fine secretary of state, a senior Trump official said on Thursday. Mr. Trump, who is always difficult to read and is capable of changing his mind at any minute, has also praised Mr. Giuliani in recent conversations with acquaintances. Even Thanksgiving did not provide a reprieve from the extraordinary public efforts to cast doubt on Mr. Romney. Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said on Twitter that she had received “a deluge” of concern from people warning against picking Mr. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee and former Massachusetts governor. Those raising concerns about Mr. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and an early and loyal supporter of Mr. Trump, have said they fear that his tangle of foreign business ties could lead to a damaging confirmation battle. They also worry that Mr. Giuliani lacks the vigor for the   job. Both Mr. Romney and Mr. Giuliani have made their interest in the role known to Mr. Trump. But while Mr. Giuliani has been very public about his intentions  —   angering Mr. Trump at times with his statements  —   Mr. Romney has been more reserved. The split over the two men has opened the door for another candidate altogether. One potential pick Mr. Trump and his team have entertained is Gen. John F. Kelly of the Marines, a former head of the United States Southern Command. Others are David H. Petraeus, the retired general and former C. I. A. director, and Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, according to two people involved in the process. Asked about Mr. Trump’s deliberations, a spokesman, Jason Miller, said in an email Thursday, “The   is meeting with a number of   potential selections for this important position who share his America First foreign policy  —   some of whom have been made public and others who have not  —   and the   will make public his decision when he has finalized it. ” Mr. Romney would represent a departure from the   Mr. Trump has already picked for his national security team. But aides like Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, have expressed doubts about Mr. Romney’s loyalty given his denunciation of Mr. Trump as a “phony” and a “fraud. ” Mr. Bannon and others have told colleagues they fear that a State Department under Mr. Romney could turn into something of a rogue agency. Asked to explain her Twitter post about Mr. Romney, Ms. Conway said that while she trusted Mr. Trump’s judgment, she found it notable that the most outrage directed at Mr. Trump from the party’s   “is not against something he said, but something he may do. ” In another post, she said that being “loyal” was an important characteristic for a secretary of state. Others hoping to catch Mr. Trump’s ear have taken their message to a place they know he is likely to absorb it: cable news. Joe Scarborough, the MSNBC host, who has spoken with Mr. Trump about his concerns that Mr. Giuliani would not be confirmed by the Senate, has taken to making those arguments on a daily basis on his morning show, which he knows Mr. Trump watches. Others, like Newt Gingrich, the former Republican House speaker, and Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, have gone on television to try to dissuade Mr. Trump from picking Mr. Romney. Mr. Huckabee, who said during the 2008 presidential campaign that Mr. Romney reminded voters of “the guy who laid them off,” told Fox News on Wednesday that picking Mr. Romney would be “a real insult” to Mr. Trump’s supporters. Mr. Giuliani is a favorite of the Republican voters who turned out in large numbers to lift Mr. Trump to victory. Sean Hannity, a Fox News host whose opinion Mr. Trump often privately solicits, has also been deeply critical of Mr. Romney on his show. Shortly after the election, Mr. Giuliani told associates that he believed the job was his. He had communicated to Mr. Trump’s top advisers that it was the only post he was interested in, according to the people briefed on the discussions. But he began to run afoul of Mr. Trump when he told a Wall Street Journal forum that he would probably be a better candidate than John R. Bolton, who served as one of George W. Bush’s ambassadors to the United Nations. And when reports surfaced about Mr. Giuliani’s foreign business entanglements and highly compensated speechmaking, Mr. Trump grew even warier. His firm, Giuliani Partners, has had contracts with the government of Qatar, and Mr. Giuliani has given paid speeches to a shadowy Iranian opposition group that until 2012 was on the State Department’s list of foreign terrorist organizations. As a backup plan, some of Mr. Trump’s aides encouraged him to meet with Mr. Romney. Though some in Mr. Trump’s inner circle, like Reince Priebus, his choice for chief of staff, thought that such a meeting would anger the  ’s supporters, Mr. Trump went ahead. In the meantime, he started sounding out Mr. Giuliani on a different post, director of national intelligence. Mr. Trump’s advisers have discussed the role for Mr. Giuliani, but there has been no indication he wants it. What many people believed would be a perfunctory meeting with Mr. Romney last weekend at Mr. Trump’s golf club in Bedminster, N. J. turned into something more substantial. Mr. Trump liked Mr. Romney quite a bit, and was intrigued by the possibility of such a   option to represent the country around the globe, advisers to Mr. Trump said. The following day, Mr. Giuliani met with Mr. Trump and urged him to make a decision in one direction or the other. Mr. Romney, who was mocked in 2012 when he described Russia as the greatest geopolitical foe of the United States, has seen his stock in the Republican Party rise since his loss to President Obama, although he is still viewed skeptically by the party’s  . His allies believe that his position on Russia has been vindicated, but it is starkly at odds with Mr. Trump’s stated desire for a better relationship with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. Privately, Mr. Giuliani has expressed his frustration at going from   for secretary of state to a contender who has to convince Mr. Trump of his strengths. He is particularly irritated over the focus on his business ties. The option of a third person like General Kelly has gained currency in recent days inside the transition team. A respected leader, General Kelly served as the senior military assistant to former Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta. He led the Southern Command, responsible for all United States military activities in South and Central America, for four years under Mr. Obama. And his appointment would fit Mr. Trump’s inclination toward putting people with combat experience in senior foreign policy roles.",0

by Pepe Escobar Donald Trump’s red wave on Election Day was an unprecedented body blow against neoliberalism. The stupid early-1990s prediction about the ‘end of history’ turned into a – possible – shock of the new. 
The new global nativism? Perhaps a new push towards democratic socialism? Too early to tell. 
Once again. A body blow, not a death blow. Like the cast of The Walking Dead , the zombie neoliberal elite simply won’t quit. For the Powers That Be/Deep State/Wall Street axis, there’s only one game in town, and that is to win, at all costs. Failing that, to knock over the whole chessboard, as in hot war. 
Hot war has been postponed, at least for a few years. Meanwhile, it’s enlightening to observe the collective American and Eurocrat despair about a world they can’t understand anymore; Brexit, Trumpquake, the rise of the far-right across the West. For the insulated financial/tech/think-tank elites of liquid modernity, criticism of neoliberalism – with is inbuilt deregulation, privatization a-go-go, austerity obsession – is anathema. 
The angry, white, blue collar Western uprising is the ultimate backlash against neoliberalism – an instinctive reaction against the rigged economic casino capitalism game and its subservient political arms. That’s at the core of Trump winning non-college white voters in Wisconsin by 28 points. Blaming “whitelash” , racism, WikiLeaks or Russia is no more than childish diversionary tactics. 
The key question is whether the backlash may engender a new Western drive towards democratic socialism – read David Harvey’s books for the road map – or just nostalgic nationalism raging against the neoliberal Washington/EU/NAFTA/ globalization machine. 
Read my lips: much lower taxes 
Trump is proposing to turn the tables on the neoliberal game. Throughout his campaign he criminalized free trade – the essence of globalization – for decimating the American working class, even as US businesses blamed free trade for forcing them to squeeze workers’ wages. 
So let’s see how Trump will be able to impose his priorities. In parallel to addressing the appalling structural decline in US manufacturing, he wants to pull a China: a massive $1 trillion infrastructure project over 10 years via public-private partnerships and private investments encouraged by lower taxes. That’s supposed to create a wealth of jobs. 
Lower corporate taxes in this case translate into a whopping $3 trillion over 10 years, something like 1.6 percent of GDP. That would be the way to incite huge multinationals to repatriate the hundreds of billions of dollars in profits stashed abroad. This fiscal shock would create 25 million jobs in the US over the next 10 years, and propel a 4 percent growth rate. 
And then there’s the protectionist drive that will renegotiate NAFTA and kill TPP for good. Not to mention raising import tariffs over manufactured products (many by de-localized US multinationals) imported from China and Mexico. 
It’s open to fierce debate how Trumponomics will manage to square the circle; with more economic growth fueled by less taxes, imports will rise to satisfy internal demand. But if these products are subjected to stiffer tariffs, they will become more expensive, and inflation will inevitably rise. 
Anyway, the bottom line of protectionist Trumponomics would be a huge blow against global trade. Deglobalization, anyone? 
Asia braces for impact 
Predictably, the heart of deglobalization will be the Trump-China relationship. Throughout the campaign, Trump blamed China for currency manipulation and proposed a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports. 
In Hong Kong banking circles, no one believes in it. Key argument: the already strapped basket of “deplorables” simply won’t have the means to pay more for these Chinese imports. 
Another thing entirely would be for Trumponomics to find mechanisms to hurt US companies that de-localize in Asia. That would translate into serious problems for outsourcing Meccas such as India and the Philippines. Outsourcing in the Philippines, for instance, serves mostly US companies and attracts revenue as crucial to the nation as total Filipino worker remittances from abroad, something like 9 percent of GDP. 
It’s quite enlightening in this context to consider what Narayana Murthy – founder of Indian IT major Infosys – told the CNBC TV-18 network; “What is in the best interest of America is for its corporations to succeed, for its corporations to create more jobs… to export more… so I’m very positive.” 
our months ago Nomura Holdings Inc. issued a report titled “Trumping Asia” . No less than 77 percent of respondents expected Trump to brand China a currency manipulator; and 75 percent predicted he will impose tariffs on exports from China, South Korea and Japan. 
So no wonder all across Asia the next months will be nerve-wracking. Asia – and not only China – is the factory of the world. Any Trump trade restriction over China will reverberate all across Asia.

17253,Trump and the Power of Money | The Vineyard of the Saker,"1597 Views October 28, 2016 8 Comments Guest Posts The Saker 
by Peter Koenig 
Imagine, Donald Trump would accede to the US Presidency, an unlikely event with the presstitute media relentlessly slamming, slashing and demonizing him, not unlike they do with President Putin – while cheering no-end for the warmonger Killary, no matter what atrocities she has on her hands and body, no matter that blood is dripping out of her mouth every time she opens it – like Iraq, Libya, Syria, Palestine, Afghanistan, Sudan – and more, much more. They, the elite, the military-security complex, the financial mafia, want more blood, more than is already covering the entire current Obama Administration’s structure of psychopaths. Blood is weapons, blood is money, blood is more profit, blood is good for business – so said the Washington Post, just slightly translated from ‘war is good for business’. The warmongering MSM (mainstream media) also propagate for more weapons to enrich the military-security complex that pays them. But just for a moment, let’s assume, Trump would get elected with such a large margin that voter fraud would be difficult to manage. 
Trump is sending a different narrative from that of eternal war. Trump seems to be looking into a different direction. He essentially says – stop the conflict with Russia, make Russia a partner, stop outsourcing jobs, bring them back, give labor back to Americans, slash the unemployment rate – which is, of course, everybody knows, way above the silly fabricated 5%. The reality is that unreported but real unemployment in the US is hovering between 22% and 25%, a real hammer for the economy, increasing anger and unhappiness and crime. Trump also says in the same vein as bringing back jobs – STOP globalization, restrain NATO, rein in the banks – yes, Wall Street, the Goldman Sachs-es and Co. of this world of fake pyramid money, dominated by the Rothschild-Rockefeller-Morgan clan. Trump says, let’s have a financial system that works for the people. 
Does he mean it? – I don’t know. Could be true. Most of what he says makes sense for America, for Americans – and by extension for much of the rest of the world, especially Europe, the genuine Europe, not the puppet-commandeered Europe. He also says a lot of outright discriminatory and xenophobic rubbish – like building a wall separating Mexico from the US of A, emulating Israel; and propagates a crackdown on Moslems. Does he mean it? Or does he want to please potential voters? – Such statements are indeed dangerous rubbish, but they are secondary to all the other things that are PRIORITARY, as they would help restore American society, workforce, dignity – most important: DIGNITY. Dignity is important for Americans to wake up to realize that they are living in a country that wastes their money, the peoples’ resources – on countless criminal wars around the world, feverishly racing towards Full Spectrum Dominance to benefit a few. The secondary stuff is important too, but can be dealt with in parallel by Americans that have come to senses. 
Trump is in many ways like France’s Marine LePen, representing the extreme right, and therefore, no matter what sensible things she says and has on her agenda to do – and I don’t doubt one minute that she means what she says – like EUREXIT and send NATO to hell – she is still framed by the ‘left intellectuals’ – if such a thing still exists in our neoliberal universe – as a discriminatory xenophobe who would expel all ‘colored’ and ‘veiled’ foreigners. Of course, that’s bad. But let her first initiating France exiting from the EU, the Euro and NATO – the likely salvation of Europe, then tackle the other issues. First comes first. A true intellectual left would have to understand that – and not bend to the presstitute promoted clichés. 
Trump has enough money power. He doesn’t have to bend to the military security complex, to the banks, to the Obamacare pharma-fiefdom. He doesn’t really have to bend to anybody. That worries the elite. He is independent. Let’s give him the benefit of the doubt. In no case could he be worse than Hillary – the killer – so much can be read from every word she says. Her pattern of pathology – “We came, we saw, we won” , when she saw the bloodstained image of the NATO-slaughtered Ghaddafi – indicates that she would not stop from pressing this infamous Red Button of Death and total world annihilation – perhaps even repeating that same smirk, , “We came, we saw, we won” . 
Now let’s go to the next hypothesis, assuming Trump would be elected and ‘they’ – the elusive high-powered small elite that pulls the strings on Washington and the White House’s overseas puppets, and let’s assume ‘they’ would let him live, at least for a while, Trump might be doing ‘irrational’ things in the eye of the Beltway slaves. Recognizing the perils for his own country and those for his neighbor, Canada, Mr. Trump might call on the western stooges, in Europe particularly, who for the sake of brown-nosing the naked king in Washington, are prepared to sell-out 500-plus million European and their future generations to the most nefarious trade deals the world has ever known – CETA, TTIP and TiSA (let alone the TPP, where 12 Pacific countries are about to kiss ass in Washington) – telling them to come to senses, think democracy and stop the deals that 80% or more of Europeans despise and reject. 
As a parenthesis and philosophically speaking, one could say that given the hundreds of years of colonization around the globe, of shameless exploitation, of raping and killing millions of people throughout Africa, Asia, and Latin America, that these trade ‘deals’ are Europe’s historically deserved heritage.—– The Saker wrote a great essay on the aberration of this upcoming election and what might follow after the election, “The US Is About To Face The Worst Crisis in Their History” – http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article45729.htm . One of the article’s commenters pinned it down to the point: “ If Trump does become Commander in Chief, his first job will be securing his life. Those who really run the show in the US will stop at nothing to safeguard their empire. Truly the US is at a cross roads and by extension the world. Times are really scary .” 
What Trump says he would do during his first 100 days in office, he presented in a groundbreaking speech at Gettysburg, Pa. this past weekend, is for the most part truly astounding http://www.veteransnewsnow.com/2016/10/24/donald-trump-delivers-a-powerful-policy-speech-on-his-first-100-days-in-office/ . It is not less than revolutionary, because no US politician, let alone a Presidential candidate or President has said something for the most part so sensible as did Presidential candidate Trump. Summarizing, he promises bringing back overseas jobs, would prevent the continued outsourcing of the American production processes, bring order to the crime-ridden communities, he would seek friendly partnership with Russia, defusing the WWIII threat – and he would tackle, restrain and control the corrupt banking system, including the endless money-making machine, the privately owned, Rothschild dominated FED. – That is a challenge other Presidents have failed to master, including Lincoln and JFK. We know how they ended. 
Trump has already hinted that to revive the American economy the zero-interest policy may have to be changed, so that banks become more responsible. The owners off the system would hardly allow Trump’s interference in their obscene profit-making scheme. They’d rather at their calling let the bomb loose. A sudden change of this policy would hit many over-stretched banks like a bombshell – reminiscent of 2008 Lehman Brothers, just magnified by a factor of 10. There are currently at least three, possibly five Wall Street giants that are on the edge. They get by, because of the FED’s zero interest policy- and they make sure that this doesn’t change, as several if not all of them are part of the private FED system. Would Trump dare touching this system? – It’s a deadly challenge. He knows it. 
This time there may be more at stake then just another banking collapse, a planned emulation of the 2007 / 2008 crisis, where Wall Street was copiously rewarded for its excesses by tax-money bail-outs. Be aware, this time it would not be tax-payer’s money that would rescue the Too-Big-To Fail (TBTF) banks, but it would be YOUR money, your deposits, your savings, your pension funds, possibly even your shares if you have any in the bank being ‘collapsed’ – and the process would be called ‘bail-ins’. 
The (western) world is under the hegemon of a privately-owned money system, the US-dollar – and most people don’t even know it. The accent is on the western world , because the east, comprising Russia, China, the SCO countries (Shanghai Cooperation Organization – comprising China and Russia and most of the Central Asian former Soviet Republics, plus Iran and Pakistan – and others are waiting in the wings), the EEU (Eurasian Economic Union), as well as most of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), are forming their own eastern economic and monetary block. – I have said this before, but will repeat it for readers to realize – this ‘economic block’ – is largely, if not entirely, delinked from the dollar scheme. It consists of about half the world’s population and one third of the world’s GDP, a solid GDP that is. In contrast to the western, especially the US GDP; in the eastern block much of the GDP is based on real labor output and manufacturing. 
In reality, this eastern economic power block which is also displaying the world’s largest economic development potential, since history remembers, the New Silk Road – or the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) economic development scheme, stretching from Vladivostok to Lisbon (if Europe chooses to participate), does not need the west anymore. The OBOR project has already begun. It represents a view into the future, with job opportunities and the outlook for a truly better life for hundreds of millions, possibly billions of people during coming generations – a dynamic vision for the future. The east is where the future lays.——- 
Donald Trump as President notwithstanding, a new western well-planned banking collapse may start in the US, the ramifications and impact would be felt around the globe – sinking millions, hundreds of millions of people into poverty, misery, the like we haven’t seen in recent history. The banks ‘depositors’ money might not be enough. The reptiles are hungry. They might privatize public properties, infrastructures, roads, ports railways, health care, education, pensions, natural resources – anything that is still in the hands of the people. If Greece is a reminder, then think of Greece blown up by a factor of 1000 – all around the globe, touching in extremis the vulnerable people of the vulnerable countries – billions of people. While the money flows again from the poor to the rich, to an ever-shrinking pool of super-rich; widening the rich-poor gap to a disgusting yawn. Leaving the 99.99 % – by now the 99. % ever more powerless, having to fend for sheer survival – seeking refuge in ‘better lands’ – It’s a war by money. Canons, bombs and guns could rest – for a while. 
For years, I have felt the Empire will have to be brought down from inside – from the people who can’t take it anymore, from an internal revolt that eventually would break the worldwide extended monster’s back. Rome and most subsequent empires have fallen this way. It may still happen. But now I side more with The Saker’s theory, namely that the defeat may come from a combination of inside revolt and outside forces, not so much military forces, but economic forces. In theory, it could happen tomorrow. Just imagine, the one third of world-GDP-countries would drop all their dollar reserves, all the dollar denominated international contracts, all dollar issued trade agreements – and in particular, abandon at once the unwritten rule of hydrocarbons to be traded only in US-dollars. It would most likely wipe out the western economy. 
This will not happen, of course. Simply, because the One Third GDP holders do not want to destroy the economy of the rest of the world, especially the so-called developing and emerging countries, many – or most of them – eventually to become allies of this eastern block that promises peaceful co-existence rather than the current western pattern of ever multiplying wars and conflicts – a sheer dollar-fed killing spree, with destruction and weapons manufacturing no end. 
The Power of Money. Would Donald Trump, as President, himself a moneyed powerhouse, survive such a calamity? In fact, would he be able and strong enough to veer the ship around, guiding the world away from such destructive scenarios and towards peace and cooperation between East and West? – Or is the train already too far out of the station? – No telling at this time. The signals are certainly not good. But, let’s put in a grain of optimism and ‘bank’ on a positive strand of dynamics fueled by an increasing human consciousness – one that would not allow Hillary to push the Death Button.

By Jerri-Lynn Scofield, who has worked as a securities lawyer and a derivatives trader. She now spends most of her time in India and other parts of Asia researching a book about textile artisans. She also writes regularly about legal, political economy, and regulatory topics for various consulting clients and publications, as well as writes occasional travel pieces for The National . 
Since FBI Director James Comey’s bombshell announcement Friday that the bureau was reviewing new evidence regarding Hillary Clinton’s email tar baby, many questions have arisen– among the Naked Capitalism commentariat, as well as more widely– about the scope and details of the President’s pardoning powers. There are a few things to clear up right away, because I’ve seen a considerable amount of misinformation bandied about as to what the United States Constitution permits. Readers will please indulge me if in the interest of keeping this post short and sweet, I don’t debunk each and every wrong argument I’ve seen since Friday. If I responded to all the crazypants stuff out there– tempting as that might be– I’d never get to my main points. 
Article II, Section 2 of the United States Constitution says that the President “shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment …” 
So allow me to summarize the salient points. 
Absolute Power, Can Neither Be Reviewed nor Overturned As a Matter of Law 
The President’s pardoning power is absolute. Pardoning decisions are not subject to judicial review, nor can any individual pardon be overturned by an act of Congress. The pardoning power’s also unlimited as to offenses against the United States, so in theory, at least as a matter of law, a President could pardon someone for committing any offense against the United States ( I leave to one side the question of whether such an action would be politically possible). A President could also, at least in theory, pardon him or herself– for anything except in cases of impeachment. 
No Indictment Necessary 
It’s not necessary for someone to be charged or convicted of a crime against of the United States for the President to pardon that person. The most famous example of a President granting a pardon in a case where no indictment had been brought is President Gerald Ford’s September 1974 pardon of Richard Nixon shortly after he resigned the office of President. Allow me to quote at length from Proclamation 4311 Granting Pardon to Richard Nixon : 
Richard Nixon became the thirty-seventh President of the United States on January 20, 1969 and was reelected in 1972 for a second term by the electors of forty-nine of the fifty states. His term in office continued until his resignation on August 9, 1974. 
Pursuant to resolutions of the House of Representatives, its Committee on the Judiciary conducted an inquiry and investigation on the impeachment of the President extending over more than eight months. The hearings of the Committee and its deliberations, which received wide national publicity over television, radio, and in printed media, resulted in votes adverse to Richard Nixon on recommended Articles of Impeachment. 
As a result of certain acts or omissions occurring before his resignation from the Office of President, Richard Nixon has become liable to possible indictment and trial for offenses against the United States. Whether or not he shall be so prosecuted depends on findings of the appropriate grand jury and on the discretion of the authorized prosecutor. Should an indictment ensue, the accused shall then be entitled to a fair trial by an impartial jury, as guaranteed to every individual by the Constitution. 
It is believed that a trial of Richard Nixon, if it became necessary, could not fairly begin until a year or more has elapsed. In the meantime, the tranquility to which this nation has been restored by the events of recent weeks could be irreparably lost by the prospects of bringing to trial a former President of the United States. The prospects of such trial will cause prolonged and divisive debate over the propriety of exposing to further punishment and degradation a man who has already paid the unprecedented penalty of relinquishing the highest elective office of the United States. 
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GERALD R. FORD, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, pursuant to the pardon power conferred upon me by Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution, have granted and by these presents do grant a full, free, and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States which he, Richard Nixon, has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 20, 1969 through August 9, 1974…. 
What Can Congress Do? 
Article, section 4, of the US Constitution grants Congress the power to impeach any federal officeholder: 
The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors. 
Further, note that, Article I, Section 1, specifies: 
The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present. 
Judgment in Cases of Impeachments shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust, or Profit under the United States, but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment, and Punishment, according to Law. 
A few considerations to note here, even though an extended discussion of impeachment is beyond the scope of this post. First, impeachment is a political process, with the penalty (to reiterate from above) limited to “to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust, or Profit under the United States.” A party that has been convicted by the Senate in an impeachment proceeding “shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment, and Punishment, according to Law.” 
Second, although we’re all well aware of the history of impeachment proceedings and the presidency (e.g., involving Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Bill Clinton), Congress can actually pursue impeachment proceedings against all civil officers of the United States. And in fact, there’s a long common law tradition of such proceedings. I mention impeachment only in passing because such power lurks in the background, particularly in divided government situations– but I defer a more comprehensive discussion of impeachment issues in the current context until we know who has been elected President, and what the partisan composition of each house of Congress will be. 
What Will the Obamamometer Do? 
Back to the pardoning question. So, now that I’ve outlined the constitutional authority for pardoning, the main issue I wish to address is: What Will the Obamamometer do? 
On first glance, it’s obvious that a President who has been, at least to my mind, unduly concerned with his legacy, and who also fetishizes the concept of bipartisanship, would not want to touch the issue of pardoning Hillary Clinton with a barge pole. I should also point out that the Obamamometer has been an unusually timid politician, and has often articulated soaring rhetoric that’s never backed by bold action. In other words, all hat, not cattle. 
What the Obamamometer wil do, I believe, hinges on the outcome of the election. 
If Hillary Clinton Wins 
If Hillary wins next Tuesday, I believe the Obamamometer will not grant her a pardon, for the simple reason that she won’t ask for one. To accept a pardon from Obama would be tantamount to an admission of guilt for her email practices, the Clinton Foundation’s activities, , influence peddling, and pay-to-play, among other issues . 
Hillary Clinton as President can probably get away with foregoing a pardon, at least with respect to herself. After all, does anyone seriously believe that she will nominate candidates for high-level Department of Justice positions that will vigorously pursue investigations into her and hear activities prior to becoming President? I don’t think so. 
The more interesting question is whether she’ll be able to contain investigations that have already started and will no doubt draw in members of her inner circle. I’m going to put these questions aside for the time being– I promise readers I will revisit them if they’re not moot, after the election. But in the interests of keeping this post short, and confining its focus on the main question at hand– the Obamamometer’s options– I’m not going to delve further into these issues now. 
If Donald Trump Wins 
If Donald Trump wins, we’re in a completely different ballpark. 
Trump promised in the second debate to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton’s (alleged) corruption (although I think the Wikileaks revelations should dispense with the need to put in an alleged, even in parenthesis). I believe he will have to follow through on this pledge. His smart move would be to ask his Attorney General to appoint a special prosecutor– nominally a Democrat– who has extensive experience investigating complex financial frauds, misuse of information, and influence peddling. And if Hillary Clinton also understands this to be Trump’s next move, this would leave her in the market for a pardon. 
Now, there’s a lot of chatter out there that suggests the Clintons hate the Obamas and that the Obamas hate the Clintons. I’ve also heard it said that they’re all great pals. 
For the purposes of my argument, however, it really doesn’t matter one way or the other. I think Hillary will ask for a pardon, and the Obamamometer will grant it. It will be justified on the grounds that she’s suffered enough in losing the election, and that she’s been the subject of an unprecedented political vendetta. The Democratic nomenklatura laid the groundwork for this point in the immediate aftermath of the second debate, where Trump was lambasted for calling for appointing a special prosecutor, if he were elected, into Clinton’s activities. This pledge was taken as a beyond-the-pale statement of vindictiveness rather than as a logical follow-through to investigations launched during the administration of a President of the same party as the candidate, into serious allegations involving mishandling of classified information and other offences. And I might add, Comey’s late innings interjection should suggest that these investigations were neither comprehensively conducted, nor concluded. 
Given that Trump’s next move is fairly obvious, I predict that the Obamamometer’s is too. Hillary will seek, and he will grant, a pardon, while promoting the line that she’s suffered enough in not getting her turn to be President, and that further, she’s exposed to extreme vindictiveness from Team R. The unlikely outcome of a Trump victory will undoubtedly shake up the political, economic and cultural elite. It will trigger widespread concern that they might have to pay for their past sins. In order to forestall the possibility that punishment will indeed be meted out to fit crimes, wagons will be circled. The Obamamometer covets a reserved place at the top table, and to attain that, will have to deliver on a solution, and protect poor Hillary. Otherwise, no more summers on the Vineyard. 
The more interesting question is how far the Obamamometer’s pardoning power will extend: will he provide get-out-of-jail free cards to Huma Abedin, John Podesta, Doug Brand, Cheryl Mills, any other Clinton minions, even the Big Dog himself? (I do of course realize Bill is probably untouchable). I don’t think so. Because although I have and will continue to criticize the Obamamometer for being politically timid– not to mention intellectually not all he’s been touted as being– I don’t think he’s personally corrupt in the narrow influence peddling sense. So let’s hope he takes the legacy stuff seriously enough to hold the line at a tightly-drawn pardon for Hillary only, in the unlikely event Trump wins next week. 
As for the broader political issues– what Congress will do to address these issues– these will depend on the election results. Again, I defer further analysis until we see the election returns.",0
17255,"GRAND SLAM! After Hearing FBI Reopened Her Case, Trey Gowdy Gives Hillary EXACTLY What… | EndingFed News Network","Email Print One of my top candidates for Attorney General just gave Hillary Clinton a little truth bomb for dinner. While appearing with Megyn Kelly and discussing the reopening of the FBI investigation against Hillary Clinton, Gowdy said Hillary’s attitude and defensiveness is “…just too rich.” In essence, she is getting exactly what she deserves… Gowdy stated something I commented on earlier in the day, stating, “The same person who went to great lengths to make sure that these emails were private now, all of a sudden, wants it all made public.” This is grandstanding by Hillary, nothing more. As an attorney, and as Secretary of State, Hillary knows the FBI CAN NOT release any information about an ongoing investigation. She also knows that due to the complexity of the case, it could take months before We the People hear anything from the FBI about this investigation. This is nothing Comey is doing to hurt her in the campaign or any type of conspiracy, this is just how the system works. The arrogance of Clinton is now demanding we get that information immediately, which would mean expediting her case and devoting thousands of extra man hours, probably all overtime, at tax payers expense! That, my friends, is what we would call privilege. And I don’t want to hear her argument that because she is running for president she is entitled because We the People were also supposed to be entitled to a Secretary of State that was not corrupt! Hilary wrote this narrative on her own. She decided to use a private server for government communications, something NOBODY else in our government was doing or was allowed to do. She broke the rules, and now that there is an attempt to hold her accountable for it, she wants exceptions. Gowdy is right, this is rich, because if Hillary had simply followed the rules, she would not be in this mess in the first place! But, then again, there is a reason we have jails… because criminals never follow the rules! And Mr. Gowdy, if Hillary truly gets what she deserves, her address will be changed to one of those prisons very soon!

The South African Tourism office in the United States has created a   travel initiative of nine trips to entice aspiring travelers to visit the country.

17259,Indiana Economy Offers Caution and Inspiration as Primary Nears - The New York Times,"INDIANAPOLIS  —   As the presidential race came to Indiana, candidates of both parties seized on a fresh example in this industrial state of factory jobs being shipped abroad. “Is anyone here from Carrier?” Donald J. Trump called out in Evansville, Ind. last week, referring to the Carrier Corporation’s closing of factories that make heating and   units. “They let go of 1, 400 people to move to Mexico,” Mr. Trump said. “And you know what? They have to pay a consequence. ” At a union rally the next day at the State Capitol, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont thundered a message to the chief executive of United Technologies, Carrier’s parent company. “Stop the greed,” he shouted. “Stop destroying the middle class in America! Respect your workers!” The picture of manufacturing decline and   retreat has become a driving narrative of the presidential race, spawning economic populism on both the left and the right. Yet Indiana, which holds its primary on Tuesday, defies an easy picture of Rust Belt decline. By many measures, the state is humming economically, offering a contrarian reality to the gloomy scenario that the presidential candidates are presenting to motivate voters. With nearly one in five jobs in manufacturing, the highest share of any state, Indiana’s gross domestic product is accelerating faster than any of its Great Lakes neighbors, according to the latest figures from the Commerce Department. Unemployment at the end of last year was 4. 4 percent, below the national average of about  5 percent. Even though the figure has ticked up in 2016, economists attribute the increase to the large number of people returning to the work force, including job seekers moving to Indiana. Factories in heavily industrial Elkhart County, a center of recreational vehicle manufacturing where unemployment has been significantly reduced, have resorted to calling a homeless shelter to look for workers. The Indianapolis region is growing faster than Chicago, Cleveland or Detroit, and personal income statewide rose 3. 6 percent last year, faster than the national average. “The economy here in terms of the data is as good as it’s been in a generation,” said Michael J. Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind. Mr. Hicks said that if measured by the value of goods produced, manufacturing has never been stronger in Indiana. The boom in the auto industry has played a big role in this because of the many parts factories in the state. Factory jobs have declined, he added, but not because of trade deals with other countries as Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders assert, but because Indiana factories are increasingly efficient and fewer workers are needed. “Manufacturing employment peaked in 1973,” he said, adding that since then the productivity of Indiana factory workers has climbed 250 percent. “We need far fewer workers, and a very different type of worker, too. ” In Warsaw, Ind. for example, a global center for manufacturing orthopedic devices, the workers are highly specialized. Despite increases in productivity, wages have stagnated in step with national trends, feeding widespread anxiety about the future. Candidates in both parties have channeled these fears at targets ranging from immigration to trade deals to the government. And Indiana economists point to pockets of weakness within the state. Like other Midwestern states, Indiana’s rural counties are emptying: Of the state’s 92 counties, 54 lost population in 2015, according to the Business Research Center at Indiana University. “Connersville in Fayette County, which was once called Little Detroit, they had close to 2, 000 manufacturing jobs and now are down to about 400,” said Timothy Slaper, an economist at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business. Patti and Richard Schwalm, owners of a machine shop in rural Henry County, an hour’s drive east of Indianapolis, said they had to cut their staff to three employees in recent years. They blamed President Obama for hurting the manufacturers that are their clients. The Schwalms plan to vote for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the Republican primary. Pressed for details about Obama administration policies that hurt manufacturing, Ms. Schwalm acknowledged, “The problems we have are 50 years in the making. ” Todd Witte, who works in a factory in Fort Wayne, Ind. plans to vote on Tuesday for Mr. Sanders because of the senator’s opposition to trade deals and his history of walking union picket lines. If Mr. Sanders is not the Democratic nominee, Mr. Witte said, he will probably vote for Mr. Trump if he is nominated. “I like his views on the Second Amendment,” he said. “In our local, they’re either Bernie Sanders or Trump supporters. ” Mr. Witte was in attendance on Friday when Mr. Sanders addressed members of his union, the United Steelworkers, who were protesting the Carrier layoffs. Even as Mr. Sanders delivered a   speech about the cost of trade deals, many union members in the crowd who did not work for Carrier said they were personally doing fine. Mr. Witte’s plant, owned by Dana Holding Corporation, plans to grow to 900 hourly workers from 535 in the next few years, according to Tom Herendeen, president of the United Steelworkers Local 903, who also attended the rally. “We’re doing great,” he said. “We have a lot of new business coming in. ” Carrier’s decision to lay off 2, 100 workers at two factories gained national attention in February when a video of an executive icily delivering the news to workers generated more 3. 5 million views. Mr. Trump took to criticizing the company and threatening high tariffs that he promised would force Carrier to reverse itself. “They’re going to call me and say, ‘Mr. President, Carrier has decided to stay in Indiana,’” he told the crowd. His protectionist policies, which go against decades of Republican orthodoxy, have brought the issue of trade and its potential costs to workers to the fore of the presidential race. Hillary Clinton has backed off her earlier support of the   Partnership deal, and during a visit here she vowed to take on China for dumping steel. Because the loss of manufacturing jobs has many factors and predates the latest international trade deals and the rise of China, economists say that steep new tariffs, such as those promised by Mr. Trump, will not restore jobs. Mr. Hicks, the Ball State economist, predicted that Indiana will have 125, 000 new openings in manufacturing jobs, in part because of retirements, each year in the next decade. “By way of comparison,” he wrote in a blog post, “we will only have 70, 000 high school graduates per year. ”",0
17260,"Hillary Clinton, at Site of Lincoln Speech, Laments G.O.P.’s Turn to Donald Trump - The New York Times","SPRINGFIELD, Ill.  —   On the grounds of the Old State Capitol here, where nearly 160 years ago, Abraham Lincoln held forth on “a house divided,” Hillary Clinton on Wednesday lamented the Party of Lincoln’s transition to the Party of Trump, casting the present moment as an indelible stain on Republican history. Yet even as she savaged Donald J. Trump as an existential threat to American democracy, a week before Republicans plan to nominate him for president in Cleveland, Mrs. Clinton set off on a delicate balancing act of her own. She waded with care into the thickets of national reckonings over police violence and violence against the police, hoping to position herself as an unlikely agent of harmony. And in an uncharacteristic admission, Mrs. Clinton assumed responsibility for at least a small measure of the fractiousness in the national discourse. “I cannot stand here and claim that my words and actions haven’t sometimes fueled the partisanship that often stands in the way of our progress,” she told a small audience that crowded beneath a grand ceiling here. “So I recognize I have to do better, too. ” Though Mrs. Clinton has for weeks stressed unity as the binding theme of her campaign  —   making speeches in front of “Stronger Together” signs  —   the staging on Wednesday was particularly unsubtle. She immediately invoked President Lincoln, quoting from his speech on June 16, 1858. She spoke slowly and sternly, as if narrating a documentary, railing against a litany of national hardships: gun violence, economic inequality, an overreliance on the police to remedy societal ills. She suggested reassuringly that America had overcome much more than its recent pain and political fury. “The challenges we face today do not approach those of Lincoln’s time. Not even close,” she said. “But recent events have left people across America asking hard questions about whether we are still a house divided. ” For a candidate not known for soaring oratory, and often not especially comfortable pursuing it, the venue was something of a risky choice, inviting comparisons to some of the most stirring speakers in American history. Nearly a century and a half after Lincoln condemned slavery here, Senator Barack Obama stood before the Capitol in February 2007 to announce his bid for president. Mrs. Clinton’s aides had billed this speech as a major address, hoping to build on remarks last week before black clergy members in Philadelphia, when she urged white Americans to “do a better job of listening when   talk. ” She did touch on the deaths of black men in Louisiana and in Minnesota, and the deaths of five police officers in Dallas, reciting all of their names. She also cited the deaths of five Latinos in     episodeslast week. But during her   remarks, Mrs. Clinton trained her attention largely on Mr. Trump, whose campaign she called “as divisive as any we have seen in our lifetimes. ” In perhaps her most zealous flourish, she noted that Mr. Trump had suggested Tuesday night that he could relate to systemic bias against black Americans because “even against me, the system is rigged. ” “Even this, the killing of black people by police, is somehow about him,” Mrs. Clinton said. As the Republican Party prepares to nominate Mr. Trump next week, Mrs. Clinton seemed inclined to highlight the consequences of that choice at every opportunity. She mocked Mr. Trump’s reference last week to “Article 12” of the Constitution, which does not exist, and wondered about giving him access to the levers of power. “Imagine if he had not just Twitter and cable news to go after his critics and opponents, but also the I. R. S.  —   or for that matter, our entire military,” she said. As she moves to portray Mr. Trump as a purveyor of national chaos, Mrs. Clinton is also seeking to bridge a divide in her own party. Her campaign is hopeful that the   endorsement from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on Tuesday will help bring Democrats together in earnest before the party’s convention in Philadelphia in two weeks. Implicit in her comments on Wednesday was a plea for empathy, even for political opponents  —   a striking gesture from Mrs. Clinton, who has long inspired intense partisan passions and was criticized last year for saying in a debate that Republicans were the “enemy” she was proudest to have made. “Let’s put ourselves in the shoes of Donald Trump’s supporters,” said Mrs. Clinton, who speaks often of her family’s   roots. (Her father owned a small drapery business in Chicago.) “We may disagree on the causes and the solutions to the challenges we face,” she continued, “but I believe, like anyone else, they’re trying to figure out their place in a   America. ” Wrapping up, Mrs. Clinton strayed from her prepared text to describe a song from the musical “Hamilton,” which she saw for the third time on Tuesday, telling the crowd that history had its eyes on how Americans respond to this moment. Then she quoted Lincoln once more. “If we do the work, we will ‘cease to be divided,’” she said. “We, in fact, will be indivisible  —   with liberty and justice for all. And we will remain  —   in President Lincoln’s words  —   the last, best hope of earth. ”",0

He is perhaps the greatest basketball player of all time, certainly of the current era, and he’s with her. 
Cleveland’s LeBron James has announced that he will be stumping for Hillary when she makes a stop in the crucial city in one of the most hotly contested battleground states in the country. James and Clinton will appear together at a get-out-the-vote rally at the Public Auditorium in Cleveland, Ohio in the late afternoon. This will be James’s first appearance with Clinton. In fact, a source says, the two have never met. James – a hero to many Ohio sports fans, especially in the African American community – could prove helpful to Clinton’s effort to win the state’s 18 electoral votes. While Clinton is handily beating Donald Trump among African American voters, she is struggling to gin up enthusiasm. According to the 2010 census, 53 percent of Clevelanders are African American. 
The stakes could not be higher. If Clinton can win Ohio, there is almost no scenario in which Trump can win. If Ohio goes for Trump, then he has a real shot of becoming president. As Ohio’s biggest star (sorry, John Kasich), James has a lot of power to motivate people to get out and vote. It could be a difference-maker in a tight election. 
James’ decision to stump with Hillary comes after other big-name celebrities publicly expressed their support for her campaign. Just days ago, musical power couple Beyonce and Jay Z held a concert in support of Clinton. The star power has spooked Trump’s campaign, as evidenced by the fact that they are claiming the celebrities backing Hillary give her an “unfair” advantage. Trump, a man who once okay’d a DJ calling his daughter a “piece of ass” and who bragged about grabbing women “by the pussy,” went so far as to lament the language used in some of Jay Z’s songs. 
“He used every word in the book last night,” Trump said. “He used language last night that was so bad and then Hillary said, ‘I did not like Donald Trump’s lewd language.’ My lewd language. I tell you what, I’ve never said what he said in my life.” 
Eye roll. 
Meanwhile, in related news, Trump will be campaigning with his own star power tonight. The cream of the crop. The best of the best. The A-lister…Ted Nugent. A man who once “ joked ” about shooting Hillary Clinton with a machine gun. 
“Obama, he’s a piece of shit. I told him to suck on my machine gun. Hey Hillary,” he continued. “You might want to ride one of these into the sunset, you worthless bitch.” 
Yeah, Trump sure seems concerned about what language musicians use.

17263,VIDEO: Trump’s Hollywood Star Smashed by Lunatic with Sledgehammer,"We Are Change 
A man posing as a construction worker destroyed Donald Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a pickaxe and a sledgehammer early Wednesday morning, as bystanders stopped and watched.
The vandalism was captured on video shortly before 6 a.m. The star, Trump’s name, and the camera icon sitting in the center were all destroyed. The cost of the damage is estimated to be around $2,500. 
The vandal identified himself as “Jamie Otis,” to Deadline Hollywood, and explained that he was planning to “extract the star to auction it off and raise funds” for the women who have accused Trump of being sexually inappropriate. He chatted casually with a person who filmed the incident on his cellphone. 
By the time that police arrived, the man had already left. He is described as a white male, and left behind the pick, sledgehammer, a construction hat, and vest, USA Today reports. 
“We’re reviewing surveillance footage from local businesses and when the case is completed, it will be submitted to the district attorney for filing of a felony vandalism charge,” Officer Norma Eisenman told USA Today. 
The star was dedicated in 2007, and sat at 6801 Hollywood Blvd. by the Dolby Theatre — across the street from the busy Hollywood & Highland shopping and entertainment center. The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce has said in a statement that Trump’s star will be replaced immediately, and work has already began on it — though it will have to sit for a couple of days before it can be polished. 
“When people are unhappy with one of our honorees, we would hope that they would project their anger in more positive ways than to vandalize a California state landmark,” Hollywood Chamber of Commerce president and CEO Leron Gubler said. “Our democracy is based on respect for the law. People can make a difference by voting and not destroying public property.” 
Gubler added that they intend to prosecute the vandal to the fullest extent of the law when he is located. 
The star has been a target of vandalism throughout the election season, by people repeatedly spray painting it — and even defecating on it. 
In February, the star was defaced with a large black swastika.

17264,Gunman Stages Deadly Attack on Police Station in Kazakhstan - The New York Times,"MOSCOW  —   A gunman stormed a police station on Monday in Almaty, the largest city in Kazakhstan, and killed three officers and two civilians in an attack attributed to radical Islamist motivations. The attack elevated concerns about the spread of terrorism in former Soviet Central Asia as an oil bust ripples through regional economies and the Islamic State’s footprint expands. The police in Almaty said the attacker wrested a rifle from a guard at a police station, wounded him and then used the weapon to kill three police officers. As the battle raged, the gunman shot and killed one of the two civilian victims before hijacking his Toyota Corolla. He was later caught by the police and taken into custody. Early on Monday, officers said that two men had attacked the police station. But later, in a clarification, they said that the second suspect was in fact a hostage  —   a taxi driver who had been forced to drive the gunman to the scene of the attack. Tass, the Russian news agency, reported that more than a dozen other people were wounded, and a local news portal said seven police officers were in intensive care with gunshot wounds. The authorities alternatively described the rampage as the work of criminals on the run after killing a woman over the weekend, or of Islamic radicals  —   though the two theories are not mutually exclusive. On Monday evening, President Nursultan Nazarbayev called the shooting a terrorist attack. Security officials said the suspect, a    resident of   western Kazakhstan, had converted to fundamentalist Salafi Islam while serving a prison term for robbery. Kazakhstan, an oil producer with major investments from Chevron and Exxon, has been a bastion of stability for most of the   period. But the oil price collapse and subsequent devaluation of the currency is straining the government. Last month, security forces killed two dozen attackers identified as sympathizers of the Islamic State in the northwestern town of Aktobe after the militants stole guns from sporting goods stores and attacked the police and a national guard base.",0
17265,A New Debate Over Pricing the Risks of Climate Change - The New York Times,"Some companies, including Exxon Mobil, say the economics of climate change are too hard to predict for them to give investors hard numbers about the business impact of global warming. Federal regulators may disagree and are considering requiring Exxon to do just that for the value of its oil reserves. Now a   legislative effort by a Florida congressman to prevent such a move by the federal government has become an unexpected flash point in the battle over disclosing   risks  —   with potentially hundreds of billions of dollars in the balance. The congressional measure, an amendment to an appropriations bill, originally introduced in July by Representative Bill Posey, a Florida Republican, has been picked up in the Senate version of the legislation. Because the bill is tied up in a partisan debate over spending, there is no certainty the amendment will pass. But at a time when many Republicans dispute the very notion of climate change, the Posey measure has focused the debate over whether it is reasonable  —   or even possible  —   to expect companies to put a price tag on the environmental impact of climate change. Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, has called climate change “a hoax” and promises to slash environmental regulations to bolster economic growth. The issue is not limited to Exxon and oil companies. The Posey amendment would allow real estate companies to stay mum on the risks posed to waterfront properties by rising seas, for example, and let food companies leave the impact of future water shortages unaddressed. “Whether it’s oil, apparel, clothing, utility  —   almost everything in our economy is built off of some use of natural resources, and the risks they face are substantial,” said Mindy S. Lubber, president of Ceres, a nonprofit organization that works with some of the world’s largest investors on climate change issues. But some companies, including Exxon, contend that the economics of climate change are unpredictable and that global growth will continue to create demand for resources, making it even more difficult to come up with hard numbers. Representative Posey is among those who say the federal government has no business forcing businesses to try. He accuses the financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, of pursuing a political agenda by pressing companies to quantify climate risks. “These politically motivated and mandated disclosures are not about protecting investors, they are about shaming companies, or at least attempting to shame companies, into adopting their agenda,” he said in July. “It is a waste of resources for the companies, for their shareholders, and for the S. E. C. ,” said Mr. Posey, who has accepted donations from oil and gas companies. George Cecala, a spokesman for Mr. Posey, did not respond to requests for further comment. Advocates of fuller corporate disclosure say the sums at stake are vast. Even under a plan that would limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius  —   a goal agreed to as part of the Paris deal  —   climate change could wipe out $1. 7 trillion of global financial assets, according to a   study published earlier this year in the journal Nature. “How could anybody tell the S. E. C. to ignore the climate?” Ms. Lubber of Ceres said. The issue has been for investors, corporate executives and environmental leaders gathered in New York this week for Climate Week, an annual showcase tied to the opening of the United Nations General Assembly. Discussions here have been galvanized by news that more than 20 world leaders had ratified the Paris climate accord on Wednesday, all but ensuring that the agreement will be adopted by the end of the year. And Exxon’s acknowledgment that the S. E. C. was asking about its   accounting gave further hope to proponents of fuller disclosure. Already, a shift in the global energy landscape, brought on partly by a surge in drilling in United States oil and gas shale fields, has brought about a slump in fuel prices, calling into question the viability of future oil projects in   places like the Arctic and deepwater oceans. And scientists estimate that as much as   of the world’s coal, oil and gas reserves must remain in the ground if the world has a shot at keeping carbon emissions under levels set by the Paris climate accord  —   unless there is a technological breakthrough in capturing carbon and keeping it out of the atmosphere. Exxon and its American oil industry peers have been reluctant to estimate the risks to their balance sheets. That contrasts with oil companies in Europe, which have been writing down the value of their assets over the last two years as oil prices plummeted. Energy experts say that is largely because international financial reporting standards require more detailed reporting on asset valuations than the standards in the United States. Last year, Statoil, the Norwegian oil giant, wrote down the value of its North American shale and oil sands assets by $4 billion. Royal Dutch Shell reported a   of more than $8 billion. “The rules are different, the relationships between the companies and governments are different, and Europe has clearer carbon policies,” said Michael Webber, associate director of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin. Exxon Mobil, which has accumulated assets over decades, has long argued that its executives take a long view that includes periods of both low and high commodity prices that swing as a matter of normal course. In its filings to the S. E. C. Exxon Mobil has reported that it has   its major assets and expects that future cash flow could sustain even its most economically challenged oil and gas fields. The company has conceded that a future   of assets is possible if its projections change. Still, most oil companies, including Exxon Mobil, predict that oil and natural gas prices will recover over the next few years and that demand for those fossil fuels will continue to increase along with growing populations and middle classes in emerging markets. The companies also say that projections are difficult without knowing what future   regulations will entail, or how new technologies might help curtail greenhouse gas emissions. “This is like being blindfolded, shooting in the dark at a moving target,” said Fadel Gheit, a senior energy analyst at Oppenheimer  Company. The one certainty is that the United States oil industry is already under severe financial pressure. Last year, American petroleum producers wrote down $177 billion in assets, according to a recent report by IHS Energy. Exxon Mobil is in far better financial condition than most other companies in the industry. But this year the company, stretched by debt, lost its   AAA credit rating. And while the fossil fuel companies may face the biggest climate change risks, the need for financial disclosure stretches to other industries, said Mark Campanale, founder and executive director at Carbon Tracker, a financial think tank that focuses on energy and climate change. “Banks are lending to fossil fuel projects, and ports and railroads are being built to handle coal, and that’s not viable,” Mr. Campanale said. “We’re talking about a highly disruptive transition, and companies aren’t properly disclosing what that transition will look like. ” Efforts are now afoot to set   standards for disclosing climate change risks, most notably by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, a nonprofit group whose chairman is Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor. The board estimates that there are significant climate risks for most companies it tracks, which represent $27. 5 trillion, or 93 percent, of United States stocks as measured by market value. Some companies have led the way with disclosure. The global agriculture giant Adecoagro, in an April 2015 S. E. C. filing, reported that drought had reduced yields for its corn and soybean harvest by as much as 31 percent, and warned that “the occurrence of severe adverse weather conditions, especially droughts, hail, floods or frost or diseases are unpredictable and may have a potentially devastating impact” on future agricultural production. Jean Rogers, chief executive of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, says more companies should acknowledge the threat. “Climate risk is the most ubiquitous risk out there,” Ms. Rogers said. “There’s no excuse anymore. We know what the risks are, industry by industry. ”",0
17266,Oscars Ratings Hit 9-Year-Low in Early Numbers,"Ratings for the 89th annual Academy Awards slid for a second consecutive year as a slew of wins for   La La Land, a shock Best Picture win for Moonlight and a game host in Jimmy Kimmel couldn’t move the needle this year. [According to Deadline, the   49 minute Oscar broadcast on ABC averaged a 22.  in metered market results, in the “early” numbers, marking a    for the show.  The Hollywood Reporter notes that figure is down around four percent from last year’s telecast, which drew a 23. 4 rating in the early numbers. Last year’s broadcast ultimately drew 34. 4 million viewers, enough to make it the third   Oscars ever, so the lower initial numbers could mean this year’s broadcast drew even less total viewers. Sunday night’s ceremony featured plenty of   Trump jokes from host Jimmy Kimmel, political statements from some of the honorees and presenters and one major upset. At the tail end of the nearly    show, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway mistakenly named La La Land the winner of the night’s biggest award, when Moonlight had actually won. La La producer Jordan Horowitz paused midway through his acceptance speech to announce that a mistake had been made and called the cast and producers of Moonlight to the stage to hand them his Oscar. ’La La Land’ producer: ”There’s a mistake. ’Moonlight’ you guys won Best Picture. This is not a joke.” #Oscars pic. twitter.   —   Hollywood Reporter (@THR) February 27, 2017,  The night also featured fiery political speeches from Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi, who blasted Trump’s proposed temporary immigration ban in his acceptance speech for Best Foreign Language Film, and from Mexican actor Gael Garcia Bernal, who criticized Trump’s proposal to build a wall on the U. S.  border. As for the awards: Casey Affleck (Manchester by the Sea) took home the Best Actor prize while Emma Stone (La La Land) won Best Actress. Mahershala Ali (Moonlight) won Best Supporting Actor and Viola Davis (Fences) won Best Supporting Actress. Damien Chazelle (La La Land) won Best Director, and the musical also picked up awards for Best Original Score, Best Original Song and Best Cinematography.

Trump weighed in on the CORRUPTION FIASCO created and perpetuated by the FBI. 
Comey, the DISGRACED FBI director, re-opened the email investigation into Hillary Clinton’s CRIMINAL mishandling of classified emails after finding 650K NEW emails on Anthony Weiner’s computer that were “directly tied” to Hillary’s case. 
As Hillary began TANKING in the polls, Comey came out and said, “Oh, whoops, nothing to see here, Hillary’s fine, no charges!” 
Now, how the hell do you go through 650K emails in 8 days, when previously it took the FBI over a YEAR to go through 53k? 
It doesn’t happen. 
We all know that the RIGGED SYSTEM which Hillary used to STEAL the primary is the SAME RIGGED SYSTEM she uses to keep her out of jail. 
There are countless GOOD people rotting away in prison for doing a TINY FRACTION of what Hillary did. 
How is that fair? 
In addition, we just learned that Hillary Clinton had her MAID printing off classified documents for her. 
That’s right, he MAID, for the love of god. 
Also, the FBI says that at least 5 foreign countries hacked her system. 
…and this criminal-harpy is running for president? 
No. Over 80% of Americans believe Hillary is GUILTY. 
SAY NO to this vile crap, AMERICA. 
From Politico: 
Reacting to news that the FBI won’t change its determination in the Hillary Clinton email probe, Republican nominee Donald Trump made it clear he still regards her as guilty and is convinced she will ultimately face justice. 
“You can’t review 650,000 emails in eight days,” Trump said Sunday in an appearance at the Freedom Hill Amphitheater. “You can’t do it folks. Hillary Clinton is guilty.”

17269,Exclusive—Regnery: Why Law Enforcement Will Like Justice Neil Gorsuch - Breitbart,"Assuming Senate Democrats cannot torpedo his confirmation, Neil Gorsuch will be a welcome addition to a   Supreme Court often divided over questions of policing, law enforcement, and criminal justice. [The Court’s four liberals —  Justices Ginsberg, Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan too often think of themselves as super legislators rather than judges when they do their opinions reflect their personal proclivities rather than the strict letter of the law. Not so Neil Gorsuch, who prides himself on deciding cases based on the law rather than the outcome he would prefer. In his remarks at the White House, when President Trump nominated him, he said that “A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands. ”  Gorsuch may not have been accusing the four SCOTUS liberals of being bad judges —  he is too polite to do that —  but his remarks set him far apart from the ideal liberal judge, who cares little about what the law says, but instead cares a lot about the outcome and its impact on his favorite issues and perceived victims. Liberals’ view of judging was confirmed in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee released this week, when some 100 liberal organizations predictably demanded that Gorsuch not be confirmed because he is not sufficiently sympathetic to “workers’ rights, immigration, women’s health, LGBT rights, police misconduct, students with disabilities, corporate bias, money in politics, environmental protection and voting rights. ” Which is exactly Gorsuch’s point: treat everybody equally under the law, regardless of who they are, and don’t go beyond what the written law provides. A review of opinions Gorsuch as written or joined while on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, together with speeches he has given, indicates that as a Supreme Court justice, he would likely be admired by the law enforcement community. Not because he is “ ” or “  offender,” but because he would be “ . ” In other words, law enforcement will likely approve of his jurisprudence more for what he is not than what he is —  and what he is not is why the liberals don’t think he should be confirmed. That is, he rules predictably, according to the law, rather than trying to favor those the liberals think need an advocate. That is also not to say that he will be a   inalterably strident         justice. His Tenth Circuit opinions include cases where he ruled in favor of police officers, and cases where he ruled against them who, for whatever reason, deserved being ruled against. First, Gorsuch believes that there are far too many laws —  5, 000 or so “with hundreds of new statutory crimes inked every few years,” as he told the Federalist Society in 2013, which, he said “does not begin to count the thousands of additional regulatory crimes buried in the federal register. There are so many crimes cowled in the numbering fine print of those pages that scholars actually debate their number. ” Reform of the criminal code is a job for Congress, not the Court, but intelligent critique from a thoughtful Justice might inspire somebody on the Hill to get started with the project. Gorsuch’s critique of the criminal justice system seems confined to the above point rather than the left’s view that the system is laden with racism and that the police tend to disproportionately arrest minorities, the poor and minor drug offenders, resulting in what liberals refer to as “mass incarceration. ” It is on this point that the left will focus its opposition to his confirmation, among others. In an early critique of his record, for example, People for the American Way wrote that “at a time when the abuses of our criminal justice system are becoming a national crisis, we cannot confirm a justice who does not understand the role of the Supreme Court to protect the most vulnerable among us. ” Gorsuch may be bad news for People for the American Way, but he is good news for law enforcement. Second, Gorsuch has a solid record on    cases, an issue often addressed by the courts he generally, but not always, takes a   enforcement position. In a 2013 case, he sided in the majority in a   split, finding the use of a Taser resulting in the death of an offender was a reasonable use of force under the circumstances. In an earlier case, in 2006, Gorsuch, in a dissent in an en banc civil    case against an officer, in which he was joined by four other judges, asked whether any use of force, no matter how slight, might result in a finding that the force was excessive. But by no means did he always rule on the side of the police —  in at least two other cases, he found the use of force was excessive and that the officers in question were not entitled to qualified immunity. In another   case involving a   kid who kept his class amused by forcing air into his stomach and producing loud burps —  much to the annoyance of his teacher —  Gorsuch dissented from the ruling, finding the police were immune from a civil suit when they arrested and detained him, writing that the teacher went overboard by failing to properly discipline the child and had him arrested by police. A 2012 case is a good indicator of Gorsuch’s strong conviction that criminal laws should not be interpreted in such a way as to jeopardize innocent conduct, just because that conduct can be squeezed between the words of a statute. The case in question involved a felon charged with possessing a gun in violation of a statute which prohibits the “knowing” possession of a firearm by a felon. Gorsuch, in his opinion, reminds us that plenty of minor crimes may technically involve felony convictions even if no jail time is included, so that the convicted defendant may not know he was guilty of a felony. “There can be fewer graver injustices,” wrote Gorsuch, “in a society governed by the rule of law than imprisoning a man without requiring proof of his guilt under the written laws of the land. Yet that is what Capps (the precedent relied on by the prosecutor) permits, excusing the government from proving an essential element of the crime Congress recognized. ” Even if Gorsuch’s narrow reading of the criminal law is sometimes more favorable to the criminal defendant than the prosecutor, those in the criminal justice and law enforcement communities will find his approach a refreshing, and consistent, change from the liberal view that the law should be read more as the judge wishes it had been written, or even by finding some obscure reasoning in the legislative history, or a comment from a member of the legislature that enacted it, giving it a broader interpretation than the written words.",0

He reminded the crowd that he once served as a career prosecutor in the Justice Department, a department that was “blind” and “independent,” and he believed that nobody was above the law. “I miss President Obama right now,” Perez said, claiming that Obama understood the importance of the department’s independence.

17271,"Obama Understood the Power of Art. And He Wanted You to Get It, Too. - The New York Times","Anyone inclined to find joy when a president’s taste collides with yours had a lot to choose from with Barack Obama. There was the time he dropped by the Los Angeles garage where the comedian Marc Maron records his podcast or when he sat between the two ferns where Zach Galifianakis pretends to be a boob hosting a talk show. At the 2015 White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner, he did a bit with   Key as Luther, Mr. Obama’s fictional but legitimately irate “anger translator” from “Key  Peele. ” He called Kanye West a jackass, invited   Miranda to the White House Poetry Jam to perform a song from “Hamilton” before “Hamilton” was even a thing, and, for two straight years, dropped   thoroughly convincing Spotify playlists. That doesn’t even include the New York Review of Books conversation (in two parts!) between him and the novelist Marilynne Robinson. They talked about   …     about   …     well it’s just sobering and oracular, and you should read it. But of all the culture Barack Obama has been a part of, inspired, commented on or cultivated, of all the ways in which the culture seemed to evolve around  —   and unconsciously respond to  —   him, the thing that says so much about his unprecedented relationship to art and popular culture is actually, in the vast scheme of things, just a footnote. Which is to say it’s pretty small yet so illustrative of his sense of respect, professionalism and awe. It was the time he was emailed for a quote. The occasion was the 2015 Kennedy Center Honors. The inductees included Carole King, who sat in the balcony between her fellow inductee George Lucas and the first couple. And during Ms. King’s tribute, out came Aretha Franklin, who sat at a piano in a   fur coat and sang “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,” the classic Ms. King wrote, and Ms. Franklin released in 1967. Her appearance was pretty much expected. The shock was how powerfully good, at 73, Ms. Franklin sounded  —   so good that you worried ecstasy would send Ms. King toppling off the balcony, so good that Mr. Obama wiped tears from his eyes. For a critical profile of Ms. Franklin in The New Yorker, its editor, David Remnick, reached out to the president. As a critic, I feel a duty to point out that that’s an unusual move. Mr. Remnick is also, among other things, a critic. He knows Ms. Franklin’s worth as an American treasure and that it has no price. He’s more than equipped to sum her up. But he outsourced that job. To the president of the United States. And if you got to that section of that story and considered rolling your eyes (“When I emailed President Obama about Aretha Franklin and that night   …    ”) you immediately retreated when you read what Mr. Obama wrote in response. “Nobody embodies more fully the connection between the   spiritual, the blues, R.  B. rock and roll  —   the way that hardship and sorrow were transformed into something full of beauty and vitality and hope,” he wrote back, through his press secretary. “American history wells up when Aretha sings. That’s why, when she sits down at a piano and sings ‘A Natural Woman,’ she can move me to tears  —   the same way that Ray Charles’s version of ‘America the Beautiful’ will always be in my view the most patriotic piece of music ever performed  —   because it captures the fullness of the American experience, the view from the bottom as well as the top, the good and the bad, and the possibility of synthesis, reconciliation, transcendence. ” Mr. Remnick wrote to him because he knew that Barack Obama would deliver. Mr. Remnick asked for two cents. The president gave him a dollar. Mr. Obama, for nearly all of his tenure, was fully aware of, interested in, and knowledgeable about popular culture, even as it grew impossible to take it all in. He tried: sports, movies, television, the internet, music, books. He was protean and catholic. He was thoughtful and   cool and yet far from it. He was a version of America’s dad and the dad some kids wished theirs could be: fit for world leadership, fit for a sitcom. Lots of smart people are poring over Mr. Obama’s record to divine a legacy. Which policies will last? How did he change the job? How did he distinguish himself? But this was a presidency whose few faint whiffs of scandal included being surreptitiously videoed last year by Usher dancing listlessly to Drake’s “Hotline Bling,” which was more than a year old. So to be fair: It’s an addictive song, and he moved like someone who had been dancing to it since it came out. In other words, Mr. Obama’s place in popular culture has always felt new, alive and mostly underappreciated. Obviously, other presidents have had a relationship with American culture. Television was in its creative infancy when Dwight D. Eisenhower entered office in 1953, and he took quick advantage of the power of its immediacy. When John F. Kennedy turned 45, he received American history’s most famous “Happy Birthday” from Marilyn Monroe. But it was tragedy and a glamorous wife that ensured Kennedy’s legacy in popular culture. Richard Nixon disliked “All in the Family” and was an avid moviegoer, who according to Mark Feeney’s surprising book “Nixon at the Movies,” watched about 500 films during his presidency. Ronald Reagan was a Hollywood actor before he was a politician, and, as a candidate, Bill Clinton made a lot of sense on MTV and Arsenio Hall’s   talk show. But has any president been as conversant in the art and popular culture of this country as Barack Obama? Who has been as committed to opening up the White House to the sorts of artists he has? Lunches with the novelists Zadie Smith, Barbara Kingsolver, Junot Díaz, Dave Eggers and Colson Whitehead. One lunch, actually. That was one lunch. Initiative summits that included Alicia Keys, Nicki Minaj, J. Cole, Ludacris, Rick Ross, Pusha T. Common and Chance the Rapper. (So many different rappers and RB singers have come through the White House in the last eight years that the BET Awards could sue for copyright infringement.) Last year, Barack and Michelle Obama hosted “Jazz at the White House,” which featured appearances by so many magnificent, important people that to type out all the names  —   Chick Corea, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Ms. Franklin, for openers  —   is to make a very fancy shopping list. Mr. Obama brought all kinds of art and culture into the White House, and he sought culture out. At the same time, how we experience that art and culture, changed as much as the culture itself. When he entered office, in 2009, Netflix was a    service. Now it’s a major reason we no longer watch TV we scarf it down. But that disruption  —   from channels and networks to platforms and apps  —   also unleashed TV that looked more like America: more nonwhite characters, more women, more gays. He presided over an era in which television and movies grappled with the meaning and meaninglessness of race, whether to laugh at it or take it seriously or ignore it altogether, whether the idea of a   postracial America was ever possible, as though electing a black man for eight years erases the traumas of 400. To that end, “30 Rock” was the great   situation comedy  —   a workplace farce, on and loosely about NBC, that hit its stride in 2008 and ran until 2013. Not so secretly, it was about the insurmountable work of race and gender. Meanwhile, the American movie industry went all in on franchises and sequels while leaving art and humanity for TV. But the “Fast and Furious” movies did bounce off the assembly line. The series started in 2001, essentially died in 2003, and came roaring back to life at the start of Mr. Obama’s first term and is ludicrously yet thankfully on the verge of an eighth installment. The protagonists are car thieves turned action heroes, who are mostly black, Asian, Latina or racially ambiguous. These aren’t great movies. But they’re great,   fun: serious and   without too much (or any)  . And they take an issue that Hollywood has always struggled with  —   what to do with all these talented, interesting people of color?  —   and laughs at it. What to do? It’s not that hard: Let ’em drive. Mr. Obama had his priorities straight, of course. Pop culture and art aren’t aspects of American life that should dominate a   presidency. They have little to do with the business of governance. But Mr. Obama has always seemed to understand the importance of culture as mirror, window, escape hatch and haven. The Obamas were catholic in their tastes not because they had to be, but because that’s what we should be: open. Their minds were open, their hearts were open, their arms were open  —   to the Willie Nelsons, the Beyoncés, the Junot Díazes, to all kinds of excellence. One of the happiest cultural events I’ve ever watched was the Presidential Medal of Freedom ceremony in November. The honor went to 21 men and women, from Robert De Niro and Tom Hanks and Michael Jordan to Cicely Tyson and Diana Ross and Ellen DeGeneres. Bill and Melinda Gates were honored. So were Maya Lin and Robert Redford. Mr. Obama had good material for most of them  —   philanthropists, movies stars, architect, alike. And, as he so often does and gets nary enough credit for, he delivered it with perfectly timed drollery. (He could easily enjoy a second career as a comedian.) These people meant something to him. His joshing notwithstanding, a few of them appeared to mean everything. The knock on Mr. Obama was that he was dry and aloof. Perhaps but not always. He understood what laughter could do. He knew the power of songs. He knew the power of singers, even if the only person doing the singing was, at first, only him. In 2015, at the memorial service after the Charleston massacre, he takes a dramatic, deliberative pause before intoning the lyrics to “Amazing Grace. ” He starts and the choir behind him rises, out of surprise. You can tell he’s not singing because he thinks his baritone sounds good. He’s singing because something’s come over him, the way it does me, the way it does lots of people. What appears to have come over him at that memorial is both a sincere holiness and a rare, powerfully particular recognition of the glory and tragic risk of being black and American: He had to sing. In that moment, that song was all he seemed to have. That’s not a sensation you go looking for. It finds you. Good historians tend to know the right moment to evaluate a president’s place. They wait until the office is behind him, for the right mix of distance and scholarship. In the meantime, Barack Obama’s performance as president  —   meaning the performance he gave in the role of president of the United States  —   was flawless. Culturally speaking, he didn’t use his office to lift up, enlighten and entertain so much as share it. He wrote to David Remnick that he loved Ray Charles’s version of “America the Beautiful” because “it captures the fullness of the American experience, the view from the bottom as well as the top, the good and the bad, and the possibility of synthesis, reconciliation, transcendence. ” The man knows his country and his Ray. But it’s entirely possible to read that quote and catch a chill because Mr. Obama could easily have been writing about himself.",0
17272,Let’s Be Clear – A Vote For Warmonger Hillary Clinton Is A Vote For World War 3,"in: Politics , War Propaganda If you want to see war without end, vote for Hillary Clinton. It is tremendously ironic that Hillary Clinton and the mainstream media have attempted to portray Donald Trump as “dangerous” and “temperamental”, because it is Clinton that actually has a long history of being emotionally unstable. She has a temper that is absolutely legendary, and she has been cussing out the men and women in her security detail for decades . Hillary Clinton played a key role in starting the civil war in Syria, thanks to her Libya is a post-apocalyptic wasteland today, and now she is picking a fight with the Russians before she has even won the election. Of all the candidates there were running for president this election cycle, there was nobody that was even close to as dangerous as Hillary Clinton, and if she wins the election I am fully convinced that World War 3 will begin before her time in the White House is over. Someone that shares this opinion with me is Donald Trump. According to Reuters , Trump recently stated that we are “going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton”… On Syria’s civil war, Trump said Clinton could drag the United States into a world war with a more aggressive posture toward resolving the conflict. Clinton has called for the establishment of a no-fly zone and “safe zones” on the ground to protect non-combatants. Some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the United States into direct conflict with Russian fighter jets. “What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,” said Trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his Trump National Doral golf resort. “You’re going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.” In order to have a no-fly zone in Syria, you would have to enforce it. And in order to enforce it, you would have to be willing to shoot at the Russians. According to National Intelligence Director James Clapper , that could have dire consequences… Russia could shoot down a U.S. aircraft if a no-fly zone were imposed over Syria, National Intelligence Director James Clapper said Tuesday. “I wouldn’t put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground,” Clapper said, speaking with CBS’ Charlie Rose at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York about several national security issues. Of course Clapper is not alone in that assessment. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Francis Dunford, says that imposing a no-fly zone over all of Syria “would require us to go to war” … “Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria it would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia,… That’s a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I’m not going to make.” ( Senate Armed Services Committee, September 22, 2016, emphasis added) But Hillary Clinton is unwavering in her position that this is what she wants. You see, the truth is that Hillary Clinton wants to win the war that she started in Syria. Back in 2011, she spearheaded an effort along with Saudi Arabia and Turkey to try to use the Arab Spring uprisings in the Middle East as an opportunity to try to overthrow President Assad in Syria. If it wasn’t for her meddling, millions of refugees would not be pouring into Europe and elsewhere, and there would be no “humanitarian crisis” in Syria at all. Thanks to Russian intervention, the war in Syria is not too far from being over, but the Obama administration is desperate to keep it going. They understand that if Assad is victorious that all of their efforts for the last five years have been wasted, and that is why they are so determined to keep Aleppo from falling. Without Aleppo, many of the jihadist rebels that the Obama administration has been supporting won’t have anywhere to hide. So the Obama administration has actually been considering direct strikes against the Syrian military, and the Russians have already said that they will not allow this to happen . If Obama is insane enough to order airstrikes against Syrian forces and the Russians start shooting back, that could set off a chain of events that could rapidly spiral completely out of control. One recent survey found that current American leadership has a 1 percent approval rating in Russia right now, and the Russians dislike Hillary Clinton even more than they dislike Barack Obama. The Russians know that if Hillary Clinton is elected that it is quite likely that they will have to fight a war with us, and that is why they desperately want Donald Trump to win in November. You can see this outlook reflected in comments that Russian President Vladimir Putin recently made about the two candidates … “Mrs. Clinton has chosen to take up a very aggressive stance against our country, against Russia. Mr. Trump, on the other hand, calls for cooperation – at least when it comes to the international fight against terrorism,” Putin said. “Naturally we welcome those who would like to cooperate with us. And we consider it wrong, that we always have to be in conflict with one another, creating existential threats for each other and for the whole world,” Putin noted. Anyone that watched the three presidential debates could see that Hillary Clinton is absolutely seething with animosity for Russia. The thought of her finger on the nuclear trigger is almost too terrible to contemplate, but it may soon become a reality. And even now, the Obama administration and our NATO allies are shifting forces into position for a confrontation with Moscow. This week it is being reported that NATO troops will soon be sent to Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania … Nine hundred US troops are to be sent to eastern Europe next year as America’s troubled relationship with Russia enters new, uncertain territory. A US-led battle group of NATO allied soldiers will be sent to Poland as part of the multi-nation operation. British forces will lead one of the four battle groups in Estonia, Canada will spearhead the presence in Latvia and Germany will be present in Lithuania. In addition, Infowars is reporting that U.S. Marines will soon be stationed in Norway near the border with Russia… After accepting a Pentagon proposal, Norway will host US Marines at a base near the Russian border as Russia deploys nuclear-capable ships to Kaliningrad. A rotating force of approximately 330 Marines will be stationed at an airfield in the city of Vaernes, just outside Trondheim, beginning in January. Norway and Russia share an 122-mile border in the Arctic. “The US initiative to augment their training and exercises in Norway by locating a Marine Corps Rotational Force in Norway is highly welcome and will have positive implications for our already strong bilateral relationship,” said Norwegian Defense Minister Ine Eriksen Søreide. Most Americans aren’t aware of any of this, nor do they really care about our relationship with Russia. But in Russia things are completely different. The possibility of war with the United States is the biggest news story over there these days , and feverish preparations are being made for a potential nuclear confrontation … Russian authorities have stepped up nuclear-war survival measures amid a showdown with Washington, dusting off Soviet-era civil-defense plans and upgrading bomb shelters in the biggest cities. At the Kremlin’s Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Cold War is back. The country recently held its biggest civil defense drills since the collapse of the U.S.S.R., with what officials said were 40 million people rehearsing a response to chemical and nuclear threats. I know that I have been writing about this over and over , but the truth is that we are on a path to war with Russia, and the election of Hillary Clinton would greatly accelerate the march toward war. In my controversial new book , I expressed my belief that war with Russia is coming, but at the time that I wrote it I didn’t know how the election would turn out. At this point it looks like Clinton is very likely to win on November 8th, and that would be absolutely disastrous for our relationship with Russia. If you are reading this and you are considering voting for Hillary Clinton, please don’t do it . We simply cannot afford to have an emotionally unstable warmonger with a violent temper in the White House at this critical time. If the American people do choose Hillary Clinton this November, I believe that it will be a choice that they will bitterly, bitterly regret in future years. Submit your review",0
17273,Rocky First Weekend for Trump Troubles Even His Top Aides - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump’s first weekend in office unfolded much the way things often did during his campaign: with angry Twitter messages, a familiar obsession with slights and a series of meandering and at times untrue statements, all eventually giving way to attempts at damage control. The problem is that what works on the way to the White House does not always work once a candidate gets there. To the extent that there was a plan to take advantage of the first days of his administration, when a president is usually at his maximum leverage, Mr. Trump threw it aside with a decision to lash out about crowd sizes at his swearing in and to rewrite the history of his dealings with intelligence agencies. The lack of discipline troubled even senior members of Mr. Trump’s circle, some of whom had urged him not to indulge his simmering resentment at what he saw as unfair news coverage. Instead, Mr. Trump chose to listen to other aides who shared his outrage and desire to punch back. By the end of the weekend, he and his team were scrambling to get back on script. New presidents typically find the adjustment from candidate to leader to be a jarring one, and Mr. Trump was not the first to get drawn into the latest flap in a way that fritters away whatever political good will comes with an inauguration. Former President Bill Clinton got off to a tough start by engaging on issues that were not central to his agenda, most notably gays in the military, and took a while to learn how to focus on his highest priorities. But Mr. Clinton showed none of the combativeness and anger of Mr. Trump. “The adjustment from private citizen to running the country is unbelievably hard,” said Dan Pfeiffer, a longtime adviser to former President Barack Obama. He said that what people, even new presidents, often fail to fully understand “is that after you stand out there in the weather and take the oath of office in front of an adoring crowd, you walk into that building and you are in charge of the free world. ” At first, at least, Mr. Trump seemed to be resisting the notion that he should adjust his approach now that he is in office. After all, his pugilistic style was a winning formula, one that got him to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in the first place. Many of his supporters cheer him taking on the establishment. And some allies said any blowback would not matter long anyway. “Ultimately this is about governing,” said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has advised Mr. Trump. “There are two things he’s got to do between now and 2020: He has to keep America safe and create a lot of jobs. That’s what he promised in his speech. If he does those two things, everything else is noise. ” “The average American isn’t paying attention to this stuff,” he added. “They are going to look around in late 2019 and early 2020 and ask themselves if they are doing better. If the answer’s yes, they are going to say, ‘Cool, give me some more. ’” That is the long view and ultimately perhaps the most important one. The short view from many political professionals is that Mr. Trump’s debut was not a success. The president himself seemed to be trying to find a way forward as the weekend proceeded. He danced to “My Way” on Friday night and did it his way on Saturday, but by Sunday he seemed to be trying something different. A day after waves of opponents gathered in Washington and cities around the nation and world to protest his presidency, Mr. Trump began Sunday still in a mood to push back. “Watched protests yesterday but was under the impression that we just had an election!” he posted on Twitter in the morning. “Why didn’t these people vote? Celebs hurt cause badly. ” Kellyanne Conway, his counselor, contributed to the combative mood in an interview with NBC’s Chuck Todd when she described the falsehoods that the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, had told reporters Saturday night as “alternative facts”  —   an assertion that lit up Twitter. However, Mr. Trump later adopted the more    demeanor that presidents typically take. “Peaceful protests are a hallmark of our democracy,” he wrote on Twitter. “Even if I don’t always agree, I recognize the rights of people to express their views. ” Mr. Trump faces a challenge few of his predecessors have confronted. Having won an Electoral College victory but not the popular vote, he entered office with less public support in the polls than any other president in recent times. After a transition in which he did relatively little to reach out to his opponents on the left and they hardly warmed to him, he found hundreds of thousands of protesters chanting just a few blocks from his new home on the first morning he woke up there. That has left the new White House feeling besieged from Day 1, fueling the president’s grievances and, in the view of some of his aides, necessitating an aggressive strategy to defend his legitimacy. “The point is not the crowd size,” Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, said on “Fox News Sunday” before the mood began to soften. “The point is that the attacks and the attempts to delegitimize this president in one day  —   and we’re not going to sit around and take it. ” Mr. Trump grew increasingly angry on Inauguration Day after reading a series of Twitter messages pointing out that the size of his inaugural crowd did not rival that of Mr. Obama’s in 2009. But he spent his Friday night in a whirlwind of celebration and affirmation. When he awoke on Saturday morning, after his first night in the Executive Mansion, the glow was gone, several people close to him said, and the new president was filled anew with a sense of injury. He became even more agitated after learning of a pool report by a Time magazine reporter incorrectly reporting that a bust of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had been removed from the Oval Office. (The reporter, Zeke Miller, did not see the bust and, after realizing the error, quickly issued a correction and apology.) While Mr. Trump was eager to counterattack, several senior advisers urged him to move on and focus on the responsibilities of office during his first full day as president. That included a   trip to the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency, where he had been coached to demonstrate support of the agency and criticize Senate Democrats for delaying confirmation of his nominee to lead it, Mike Pompeo. The advisers left thinking he agreed. But Mr. Spicer, who often berated reporters for what he called biased coverage during the campaign, shares Mr. Trump’s dark view of the news media and advocated an   declaration of war. After racing through his words of reconciliation at the C. I. A. in Langley, Va. Mr. Trump launched into a rambling, unscripted discussion that drifted to the topic of crowd size, making a series of verifiably false claims. Mr. Spicer then went to the White House briefing room for his first turn at the lectern and issued a blistering attack on reporters, made his own false claims and then stormed out without taking questions. Some of the president’s supporters found the first weekend troubling. L. Lin Wood, a prominent libel lawyer who was a vocal defender of Mr. Trump’s on Twitter during the campaign, said that he considered it a dangerous debut. “To someone who believed we might have a good opportunity to change, it’s just a terrible start. Because he’s got a long way to go,” Mr. Wood said. “This is going to go downhill quickly if it’s not changed, and that’s not good for any of us. ”",0
17274,George Michael Mattered Beyond the Music - The New York Times,"If you were around in October of 1987 and had MTV then, you remember. You remember the camera climbing, in black and white, up a rotating pair of torn,   Levis. You remember it seeming to take in the seat of the pants  —   or seeming to let you take that in. You remember the annoying cut to a jukebox, against which leaned two pairs of legs: some lady’s in blue heels, and another in blue denim and   cowboy boots  —   a dude’s. You remember the fade from the jukebox back to the rotating body, and the camera’s revealing a man in a leather jacket and a white   with perfectly trimmed stubble, aviator sunglasses and a cross dangling from his left ear. Today, we’d call that a lot of look. (The pompadour doesn’t even arrive for another couple of shots.) But if you were around in 1987, you just called your friends and said, “Oh, my God. ” If you missed Elvis or James Dean or the Beatles, if you were immune to what they did to other people’s hormones, maybe George Michael’s “Faith” registered strongly on your superstar Richter scale. Maybe he triggered your gaydar, too. Mr. Michael, who died unexpectedly on Christmas Day, never had to say he was gay for his gayness to seem apparent and unabashed. Three years earlier, this same person could be seen hugging himself while singing into the camera as the   more freshly     blond in a   pop duo (Wham! with Andrew Ridgeley) whose sound was about as close as two white British boys could get to a black girl group from the 1960s. By 1987, Mr. Michael had become just fresh, switching personas from soft to hard, from exuberant cheerleader to butch troubadour. [ Read the obituary | Watch George Michael perform live ] Somehow, wagging his derrière and begging for sex  —   and sounding deeply soulful while he did it  —   didn’t make him a novelty act. It made him extremely famous. It was a pose he kept for about a year. By the time you saw him in 1988, swiveling through the video for “Monkey,” in suspenders and a bolero hat, he’d  . Striking a pose is one thing. Holding it is something else. There weren’t many major male pop stars who were openly gay back then. (Scarcely any are now. Elton John said he was bisexual in 1976, and officially stayed there for more than a decade. He could hold a pose.) Lots of men hinted. Lots of men messed around with masculinity, and not just the megastars. For every David Bowie or even Boy George, there was a Jermaine Stewart or a Good Question, many rungs down the fame ladder. And for reasons that make no cosmic sense, a few of those men  —   Prince, David Bowie, Prince Be of P. M. Dawn, and now Mr. Michael  —   died in 2016, a year in which dismaying ambivalence about aggressive, invasive male behavior was matched by the reinstatement of duller performances of masculinity in both our pop music and our politics. The Princes and the George Michaels seem as radical as ever. Some of the shock of seeing “Faith” for the first (or 10th) time was that, just that summer, the man in it was getting all kinds of kids in trouble for singing “I Want Your Sex” not far into the AIDS era. After that, we should have been ready for “Faith. ” But “I Want Your Sex” kept to MTV’s gender norms, in which videos objectified sexy women (in that case, the stunning Kathy Jeung). “Faith” seemed exhilaratingly dirty by those standards: Mr. Michael was objectifying himself. “Faith” isn’t as great a video as it is a song or an album. But it’s important. Its hotness gave Mr. Michael this new, macho self to work with: somewhere between leather bar opening act and the boyfriend that girls in teen comedies think they want. He seemed both dangerous and “dangerous. ” But the pleading in his voice made you take him more seriously than you would a star whose new look was “sexy Village Person. ” Mr. Michael’s artistry ensured he would never be received only as camp. He was too good. He was too rueful and needy. Under the jacket and the shades and the stubble and the hair was a human who ached. Mr. Michael had a pretty, plainly textured voice that could quickly flare outward, into regret or shame, just for a few bars, the way it does in the bridge for 1984’s “Careless Whisper,” one of those apologetic slow jams with the evergreen wisdom of a psalm. It’s clarifying to tally up all those excellent songs and discover just how many were about emotional desperation and sexual frustration (“Everything She Wants,” “Last Christmas,” “Faith,” “Father Figure,” “Hard Day,” “Hand to Mouth,” “Something to Save,” “Too Funky,” “Outside,” to name just nine). The need for both liberty and intimacy also recur. So does the urge to let go or be released, to be truly seen and to give love. You don’t always notice because Mr. Michael’s singing smooths out any psychological cracks. He was ingenious with melody. There aren’t that many pop stars with as many parts of as many songs that are as exciting to sing as George Michael has  —   bridges, verses, the fillips he adds between the chorus during a  . “Faith” isn’t just an album. It’s a complex city of modern sound: a collection of songs, yes, and a skyline, too. But the psychological always tended to be present. The church organ at the beginning of that “Faith” video is playing the chorus of Wham! ’s “Freedom. ” He sang about wanting to be free often enough to make you wonder whether he thought any freedom was ever attainable. He seemed to come to resent his fame. David Fincher’s video for another “Freedom”  —   “Freedom! ’90”  —   amounts to Mr. Michael’s changing his mind about 1987. The stars of the video are Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington, Tatjana Patitz and Linda Evangelista  —   supermodels  —   not Mr. Michael, who’s conspicuous by his absence yet represented by the demolition of that jukebox and the immolation of the leather jacket. He was rejecting “Faith,” and it was heretical. “Freedom! ’90” appears on “Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1,” the album with Mr. Michael’s strongest singing. There are want, hurt, protest and artistic risk. Prince, Mr. Bowie and Michael Jackson were theatrical performers. This was the first time Mr. Michael allowed himself to sound theatrical, too. The lyrics are explicitly personal, if poetically implicit. The record rejects the perfect pop songwriting of “Faith” and replaces a lot of the danciness of that album with gospel. It holds up as a work of art as well as the previous record holds up as an achievement of commercial intelligence. Those other men who died this year  —   Mr. Bowie and Prince and Prince Be  —   also managed to do interesting stuff with race: to sing black music while white to be a   black guitarist in any genre to be a fat, bohemian rapper who sang. For all Mr. Michael did to make gayness interesting and less threatening, he might have done more to help erase a barrier between who should and should not sing soul music. In his prime, he was a relatively frictionless ambassador among the races. He didn’t cross all the way over, as Teena Marie did. He didn’t “sound black. ” He sounded like himself  —   and that was enough to land him near the top of the black music charts. “I Knew You Were Waiting for Me,” from 1987, is still the best Aretha Franklin duet. Mr. Michael’s black support was never an exploitative exhortation. It was never “Go, white boy! Go, white boy! Go!” It was: “Oh, he gets it. ” And by 2016, he wasn’t done mattering. Last spring, Key  Peele’s stoner,    comedy, “Keanu,” came and went. But there’s a running gag that’s stayed with me. It’s just three Los Angeles thugs and one uptight bureaucrat named Clarence (Keegan Michael Key) pretending to be a thug (long story a good one, though) chilling in Clarence’s minivan. To pass the time, they turn to the fake thug’s iPhone for music, and up comes George Michael’s “Freedom! ’90. ” One dude says, “That sounds kinda white. ” And Clarence begins a quick defense of his taste, studded with the   that also makes a flashy British pop star sound like a gangsta from Crenshaw. The sequence culminates with their being oblivious to the shootout in the house they’re parked in front of, belting “One More Try” like a pack of wolves baying at the moon. For about 25 minutes, “Keanu” is smarter than the bad action comedy it turns out to be. And one thing it’s brilliant about is the partial meaning of George Michael. Who knows if Mr. Michael found that annoying. Who knows if he was aware that “Keanu” existed. But the crush this movie has on him is the crush almost everybody did. At some point, Clarence takes a hit of some hot new street drug, and the first place his high takes him is dancing with Mr. Michael in the “Faith” video. He’s up where even Mr. Michael’s slowest, saddest music could take you. He’s in heaven.",0
17275,The Phrase Putin Never Uses About Terrorism (and Trump Does) - The New York Times,"MOSCOW  —   Vladimir V. Putin, Russia’s president, hardly misses a chance to talk tough on terrorism, once famously saying he would find Chechen terrorists sitting in the “outhouse” and “rub them out. ” He and President Trump, notably dismissive of political correctness, would seem to have found common language on fighting terrorism  —   except on one point of, well, language. During his campaign, Mr. Trump associated Islam with terrorism and criticized President Obama for declining to use the phrase “radical Islamic terrorism. ” However, Mr. Putin, whom Mr. Trump so openly admires for his toughness, has, for more than a decade, done exactly what President Obama did. He has never described terrorists as “Islamic” and has repeatedly gone out of his way to denounce such language. “I would prefer Islam not be mentioned in vain alongside terrorism,” he said at a news conference in December, answering a question about the Islamic State, a group he often refers to as “the   Islamic State,” to emphasize a distinction with the Islamic religion. At the opening of a mosque in Moscow in 2015, Mr. Putin spoke of terrorists who “cynically exploit religious feelings for political aims. ” In the Middle East, Mr. Putin said at the mosque opening, “terrorists from the   Islamic State are compromising a great world religion, compromising Islam, sowing hatred, killing people, including clergy,” and added that “their ideology is built on lies and blatant distortions of Islam. ” He was careful to add, “Muslim leaders are bravely and fearlessly using their own influence to resist this extremist propaganda. ” And, this being Russia, the failure to adhere to this   interpretation is a prosecutable offense: The Russian news media are required by law to note in any mention of the Islamic State that the reference is to a banned terrorist organization of that name, lest it be misconstrued as denigrating religion. Mr. Putin does not take this stance to soothe the feelings of Western liberals, a group he dismisses as hypocritical in any case. “Putin prides himself on Russia’s intelligence capabilities,” the Brookings Institution wrote in a study of the early formation of his counterterrorism policies. “Russian leaders think they know their enemy,” and it is not the governments of majority Muslim countries such as Iraq and Iran, or the majority of Muslims living in Russia. Instead, Russian counterterrorism strategy focused on financing and militarily backing moderate Muslim leaders, with the breakthrough in the Chechen war coming when the region’s imam, Akhmad Kadyrov, allied with the Russian military. His son, Ramzan Kadyrov, leads the region today. While embracing Islamic leaders as a centerpiece of its counterterrorism strategy, however, the Kremlin did not avoid drawing distinctions along religious lines. The Russian government backed the Kadyrov family’s campaign to revive traditional Sufi Islam in Chechnya as a counterweight to the more austere Wahhabi denomination professed by many separatists. The Wahhabi strain was outlawed in another restive, predominantly Muslim province, Dagestan, and its adherents are persecuted in Russia, rights groups say. Still, the alliance with moderate Islamic religious leaders became important in pacifying Chechnya and other North Caucasus regions, which have ceased to pose a serious security threat to Russia. “Putin rules a multiconfessional country,” Orkhan Dzhemal, a commentator on Islamic affairs, said in a telephone interview, noting that in the United States, in contrast, Muslims are not a powerful political force. “He cannot say ‘Islamic terrorism’ for a simple reason. He doesn’t want to alienate millions of Russians. ” The term preferred in Russian political parlance is “international terrorism. ” In a phone call on Friday, President Trump and Mr. Putin discussed “real cooperation” in fighting terrorist groups in Syria. They could agree on an enemy. But the Kremlin statement described a “priority placed on uniting forces in the fight against the main threat  —   international terrorism. ”",0

Host Bill Maher asked Lieu how Trump going against Russia to launch the strike on Syria “fit into the Republican  —   the liberal idea that he was installed by Putin as a stooge to do whatever Putin wanted? This is not what Putin wanted. ” Lieu responded, “If you’re facing possible collusion with Putin, you might just want to distract people. ” He added, “It might be, we don’t know. I’ve learned to not predict Donald Trump. But, in this case, what he did was not only unconstitutional, there’s no strategy. We don’t know what were doing in Syria, how long we’re going to be there. He’s got US ground forces there now that are more at risk of being attacked because he just attacked Assad. He has to tell the American people what we’re doing in Syria, he has not done that. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0

17278,GRAPHIC -- Cartel Violence Kills 10 near Texas Border,"MATAMOROS, Tamaulipas  —   A series of recent gun battles and executions in this border city and in Rio Bravo led to nearly a dozen deaths as clashes with military forces and internal turmoil within the Gulf Cartel is reaching a boiling point. [The violence began last week in the Buena Vista neighborhood of Matamoros when cartel gunmen clashed with military and police forces. As usual, the fighting led to blockades, where cartel gunmen hijacked various vehicles to choke chances of police pursuit down main avenues. In Rio Bravo, troops killed several  gunmen throughout the city.   The fighting and a series of apparent executions in both Matamoros and Rio Bravo led to the death of several men who are all believed to be part of one of the various factions that make up the Gulf Cartel.  In the downtown area of Matamoros, authorities responded to a local business where they found four men killed. The four cartel members had all been shot in the head  .   In a separate attack, a team of gunmen killed three men in a second ordered hit. One of the victims was a   drug dealer while the other two remain unknown. A local college student was struck by a stray bullet and died shortly after. In Rio Bravo, Mexican marines killed two gunmen who were fleeing from authorities after they murdered a married couple. The couple was gunned down after getting in a car crash with the cartel gunmen.   Editor’s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.

17279,"In 9/11 Document, View of a Saudi Effort to Thwart U.S. Action on Al Qaeda - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   The   document detailing possible connections between the government of Saudi Arabia and the Sept. 11 terrorist plot released on Friday is a   catalog of meetings and suspicious coincidences. It details contacts between Saudi officials and some of the Sept. 11 hijackers, checks from Saudi royals to operatives in contact with the hijackers and the discovery of a telephone number in a Qaeda militant’s phone book that was traced to a corporation managing an Aspen, Colo. home of Prince Bandar bin Sultan, then the Saudi ambassador to Washington. The document, 28 pages of a congressional inquiry into the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, is also an unflattering portrayal of the kingdom’s efforts to thwart American attempts to combat Al Qaeda in the years before the attacks. But it is also a frustrating time capsule, completed in late 2002 and kept secret for nearly 14 years out of concern that it might fray diplomatic relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia. Subsequent investigations into the terror attacks pursued the leads described in the document and found that many had no basis in fact. But the mythology surrounding the document grew with each year it remained classified. The Obama administration sent a declassified version of the document, with some redactions, to the congressional leadership on Friday. Its release on the website of the House Intelligence Committee later in the day marked the end of a   fight by lawmakers and families of the Sept. 11 victims to make public any evidence that Saudi Arabia may have played a role in the attacks. It is by no means a Rosetta Stone that deciphers the lingering mysteries behind the attacks. But it is also a far more substantial document than many American and Saudi officials  —   from the White House press secretary to some members of Congress to the Saudi foreign minister  —   tried to indicate in a flurry of news conferences and emailed news releases on Friday afternoon. And it was made public at a particularly troubled moment in America’s   relationship with Saudi Arabia. The Senate unanimously passed a bill in May that would make it easier for families of Sept. 11 victims to sue the Saudi government for any role in the attacks. The bill is now being considered in the House. The White House has threatened to veto the legislation, but the Obama administration has had its own recent period of tension with Saudi leaders over the Iran nuclear deal and the grinding war in Syria. Much of the push over more than a decade to get the document declassified was led by former Senator Bob Graham, the Florida Democrat who was one of the   of the congressional inquiry. In a statement on Friday, Senator Graham compared the release to the “removal of the cork at the end of the bottle” that should lead to even more information to be declassified. The panel that Senator Graham helped lead did not try to reach definitive conclusions about what the 28 pages called the “Saudi issue” in its final report in 2002. “It was not the task of this Joint Inquiry to conduct the kind of extensive investigation that would be required to determine the true significance of any such alleged connections to the Saudi Government,” the document states. The most extensive investigation into the attacks was conducted by the September 11 Commission, which pursued many of the leads presented in the 28 pages. The commission’s final report, released in 2004, said that the panel had found no evidence that the “Saudi government as an institution, or senior Saudi officials individually funded” Al Qaeda. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, quoted that assessment word for word on Friday, adding that the various leads that investigators pursued about top Saudi officials having a role in the plot “didn’t really turn up anything. ” Adel al Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister, echoed that sentiment hours later at a news conference at the Saudi Embassy, saying that all the allegations in the document “have been dealt with in the subsequent investigations and they have found that they were without merit. ” “The surprise in the 28 pages is that there is no surprise,” he said. But some former September 11 Commission staff members pointed out that the wording in the group’s final report did not rule out the possibility that lower ranking Saudi officials had assisted the hijackers and said that the commission operated under extreme time pressure and could not run down every lead. In particular, some investigators remain puzzled by the exact role played by Fahad   a Saudi consular official based in the Los Angeles area at the time of the attacks. They believe that if there had been any Saudi government role in the plot, it probably would have involved him. Mr. Thumairy was the imam of a mosque visited by two of the Sept. 11 hijackers, and some American government officials have long suspected that Mr. Thumairy assisted the two men  —   Nawaq Alhamzi and Khalid    —   after they arrived in Los Angeles in early 2000. An F. B. I. document from 2012, cited last year by an independent review panel, concluded that Mr. Thumairy “immediately assigned an individual to take care of” of Mr. Alhamzi and Mr. Midhar “during their time in the Los Angeles area,” but the F. B. I. has been unable to piece together other details of the movement of the two men during their early days in the United States. Two investigators for the Sept. 11 commission interviewed Mr. Thumairy for several hours in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, in February 2004, but he denied having any ties to the hijackers  —   even after being presented with phone records that seemed to link him to the two men. The 28 pages discuss the role that Mr. Thumairy is said to have played, as well as a number of possible connections between Qaeda operatives and Saudi officials. One section of the report details how a phone number in a telephone book found with Abu Zubaydah, who was captured in Pakistan in March 2002 by the C. I. A. was traced to a corporation in Aspen, Colo. that manages the affairs of the Colorado residence of Prince Bandar. The Saudi government on Friday issued a lengthy rebuttal to the 28 pages, saying it was “one of the more peculiar ironies” that a nation that has done so much to combat terrorism finds itself “the object of ceaseless suspicion. ” American officials broadly agree that Saudi Arabia, since the Sept. 11 attacks, has been aggressive in its efforts to stamp out terror networks inside the kingdom and to clamp down on the financing private individuals in the country historically have given to militant groups. But the document released on Friday is unsparing in its criticism of Saudi efforts to undermine American attempts to dismantle Al Qaeda in the years before the Sept. 11 attacks. Moreover, it portrays the F. B. I as generally in the dark about the maneuverings of Saudi officials inside the United States during that period. It closes with a snippet of testimony from October 2002, when a senator asked Robert Mueller III, the F. B. I director, during a   session, whether the work of the congressional inquiry had unearthed information of which he had been unaware. “Yes,” he said.",0
17280,After ‘Hairspray Live!’: 7 TV Musicals and 5 Lessons Learned - The New York Times,"We’re now three years and seven shows into the     phenomenon. It’s time to begin drawing conclusions from this continuing experiment. You’ll recall that NBC began the parade in December 2013 with “The Sound of Music Live! ,” which starred Carrie Underwood as Maria. A year later came “Peter Pan Live! ,” also on NBC, and last December the network served up “The Wiz Live!” Fox got into the act this year with “Grease: Live! ,” “The Passion” and “The Rocky Horror Picture Show,” and on Wednesday night NBC resumed its December tradition with “Hairspray Live!” [ Review: “Hairspray Live!” Had Power Voices but Still Lacked Power ] Let’s cut to the chase: “The Wiz” was the best by far. But in terms of ratings, which is what this is really all about, “The Sound of Music” is the king (more than 18 million viewers) fueled no doubt by a curiosity factor, since it was first. “Grease” is second at about 12 million, then and “The Wiz” at 11. 5 million. Preliminary numbers for “Hairspray” put it somewhat behind those. But in general the bloom seems to be off the rose, and these musicals are settling into a     ratings zone. So maybe the phenomenon continues indefinitely, maybe not. But at this point, we have a pretty good idea of how to make them work. Among the poorest ratings performers and least watchable productions was Fox’s “Rocky Horror” in October, which was not performed live. That made it little more than a remake of the 1975 film version, a wonderful cult favorite built around a   performance by Tim Curry. Laverne Cox had the unenviable job of stepping into his shoes as    and never looked as if she was doing more than imitating her onscreen predecessor, something that was true of the rest of the cast as well. And for the viewer the enterprise lacked that little bit of spark that comes from knowing you’re watching a live performance. Granted, these are heavily regimented productions with little risk of a catastrophic misstep, but still  —   it’s fun to dream. Ms. Underwood, the country singer and “American Idol” winner, was the unfortunate sacrificial lamb who proved this point in “The Sound of Music. ” She has a nice voice, but it’s not a stage voice, the kind a classic musical requires. (Also, she’s not an actress.) Anyone thrown into one of these productions as   to attract viewers  —   and the ratings suggested that Ms. Underwood, with her substantial fan base, did attract viewers  —   is in danger of seeming inadequate next to whatever veteran stage actors are in the show. Ms. Underwood’s weaknesses were only underscored by the presence of Laura Benanti and Audra McDonald. Similarly, Allison Williams, as Peter Pan, was even more of a dud when compared with   like Kelli O’Hara and Christian Borle.   can work, but only when the production plays to the strengths of those performers. “The Wiz” did  —   its     score was just right for   Mary J. Blige and other recording artists in that cast. And Jennifer Hudson, who has starred on Broadway but is better known for her screen and singing careers, was a “Hairspray Live!” highlight, belting out powerful numbers like “I Know Where I’ve Been” and “Big, Blonde and Beautiful. ” Several of these productions, especially “Grease” and “Hairspray,” have gone to downright desperate lengths to try to make an impact on social media and with young demographics (or at least, young demographics that condescending TV executives apparently define as “too stupid to appreciate art for art’s sake”). “Hairspray” kept pausing to introduce us to its   squad and to check in on   viewing parties in various cities. It’s as if the producers don’t trust the musical itself to be interesting. The thing is, all of these works, even the pop ones like “Grease” and “Hairspray,” have story lines. Some of those stories, like the one in “Hairspray,” are pretty powerful if they’re left alone. But if they’re interrupted so we can hear from supposed fans dressed in period clothes at a viewing party in Philadelphia, they have no chance. “Grease” had a live audience viewing parts of the show. So did “Hairspray. ” But both of these productions sent their casts galloping about from set to set, so the audience wasn’t always there. And when it was present, it sometimes was more cheerleader than audience, whooping it up in a way that called attention to itself. Who wants to tune in a TV show to watch people watching other people perform? Either figure out a higher purpose for a live audience or jettison it, please. “Grease” went by in a blur of blandness. So did “Rocky Horror. ” But people will be talking about Ms. Hudson’s chilling “I Know Where I’ve Been” for a long time. And “memorable” doesn’t necessarily mean “wonderful. ” It can also mean “debatable. ” What other performance are people still talking about? Christopher Walken’s odd Captain Hook in the   “Peter Pan. ” Was he lost, dazed, confused? Or slyly brilliant? Hard to say, but kudos for the casting decision. Harvey Fierstein, in contrast, was a safe choice for Edna Turnblad in “Hairspray,” since he played the part on Broadway. Sure, it’s fun to hear his growly voice, but the selection felt like an opportunity missed.",0
17281,Trump Taps Linda McMahon to Head Small Business Administration - The New York Times,"■   Donald J. Trump taps wrestling impresario for Small Business Administration. ■  : “I didn’t do anything to divide” the country. ■ The governor of Iowa is the  ’s choice for ambassador to China. ■ Saving the Dreamers. Linda McMahon, the former chief executive officer of World Wrestling Entertainment, was selected on Wednesday by Mr. Trump to head the Small Business Administration, adding another billionaire to the  ’s affluent stable. “Linda has a tremendous background and is widely recognized as one of the country’s top female executives advising businesses around the globe. She helped grow W. W. E. from a modest   operation to a publicly traded global enterprise with more than 800 employees in offices worldwide,” Mr. Trump said in a statement. Ms. McMahon, a failed Senate candidate from Connecticut, was with her husband Vince one of Mr. Trump’s biggest campaign donors. She contributed $6 million to a “super PAC” supporting Mr. Trump in August and September, according to federal election filings. And, of course, Mr. Trump has shown a great facility for professional wrestling, so the choice makes sense. In an interview with Time for its person of the year issue, and a   with NBC’s “Today” show, Mr. Trump talked tough. ■ He insisted he has nothing to do with the “divided states of America” that Time says he will lead. “When you say divided states of America, I didn’t divide them,” he told NBC. “I’m not president yet, so I didn’t do anything to divide. ” ■ He declined to criticize Rodrigo R. Duterte, president of the Philippines, who is leading a bloody campaign in the streets of Manila against drugs, or even to push back on comparisons between Mr. Duterte and the  ’s promised crackdown on criminal illegal immigrants. “Well, hey, look, this is bad stuff,” Mr. Trump told Time. “They slice them up, they carve their initials in the girl’s forehead, O. K.? What are we supposed to do? Be nice about it?” ■ He rejected United States intelligence conclusions that Russia was behind hacks at the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign that boosted his campaign. “I don’t believe it. I don’t believe they interfered,” Mr. Trump said of the Russians. ■ And he again said he would press Boeing on an Air Force One upgrade, though his Twitter order to “cancel” the project seems to have faded. “I’m going to negotiate prices, and the planes are too expensive, and we’re going to get the prices down. ” Representative Keith Ellison said Wednesday he would resign his House seat if he is elected chair of the Democratic National Committee, sweeping away an impediment to his bid for the party post while denying his critics a handy argument against his controversial candidacy. “Whoever wins the D. N. C. chair race faces a lot of work, travel, planning and resource raising. I will be ‘ ’ to meet the challenge,’” Mr. Ellison said in a statement. A range of prominent Democrats have expressed unease about installing a   chairman at the D. N. C. at a time when the party is shut out of power in Washington. But that argument against Mr. Ellison has also served as a   for broader, and more delicate, concerns about the liberal Minnesotan. Some Jewish Democrats are nervous about his past ties to the Nation of Islam and comments about Israel. Haim Saban, one of the party’s biggest donors, said Mr. Ellison would be “a disaster” for Democrats.   Trump sounded more conciliatory toward Boeing on Wednesday after its chief executive promised to help control the cost of a proposed new Air Force One plane. Mr. Trump had tweeted “Cancel Order!” on Tuesday after writing that it could cost over $4 billion to build two of the jets with   communications and security by the  . But in a telephone interview with the Today Show, Mr. Trump said that he had since talked to the Boeing executive, Dennis Muilenburg, saying he was a “terrific guy, and we’re going to work it out. ” Mr. Trump said he would negotiate lower prices or “we’re not going to order them, we’ll stay with what we have. ” Mr. Trump said he had tweeted about the project after hearing the cost estimates. He said he had not seen a Chicago Tribune article citing Mr. Muilenburg’s concerns about his trade policies that was posted shortly before his tweet. For all his talk of punishing China,   Trump has chosen a conciliator with a personal relationship with China’s president to be his ambassador in Beijing. An Iowa governor might seem an unlikely choice for one of the more sensitive diplomatic posts, but Gov. Terry Branstad has ties with China that go back decades. Mr. Branstad, whose selection was first reported by Bloomberg News and confirmed on condition of anonymity on Wednesday by two people with direct knowledge, is close to President Xi Jinping, whom he has known for more than three decades. They met in 1985, when Mr. Branstad was serving his first term as governor of Iowa and Mr. Xi was a    rural official in Hebei Province, studying modern American agriculture, including hog and corn farming in Iowa. Mr. Branstad has courted China as governor, promoting his state’s farm goods. As ambassador, he would be tasked with managing a complex relationship that Mr. Trump has already indicated he is willing to shake up. The  ’s call with Taiwan’s president last week prompted criticism from Beijing, which considers it a breakaway province, and Mr. Trump responded with posts on Twitter attacking China for its trade practices and provocative moves in the South China Sea. Mr. Trump is scheduled to travel to Des Moines on Thursday for a rally. Facing intense pressure over the   “Dreamers,” young people brought to the United States by their undocumented parents and allowed to stay under President Obama, Mr. Trump appears to be softening his stance on whether to deport the more than 700, 000 of them. “We’re going work something out that’s going to make people happy and proud,” Mr. Trump told Time. “They got brought here at a very young age, they’ve worked here, they’ve gone to school here. Some were good students. Some have wonderful jobs. And they’re in   land because they don’t know what’s going to happen. ” Mr. Trump did not go into specifics or say he would reverse his promise to reverse Mr. Obama’s executive actions, including the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which protected young undocumented immigrants from deportation. The Dreamers are likely to present Mr. Trump with the first major domestic policy test of administration, as many of his campaign promises clash with more moderate Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill who have implored Mr. Trump not to deny these young adults protective status. Many of Mr. Trump’s top advisers and potential cabinet members, including his nominee for attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, however, oppose Mr. Obama’s executive action on immigration and other measures that would allow undocumented immigrants to stay in the U. S. Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago made the case to Mr. Trump personally on Wednesday. Emerging into the Trump Tower lobby, Mr. Emanuel said: At a breakfast   at Manhattan’s Cipriani 42nd Street, Mr. Trump on Wednesday gave a tantalizing hint at the inaugural festivities to come for a reality TV   : The helicopter grand entrance. The   said he was paid a visit a day earlier by Mark Burnett, the executive producer of “The Apprentice,” the reality show that helped make the   a household name. Mr. Trump told the crowd that Mr. Burnett proposed reinventing the inauguration with a helicopter taking off from New York City, according to an attendee. Mr. Burnett, who is known for producing shows like “Survivor,” “The Voice” and “Shark Tank” as well, also told Mr. Trump that he should consider a parade up Fifth Avenue. The group planning Mr. Trump’s inauguration has secured about $50 million in pledged donations since it began   in earnest last week, a breakneck pace that promises a glittering event, according to two people involved in the effort. The early success puts Mr. Trump on pace to easily surpass President Obama’s 2009 inauguration, when his finance team raised a record $53 million to fund the inaugural festivities. The group, the Presidential Inaugural Committee, has set a   goal of $65 million to $75 million, though the final figure could well be higher, the two people said. The committee has planned a series of exclusive events around Mr. Trump’s    —   not unlike those planned around past inaugurations  —   to help entice wealthy donors and corporations to open their checkbooks. Evidently, the events are working.   Trump was announced as the Time magazine’s person of the year on Wednesday  —   but with a discordant note. As the magazine’s editor in chief, Nancy Gibbs, put it: Mr. Trump accentuated the positive. “It’s a great honor, it means a lot, especially me growing up reading Time magazine,” he said on the “Today” show on NBC after the choice was announced. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Trump bragged at rallies about how frequently he was on the magazine’s cover. And hey, last year, he said it would never happen. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, one of the most conservative Democrats in Congress, says he is trying to find time for a second trip to Trump Tower in New York, this time to see Reince Priebus, tapped to be the next White House chief of staff. “I’m anxious to talk to him,” he said. What Mr. Manchin wants is unclear. Asked if he were open to serving in the cabinet, he answered, “I’m just anxious to help my country and help my state. ” And what an appointment would mean to Mr. Trump is equally unclear. The other red state Democrat being wooed by the Trump transition team, Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, is a more obvious target. Her seat would be filled by an appointment made by North Dakota’s incoming Republican governor, Doug Burgum, giving Republicans a little more cushion for their narrow Senate majority. Mr. Manchin’s successor would be named by West Virginia’s incoming Democratic governor, Jim Justice. With Hillary Clinton’s lead in the popular vote reaching 2. 7 million votes, the Democrats’ losses are looking increasingly improbable but very real. They are annotated on Twitter by David Wasserman, House editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. History is a game of inches  —   or a few thousand votes in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.",0

17283,"At Debate, Hillary Clinton Leaves Questions About Approach to Banks - The New York Times","A jarring regulatory action this week against five large banks was bound to bring Wall Street to the fore in the Democratic presidential debate on Thursday. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders differ on how to handle banks that are deemed “too big to fail. ” The complexities of bank regulation have made it hard for the candidates to express themselves clearly on Wall Street issues. Mr. Sanders, who is quite knowledgeable on the subject, nevertheless left some readers of a recent interview with The Daily News concerned that he wasn’t. On Thursday, Mrs. Clinton might have left viewers with plenty questions about what she’d actually do to break up the banks. The banking discussion started with a question about the news that sent a chill through the large banks this week. Federal regulators rejected special plans that large banks now have to draw up to show how they would go through bankruptcy in an orderly fashion. Early in the debate, CNN’s Dana Bash noted that, if the five banks don’t fix the plans, the regulators could, as a last resort, require them to break up. Ms. Bash asked Mrs. Clinton: “So, as president, would you call on regulators to start the process of breaking up these banks, something that the law not only allows, but actually explicitly encourages?” “Absolutely,” Mrs. Clinton said. But what followed was not absolutely clear. Mrs. Clinton described two powers she would have under the   Act, the law Congress passed to overhaul the financial system. She said how these powers might be used to break up the banks. But she might have left viewers confused over when she could use them. Under one interpretation, Mrs. Clinton appeared to be saying that she would quickly use the powers to pressure the banks to get smaller  —   an aggressive stance that might win admiration from Mr. Sanders’s supporters. But it is also plausible that Mrs. Clinton was saying that, while her administration would emphasize a tough line on the banks, it would not actually use the   powers until a serious debacle started to occur in the banking sector. This would be a more reactive approach, and, if no banking disasters happened on Mrs. Clinton’s watch, it could leave the banks at more or less the size they are today. Here is what Mrs. Clinton said to Ms. Bash: “I will appoint regulators who are tough enough and ready enough to break up any bank that fails the tests under  . There are two sections there, and if they fail either one, that they’re a systemic risk, a grave risk to our economy, or if they fail the other, that their living wills, which is what you’re referring to, are inadequate. ” Mrs. Clinton added: “I have been standing up and saying continuously, ‘We have the law we’ve got to execute under it.’ So you’re right: I will move immediately to break up any financial institution. ” When Mrs. Clinton said “living wills,” she was referring to the special bankruptcy plans that five big banks drew up, but that failed to pass muster with regulators. If after two years, the banks have not fixed the deficiencies that the regulators identified, the regulators can require the banks to take steps that would make them smaller. But the five banks, which include JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, are now going to do everything they can to get their living wills in order. The last thing they want to do is give the regulators the right to demand that they downsize. So as things stand today, it is unlikely that Mrs. Clinton will get the chance to use the living wills to carry out a sweeping breakup of the biggest banks. Nor is the other test going to give the next president an    tool to dismantle large banks. This is the Kanjorski amendment, an obscure provision in   that is named for Paul Kanjorski, a former Democratic representative who helped design this part of the legislation. In her answer, Mrs. Clinton said the government would have the power to act with force when banks become “a grave risk to our economy. ” The Kanjorski amendment does just that. It gives a council of regulators the ability to determine that a large bank or financial firm poses a “grave threat to the financial stability of the United States. ” After a vote, the council can demand the bank take certain steps to reduce its riskiness, but if those are deemed inadequate, the council can tell the bank to sell assets. But if Mrs. Clinton were to use this power simply to break up the banks, and not because the system was in imminent danger, it would be viewed as a radical, even destabilizing, step. The chances of the Kanjorski amendment’s being used outside of an emergency to achieve broader policy goals are close to zero. Mrs. Clinton most likely knows this. And it may be why she favors legislation to do things that   cannot do. This is from her website: “As president, Clinton would pursue legislation that enhances regulators’ authorities under   to ensure that no financial institution is too large and too risky to manage. ” It adds: “If firms can’t be managed effectively, regulators would have the explicit statutory authorization to require that they reorganize, downsize or break apart. ” Getting Congress to pass a new law to break up the banks would be hard. But, as we have seen from looking closely at Mrs. Clinton’s assertions, the existing law does not make it easy.",0
17284,"Amazon to Add 100,000 Employees for Automated Market - Breitbart","Despite CEO Jeff Bezos’s political battles with   Donald Trump, Amazon is going   by pledging to hire 100, 000 U. S. employees with full benefits to launch its   grocery markets, which are expected to offer drone delivery services. [Amazon. com (OTC: AMZN) currently has about 180, 000   employees in the United States and over 306, 000 full and   employees worldwide. That represents about a 33 percent increase over the 230, 800 at the end of 2015.  With 600 percent employment growth in the last 5 years, Amazon’s employee base is now 3 times Microsoft’s direct workforce and over 4 times Google parent Alphabet’s 70, 000 employees. Unlike other tech companies that are automating away employment or replacing Americans with   foreigners, Amazon is accelerating hiring. Most of Amazon’s U. S. growth has been at its 18 “Fulfilment by Amazon” service centers. Although the centers open with   employees, Amazon’s CFO Brian Olsavsky recently stated that due to expansion factors, the company is converting more temporary employees to   positions. The next big phase for Amazon’s growth will be the   of 1, 800   “Amazon Go” grocery stores, which will feature clerkless shopping. The company opened its pilot store at one of Amazon’s downtown Seattle headquarters buildings. Food options include fresh produce, frozen foods, packaged grocery and prepared food options. Only Amazon   “blue badge” staffers can enter right now, but ARS Technica reported that the      stores will be soon be open to Amazon Prime members who download a smartphone app. Through a combination of cameras and sensors powered by machine learning to track users’ activity, Amazon Go users can   and their account will br billed as they walk out of the store. With a huge inventory of     apartments with vacant ground floor retail space dotting most major cities, Amazon Go will have no problem rolling out their concept nationally. In a move apparently timed to the public launch of Go, Amazon filed a Federal Communications Commission application for a Special Temporary Authority permit to use of an indoor and outdoor wireless communications system in Seattle and rural Washington. The application states: “Amazon seeks FCC experimental authority to evaluate prototype equipment and associated software designed to support innovative communications capabilities and functionalities. ” It is signed by former NASA astronaut Neil Woodward, who manages of flight test and certification for Amazon Prime Air. Amazon’s application also “seeks to collect sufficient data within that time frame to assess the performance and reliability characteristics of prototype equipment and software to determine if additional research is needed and should be scheduled. ” Rumors in the tech world suggest the system will support Amazon Go drone deliveries. Amazon has already started making its first drone package deliveries in the UK, but Federal Aviation Administration regulations have limited the tech giant’s ability to conduct tests in its home market. Amazon patents applications include a “collective UAV” that would combine a flock of drones to pick up and deliver heavier items.",0
17285,Ukraine Lawmaker Who Worked With Trump Associates Faces Treason Inquiry - The New York Times,"Prosecutors in Ukraine are investigating whether a member of Parliament committed treason by working with two associates of President Trump’s to promote a plan for settling Ukraine’s conflicts with Russia. In a court filing on Tuesday, prosecutors accused the lawmaker, Andrii V. Artemenko, of conspiring with Russia to commit “subversive acts against Ukraine,” in particular by advancing a proposal that could “legitimize the temporary occupation” of the Crimean peninsula. Russia forcibly annexed the peninsula in 2014, a step that Ukraine, the United States and other governments have refused to recognize Mr. Artemenko said his proposal would allow Ukraine to formally cede control of the territory to Russia, at least temporarily. Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine’s prosecutor general, posted a copy of the court filing to his Facebook page on Tuesday with the statement “Ukraine’s integrity is above all else. ” Mr. Artemenko’s plan, reported on Sunday by The New York Times, outlines a series of steps meant to bring to an end the rebellion by   separatists in eastern Ukraine, and to resolve the dispute over Crimea by allowing voters to decide whether to lease the peninsula to Russia for 50 or 100 years. Settling those issues could give the Trump administration a path to lift sanctions against Russia. Mr. Artemenko traveled to New York in January to discuss the plan with Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, and with Felix H. Sater, a   business associate of the Trump Organization who scouted business opportunities in Russia for the company as recently as 2015. Mr. Cohen said he delivered the proposal to the White House in a sealed envelope in early February. Mr. Artemenko, a   politician who has tried to brand himself as a   populist, has not been arrested or formally charged with a crime. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Ukrainian news outlet Strana. ua quoted him as saying that the investigation was “politically motivated. ” “I’m not going anywhere, and will meet with investigators to explain my position,” he was quoted as saying. Mr. Artemenko has claimed he received encouragement from the Russian authorities for his effort, but the Kremlin has denied any knowledge of his proposal. He has also claimed to have evidence of corruption that could help lead to the ouster of the Ukrainian president, Petro O. Poroshenko. The Trump administration has sent mixed signals concerning the war in Ukraine, which has cost more than 10, 000 lives. White House officials have suggested that they would be open to lifting sanctions against Russia, but they have also demanded that Crimea be returned to Ukraine. Word of Mr. Artemenko’s peace plan has prompted outrage among many officials in Ukraine. Some accused him of being a secret Russian agent, and there have been calls for him to relinquish his seat in Parliament. On Monday, fellow Radical Party lawmakers voted unanimously to expel him from the party. The suggestion that Crimea be handed over to Russia legally, even for a limited time, particularly outraged Crimean Tatars, the ethnic group in Ukraine whose members consider the peninsula their historic homeland. Refat Chubarov, a Tatar member of Parliament, wrote on Facebook that Mr. Artemenko should be stripped of his parliamentary immunity and arrested. “Given the continued Russian occupation of Crimea,” he wrote, “which is characterized by the total suppression of the rights and freedoms of the Crimea Tatar people violent kidnappings and killings of peaceful citizens arrests of Crimean Tatar citizens and attacks on their homes and families as well as the persecution of journalists, the actions of Andrii Artemenko are unequivocally qualified as treason. ”",0
17286,‘Unbelievable Turmoil’: Trump’s First Month Leaves Washington Reeling - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The resignation of Michael T. Flynn as national security adviser caps a remarkably tumultuous first month for President Trump’s White House that has burdened the early days of his presidency with scandal, legal challenges, personnel drama and questions about his temperament during interactions with world leaders. Mr. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, lasted only 24 days before his tenure was cut short by an admission that he had misled the vice president and other White House colleagues about the contents of a phone call with the Russian ambassador to the United States. The resignation on Monday night and the continuing turmoil inside the National Security Council have deeply rattled the Washington establishment. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, railed against the administration on Tuesday, decrying the “dysfunction” of the country’s national security apparatus and accusing the White House of being a place where “nobody knows who’s in charge and nobody knows who’s setting policy. ” Gen. Tony Thomas, head of the military’s Special Operations Command, expressed concern about upheaval inside the White House. “Our government continues to be in unbelievable turmoil. I hope they sort it out soon because we’re a nation at war,” he said at a military conference on Tuesday. Asked about his comments later, General Thomas said in a brief interview, “As a commander, I’m concerned our government be as stable as possible. ” But Mr. Flynn’s   departure just added to the broader sense of chaos at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. In record time, the 45th president has set off global outrage with a ban on travelers from   countries, fired his acting attorney general for refusing to defend the ban and watched as federal courts swiftly moved to block the policy, calling it an unconstitutional use of executive power. The president angrily provoked the cancellation of a summit meeting with the Mexican president, hung up on Australia’s prime minister, authorized a commando raid that resulted in the death of a Navy SEAL member, repeatedly lied about the existence of millions of fraudulent votes cast in the 2016 election and engaged in Twitter wars with senators, a sports team owner, a Hollywood actor and a major department store chain. His words and actions have generated almost daily protests around the country. “I’ve never been so nervous in my lifetime about what may or may not happen in Washington,” said Leon Panetta, a Democrat who served as chief of staff, secretary of defense and C. I. A. director during a   career that spanned nine presidents from both parties. “I don’t know whether this White House is capable of responding in a thoughtful or careful way should a crisis erupt,” he said in an interview on Tuesday. “You can do    stuff over a period of time. But at some point, I don’t give a damn what your particular sense of change is all about, you cannot afford to have change become chaos. ” Mr. Trump’s allies note that the president has moved forward in areas that are more typical of the early days of a   administration. Mr. Trump nominated a Supreme Court justice 12 days into his tenure, and has issued a dozen executive orders, including ones to limit the influence of lobbyists, reduce regulations, pare the Affordable Care Act, move forward on pipeline construction, end trade deals and speed up deportations. Those accomplishments are catnip for the president’s most fervent supporters across the country, said Sara Fagen, who served as a senior aide and political director for former President George W. Bush. The perspective on the White House is very different far outside the interstate freeway that rings Washington, she said.’ ”“If you’re someone inside the Beltway, you think it’s been really rocky,” she said. “If you are outside the Beltway, you think, ‘That’s why we sent him there.’ There has been a lot of chaos and a lot of growing pains, but they have gotten a lot done. ”” ’Still, half of the president’s cabinet has yet to be confirmed by the   Senate, and several other key White House aides have become lightning rods for daily mockery by   comedians. It all has official Washington reeling and exhausted as it tries to make sense of  —   and keep up with  —   the nearly constant tornado of activity swirling around the president and his advisers. “If you had   Obama, you’ve got      Trump,” said John Feehery, a veteran Republican strategist, who compared the last several weeks to the chaotic start to Newt Gingrich’s tenure as speaker of the House in 1995. “Newt never settled down. It was always one crisis after another,” Mr. Feehery recalled. “This might be the new normal. People will start getting used to the new normal, but will also be exhausted by it. ” As a candidate, Mr. Trump promised to move quickly to stop illegal immigration, bring jobs back, end trade deals and reduce crime. Central to his campaign agenda was his pledge to be a disruptive force in Washington  —   and he has certainly done that. Since winning the election, Mr. Trump and his closest aides have embraced the turmoil, viewing it as evidence of their aggressive efforts to fundamentally reorient the government. The West Wing also uses the chaos as a tactical weapon, believing that the flurry of   presidential tweets, controversial statements during the afternoon briefing and surprise executive actions work to keep their adversaries, the media and others off balance. On Tuesday, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, happily kept reporters waiting while he did “a quick recap of the president’s activity,” proceeding to offer a long list of meetings and phone calls with foreign leaders, female entrepreneurs, local officials and educators. Yet the disruptions have come at a cost: the president has so far made little progress on legislation that would repeal President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. The White House has not proposed a promised infrastructure bill to repair deteriorating roads, bridges and tunnels. And the president’s aides have not yet drawn up plans for an overhaul of the nation’s tax code. “It’s pretty predictable,” Mr. Feehery said. “This guy has never been in government before and he promised to be disruptive. ” It may also have consequences for Mr. Trump’s ability to help Republicans win in the 2018 midterm elections. And Republican campaign experts acknowledge that his chances for winning   may hinge on his ability to contain the White House frenzy. “You are processing so much information in a day now. This stuff would have doomed anyone else, just one or two of them,” said Thomas M. Davis, a former Republican member of Congress from Virginia. “They have got to produce something. If all you’ve got is a bunch of executive orders and a Twitter feed, you don’t want to go into an election like that. ” Kevin Madden, who served as a senior adviser to Mitt Romney during both of his presidential campaigns, said Mr. Trump’s voters in 2016 wanted him to overhaul an establishment in Washington, which they view as long on promises, long on process but short on action. “Voters certainly asked for change. They certainly wanted to see disruption,” Mr. Madden said. “But if change begins to look like confusion and disruption morphs into disorder, you risk losing a certain level of confidence with voters. ”",0
17287,WATCH: Jailed Palestinian Terrorist And Hunger Strike Leader Caught On Tape Eating,"TEL AVIV  —   The Israeli Prison Service released a video on Sunday that appears to show Palestinian terrorist and wannabe politician Marwan Barghouti secretly eating a candy bar and other food in the bathroom of his cell while purportedly leading a hunger strike. [Barghouti, who is serving five life sentences, was filmed eating on two separate occasions. The first time on April 27 shows him unwrapping cookies from a hiding place in the bathroom and then eating it while sitting on the toilet. He then tries to conceal the fact by washing his hands and face and hiding the wrapper. On the second occasion on May 5, Barghouti is filmed eating a candy bar and salt.  Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan slammed Barghouti as a “murderer and a hypocrite” for eating while leading a hunger strike. “As I said from the very beginning, this hunger strike was never about the conditions of the convicted terrorists, which meet international standards. It is about advancing Marwan Barghouti’s political ambitions to replace Abu Mazen,” Erdan said, referring to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas by his nickname. Barghouti is seen as a major contender to succeed Abbas. “Barghouti is a murderer and hypocrite who urged his fellow prisoners to strike and suffer while he ate behind their back. Just like he lied to the world when he wrote in the New York Times that he decided to strike in order to protest   he lied to the Palestinian public when he claimed to be striking. Israel will not give in to extortion and pressure from terrorists,” Erdan said. Israel’s Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon said Barghouti’s eating proved that the hunger strike is nothing more than “a media stunt, which seeks to glorify terrorists with blood on their hands. ” According to Palestinian sources, there are 1, 500 hunger strikers in Israeli prisons. The goal of the hunger strike is supposedly to improve prison conditions. Demands include resuming a second monthly visit by family members (originally cancelled by the International Committee of the Red Cross over budgetary concerns) restoring academic studies for prisoners, and allowing additional TV channels and cell phones in security wings. Barghouti served as chief of the Tanzim armed wing of Fatah and is the founder of the terror group the   Martyrs Brigade. In 2004, he was found guilty of ordering terror attacks in three different locations and was implicated in another four.",0
17288,Tomb Opened Where ‘Jesus was Resurrected After Crucifixion For The First Time…’,"Via TruthAndAction SPONSORED LINKS 
The location of the tomb is inside the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. The tomb has been sealed since at least 1555 A.D. and was opened briefly as work progressed in restoring the site. 
It’s the location where the body of Jesus is said to have been placed after his crucifixion 2000 years ago. This tomb within the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem was opened for only 60 hours as renovation work progressed on this site that is holy to Christians. And a remarkable discovery was made. 
After removing the marble slab that encased the tomb, scientists at the University of Athens and National Geographic were stunned to find a limestone burial shelf intact and a second marble slab with a cross carved into its surface. Researchers were given the unprecedented access as part of restoration work. 
The team were shocked to find portions of the tomb are still intact today, having survived centuries of damage. The original surface was exposed during the restoration work being done at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the Old City of Jerusalem, according to National Geographic. 
Until then, marble had encased the slab since at least 1555 AD, and likely centuries earlier. When work first began the conservation team from the National Technical University of Athens showed only a layer of material underneath the marble slab. 
But as researchers continued their work over the course of 60 hours – and with just a few hours left before the tomb was to be resealed, another marble slab with a cross carved into its surface was exposed. Highlighting the sensitivity of the tomb, scientists were given only 60 hours to view the site before it was sealed again. 
‘This is the Holy Rock that has been revered for centuries, but only now can actually be seen,’ said Antonia Moropoulou of the National Technical University of Athens, who is leading the restoration of the Edicule. 
The burial slab was enclosed in an 18th century shrine structure known as the Edicule – a word derived from the Latin term aedicule meaning ‘little house’. The team cut a window into the southern interior wall of the Edicule, exposing one of the cave walls. 
The tomb has now been resealed and will probably not be opened again for hundreds, possibly even thousands, of years. But before it was resealed, the surface of the rock was extensively cataloged. 
There is considerable support for this being the actual place where Jesus’ body was placed, although that cannot be known for certain. The evidence for this is not definitive, however, according to Dan Bahat, a former district archaeologist in Jerusalem and in Galilee. 
‘We may not be absolutely certain that the site of the Holy Sepulchre Church is the site of Jesus burial, but we certainly have no other site that can lay a claim nearly as weighty, and we really have no reason to reject the authenticity of the site,’ Bahat said. 
Given that the site might not be reopened for hundreds or thousands of years, this 60-hour window into the ancient past has given researchers as well as Christian believers an unprecedented opportunity to study the origins of the faith.",0
17289,Busted! Wikileaks Proves Obama Lied about when He Knew about Hillary’s Email Server,"Well, in a long list of documented lies, coverups and criminal activity , Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah continues to get busted, demonstrating that the man is a pathological liar , which makes him mentally unstable and unfit for office ( not that he was qualified in the first place ). 
First, let's review what Obama said. Michael Bastasch reports : 
The White House knew President Barack Obama had emailed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email account that was run out of an unsecured server in her New York home, according to emails released by WikiLeaks. 
Obama told CBS News in March 2015 he learned of Clinton's private server the way basically all Americans did, "" through news reports ."" But emails hacked from Clinton campaign chair John Podesta's Gmail account suggest the White House already knew about Clinton's private email server. 
""They know POTUS and HRC emailed,"" Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri wrote to aides in March 2015 — about a month before Clinton announced she was running for president in 2016. 
So, how did Obama find out about Clinton's illegal email server ? The same way most Americans do, ""through new reports;"" at least that is the lie he told. 
So, how do we know he's lying? First, his lips are moving. Second, is the documented evidence of a March 7, 2015 email from Josh Schwerin to Jennifer Palmieri, Kristina Schake, Nick Merrill, Jesse Ferguson, which reads, ""Jen you probably have more on this but it looks like POTUS just said he found out HRC was using her personal email when he saw it in the news."" 
And what was the reply? 
""we [sic] need to clean this up – he has emails from her – they do not say state.gov."" 
That reply came from none other than Cheryl Mills, who wrote to John Podesta. 
Does anyone else think Josh had to change his cell phone number after this? 
This is right along the lines of the lie Obama told when he said, ""If You Like Your Health Care Plan, You Can Keep It"" . 
Anyways, this is what we have come to expect from those who are supposed to serve the people in government, but we should not expect such and should not allow it to continue. Rather, we should be demanding that justice prevail in all things and deal with these people not just by getting them out of government, but by bringing a just punishment on them for what they have done and sending a message to anyone else that chooses to engage in this behavior while in public service that they will receive the same treatment. shares",0
17290,Gene Wilder Dies at 83 Star of ‘Willy Wonka’ and ‘Young Frankenstein’ - The New York Times,"Gene Wilder, who established himself as one of America’s foremost comic actors with his delightfully neurotic performances in three films directed by Mel Brooks his eccentric star turn in the family classic “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory” and his winning chemistry with Richard Pryor in the   smash “Stir Crazy,” died early Monday morning at his home in Stamford, Conn. He was 83. A nephew, the filmmaker Jordan   confirmed his death in a statement, saying the cause was complications of Alzheimer’s disease. Mr. Wilder’s rule for comedy was simple: Don’t try to make it funny try to make it real. “I’m an actor, not a clown,” he said more than once. With his haunted blue eyes and an empathy born of his own history of psychic distress, he aspired to touch audiences much as Charlie Chaplin had. The Chaplin film “City Lights,” he said, had “made the biggest impression on me as an actor it was funny, then sad, then both at the same time. ” Mr. Wilder was an accomplished stage actor as well as a screenwriter, a novelist and the director of four movies in which he starred. (He directed, he once said, “in order to protect what I wrote, which I wrote in order to act. ”) But he was best known for playing roles on the big screen that might have been ripped from the pages of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. He made his movie debut in 1967 in Arthur Penn’s celebrated crime drama, “Bonnie and Clyde,” in which he was memorably hysterical as an undertaker kidnapped by the notorious   bank robbers played by Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty. He was even more hysterical, and even more memorable, a year later in “The Producers,” the first film by Mr. Brooks, who later turned it into a Broadway hit. Mr. Wilder played the    accountant Leo Bloom, who discovers how to make more money on a bad Broadway show than on a good one: Find rich backers, stage a production that’s guaranteed to fold fast, then flee the country with the leftover cash. Unhappily for Bloom and his fellow schemer, Max Bialystock, played by Zero Mostel, their outrageously tasteless musical, “Springtime for Hitler,” is a sensation. The part earned Mr. Wilder an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor. Within a few years, the anxious,   popeyed Mr. Wilder had become an unlikely movie star. He was nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance as the wizardly title character in “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory” (1971). The film was a   disappointment, partly because of parental concern that the moral of Roald Dahl’s story  —   that greedy, gluttonous children should not go unpunished  —   was too dark in the telling. But it went on to gain a devoted following, and Willy Wonka remains one of the roles with which Mr. Wilder is most closely identified. His next role was more adult but equally strange: an otherwise normal doctor who falls in love with a sheep named Daisy in a segment of Woody Allen’s “Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex but Were Afraid to Ask,” in 1972. Two years later, he reunited with Mr. Brooks for perhaps the two   entries in either man’s filmography. In “Blazing Saddles,” a raunchy,    spoof of Hollywood westerns, Mr. Wilder had the relatively quiet role of the Waco Kid, a boozy   who helps an improbable black sheriff (Cleavon Little) save a town from railroad barons and venal politicians. The film’s   humor may have lost some of its edge over the years, but Mr. Wilder’s next Brooks film, “Young Frankenstein,” has never grown old. Mr. Wilder himself hatched the idea, envisioning a    film faithful to the look of the Boris Karloff “Frankenstein,” down to the laboratory equipment, but played for laughs rather than for horror. He would portray an American man of science, the grandson of the infamous Dr. Frankenstein, who tries to turn his back on his heritage (“that’s   ”) but finds himself irresistibly drawn to Transylvania to duplicate his grandfather’s creation of a monster in a spooky mountaintop laboratory. Mr. Brooks’s original reaction to the idea, Mr. Wilder recalled, was noncommittal: “Cute. That’s cute. ” But he eventually came aboard as director and   and the two garnered an Oscar nomination for their screenplay. Serendipity played a role in the casting. Mr. Wilder’s agent asked him to help find work for two new clients, and thus Marty Feldman became Frankenstein’s assistant, Igor (“that’s  ”) and Peter Boyle the monster. Madeline Kahn, whose performance as the chanteuse Lili Von Shtupp had been a highlight of “Blazing Saddles,” played the doctor’s socialite fiancée. Cloris Leachman was Frau Blücher, the sound of whose name caused horses to whinny in fear. The name Blücher, Mr. Wilder said in a 2008 interview with The San Jose Mercury News, came from a book of letters to and from Sigmund Freud: “I saw someone named Blücher had written to him, and I said, ‘Well, that’s the name. ’” And Mr. Wilder certainly knew a lot about Freud. His first of many visits to a psychotherapist is the opening scene in the memoir he published in 2005, “Kiss Me Like a Stranger: My Search for Love and Art. ” “What seems to be the trouble?” the therapist asks. “I want to give all my money away,” he says. “How much do you have?” “I owe three hundred dollars. ” Soon the jokes and evasions give way to the torments of sexual repression, guilt feelings and his “demon,” a compulsion, lasting several years, to pray out loud to God at the most embarrassing times and in the most embarrassing places. But never onstage or onscreen, where he felt free to be someone else. Gene Wilder was born Jerome Silberman in Milwaukee on June 11, 1933. His father, William, a manufacturer and salesman of novelty items, was an immigrant from Russia. His mother, the former Jeanne Baer, suffered from rheumatic heart disease and a temperament that sometimes led her to punish young Jerry angrily and then smother him with regretful kisses. He spent one semester at the   Military Institute in Hollywood. His mother saw it as a great opportunity in reality, it was a catch basin for boys from broken families, where he was regularly beaten up for being Jewish. Safely back home after that misadventure, he played minor roles in community theater productions and then followed his older sister, Corinne, into the theater program at the University of Iowa. After Iowa, he studied Shakespeare at the Bristol Old Vic Theater School in England, where he was the first freshman to win the school fencing championship. He next enrolled part time at the HB Studio in New York, while also serving a   Army hitch as an aide in the psychiatric unit of the Valley Forge Army Hospital in Pennsylvania  —   an assignment he requested because, he said, “I imagined the things I would see there might relate more to acting than any of the other choices. ” He added, “I wasn’t wrong. ” After his discharge, he won a coveted spot at the Actors Studio, and it was then that he adopted the name Gene Wilder: Gene for Eugene Gant, the protagonist of Thomas Wolfe’s “Look Homeward, Angel,” and Wilder for the playwright Thornton Wilder. In his first major role on Broadway, Mr. Wilder played the chaplain in a 1963 production of Bertolt Brecht’s “Mother Courage and Her Children. ” The production ran for less than two months, and he came to believe that he had been miscast. The good news was that he met the boyfriend of the star, Anne Bancroft: Mel Brooks, who wore a pea coat the night he met Mr. Wilder backstage and told him, “You know, they used to call these urine jackets, but they didn’t sell. ” So began the conversation that ultimately led to “The Producers. ” Mr. Wilder’s association with Mr. Brooks led, in turn, to one with Richard Pryor, who was one of the writers of “Blazing Saddles” (and Mr. Brooks’s original choice for the part ultimately played by Mr. Little). In 1976, Mr. Pryor was   behind Mr. Wilder and Jill Clayburgh in “Silver Streak,” a comic thriller about murder on a transcontinental train. The two men went on to star in the 1980 hit “Stir Crazy,” in which they played a hapless pair jailed for a crime they didn’t commit, as well as “See No Evil, Hear No Evil” (1989) and “Another You” (1991). Mr. Wilder’s first two marriages, to Mary Mercier and Mary Joan Schutz, ended in divorce. In 1982, he met the “Saturday Night Live” comedian Gilda Radner when they were both cast in the suspense comedy “Hanky Panky. ” One evening, he recalled in “Kiss Me Like a Stranger,” he and Ms. Radner innocently ended up at his hotel to review some script changes. The time came for her to go instead, she shoved him down on the bed, jumped on top of him and announced, “I have a plan for fun!” He sent her home anyway  —   she was married to another man  —   but before long, they began a relationship. By his account, Ms. Radner was needy, obsessed with getting married and, once they married in 1984, obsessed with having a child, a project that ended in miscarriage just months before she learned she had ovarian cancer in 1986. Of their first year of living together, he wrote: “We didn’t get along well, and that’s a fact. We just loved each other, and that’s a fact. ” He left, only to find that he needed to go back. Ms. Radner died in 1989. “I had one great blessing: I was so dumb,” Mr. Wilder once said of her last years. “I believed even three weeks before she died she would make it. ” In memory of Ms. Radner, he helped to found an ovarian cancer detection center in her name, in Los Angeles, and Gilda’s Club, a network of support centers for people with cancer. He also contributed to a book, “Gilda’s Disease” (1998) with Dr. M. Steven Piver. Mr. Wilder himself developed  ’s lymphoma in 1999. With chemotherapy and a   transplant, he was in remission by 2005. In 1991 Mr. Wilder married Karen Boyer, a hearing specialist who had coached him in the filming of “See No Evil, Hear No Evil,” in which his character was deaf and Mr. Pryor’s was blind. She survives him, as does a daughter from an earlier marriage. His sister died in January. Even before he became ill, Mr. Wilder had begun slowing down. He made his first and last attempt at a television series, the   and   comedy “Something Wilder,” in 1994. He returned to the theater in 1997 in a London production of Neil Simon’s “Laughter on the 23rd Floor. ” In 1999 he was a writer for two TV movies in which he starred, “Murder in a Small Town” and “The Lady in Question,” playing a theater director turned amateur sleuth. In 2001 he appeared at the Westport Country Playhouse in Connecticut in a program of   farces. Shortly after appearing in an episode of “Will  Grace” in 2003  —   he won an Emmy for that role  —   he declared that he had retired from acting for good. “I don’t like show business, I realized,” he said in 2008. “I like show, but I don’t like the business. ” He was by then enjoying a new career as a novelist. His “My French Whore,” published in 2007, was the story of a naïve young American who impersonates a German spy in World War I. (“Just fluff, but sweet fluff,” the novelist Carolyn See wrote in her review in The Washington Post.) It was followed by two more novels, “The Woman Who Wouldn’t” and “Something to Remember You By,” and a story collection, “What Is This Thing Called Love?” But it was, of course, as an actor that Mr. Wilder left his most lasting mark. In his memoir, he posed a question about his life’s work, then answered it: “What do actors really want? To be great actors? Yes, but you can’t buy talent, so it’s best to leave the word ‘great’ out of it. I think to be believed, onstage or onscreen, is the one hope that all actors share. ”",0
17291,Interview: Andy Worthington On Final Push To Close Guantanamo,"President Barack Obama has less than 70 days to achieve one of the key goals that will define his legacy: close the Guantanamo Bay military prison. 
There are 60 prisoners at Guantanamo. Twenty of them were cleared by the Obama administration and could be freed. 
Of course, the specter of a Donald Trump presidency has those who pushed for the closure of Guantanamo frightened because Trump said he would bring new prisoners to the facility. What if Obama had closed the facility years ago? Would this even be a possibility? 
Joining me on the “Unauthorized Disclosure” podcast, journalist Andy Worthington talks to me about the final push to close Guantanamo. He is the co-founder of the “ Close Guantanamo ” campaign. He also is a musician, who wrote a song for his band, Four Fathers, about closing the military prison. His work can be found here .
The interview starts at the 30:00 mark. Later in the interview, we go on a bit of a tangent and spend a few minutes addressing the rise of far-right elements in the United States and the United Kingdom, particularly because Worthington is based in the U.K. 
Below is a partial transcript of the interview: 
GOSZTOLA: What do you plan to do during final days of President Obama’s presidency to push for the closure of Guantanamo, especially now that Donald Trump is president and open to torture and possibly even bringing more prisoners to Guantanamo? 
WORTHINGTON: I’ve been working on the Guantanamo issue for over ten years, and it’s always been my intention to try and get it closed. So, back in January 2012, when it was the tenth anniversary of the opening of the prison, I setup a campaign and website called “Close Guantanamo” with the attorney Tom Wilner, who represented the Guantanamo prisoners in their Supreme Court cases in 2004 and 2008. 
What we did this year, 2016, is we setup a countdown to close Guantanamo. So we counted down the last year of the presidency, and every 50 days we have these posters that they could print off that they could stand with, they could send in to us, and we put them on to the website and on social media. We’ve had over 500 celebrities and people across the U.S. and around the world sending in photos every 50 days. 
Of course, we’re now into the very last ten weeks of Obama’s presidency so what I am trying to do is just to keep the pressure on as we’ve been doing all year just to try and keep President Obama aware that people are watching. Obviously, he doesn’t need any telling. After the election result, it’s more urgent than ever. If he really does want to close the prison, he needs to do everything that he can in his power to do it before he leaves office because, as you say, Donald Trump has said on the campaign trail that he wants to keep it open. He wants to send Americans there to be prosecuted. He wants to reintroduce torture. 
Now, we also know that Donald Trump, to be generous, is a colossal windbag, and that it’s not necessarily true that the things he says he means. But he is now the president. The Republican Party that he nominally is the president of is in control of the Senate and the House, and there are some very unpleasant characters in the Republican Party, who love Guantanamo and who would love to reinstitute torture. 
I think it’s fair enough at this point for people to be genuinely worried that any progress that has been made toward the closure of Guantanamo is going to hit a very sticky patch with the inauguration of Donald Trump. 
GOSZTOLA: I get the real sense that we shouldn’t take any chances here, that perhaps the human rights community could get to Donald Trump and convince him that Guantanamo needs to be closed. We already see figures surrounding him like Rudy Giuliani and also, a quite goonish character, Tom Cotton, who is a senator, and former veteran, who has incredible bloodlust. 
WORTHINGTON: He’s a dreadful individual. It’s so out of control that kind of massive enthusiasm for Guantanamo and the hysteria and the exaggeration about the people who were held there. Any rational analysis of Guantanamo has always has always accepted there are a handful of significant people there, but the majority of people there never were. It’s awful the things he’s been saying. 
But you know, I’m really worried about the kind of people we’re hearing that are gathering around Donald Trump. I thought we’d seen the last of Rudy Giuliani and people like that. I’m hearing people mention John Bolton. Surely not. Surely, we’re not going to put up with him again. But who knows? 
GOSZTOLA: The neoconservatives, as they call them, ran away from Donald Trump, but it seems they may be coming back, as it’s their only way to have access to power. So let’s talk about the critical issue of the human beings, who still remain captive at Guantanamo. I know you’ve done some recent work on Abu Zubaydah. Just so people can have a case within our interview to think about, and to think about the critical importance of closing Guantanamo and what’s at stake, talk about how he was denied release and what we know about how he was treated. 
WORTHINGTON: I suppose I should really start out by breaking down who is at Guantanamo, these 60 men. Twenty of them have been approved for release by two review boards, one back in 2009. There are still a handful of men approved for release then, who haven’t actually been freed. The rest of them were approved by a review board that’s been taking place over the last few years, the Periodic Review Board, which is like a parole board. People have to demonstrate they show contrition for what they did, and they want to have constructive peaceful lives if they’re released. 
That process has been involving at Guantanamo, who isn’t already approved for release or facing trial. And just ten men are facing trials. So, at present, of those people held, there are 30 men, who have had these reviews, that have said on balance we’ve reviewed their cases and we’re still going to carry on holding them but we’re not putting them on trial. 
Abu Zubaydah is one of those people. He was the person that the Bush administration’s CIA torture program was created for. He was the first victim of that. He was someone who was outrageously hyped up by the Bush administration as somebody close to Osama bin laden, involved in 9/11 attacks. Number three in al Qaida was what they were saying at the beginning, even though there were people in the intelligence community who knew from the beginning that this simply was true about him
But they tortured him abominably, waterboarded him on 83 occasions, destroyed him in some ways. He has fits, is in a pretty terrible way. All of this was for somebody that was who they said he was. The U.S. government eventually backed down and said they didn’t think he knew about the 9/11 attacks. He wasn’t a member of al Qaida. They’re still trying to suggest that he was part of some kind of militia that would enable to say he was an enemy of the United States. 
The thing about Zubaydah is obviously, as with everybody held, the terrible things that happened should not have happened. Skilled interrogators would have been able to sit down with these guys without laying a finger on them and get information from them. Then we would have been able to have trials that would have been acceptable. But this is a kind of revisionism of history that didn’t happen—Terrible things happened instead.
This man was a facilitators for an independent training camp that had some involvement in militarily training and some people that were trained there it seems went away and became involved in plots. So it’s not that there isn’t a case against him on some level, but whether he actually constituted an enemy of the United States, I couldn’t really say. 
But there he is in Guantanamo, and like all these to moral or other degrees were mistreated and who may or may not have done things in some way against the United States, he’s had this review process, and they’ve said, well, no, we’re not going to approve him for release. He’s now eligible for further reviews, as are all the other men who had their ongoing imprisonment upheld. 
Now, these reviews were initiated several years ago by an executive order that President Obama. They involve the Defense Department, the intelligence agencies, all the major government departments. So it’s an ongoing process unless, of course, a new government decided they were not interested in them, and we don’t know where President-To-Be Donald Trump stands on the periodic review boards or where the people gathering around him stand on them. But I think it would be fair to say there will be a certain amount of hostility toward them. What I don’t know is how much within these departments of the kind of unchanging people who do the work, regardless of who the government is, how much there will be feedback within these various departments and agencies about what they think is the usefulness or not of reviewing people. 
I think it’s fair to say that we’re fortunate—those of us who want to see Guantanamo closed—that President Obama has done so much in recent years to reduce the population. 
GOSZTOLA: There’s been a lot of promising developments, especially in the last year, but at the last time, you see a real failure because now with the election of Donald Trump the Obama administration has left the door open for the military to keep using it as a facility. Right now, as I understand it, some of the camps are being transformed into mental health or hospital facilities. Still, easily, you could put the brakes on that. Donald Trump could use that again for what we already have read about in your reporting and other books. 
WORTHINGTON: I have to say, although the worst case scenario could happen in anything we think of, when we look at Donald Trump and these figures within the Republican Party who want power and influence—There are very strong arguments I suspect will be made by career bureaucrats, by lawyers, and certainly of course by NGOs. I would not expect silence from the liberal media. I would think there would be a lot of voices discussing very loudly how inappropriate it would be, for example, to send anyone new to Guantanamo. 
President Obama, to his credit, he always treated it as a legacy issue. He never sent anybody there. Every time that some terrorist suspect was apprehended, pretty much wherever it was, these Republicans, the kind of people now jockeying for power, would have been saying send this person to Guantanamo. Give him the works. Torture them. All of this stuff, and ridiculous, and he never did. 
This isn’t just some kind of humanitarianism that can be easily dismissed. The truth is if you apprehend a terrorism suspect and what to give them a trial then do it in federal courts. Because federal courts have a long and capable history of doing it. What everybody needs to remember and what even the great cheerleaders for Guantanamo actually know when you put them on the spot is that when Guantanamo was setup there were still federal court trials taking place successfully for people accused of terrorism. The same happened throughout the Obama administration. 
Really when you step back and look at it and strip away the hysteria, Guantanamo is an aberration. It’s a broken place that doesn’t work. It would be very hard to make a case. We’re not thankfully in the middle of a national emergency like we were in the wake of 9/11. 
There is no clear and present danger to the nation that would justify people saying, I know what the rules are that normally reply, but the thing that’s happening to us is so awful that we must throw away all those ways of behaving and do this terrible thing. There isn’t actually any pressure for doing that that is justifiable. I think that it would be difficult for them to justify it, and there would be a lot of resistance institutionally. But you know, who am I to know? If people take over with an aggression and craziness, it’s possible they can steamroll everything before them. 
GOSZTOLA: You also are a singer, and you have a band. I wanted to have you share the work you’ve been doing. It’s called the Four Fathers. You recorded a song particularly for the campaign to close Guantanamo.
WORTHINGTON: I’ve kind of revisited something I’ve done before, which is to sing about something of importance to me. You actually made a “Protest Song of The Week” awhile back, the song I wrote for Shaker Aamer who was the last British resident in Guantanamo who I was campaigning to release. I came up with another song fairly recently. Earlier this year was when I came up with it, about Guantanamo. 
That kind of fell into place that here’s this sunny, bouncy tune, which I think is probably appropriate for what this corner of the Caribbean should be, and then I basically just sang about what’s happened at Guantanamo since the prison was setup. I kind of distilled into verse what I’ve always understood about it—how the Bush administration chose it to be beyond the law, said they could torture and abuse people, when they tortured and abused people they told lies, they had the nerve to then present these lies that people told under torture and abuse as though they were the truth. 
And then the last verse of the song, which I’ve used in the campaign video for the “Close Guantanamo” campaign is about President Obama’s struggles to close Guantanamo and what seems to be his failure to be able to do so. I hope people will like the song. I think it tells the story well and in a good manner. It would be lovely if you could play it to your listeners.

17292,"A Grand Tour of Switzerland, Reluctant Son in Tow - The New York Times","Most Sunday mornings, throughout my childhood near Geneva, my father would drive me to a spot we had never been before. Switzerland occupies about 16, 000 square miles. Squeezed between France, Italy, Liechtenstein, Austria and Germany, it is divided into 26 cantons, each influenced by the country it is closest to. All are both fiercely independent and utterly loyal to the Swiss confederation. We explored much of the region where we lived, and that forged a nomadic spirit that has stayed with me. After high school, I moved to New York, where I’ve lived for the last 30 years. My father died in 2003 three weeks later, my son, Sébastien, was born. I began to long for the stunning Alpine landscapes of my youth. Whenever possible, we traveled back to my mother’s house in Genthod, near Geneva, but I yearned to share more with Sébastien as he grew. A dual citizen who spoke French at home, Sébastien, now 12, was curious about Switzerland. (He had been switching to English in our conversations, perhaps out of a growing preteen defiance.) So before   adolescence claimed him, I decided to take him around the country last summer. The plan was to choose   spots to evade the August crowds and explore cantons where each national language  —   French, Italian, German and Romansh  —   was spoken and celebrated. Going by train, I thought, would give us a chance to focus on each other and see the countryside at its most tranquil. Halfway through our journey, though, I wondered if we would make it to the end. “I’m bored to death,” said a breathless Sébastien as we hiked down through the steep terraced vineyards of Lavaux, between Lausanne and Vevey. Really? Below us, an undulating flow of greenery cascaded toward a perfectly still lake. On the other side, France was shrouded in sheer morning fog, pierced only by the colossal range of the Alps. Vineyards have existed on these slopes since Roman times, but monks planted most of the 2, 400 acres on   terraces during the 11th century. In 2007, the region’s terraced vineyards, deemed a “cultural landscape,” became a Unesco World Heritage site. But my son was furious. In order to catch the early train from Geneva to Vevey, I woke him, a risky endeavor. Somehow I had gotten him to leave his computer behind  —   no small feat. He puffed and grumbled until, seated at the Auberge de l’Onde, in the village of St.  I asked if he wanted to taste the wine. He perked up and we sipped the fruity, perky local chasselas. But it was the perch filets meunière that elicited the first smile of the day. I had high hopes for our next stop, Fribourg, a town founded in 1157 on a sandstone cliff, with a quirky bilingual identity, a Jean   de Saint Phalle gallery and a large student population. Alas, the gallery was closed and Sébastien was checked out. He plunged into his phone, and I left our hotel alone. On the cobblestone square, I was surprised to find several hundred soldiers in fatigues. Barely older than my son, these new recruits had just started their first mandatory stint in the Swiss Army and were listening to a speech on terrorism. It was reassuring to hear that Switzerland didn’t take its peace for granted (its last war was in 1847). “I’ll serve in Switzerland if they have a computer department,” Sébastien said at dinner, thrusting his long fork into the bubbly   fondue (half Gruyère, half Vacherin). I regaled him with memories of my father, who would don his uniform, pick up the rifle every soldier stored at home and head to the annual training course. The fastest way from Fribourg to Locarno, and its home canton of Ticino, actually led us through Italy. At the stop in Domodossola, 10 cars’ worth of travelers tried without success to squeeze into the rickety   train to Locarno. “Benvenuto in Italia!” I said, finally seated in a longer train that replaced the first. “You speak Italian?” Sébastien asked. “Sì,” I said, realizing he knew nothing of my years of study. Two hours later, we landed in Locarno, with its palm trees and bougainvillea. At lunch, I showed off, babbling with the restaurant owner to persuade him to make a pasta sampler for my hungry tween. “How do you say, ‘cool’?” Sébastien asked. Our next destination was Swissminiatur, a park in Melide, on Lake Lugano (one of over 130 lakes in Ticino) that houses miniature models of Swiss monuments. We hopped on two more trains for a few minutes each to get there. As a youngster, I had taken the precision of the train system for granted, but now with a tight schedule, I was grateful. “That’s attention to detail,” said Sébastien, admiring the model of Geneva’s St. Pierre Cathedral. “Andiamo al lido! Let’s go to the beach,” I said on our way out. It turned out to be more a lawn than a beach, but soon we were bobbing along in the cool water. For centuries, artists and writers have lauded the beauty of the Swiss lakes. “The mirror where the stars and mountains view   the stillness of their aspect in each trace,” Lord Byron wrote. To me, the opaline ripples hold memories of my father, who sailed competitively, beating Ted Turner at the 5. 5 meter 1972 world championship. On Sunday nights, he would bring home twisted, drenched spinnakers to   all over the house, forming silky red or blue labyrinths. That night in nearby Morcote, the skies opened, and we admired the running of the waiters, umbrella in one hand and steaming pasta dish in the other. We wouldn’t see the sun until more than a whole day later, in   in the canton of Graubünden, where Romansh, a descendant of Latin, is spoken. And it was on the way there, crawling under steady rain, that Sébastien asked if he could go home. Too many trains and the steady pull of his “internet friends” had worn him down. As I pointed to one vista after another, he barely looked up from his phone. Had I been more sensitive to the beauty of the landscapes at age 12? Probably not. I pondered if we should abort the trip, but decided to stick with it. The next day, I woke up to the clicks of a camera. “Trying the panorama,” he said, pointing his phone out the window. We were staying at the Hotel Waldhaus   a stately white chateau with green shutters, built in 1908 and still owned by the same family. The trick was to capture the steely gray Lake Sils, Lake Silvaplana and the rocky Piz Corvatsch mountain in the same frame. Downstairs, the breakfast buffet was a study in satisfying Swiss cuisine: mountain cheese, redolent of summer grass bündnerfleisch (    beef) and even a honeycomb the size of a road map. “It’s the Grand Budapest Hotel,” Sébastien said. It seemed he was in a better mood. The serious hikers had already left, but Werner Zinsli, a local guide, was waiting. “Allegra!” he said in Romansh, and as we hiked toward the    Val Fex, he recounted the struggle to keep this local language alive. The faint chime of cowbells accompanied our steps. A light wind breathed through immense larch trees. This was the ideal Alpine landscape  —   silvery river below, ice tongues and patches of snow above  —   that inspired Nietzsche, who summered in the area. “See Maienfeld on the other side?” said Mr. Zinsli to Sébastien. “That’s the village that inspired the author of ‘Heidi’. ” (He didn’t quite have it right: The village was Grevasalvas, a location for the TV version of “Heidi. ”) After two hours, we refueled with rösti and local bratwurst served outside Hotel Fex on a     tablecloth. “What’s going on here?” asked Sébastien a day later, as we rolled our bags through the village of Appenzell, a mere 12 miles from Austria. Couples of all ages, some in lederhosen and traditional dresses, danced joyously to the sound of accordions, trumpets and string instruments. Farther away, we heard a choir’s wrenching yodels, traditional wordless songs alternating between falsetto and chest voice. Between the geraniums in the windows, the immaculately painted facades and the costumes, we seemed to have stumbled onto a theater set. “It’s a Dr. Seuss scene,” Sébastien said. But we found Appenzell and its folk music festival endearing. At dinner we munched on macaroni with creamy Appenzeller cheese at   Appenzell, on the wide Landsgemeindeplatz, the village square where inhabitants come together on the last Sunday of April to vote we discussed direct democracy and how the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden was the last of the 26 cantons to grant women the right to vote on   issues in 1991. It seemed fitting to end with the world’s steepest cogwheel railway up Mount Pilatus near Lucerne. We heard marmots cry on the way up, and at dusk we encountered our first ibex, the mountain goat that haunted the folktales of my childhood. “Cool,” Sébastien said. I never again brought up his desire to get home early, and he didn’t, either. I had pretended to be strong and steadfast. And that was all he needed. A Swiss Travel Pass (swisstravelsystem. com) provides access to all rail, boat and bus travel, as well as 50 percent off most mountain excursions. The price depends on the number of consecutive travel days, and the family card can be added free if one parent purchases one adult Swiss Travel Pass. For example, for eight days, the adult fare is $388 in second class $621 in first. Children and adults will enjoy strolling through Swissminiatur (Via Cantonale, Melide      swissminiatur. ) whether they recognize the monuments or not. We enjoyed cooling off at the Lido di Melide (Via alla Bola 10, Melide      melide. ch) an enclosed resort area with a cafe and playground. The Engadin region (engadin. stmoritz. ch) has many trails for hikers of all levels. Our   walk in the Fex Valley was a nice introduction. Most travelers hop to the summit of Mount Pilatus (pilatus. ch) on the cogwheel train (May to November) or cable car, and come back down. But spending the night at 7, 000 feet brought me my very first ibex sighting. Hôtel Au Sauvage (  12, Fribourg       . ch) is a family owned boutique hotel set in the lower part of the old town, steps from the bucolic River Sarine. Doubles start at 240 Swiss francs, or about $247. Albergo della Posta (Piazza Grande, Morcote     . ) is a simple inn with a superb terrace hanging over Lake Lugano. Doubles start at 110 francs. We loved the Waldhaus Hotel   (Via da Fex 3,         . ) for its stunning views, but also its   family run hospitality. Doubles start at 480 francs. There’s probably no better seat to watch the historic annual voting session in April on the Landsgemeindeplatz than the flowery   Appenzell (Hauptgasse 37, Appenzell       . ch) where doubles start at 250 francs. It’s worth spending the night at Hotel   (Schlossweg 1, Kriens      pilatus.    ) for the sunset and to catch a sighting of ibex or marmots out in the meadows. Doubles from 170 francs. Lunch for two at the brasserie at L’Auberge de l’Onde (Chemin Neuf, St.       aubergedelonde. ) starts at 60 francs. We had trouble finishing the “small” portion of the   fondue (25 francs) at Café du Midi (Rue de Romont, 25      lemidi. ch). Lunch served outside in the middle of the Fex Valley at Hotel Restaurant Fex (Fexerstrasse 73,       . ch) was a highlight. Lunch for two from 42 francs.",0
17293,Love Trumps Hate: GoFundMe To Rebuild Church Torched By Trump Supporter SHATTERS Fundraising Records,"Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr 
Just one week before America decides whether or not to elect Donald Trump, one of his supporters decided to help get his message out by torching a black church and defacing its wall with the words “Vote Trump.” 
“When firefighters arrived at Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church Tuesday night, they found it in flames, and the Vote Trump slogan written in silver spray paint on the outside wall of the church,” Mark Rigsby of Mississippi Public Broadcasting reports. 
“Greenville Mayor Errick Simmons calls this a hate crime — an attempt to frighten voters just days before the presidential election.” 
Trump has yet to condemn the attack, or even mention it. 
Mississippi has been the host of many decades of violence directed at African Americans. During the Jim Crow era, acts of terror committed against black Mississippians was disturbingly common. It seems for at least one Trump supporter, the term “Make American Great Again” means returning to that dark time. 
But rather than let this disgusting display of intolerance be the story, Americans got to work. In just hours, a verified GoFundMe account was set up by concerned citizens and thousands of dollars began to pour in to help rebuild. 
It’s goal was to raise $10,000. It likely wouldn’t be enough to repair all of the damages inside and outside of the church, but it would be a start. Instead, people gave over $150,000. And perhaps even more remarkably, the entire world appeared ready to reject the deplorable racism and bigotry that led to this act. The campaign’s organizer updated the campaign by saying that people from all faiths (and none at all) and many countries have contributed: 
Responses have been pouring in from all over the world, and they’re truly extraordinary. Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, atheists and many more, from all over the United States and many other countries. 
And according to GoFundMe’s VP of Communications and Policy Dan Pfeiffer, this campaign is perhaps the fastest growing in the history of the site. This one right here is verified and one of our fastest growing history https://t.co/E4smWW2s7d https://t.co/xIQWY4ulsV

A slogan that has often been used to counter Trump’s message of cynical bigotry comes to mind: Love trumps hate.

17295,The End of Relaxation - The New York Times,"We live in the golden age of wellness vacations, where taking time off is all about becoming a better person. When I was 22, I used to have a fantasy about going away to a sanitarium, like in “The Magic Mountain. ” I would do nothing but sit on balconies, wrapped in steamer rugs, and go to the doctor, avoiding the rigors of the real world and emerging after a short period brighter, happier, better. I’m beginning to think this was a prescient impulse. Over the decades we have embraced a widening and diverse array of practices and traditions, but the idea that we can be improved  —   in mind, body or spirit  —   has remained a constant. That this could be accomplished with money and in an allotted parcel of time has become increasingly popular with a generation reared in a maximalist minimalist moment that, as with fashion and interior design, demands grandiose,   freedom from the world. If stuff was once an indicator of security, now the very lack of it  —   of dust, of furniture, of body fat, of errant thoughts  —   defines aspiration. A glamorous    exercise in pricey   has become the logical way to spend one’s leisure time. We live in a golden age of the “wellness vacation,” a sort of hybrid retreat, boot camp, spa and roving therapy session that, for the cost of room and board, promises to refresh body and mind and send you back to your life more whole. Pravassa, a “wellness travel company,” summarizes its (trademarked) philosophy as “Breathe. Experience. Move. Mindfulness. Nourish. ” (The Kripalu Center for Yoga  Health, a wellness retreat in New England, boasts the eerily similar tagline: “Breathe. Connect. Move. Discover. Shine. ”) A   trip to Thailand with Pravassa includes a travel guide  —   who works, in her day job, as a “  psychotherapist” in Atlanta  —   as well as temple pilgrimages at dawn and, more abstractly, the potential to bring all that mindfulness back home with you. Selfies are not only allowed but encouraged. Whatever happened to a good book and a martini? If in the recent past people’s idea of a vacation conjured images of Caribbean resorts and swingers’ parties, the idea of taking time off as a means of   still has strong precedents. For as long as Americans have worked regular hours, many have tried to make good spiritual use of their time off. As Cindy Aron explains in her comprehensive “Working at Play: A History of Vacations in the United States,” the modern notion of “vacation” was initially the purview of the wealthy, and inextricably bound up with the idea of health. Hubs like Niagara or Saratoga were wholesome retreats from the dirt (and populations) of cities, where the air and water were both rarefied. In the   century, a class of   vacationers emerged and gradually changed the   retreats into the more democratic  —   and    —   destinations we know today. The concept of a purely fun break came later. Spiritual retreats were less   and, when under the rubric of religious communities (as many of the 19th and 20th centuries were) actively salutary. The new wellness vacations are a kind of steroidal response to movements like Chautauqua, founded by Methodists in the 19th century to encourage lifelong learning and spiritual growth. In beautiful compounds, attendees could  —   and indeed, still can  —   take classes and hear music and sermons. For many   Americans, the opportunity for continuing education, communion with nature and polite, wholesome society  —   absent of evils like alcohol or dancing  —   would have been a luxury indeed. But sophisticates like Sinclair Lewis and H. L. Mencken mocked the earnestness of communities like Chautauqua Lewis described this   learning as “nothing but wind and chaff and . .. the laughter of yokels. ” Lewis is lucky that those early Chautauquans didn’t have smartphones. The wellness vacation in its current form is all the easier to mock: As has ever before been the case, spirituality plus money makes for an open target, but add in the fact that nothing really counts today unless everyone witnesses it. If an enlightenment retreat happens in a forest and nobody’s there to Instagram the sunrise, does it even exist? Our idea of spirituality and mindfulness also includes the attempt to project these ideas by distilling them to images of   multihued   juices and toned women striking poses in silhouette against stunning natural backdrops. If this projection is a mark of sophistication and privilege, so much the better. The humanist founders of Esalen were genuinely dedicated to the expansion of consciousness that the Big Sur retreat should become a byword for trendy spiritual   (and an ambivalent punch line on “Mad Men”) is a sign of its importance. As ideas, like the “Pray” portion of Elizabeth Gilbert’s popular book, move into the cultural mainstream and lose their purity  —   as they become inextricably tied up with capitalism, really  —   it’s easy for us,   to sneer. I, however, get the appeal. For all the spiritual work, and all the hikes, and all the sunrise yoga, and all the   once you get there, as with my childhood sanitarium fantasy, you don’t have to make many decisions. Wellness vacations are planned for you, companions allocated, menus chosen. Even your breathing is dictated. We crave direction helplessness is truly the ultimate luxury, a philosophy that has by now entered the mainstream. And yet, read another way, the point is to pay people to wait on you, while feeling great about it. But why should anyone be blamed for wanting to, quite literally, better themselves? Karl Lagerfeld counts exercise and vacations as two of the many things he despises. More mysteriously, I once heard Werner Herzog give a talk in which he dismissed the notion of yoga practice, saying definitively, “It’s not my culture. ” Clearly, to the elderly German director, there is something inherently distasteful in the notion that you could take up an ancient practice, throw in some expensive leggings and call yourself evolved. Then again, the Germans gave us the “The Magic Mountain,” and the resort on which Mann based his fictional sanitarium now houses participants at the World Economic Forum in Davos.",0

17299,"Melvin Dwork, Once Cast From Navy for Being Gay, Dies at 94 - The New York Times","When the M. P. s came for him in 1944, Melvin Dwork was in class, a    gay Navy enlisted man in officer candidate school in Charleston, S. C. His companion, under arrest in New Orleans, had given him away. Jailed, found “deviant” by psychiatrists, he was discharged in World War II as “undesirable. ” The word stuck in his craw after the war, an insult that never went away. As years passed, Mr. Dwork became a successful interior designer in New York City, and he and a prominent choreographer were companions for many years. He eventually forgave the man who betrayed him, but not the Navy. In 2011, after years of trying to remove the blot on his record, Mr. Dwork, supported by advocates for gay and lesbian military personnel and veterans, won his point. The Navy officially changed his discharge to honorable. “It meant an awful lot to me because I know I never did anything disgraceful or dishonest,” Mr. Dwork said in a 2014 interview for this obituary, in which he spoke of painful military policies and glacially slow changes toward gay and lesbian service members. Mr. Dwork, who became a hero to gay people for his persistence in fighting the dishonorable discharge, died on Tuesday in Manhattan, Alan Salz, the executor of his estate, said. He was 94. Mr. Dwork was believed to be the first veteran of World War II to have an “undesirable” discharge for being gay expunged, although his case may have opened the floodgates for appeals in hundreds of similar cases. His was resolved shortly before the military ended its    “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, which barred openly gay people from service but prohibited discrimination against those not open about their sexuality. While gay men and lesbians were explicitly barred by the military during World War II, many were quietly admitted to serve, especially in the war’s early stages to meet enlistment quotas, with a tacit understanding that they would be discreet. But later in the war purges rose, and Mr. Dwork and his companion were caught in them. Both men were inducted in 1942 and, in 1943, they joined the Navy hospital corps, which was known to be more tolerant of gays. Mr. Dwork worked at the Naval Hospital at Parris Island, S. C. His partner, whom Mr. Dwork would never publicly identify, went to New Orleans. They exchanged love letters and phone calls, and once had a discreet rendezvous. With excellent work ratings, Mr. Dwork applied for officer candidate school and, in 1944, was accepted for classes at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston. Gay friends warned him and his companion to forgo exchanging letters because of the dangers of exposure in campaigns against gays. “We stopped writing, but it was too late,” Mr. Dwork said. At the time of his arrest, he believed that intercepted letters had given them away. He said it was not until many years later that he learned that his partner had been arrested, and had identified Mr. Dwork under the pressure of prolonged interrogations. “I had not taken many classes when the military police came for me,” Mr. Dwork recalled. “They took me to the brig originally, then to the psychiatric brig. They kept me there for weeks. “It was not pleasant, I can tell you that. The doctors were freakish. The psychiatrists were so stupid and asked such stupid questions. It was disgusting. They had no feeling for who I was and why I was there. ” After his discharge, Mr. Dwork returned to New York. He studied at the Parsons School of Design, worked for antiques dealers and from 1956 to 1959 was a partner in   a decorating and antiques concern. He assisted the designer Yale R. Burge in the 1960s and was a design partner of James Maguire in the early 1970s. He then worked independently for many clients, including the RCA chairman Robert W. Sarnoff and the film director Milos Forman. His work was featured in The New York Times, House  Garden, Town  Country and Architectural Digest. In 1993, he was inducted into the Interior Design Hall of Fame. Mr. Dwork said that he and John Butler, a choreographer and former dancer with the Martha Graham Dance Company, were companions and friends from 1961 until Mr. Butler’s death in 1993. After failing on his own to overturn the Navy’s “undesirable” discharge, Mr. Dwork got help from the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, founded in 1993 to fight discrimination against gay and lesbian military personnel affected by the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy. It interceded on his behalf. On Aug. 17, 2011, the Board for Correction of Naval Records in Arlington, Va. changed Mr. Dwork’s discharge to honorable. A record of the proceedings, obtained by The Associated Press, said the Navy had undergone a “radical departure” from its wartime ban on gays. It noted Mr. Dwork’s “exemplary period of active duty” and said it was acting “in the interests of justice. ” Melvin Dwork was born in Kansas City, Mo. on Feb. 9, 1922, one of four children of Henry Dwork and the former Esther Brown. He graduated from Southeast High School in 1939 and attended the Kansas City Art Institute for two years. After moving to New York, he attended the Parsons School in 1941 and 1942. On a summer break, he returned to Kansas City and met his wartime partner. Their plans for a life together were obliterated by the war and their exposure in the crackdown on gay servicemen. Mr. Dwork, who lived in Manhattan, is survived by a brother, Irvin. A documentary on his case, “The Undesirable,” was made by Michael Jacoby. It has not been released. The ruling on Mr. Dwork’s discharge entitled him to veterans benefits, including a military burial. But he said he probably would forgo that honor. Years after Mr. Butler’s death, Mr. Dwork and his wartime partner met to catch up on the passage of six decades. The partner had married and had children, but had never told his family about Mr. Dwork. “He had always denied his sexuality,” Mr. Dwork said. “He didn’t want to be exposed. After all those years in denial, and your own family doesn’t know who you are? I said: ‘Let them know. They’ll love you anyway.’ But he couldn’t do it. I forgave him, but we don’t speak any longer. ”",0
17300,Trick Or Treat: FBI Found 650.000 Emails on Weiner's Laptop,"
Shock report! 650,000 emails were found on Anthony Weiner’s laptop that he shared with his wife Huma Abedin.
Abedin is Hillary Clinton’s longtime personal assistant.
That’s a lot of emails!
Zero Hedge reported:
Yesterday, we reported that the FBI has found “ tens of thousands of emails ” belonging to Huma Adein on Anthony Weiner’s computer, raising questions how practical it is that any conclusive finding will be available or made by the FBI in the few days left before the elections
Now, according to the WSJ , it appears that Federal agents are preparing to scour roughly 650,000 emails that, as we reported moments ago were discovered weeks ago on the laptop of Anthony Weiner , to see how many relate to a prior probe of Hillary Clinton’s email use, as metadata on the device suggests there may be thousands sent to or from the private server that the Democratic nominee used while she was secretary of state, according to people familiar with the matter.
As the WSJ adds, the review will take weeks at a minimum to determine whether those messages are work-relatedemails between Huma Abedin, a close Clinton aide and the estranged wife of Mr. Weiner, and State Department officials; how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and whether they include either classified information or important new evidence in the Clinton email probe, which FBI officials call “Midyear.”
And, as we further reported earlier today , the FBI has had to await a court order to begin reviewing the emails, because they were uncovered in an unrelated probe of Mr. Weiner, and that order was delayed for reasons that remain unclear.
More stunning is just how many emails were found on Weiner’s computer. And while one can only imagine the content of some of the more persona ones, the WSJ writes that the latest development began in early October when New York-based FBI officials notified Andrew McCabe, the bureau’s second-in-command, that while investigating Mr. Weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a minor, they had recovered a laptop with 650,000 emails. Many, they said, were from the accounts of Ms. Abedin, according to people familiar with the matter.
** One-Third of likely voters are less likely to vote for Hillary Clinton following the announcement of a new FBI criminal investigation.
Democrats are going psycho right now as they are in full panic mode. Expect ANYTHING from them now, BUT disregard and ignore any stunt they may pull. Remember this was a prophetic prediction and warning!

17301,California Today: Hollywood History vs. ‘Souvenir Junk’ - The New York Times,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Sign up.) Let’s turn it over to Adam Nagourney, our Los Angeles bureau chief, for today’s introduction. For many tourists, Los Angeles is Hollywood. And Hollywood is Hollywood Boulevard, with the Walk of Fame, the celebrity stars in the sidewalk, the Egyptian Theater, and of course, the corner of Hollywood and Vine. But truth be told, for all its history and kitsch, Hollywood Boulevard is also a place of street performers dressed up as   hustling passing tourists, impassable sidewalks, street vendors and the occasional crime that draws of    attention, to the consternation of civic boosters. Despite all that, Alison Martino, who has popular a Facebook page celebrating old Hollywood, was horrified last week when she came across a photograph that showed souvenir vendor stands had overtaken one of the most venerable attractions on Hollywood Boulevard: the courtyard at the TCL Chinese Theater, where movie stars celebrate their fame by leaving handprints in cement. Ms. Martino posted the photograph with an indignant message to her page, which has over 260, 000 followers. “If you’re looking for the handprints and signatures of Jean Harlow or Lana Turner, they’re covered up with all these carts full of souvenir junk,” she wrote. “How incredibly disrespectful. If Lucy and Ethel were to try and steal John Wayne’s footprints today, they couldn’t even find it!” The reaction was not all negative. Escott O. Norton, the head of the Los Angeles Historical Theatre Foundation, said in his own Facebook post that he did not “see it as the disaster that some are making of it. ” He added, “The owners of the Chinese are very careful with the historic Forecourt and I have met with them specifically about it. ” Nonetheless, it drew a flood of attention. “I’ve never seen, in six years that I’ve run this page, this kind of emotional reaction as I’ve seen to the junk carts on this sacred ground,” Ms. Martino said. “It’s a cemetery. ” By Monday, the vendors had disappeared, presumably asked to move by the Chinese theater. The owners did not respond to a request for comment. It was impossible to determine if this was just a temporary clearance or a permanent new policy. Next up? The street performers. “It’s a freak show,” Ms. Martino said. “Now that we’ve had a victory in the Forecourt, let’s clean up the Hollywood Walk of Fame. ” See reporting in The New York Times on the Nov. 8 ballot initiatives: Proposition 51 (a new school bond) | Proposition 56 (cigarette tax) | Proposition 60 (condoms in adult film) | Propositions 62 and 66 (death penalty questions) | Propositions 65 and 67 (on banning plastic bags).

Ms. Gray, a postdoctoral student, was traveling through an area of the country that has been engulfed by antigovernment demonstrations when a mob threw stones at the vehicle she was riding in, striking her in the head, officials said. Details of the attack remained unclear, said Savithramma   the chairman of the U. C. Davis plant biology department. “Sharon was such a bright human being,” Ms. Gray’s family said in a statement provided by her husband, RJ Cody Markelz. “We have been so lucky to have shared part of our lives with her. ” Ethiopia has been wracked by protests since late 2015 with hundreds of thousands of people flooding the streets to demand fair land distribution and political change. The government’s response has been ruthless, human rights groups say, leaving hundreds of people dead. In recent days, crowds have attacked several vehicles in the wake of a stampede last weekend that killed more than 50 people, Reuters reported. Ms. Gray was traveling with Siobhan Brady, an associate professor in U. C. Davis’s plant biology department, who was unhurt and en route back to the United States, university officials said. The State Department was arranging for Ms. Gray’s body to be flown out as well, Professor   said. Ms. Gray was trying to understand how climate change was affecting plant life, and traveled to Ethiopia to attend a meeting about her research. Ms. Gray grew up in the Chicago area. She earned her undergraduate and doctoral degrees from the University of Illinois   and in 2013 joined the plant biology department in Davis. In 2014, she was married to Mr. Markelz, also a postdoctoral researcher at U. C. Davis, at a lodge surrounded by pine trees in Oglesby, Ill. “She was destined for a great future,” Professor   said. “We knew she was going to be some kind of star in plant biology. ” He added that Ms. Gray was also endlessly upbeat. “Everybody liked her,” he said. Ms. Gray’s family set up a GoFundMe   in her honor aimed at mentoring young women in science. California Today goes live at 6 a. m. Pacific time weekdays.

when i awoke this morning the Dow Jones Propaganda Index was down 72 points…then in a matter of only a few minutes it inexplicably reverse ramped almost 100 points to turn positive… 
it was then that i decided to scour the Lamestream media, Alt-Media, and lastly ZeroHedge headlines to uncover what could be behind such a preposterous, absolutely fraudulent spike across all the Fraud indices… 
however before i could conclude my inquiry the DJPI spiked another 50 plus points to recapture the all important, CON fidence inspiring 18,200 mark coincidentally beginning exactly in the last 30 minutes of “trading” in the EuroPeon cesspool of fraud and manipulation - Londone… 
it was then that i realized that what had occurred was the same bullshit i’ve witnessed for the last 5-7 years running…that being that the Fraud Markets ramped on ABSOLUTLEY NO GENUINE POSITIVE MACRO-ECONOMIC, GEO-POLITICAL NEWS OR DATA WHATSOFUCKINGEVER… 
at that moment , roughly 9:14 am, i realized that for todays ""Fraud Markets Wrap” to be posted latter in the day, i could simply “cut & paste“ from previous commentaries regarding what the rest of the day would portend because as i and many others have learned - “When the same bullshit happens every day there’s no need to type…just cut and paste…” - Kaiser Sousa - 
so thats precisely what i did… ""then, of course yet again all of the U.S. Fraud Indices entered into the sideways shuffle, ridiculous narrow “trading” pattern you all now as “suspended levitation” for the bulk of the day…” - Kaiser Sousa - from every day the last 2 years. http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/djia 
then in the famous last 2 hours of “trading”, and despite the “markets” coughing up the phony reversal implemented by “you know who”,they nonetheless fought to the death to hold on to those “green shoots” with “investors” piling into such noted bail weathers like , BOEING, NIKE, GE, and DISNEY pushing the DJPI back above the 18,200 mark… proving that the recovery in the land of the “exceptional’s” continues to shower its’ waiters, bartenders, fast food servers, and interest income starved senior citizens with generational wealth and prosperity for all… 
lastly, as for the blatant attempts to hold the phony paper prices of Gold & Silver within ridiculous “trading ranges” while the global financial and monetary system crumbles before “eyes that dare to see” alike every fiat currency (WITHOUT EXCEPTION!!) has throughout history - lets just say this…how much more obvious can the Fed, Exchange Stabilization Fund, ThreadNeddle St. inbreeds, and Scum St. flunkies make it for you

17303,Police to Strengthen Force in New York’s Most Violent Borough - The New York Times,"The New York Police Department on Wednesday announced plans to send 75 new investigators to the Bronx to address a steep and longstanding shortage of detectives in the department’s most violent and underserved borough. The chief of detectives, Robert K. Boyce, told city lawmakers at a hearing that the influx was aimed at easing enormous caseloads, which retired police leaders say have hindered investigative work in the Bronx for decades. Homicides in New York City have been falling, but the department’s plans for the Bronx reflect a growing recognition by police chiefs in cities experiencing upticks in murder that heavy caseloads let crimes go unsolved and feed a cycle of street violence. The plan for the infusion of resources comes five weeks after The New York Times published an analysis of confidential deployment data showing that precinct detectives in the Bronx last year carried more than twice as many violent felony cases on average as detectives in Manhattan or on Staten Island, and over 50 percent more than those in Brooklyn or Queens. The new deployment is a significant investment in   investigative work for parts of the Bronx that have not experienced the same improvements in overall crime rates in recent decades as wealthier parts of the city, especially at a time when detective resources are increasingly pulled toward counterterrorism operations. Department leaders, who for years have kept deployment information under wraps even amid major budgetary decisions, acknowledged in frank terms on Wednesday that parts of the city remained in need. “We saw that some of the detective squads up there are more than just a little bit challenged,” Chief Boyce said of the Bronx. “They’re flooded with more cases than they were last year. ” Police supervisors in the Bronx embraced the news of the reinforcements, known as   investigators, a class of officers who are training to become   detectives. Working under experienced detectives, the investigators often shoulder the more   tasks, like canvassing buildings for witnesses and searching for video. After 18 months, they become eligible to be promoted to detectives. “It’s great, this new wave of young, inspired police officers who want to be detectives,” said a   commander in the Bronx who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk about departmental deployment decisions. “Not only are you building the present, but you are building the future,” the commander added. “And it is good for the Bronx. ” The Times’s deployment analysis grew out of a series of articles about murder in the 40th Precinct, a    section of the South Bronx where three detectives last year carried more than 400 cases and many others had loads in the high 300s, markedly more than the 150 cases per year the department recommends for precincts with high rates of violent crime. Chief Boyce said Wednesday that about 40 of the city’s 77 precincts needed additional help to meet caseload goals. In the Bronx, he said, the 40th and the 47th, covering Wakefield and Williamsbridge, were especially burdened, some of that owing to increases in crime there last year. The department has already identified and interviewed the 75 new investigators and will send them to squads by the end of the month, Chief Boyce said. Six of them will be sent to the 40th Precinct, in addition to three detectives and one investigator added in   giving the squad a total of 33 detectives and investigators. The Times analysis last year focused on detectives and deliberately excluded   investigators because they are in training and primarily act in support roles. Police officials and elected leaders said that adding   investigators, although not as quick a fix as transferring detectives from one precinct to another, was more politically palatable and would have a lasting impact. The investigators, once promoted, typically stay in the same precinct squads where they were trained. The district attorney in the Bronx, Darcel D. Clark, said she was “very pleased” with the plan. “The people of the Bronx have been underserved too long,” Ms. Clark said. After the publication of the Times article in December, she said, she asked her office’s bureau chiefs to submit ideas for addressing the paucity in investigative resources and pressed Chief Boyce to add detectives. Ms. Clark worried that the understaffing scared off witnesses  —   who did not believe the police could protect them  —   from testifying. Michael J. Palladino, the head of the union representing New York City’s 5, 500 detectives, said that even 75 new investigators was only a first step. “Chief Boyce would like nothing more than to have a few hundred extra white shields for assignment to Bronx detective squads, but budget constraints prevent that,” Mr. Palladino said. “Getting its complement of the allotment will help the 40th Detective Squad, but historically speaking, that precinct seems resistant to crime strategies. ” Chief Boyce characterized the influx to the Bronx as a specific response to high crime and caseloads there, not as a way to fill a gap because of attrition or routine transfers. Other cities, like Boston, have improved their arrest rates by adding detectives and augmenting them with more civilian crime analysts. New York City’s Independent Budget Office has pointed out recently that the department has left empty jobs that were authorized for civilians and kept   officers in other jobs that were fit for civilians, effectively tying up officers who could otherwise do   or investigative work. Elected leaders and watchdogs have struggled to gain a clear understanding of the Police Department’s staffing and the decision making behind deployment practices. Many said Wednesday’s hearing was the first time they got specific answers, and they vowed to pursue legislation to require the department to regularly report staffing and arrest rates. “Clearly this is a backhanded acknowledgment that a problem existed,” said the city’s public advocate, Letitia James. She said the department needed to focus more on “open cases in our underserved communities,” especially in the Brownsville and East New York neighborhoods of Brooklyn and the South Bronx. “It should not have taken investigations done by others to reveal inequities in police resources,” Ms. James said. Vanessa Gibson, a City Council member from the Bronx who presided over Wednesday’s hearing, said that Bronx cases were especially difficult to solve because of drug and gang ties and that, as a result, “sometimes it’s hard to attract detectives in the Bronx. ” Jumaane Williams, a council member from Brooklyn, said that for several years he had been seeking data on the size of boroughwide homicide squads, which often work with precinct squads on   homicides, and that he had not gotten direct answers until Wednesday. Chief Boyce said the Bronx had fewer homicide detectives than Manhattan or Queens despite having more than twice as many murders as either borough, although he said Manhattan detectives also worked on nonfatal shootings.",0

If you want to see war without end, vote for Hillary Clinton. 
It is tremendously ironic that Hillary Clinton and the mainstream media have attempted to portray Donald Trump as “dangerous” and “temperamental” because it is Clinton who actually has a long history of being emotionally unstable. She has a temper that is absolutely legendary, and she has been cussing out the men and women in her security detail for decades. 
Hillary Clinton played a key role in starting the civil war in Syria, thanks to her Libya is a post-apocalyptic wasteland today, and now she is picking a fight with the Russians before she has even won the election. Of all the candidates there were running for president this election cycle, there was nobody that was even close to as dangerous as Hillary Clinton, and if she wins the election, I am fully convinced that World War III will begin before her time in the White House is over. 
Someone that shares this opinion with me is Donald Trump. According to Reuters, Trump recently stated that we are “going to end up in World War III over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton”:",0
17305,US Abstains From UN Vote Against Cuba Embargo,"Embargo Remains Politically Contentious Within the US   
For the first time ever, the US has abstained from the UN vote denouncing the ongoing US embargo of Cuba. The resolution passed through the general assembly 191-0, with the US and Israel the only ones abstaining. 
The UN has been voting overwhelmingly against the embargo for decades, but it is only in the past year that President Obama has started to criticize the embargo himself, and has sought to ease a lot of the long-standing restrictions on the island nation. 
The matter is hugely politically contentious within the US, however, with many in the Republican Congress condemning the White House for easing the restrictions, and the Congressional leadership so far preventing any more easing of the restrictions on commerce. 
The UN resolution itself is non-binding, and the real significance is not that it passed, but rather that the US abstained, which while reflecting the administration’s position is unusual, as it criticizes the US Congress internationally.  ",0
17306,Fake News: HuffPo Invents a Steve Bannon ‘War’ on Pope Francis,"The   Huffington Post stooped to innuendo, slurs, and outright fabrication to manufacture out of whole cloth a dark conspiracy by Donald Trump’s chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon against Pope Francis. [Piggybacking on a baseless New York Times article by Jason Horowitz that imagined close ties between Bannon and “traditionalists in the Vatican,” Huffington Post writer Michele Somerville goes still further, alleging that Bannon is aligning himself “with the   fringe of Roman Catholicism” in order to wage a war on Pope Francis.  In her breathtaking ignorance, Somerville bases her entire thesis on an outright error. She mistakes Steve Bannon’s 2014 reference to the “Church militant” —  a common Catholic expression referring to Christians on earth as opposed to those who have already died —  for a traditionalist website by the same name. Although Bannon has no connection whatsoever with the website or its theories about Catholic doctrine, Somerville concocts a nefarious link between the two, attributing the website’s ideas to Bannon himself. Throughout the rambling piece, Somerville lays out in great detail some of the more absurd ideas advocated by the Church Militant website, and by association suggests that Bannon must hold to the same theories. She seems ignorant of the fact that Bannon is unaware of the existence of the website and furthermore couldn’t care less about its doctrinal nitpicking. Somerville’s first mistake was giving credence to Horowitz’s New York Times piece, which alleged that Bannon visited the Vatican in 2014 “to cultivate strategic alliances with those in Rome who share his interpretation of a   ‘church militant’ theology. ” If Somerville had employed even a minimum of journalistic   she would have quickly found that the Horowitz piece on the   connection was built on air. Although Horowitz alleges close ties between Bannon and “traditionalists in the Vatican,” he doesn’t cite a single Vatican official in the entire piece and instead relies on his fertile imagination to construct a web of alliances that do not exist. In fact, when Horowitz floated his theory to Breitbart’s Rome bureau chief, Dr. Thomas Williams, Williams assured him that it had no basis in fact and that Bannon had never pursued alliances in the Vatican and had no interest in influencing church affairs. Despite this advice, Horowitz chose to publish the story anyway. In point of fact, when Bannon visited Rome in April 2014, he only met with one Vatican official: Cardinal Raymond Burke, who at the time was head of the Vatican’s supreme court. As the highest ranking American in the Vatican and a conservative besides, Burke was sought out by Bannon not for a   meeting but for an   interview as part of Breitbart’s media outreach. This was their sole meeting. Moreover, despite Horowitz’s statement to the contrary, at the time of their meeting there had been no conflict between Cardinal Burke and Pope Francis, and Bannon was not attempting to stoke “divisions” within the Church. Bannon pursued the idea of a Rome bureau for Breitbart News in 2014 because of his belief that politics is downstream of culture and that the moral voice of the Catholic Church has a powerful impact on the rest of the world.  In hiring Breitbart’s Rome bureau chief, Bannon chose not a   or an   but Dr. Thomas Williams, a theologian and former Catholic priest who has since written literally hundreds of articles on Pope Francis and the Vatican, nearly all of which have been sympathetic to the Pope. Unable to mount an argument, Somerville instead descends to insults and baseless slurs, calling Bannon an “  Catholic” who only collaborates with Jews in order to achieve the greater good of defeating Islam. She similarly attempts to tar him as a proponent of “ ” or “  Roman Catholicism,” whatever that means. “Bannon wants a war and he will use Jesus to get one,” Somerville ominously warns.

17309,How the Grammy Awards Are Made: 4 Craftsmen and ‘Grammium’ - The New York Times,"Adele and Beyoncé, should you happen to read this, consider including the following name in your acceptance speeches on Grammy night: John Billings. He’s not an engineer, producer or video director. But he has had a hand in every Grammy  —   literally  —   for the past four decades. Known as “the Grammy man,” Mr. Billings, 70, is a master mold maker who has been designing, crafting and delivering the awards to the academy for more than half of his life. “I’ve been around them forever,” he said in a telephone interview. “Every year they become more and more special to me. I’ve always been a music fan, and the Grammys have always turned me on to so much I wouldn’t hear if I just sat and listened to a radio station. ” For this year’s ceremony, airing on Sunday night on CBS, 350 trophies were made. And yes, they were all created equal. “When we’re making Grammys, we don’t know whose Grammy that’s going to be, so we don’t have one favorite,” Mr. Billings said, adding: “They’re all just like children. I really never try to question why someone is getting an award I do sometimes question why someone is not. ” Before artists can hoist the   award onstage in front of their peers, a lot of work must be done, which starts when the nomination list comes in. Mr. Billings and his team review it and estimate the number of Grammys that need to be cast to cover the nominees receiving the awards. In his    Ridgway, Colo. studio, the whirring of a polishing wheel and tapping of a hammer provide the soundtrack for his team of three, who tinker five days a week,  . “We really don’t have an average day,” Mr. Billings said of the   process needed to complete each trophy. “The guys who work with me really know what they’re doing. We don’t look at the clock, we don’t rush these things. ” The awards are made of a custom metal alloy called grammium (yes, really) and are cast from three molds: one for the base, one for the gramophone cabinet and one for the tone arm, which holds the bell. After the pieces are cast, they go through a series of filing, sanding and polishing processes, and the gramophone cabinet and tone arm are plated in   gold. Once dry, the three pieces are assembled, and each award is   with a unique serial number for authenticity. The Grammys used during the television broadcast are for show Mr. Billings and his team engrave the names of winners onto plates after the event. Mr. Billings’s relationship with the award began when he was 12, upon seeing his friend’s father, Bob Graves, make the first one in his garage. In 1976 Mr. Billings became Mr. Graves’s apprentice he took over production in 1983 after his mentor’s death. “It means a great deal to us  —   John is part of the family,” said Bill Freimuth, the vice president for awards at the Recording Academy. “It’s that personal service it’s not dealing with some sort of an anonymous corporation. It’s dealing with a person who is   who deals with making these beautiful works of art many times over. ” Over time the trophy, like the Grammy Awards show itself, has evolved. Since the first ceremony, in 1959, five different designs have been created the last major   came in the early 1990s, when Mr. Billings said he spent a year sketching and a few months fashioning three prototypes from scrap metal in his studio. The goal was simple: to keep the gramophone and its Art Deco influences but rework the tone arm, which was prone to breaking because of its thinness. Nearly 30 years later, Mr. Billings said he remains content with his design. “I think it’s going to stay exactly where it is,” he said of the current Grammy. “I don’t see a reason to change it. It’s become very iconic. People recognize it and understand what it symbolizes. ” Once Mr. Billings and his team have made the finishing touches on each set of Grammys, it’s time to send them to Los Angeles  —   but not via FedEx or U. P. S. “I’ve always just   them,” he said. “I just think it would be a nightmare to try and ship these. In the old days, there weren’t so many Grammys, so I would put them in my truck and make several trips. ” These days, Mr. Billings attaches a cargo trailer to his truck for the     journey. When the last Grammy is packed away and the trailer is locked, the team takes a moment to pause. “We open a bottle of champagne and write a date on the bottle and how many Grammys were made for that year,” he said. “That caps it off  —   the Grammys are done, now they’re on their way.

17311,Nationalism Is A Trap,"More people are coming to the truthful conclusion that globalism is a failure and nationalism, where a country’s people and interests are valued above that of non-citizens, is the way forward. A problem is that the globalism-nationalism framework is exactly the type of dialectic elites can use to usher in a global war or crackdown to further increase their power.
Imagine there is a wife who is tired of her husband going out every night with his friends to drink. Instead of nagging at him every evening, which would have the effect of motivating him to leave the house even sooner, she will wait until he gets into a drunk driving accident or serious bar fight so she could “draw the line” and make the reasonable ultimatum for him to never drink again. The husband is more likely to listen to her after something wrong takes place than after he had a safe night out.
Right now the nationalist movement is being allowed to gain strength so that a future event can act as a trigger for globalists to “draw the line” on the movement by imprisoning or killing its strongest members. In other words, globalists plan to use nationalism as a trap, a device they transform into to their advantage. As of right now, the budding nationalist movement is extremely useful in allowing them to identify all “resisters” before easily crushing them when the time is right.
Elites cannot advance their plans without a dialectic 
The way the elites move an agenda forward is through a dialectic , meaning that two opposing ideologies rub against each other, create friction, and from that comes a desired result (i.e. “order from chaos”). Those in power either control or monitor the existence of both sides to guide and bend the dialectic to serve their ends.
The recent rise in nationalism, I speculate, has been allowed because previous dialectics such as capitalism vs communism and democracy vs terrorism are no longer useful in advancing the desired agenda. Soviet Communism is dead and increased terrorism did not allow planned wars in Syria and Iran to proceed like 9/11 did with Iraq and Afghanistan. In addition, the white vs black race war is years late, stubbornly resistant to the gasoline that Obama pours onto the fire. A new dialectic must be nurtured, and so nationalism may just do the trick. Hillary’s recent alt right speech officially debuted American nationalism as the new “enemy.”
While your conclusion that nationalism is logical and beneficial to a nation is true, and I’m sure to agree with it, you were guided onto those beliefs. How did you arrive at nationalist thought? Through decades of free trade, feminism, and open-door immigration that have worn you and your country down. Your arrival at nationalist conclusions is the direct result of globalism, which means that nationalist thoughts exist in your mind only because of the likes of George Soros, who pulled out a million Muslims from his hat and placed them in Europe while sponsoring a multitude of social justice organizations in the United States. His actions and behavior, along with other powerful globalists like him, have essentially created your very ideology, because you are entrenched in a dialectic where opposing forces must exist and be in combat with each other.
The growth of nationalism is “useful” Nationalism must continue to grow in power right before the moment it can threaten globalist banking and geopolitical interests, and when it does, the globalists will clamp down severely on it. As if replaying World War 2, they will identify a nationalist country as the big bad bully, and then use that country as an excuse to start a war that will simultaneously weed out nationalists throughout the world by sending them to die or having them arrested at home for “subversion” or “treason.” Russia is the evil nationalist country that neocons and others have been poking, and even Poland is being puffed up into an “undemocratic” country in order to hedge their bets.

A hint that this may already be taking place is that France recently called upon “patriots” to serve in their National Guard to “protect citizens.” Since when does France care about patriots? They have committed no consistent actions in the past decade that suggest they do care, so we must reasonably conclude that this new army is a trap to attract nationalists into a game where the end result is their death. I wouldn’t be surprised if France’s beefed-up army is used to start a war in a place like Poland, which will be painted as an aggressor that caused “economic attacks” upon the saintly Western Europeans.
As long as you’re in the dialectic, which I see as a sort of Twilight Zone creation of the mega rich, you’re fighting on their terms. They need the nationalist “grassroots” uprising to create violent events that allow them to re-assert control and power. Even though nationalism may be the most sane movement of the day, it still plays into their hands as long as we insist on having only two sides of the debate, good and evil, as if we were living in a Hollywood-style storyline. Instead of this two-dimensional arrangement, the solution may be to go 3D, where you can move front and back and around in a spectrum of ideas, instead of just left and right where you’re a pawn of the game no matter what side you pick.
Just because a nationalist “resistance” is growing, doesn’t mean that that the globalists in power are being hurt. Without being able to effectively control the Western population through the Cold War, terrorism, racial divide-and-conquer, or modern Russian aggression, they are hoping that the nationalist movement grows enough to create the conflict that moves their chess pieces forward. While I’m not urging you to throw away your nationalist beliefs, as I surely won’t throw away mine, it is clear to me that a trap is waiting to be sprung, and we will all suffer when it’s finally launched.

17312,Sean Hannity Warns: ’End of Fox News Channel’ if Bill Shine is Replaced,"Sean Hannity took to Twitter Thursday afternoon to warn of a “total end of the Fox News Channel as we know it” in the wake of a report that suggested Fox News   Bill Shine lacks support from the network’s top brass. [In a post on his Twitter account Thursday, Hannnity linked to a report by New York magazine’s Gabriel Sherman that claimed Shine  —   a   veteran at Fox News  —   had requested a public statement of support from network CEO James Murdoch and   Lachlan Murdoch, but failed to receive one. According to Sherman’s report, Shine privately fears for his future at the network as it has endured a series of controversies, including the recent ouster of longtime star anchor Bill O’Reilly.  A Fox News spokesperson told Sherman that Shine denied having approached James and Lachlan Murdoch personally to ask for a statement of support, while a Murdoch spokesman said Shine had not directly requested a statement. “Gäbe i pray this is NOT true because if it is, that’s the total end of the FNC as we know it.

17314,20-Year-Old Brit Dies Fighting Islamic State in Syria,"A    British man who traveled to Syria to fight against Islamic State has been killed in battle, his family have said. [Ryan Lock, a former chef who had no previous military training, told his family he was vacationing in Turkey before crossing the Syrian border and joining the Kurdish People’s Defence Units (YPG). He died on 21 December during an assault on Raqqa, Islamic State’s de facto capital.  The YPG wrote a letter to Mr Lock’s family informing them of his death and praising him for his bravery. The Guardian reports that it said: Ryan joined actively in our offensive against the terror threat that Isis caused upon Rojava, Kurdistan. Here, in the dark hours of December 21, 2016, we lost our brave companion Ryan and four other fighters in Jaeber village. Ryan was not only a fighter providing additional force to our struggle. In fact, with his experience and knowledge he has been an example for younger fighters. While he has reached a vast amount of achievement up in our front lines, Ryan has served the purpose of a very important bridge between us, the Kurds of Rojava. He crossed continents for the destiny of our people and humanity. Mr Lock is the third Brit to die fighting Islamic State. Dean Evans, a    farmer, died in July 2016 in northern Syria, and Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, a former Royal Marine, was killed in March 2015. Ryan Lock was just weeks away from returning home when he was killed. He wrote on Facebook on 31 August: “I’m on my way to Rojava. I lied about going to Turkey. I’m sorry I didn’t tell anyone. I love all of you and I will be back in six months. ” He narrowly escaped death on 24 November when most of his unit was killed in an airstrike, allegedly by the Turkish air force. Twelve fighters were killed, including American Michael Israel and German Anton Leschek. In a statement, his father said: “Ryan was a very caring and loving boy who would do anything to help anyone. “He had a heart of gold. We ask for privacy to allow our family to grieve. ”",0
17315,Yellen Signals Shift From Stimulating Economy to Sustaining Growth - The New York Times,"Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said Monday that the Fed was shifting its focus from stimulating the economy to keeping growth on an even keel. She said the economy was “pretty healthy,” thanks in part to the Fed’s   stimulus campaign, which the central bank is moving to end. “Looking forward, I think the economy is going to continue to grow at a moderate pace,” Ms. Yellen said during an event at the University of Michigan. “Our job is going to be to try to set monetary policy to sustain what we have achieved. ” The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate in March for the third time since the financial crisis, and said it planned two more rate increases this year. The Fed also said it planned to begin reducing its large holdings of securities by the end of the year. Ms. Yellen did not offer any additional details during her appearance on Monday. Ms. Yellen, interviewed onstage by Susan M. Collins, the dean of the Ford School of Public Policy at the university, used the opportunity to make a strong case for the financial regulations enacted by Congress in the 2010   Act to address the problems revealed by the 2008 financial crisis. President Trump and congressional Republicans have said they want to eliminate or overhaul many of those measures, which they regard as ineffective in preventing future financial crises and as impediments to economic growth. Ms. Yellen pushed back on both counts. She cited changes that she said had increased the strength of the financial system, including requiring banks to raise more money from investors and subjecting large banks to annual stress tests. “We have accomplished a lot, and we have a much safer system,” she said. She also directly addressed the argument that the regulatory pendulum has swung too far and that government rules are preventing healthy financial activity. “I don’t think if you look at objective data on lending, that it’s possible to make the case that regulation has simply stifled lending,” Ms. Yellen said. “Lending is growing in a very healthy way as the economy has recovered. ” She said banks were actually in a better position to lend, although she acknowledged that the Fed would like to reduce the burden on smaller banks. Ms. Yellen’s assessment of economic conditions remained upbeat. She noted that the unemployment rate, which fell to 4. 5 percent in March, is now below the level that most Fed officials regard as sustainable. Consumer spending is growing at a decent pace, and Ms. Yellen noted that the global economy was also looking “slightly more robust and healthier. ” Though inflation remains a bit weaker than the 2 percent annual pace the Fed regards as healthy, she said it would be appropriate for the Fed to keep raising interest rates. She said, however, that the economy still faced problems that were beyond the power of monetary policy. While job growth has been strong, economic growth remains relatively slow, around 2 percent a year in recent years. If more people are working, making more things or doing more things in less time, the economy should be growing faster. “The fact that you can create that many jobs in the context of growth that is so low points to a significant problem,” Ms. Yellen said. “And the problem is that productivity growth is very low. ” Productivity measures the average person’s economic contribution. There are only two possible causes of economic growth: more people or increased productivity, which is to say, the same number of people making more stuff. We have slow population growth and slow productivity growth, so we have slow economic growth. Economists regard the slow pace of productivity growth as something of a mystery. Ms. Yellen tipped her hat to a number of the theories in circulation. Some economists think the flow of good ideas has simply slowed. Others point to a   in educational attainment. She also pointed to recent research that suggested one factor was a decline in corporate competition: less creation of new businesses and more corporate consolidation. Ms. Yellen said the combination of relatively fast job growth and relatively slow economic growth pointed to the underlying problem. She also fielded some lighter questions. Asked how she dealt with pressure, Ms. Yellen described herself as an “ardent believer” in the importance of a good night’s sleep. Asked for life advice, she encouraged students to find a profession that fills them with a sense of enthusiasm every day. “For me,” she said, “the core of having a satisfying career first and foremost was finding something to do that I really love. ”",0
17316,Outrage as May’s real idea of Brexit at Goldman Sachs speech leaks,"Politics British Prime Minister Theresa May waits for the arrival of the King of Bahrain, Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa outside 10 Downing Street in London on October 26, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
British Prime Minister Theresa May is facing growing criticism over her comments about Brexit at a leaked private speech to Goldman Sachs. 
The premier, who has publicly made the case for a hard Brexit following a June referendum, speaks of the “benefits” of being an EU member in the hour-long session, whose audio file was leaked to the Guardian on Tuesday night, drawing harsh criticism on Wednesday. 
“I think the economic arguments are clear. I think being part of a 500 million [population] trading bloc is significant for us. I think, as I was saying to you a little earlier, that one of the issues is that a lot of people will invest here in the UK because it is the UK in Europe,” she is heard saying. “If we were not in Europe, I think there would be firms and companies who would be looking to say, do they need to develop a mainland Europe presence rather than a UK presence? So I think there are definite benefits for us in economic terms.” 
The leader of the rival Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, attacked the prime minister for having failed to address her own concerns about leaving the European Union. 
Corbyn has previously been calling on the Tory-held government for a clear plan to exit the bloc.

(Photo by AFP) 
“The prime minister has given her private views on Brexit to Goldman Sachs bankers, but refuses to give the British people a clear plan for negotiations,” said the Labour leader. “It shouldn’t take a leaked tape for the public to find out what she really thinks.” 
The former Labour leader and leading member of the Open Britain campaign group, Ed Miliband, also reacted to the comments, saying, the leaked comments prove that May shares the concerns of all the Britons on Brexit. 
“If private warnings are to be matched by proper public debate, it is essential that the government is not allowed to hoard vital analysis of the impact on our economy of leaving the single market. This work is being done in government and it must now be published,” he said, asserting that May’s comments “demonstrated that the prime minister was just as worried privately as the rest of us are publicly about the economic impact of the hard, destructive Brexit her government seems set on.” 
According to the Guardian , the audio file was leaked as May was “prioritizing cutting immigration over staying in the single market, while refusing to elaborate any further on her plans for taking the UK out of the EU.” British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson leaves the weekly cabinet meeting at 10 Downing Street in London on October 25, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
In an unpublished newspaper column written before the June 23 referendum for the Telegraph , UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Boris Johnson, who is another Leave campaigner in the public, also defended remaining an EU member. 
“This is a market on our doorstep, ready for further exploitation by British firms. The membership fee seems rather small for all that access. Why are we so determined to turn our back on it?” he wrote, calling the EU a “boon for the world and for Europe.” Loading ...",0

17318,"Christie Lost Republicans The 2012 Election. He May Be Losing Them The 2016 Election, Too.","Christie Lost Republicans The 2012 Election. He May Be Losing Them The 2016 Election, Too. By: Ben Shapiro November 4, 2016 
Ambition can be dangerous. Not just for the ambitious man or woman, but for the country – for all those who ally with the ambitious person. 
For the last eight years, one of the most ambitious men in politics has been New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Hailed as a conservative darling after taking on teacher’s unions in New Jersey – brash language about “punching them in the face” marked his rise as a political force and an up-and-comer in presidential politics – Christie has nearly singlehandedly destroyed the Republican Party in two straight presidential elections. 
In 2012, Christie was considered and rejected for vice president by Mitt Romney – but then gave the keynote speech in primetime at the Republican convention. There, he spent the bulk of his time talking about his own wonders, ignoring Romney completely. Fox News’ Chris Wallace called the speech “the most curious keynote speech I have ever heard…For a moment I forgot who was the nominee of the party.” 
Then, the week before the election, Hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast. While New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told President Obama that his presence was unnecessary, Christie invited Obama to New Jersey, then hugged him and took him on a tour of Atlantic City, where they made political love along the boardwalk underneath the cloudy skies. “I cannot thank the president enough for his personal concern and compassion for our state,” Christie said, adding that it was “my honor” to introduce President Obama. Christie was, at the time, facing down rumors that then-Newark Mayor Corey Booker, who is black, would run against him. As The New York Times noted, “The scene played out on televisions around the country like a stirring campaign ad that hit themes of bipartisanship and crisis management – only it was run free of charge.” 
Obama surged in the final days and beat Romney handily. 
Fast forward three years. 
Christie was running in the Republican primaries. He’d done nothing much in the polls; his only hope was to somehow do well in New Hampshire. He had no support in states like South Carolina or Nevada, or southern states dominated by support for Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio. So, naturally, he used his presence at the debate before the New Hampshire primary – a state in which Rubio was surging following his Iowa showing – to destroy Rubio. Christie rightly labeled Rubio a robotic candidate, Rubio repeated himself, Christie hit him again – and Rubio fell apart in the polling. Trump ran away with the state. Almost immediately, Christie quit the race and fell in behind Trump. Thanks in large part to Christie’s help, Trump won the nomination. 
Now, with Trump surging in the polls the week before his general election against Hillary Clinton, Christie has struck again: this time, two of his top aides have been found guilty on all charges related to Bridgegate, the scandal in which the Christie administration allegedly blocked bridges in order to punish a local Democrat who wouldn’t endorse Christie’s re-election bid . This story will allow the media to shift its focus to the Trump campaign, since Christie is leader of Trump’s White House transition team. In a tight election, it could be enough to hand Hillary the White House. 
So thanks, Chris Christie. 
The Democrats couldn’t have done it without you. Tags",0
17319,Edward Snowden: Journalists Are Endangered Species In America,"Posted on October 28, 2016 by Baxter Dmitry in News , US // 0 Comments 
Whistleblower Edward Snowden warned reporters that in this era of mass surveillance and mainstream media collusion with the state, journalists are an endangered species facing extinction. 
“ Journalists are increasingly a threatened class when we think about the right to privacy, ” Snowden said. “ Yes, I can give you tips on how to protect your communications, but you are going to be engaging in an arms race that you simply cannot win .” 
Snowden, speaking via video feed at a German conference, urged journalists to be brave and fight the system by exposing privacy violations and government intrusions to the masses. 
“You must fight this on the front pages and you must win, if you want to be able to report in the same way that you’ve been able to do in the previous centuries.” 
Snowden went on to bemoan the fact mainstream media is not taking the government to task and provoking public debate about short-sighted and secret government policy. 
“ Policy is only short-sighted here because it is not being publicly debated. It is not being openly scrutinized outside of this audience of a few special interests .” 
By failing to live up to their duties in a functioning democracy, the mainstream media have played their part in granting the government a previously unthinkable amount of power. The Clinton presidential campaign is a case in point. Unencumbered by the law and unscrutinized by the media, Clinton as president will wield a dictator’s authority. 
Snowden believes journalists simply must resume criticizing the powers that be, and provoking public debate – and the topic of spying and hacking should be top of the agenda. 
“ We have technologies that can protect communications in an unbreakable format when they’re in transit. Governments have reacted to this as if we’ve thrown them in a pool of acid, saying you know, “you’re shutting us out, you’re going dark.” This is false. 
Any government official who claims we’re going dark is lying. We know this because we have classified documents from inside governments and we have reportage from journalists who have been in private sessions with these officials. Things are pretty bad for our side. For the government’s side, it’s never been easier. How do we reconcile this with this idea that these are theoretically, as far as our understanding of mathematics goes, unbreakable communications? 
It’s because what we’re doing is we’re thwarting mass surveillance when we use encryption. We’re not stopping targeted surveillance. Because even, again, if you have the most well-encrypted device in the world, if the government spends a million dollars to pay a hacker to exploit your phone personally, they will very likely succeed. 
In our current state of the art, offense is easier than defense. This is an unfortunate artifact of the fact that governments around the world have prioritized offensive capabilities for the benefit of spying on people so much more strongly than they have defensive capabilities, preventing our countries from being hacked. And this is what’s leading to the kind of dynamics we see today. 
Whether it’s the Office of Personnel Management; whether it’s this recent Democratic National Committee hack; whether it’s all of these other things about infrastructural attacks; fear of the power grid being attacked—these were preventable problems. 
But unfortunately we don’t have this pressure—that should be simply blistering—coming from newspapers, going, “We are the most advanced societies in the world, we are the most connected societies in the world, and in some sort of computer-based conflict. We have more to lose.” 
We can hack Russia ten times; it will cause less damage to them than one hack to us will cause. We can hack North Korea 1,000 times, and they will suffer less damage than if they hacked us a single time. This is not a game that we want to get into, so why are we doing so? It’s because policy is short-sighted.”

17322,Actually Existing Fascism,"Tweet Widget by Dolores Vek 
It appears that millions of folks that have tolerated -- and even cheered -- Barack Obama’s Kill Lists, assassinations of whole nations, and abject service to the ruling class, are suddenly panicking at the prospect of fascism. “So where the fuck were all these protesters when Obama was actually doing what Trump says he’ll do?” They fear the fascism of their imaginations, while oblivious to fascism in the real world. Actually Existing Fascism by Dolores Vek 
This article previously appeared on the author’s web site, Dolores Vek Cultural Marxism-Leninism . 
“ Anyone who thinks Donald Trump is more of a fascist than Barack Obama is some combination of an imbecile, a liberal, and a charlatan.” 
With the election of Donald Trump, we’re being told that now is the time to fear fascism in America. 
What is this nightmare-vision of a fascist America supposed to look like? This alternate-reality USA, under the uniquely vicious reign of the Trump regime, is one in which minorities have to fear for their lives. The president will speak in openly white supremacist language. Black Americans will have to fear death at the hands of police and vigilantes; [email protected] will have to fear deportation; Muslims, Islamophobic violence; and so on. The good people of humanity will tremble as Trump wields America’s fearsome armed forces, secret police, elite death squads, drones, and surveillance technology for the good of himself and his cronies. Earth’s ecosystem—the very promise of a habitable planet—will be sacrificed by men who put profits ahead of human needs and the good of mankind. 
Truly, fascist America would a terrifying place. This vision is so terrifying that mere days after the election, even the most conformist liberals have suddenly gotten in touch with the radical antifa apparently slumbering inside each one of them. Highly publicized protests have already occurred in several major cities. Democratic Party propaganda organ Daily Kos , which banned criticisms of Hillary site-wide in March 2016, is suddenly receptive to a planned general strike on inauguration day. Those who can manage to unscrew themselves from the fetal position are resolute in their opposition to Trump’s agenda—“ we have all been radicalized ,” writes future Molotov-thrower Lena Dunham. All these new radicals, radicalized by Trump’s racist language. Radicalized by the way his administration threatens non-whites with state violence. Radicalized by the fact that he’ll be Commander-in-Chief, and he’ll use that power to kill. 
“Democratic Party propaganda organ Daily Kos, which banned criticisms of Hillary site-wide in March 2016, is suddenly receptive to a planned general strike on inauguration day.” 
So where the fuck were all these protesters when Obama was actually doing what Trump says he’ll do? Trump’s neo-Nazi dystopia is the USA that exists today, and anyone who doesn’t realize it needs to shut the fuck up and stop pretending to know anything about politics. Anyone who thinks Donald Trump is more of a fascist than Barack Obama is some combination of an imbecile, a liberal, and a charlatan. 
Barack Obama was the President who expanded the White House’s power to kill anyone, anywhere, including American citizens. If wielding power like a führer is the mark of fascism, then Obama qualified as of the 2012 passage of the NDAA . 
It seems like every dire warning about the Trump administration starts with a bit about the millions of immigrant families that might be torn apart. Many Trump voters would salivate over the prospect of deporting 2.5 million people, as Obama has done—more than every 20th century president combined. Along the way, the Obama administration has created countless millions of refugees by destroying Honduras and Libya, towards whom the president has shown a remarkable callousness that doesn’t seem to trouble these Democrats suddenly frightened on behalf of immigrants. 
Trump said that he wants to ban Muslims from entering the United States. In 2009, as Obama began his time in the White House, prosecutions for “homegrown terrorism” shot up, as the Obama Department of Justice focused on a Muslim enemy within. By 2010, in the face of nativist hysteria over a “Ground Zero mosque,” the most stirring defense the President could muster was that Muslims were free to practice where they want but they probably shouldn’t . This was at the same time that the NYPD, trained and likely acting on behalf of the CIA, was spying on tens of thousands of Muslim-Americans throughout the US Northeast. Anyone deluded enough to think Barack Obama is a friend to Muslims should ask Tarek Mehanna, Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, or the hundreds of thousands of Libyans, Yemenis, Pakistanis, Afghans, Iraqis, Somalis, or Iranians who his administration has killed, displaced, maimed, starved, or terrorized. And with less than a week before the election, Barack Obama agreed to appear on HBO’s Real Time hosted by Bill Maher, a virulent liberal Islamophobe who has spent years peddling Trumpian bigotry against Muslims. 
“The Obama administration has created countless millions of refugees by destroying Honduras and Libya.” 
Liberals are horrified by Trump’s hatred of journalists, which is supposed to be a sign of his aberrant fascist tendencies. Before the Snowden leak spectacle largely wiped of from the news cycle, progressive outlets had started to cover the Obama administration’s war on journalism, which was sending whistleblowers and their journalist allies to prison at an unprecedented rate. Of course, while Trump’s dislike of journalists makes him Hitleresque , Obama’s actual imprisonment of journalists was, at worst, Nixonian . 
Trump will, apparently unlike every president in AmeriKKKan history, be uniquely bad for African-Americans. Will his administration steal the wealth from black homes, the way Obama helped Wall Street loot black America? Will black Americans have to rise up in the streets and declare that black lives matter, to protest the black person murdered every 28 hours in the USA? Will black revolutionaries start being mysteriously and brutally murdered in Trump’s America, like Darren Seals and at least 5 other activists in Ferguson, all of whom bear the hallmarks of falling victim to a COINTELPRO 2.0? Will a Trump Justice Department ramp-up efforts to capture fugitive black freedom fighters like Assata Shakur ? 
Even the idea that Trump and the Republicans are the only ones to speak in openly white supremacist language is idiotic, and someone doesn’t have to go back to Hillary Clinton talking about “super-predators” to find examples. As one blog pointed out: 
Obama’s 2008 “speech on race” in Philadelphia (officially titled “A More Perfect Union”), celebrated as “too good for today’s media” and “reviving the spirit of the nation itself,” was a Eucharistic repetition of white supremacist lies. In this speech, the future president delivered an objectively white supremacist view of US history, deriding the idea that white racism is endemic, equating the liberation theology of Jeremiah Wright with the latent anti-black racism of his grandmother, and accusing black radicals and revolutionary anti-racists of fomenting “disunity” at a time when “we” need to come together—while pointing to his own candidacy as proof that racism had mostly been dismantled. Minus the well-worn details about the Senator’s life story and tedious speechifying, the basic lessons of the speech would have been at home on a Fox News panel about “race hustlers.” 
One thing is true, though: Trump is uniquely bad in certain ways. The Donald, that two-bit reality-TV huckster, is sullying the august White House walls with his conciliatory attitude towards Russia and China (though his quick about-face on US troops in the southern half of the Korean peninsula is an indication of how serious this is). Still, after a year of Hillary Clinton sounding the drums of war, the Democrats are seemingly united in fury that Trump is a little frigid towards the idea of starting World War III. To be fair to them, they’re absolutely right: Trump can’t claim Hillary’s feverish desire for a nuclear war against Russia, nor her proven track record of killing millions of people throughout the global South. 
“While Trump’s dislike of journalists makes him Hitleresque, Obama’s actual imprisonment of journalists was, at worst, Nixonian.” 
Anyone who hasn’t surrendered the last lobe of their brain to the Democratic Party, and who’s fond of not being turned into ashes, has to ask themselves why it would be desirable for President Trump to start WW3, as Clinton practically promised to do. This is another question that Nate Silver would get completely wrong, but I think the actually existing fascism of Obama offers a clue. Just like Democrats have transferred all of Obama’s evils to the Nazi caricature of Trump, liberals are the ones who are lashing out against reality. 
The reality is that capitalism, particularly at this stage, has nothing good to offer the vast majority of humanity, and even increasing numbers of people in the core. Democrats conveniently forget that the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania rose to power based on illusory promises to make things better. Like Trump, his record spoke to the absurdity of his bill of goods, and he boasted a CV only marginally more impressive than “shady tycoon and TV personality.” Even though his economic promises were vague, all the “hope” talk gave people a lot of ideas; when it came time to govern, Obama defended capital against “ the pitchforks ,” as he always intended. If apathetic voters and fucked-over workers played a part in Trump’s election, why wouldn’t they? And how will the upper-middle class and rich liberal who benefit from this order respond? As one commentator observed, in a story that is typical of America’s sneering liberal bourgeois: 
A Seattle-area friend who lives in the farther working-class suburbs came to work to his inner-city, wealthy liberal coworkers bitching that his neighbors “voted us into fascism.” In the same breath, this rich shit complained about the passing of a transportation bill that would raise their taxes: “If they want Trump so bad they can pay for their own buses.” Here’s someone who probably calls themselves a progressive attacking actually existing progressivism because their taxes will go up a split hair, and potentially benefit unworthy types, “deplorables.” Maybe these people wouldn’t feel the need to “shake things up” if they had had what they needed to thrive all along. But then your misty piney mossy café-flanked Seattle townhome might have to fit only one Subaru in the garage. 
“ Trump now owns whatever happens under his presidency,” writes another newly energized rebel at Daily Kos . Not Obama. Obama, like any high-status Democrat, is never responsible for what he creates, and when he is, it’s at worst a mistake. Actually existing fascism has been erected through a series of bumbles, hypocrisies, mistakes, and odd little ironies. Obama has never been culpable for what he does; today, Democrats wail that Hillary’s worse crime was being imperfect. The bourgeois elements that are the most visible Democrats can never own up to the fact that their alleged “base” doesn’t have any good reason to come out and vote for them. So like the Red State-bogeymen they invoke so frequently, liberals are sprinting away from reality into a bubble of comforting myths and idols. 
“Obama has never been culpable for what he does.” 
Rather than face up to the fact that Hillary Clinton has little appeal outside of Goldman Sachs and whatever the Project for a New American Century is called these days, Democrats are cursing Sanders fans, third-party voters, and non-voters with a hatred usually reserved for vegans. Since they can only imagine their own upper-middle class lives orbiting major urban centers, the loudest Democrats think that everyone who’s not exactly like them is a racist, woman-hating cretin, and hope “ that they be educated and moved to the vicinity of the major hubs in the northeast and western parts, that they die off [or] that a country would attack the United States and obliterate them.” Rather than actually learn anything of substance, liberals are doing the only thing their politics really involve: sharing and commiserating over an extremely circumscribed set of insipid pop-culture references that flatter them and insulate them from reality . Those leftist critiques of Obama or Clinton that do manage to penetrate this fantasy-world get angrily dismissed as right-wing media conspiracy theories or Kremlin propaganda. And finally, as with any good whitewash, liberals are going to pretend that Donald Trump represents something totally alien and uniquely menacing, as though Obama hasn’t done everything Trump says he will. 
“When it came time to govern, Obama defended capital against “ the pitchforks ,” as he always intended.” 
And now, as soon as humanity has its first shot at finally being rid of the Clintons, and taking a small step back from the brink of ultimate atomic horror, these people want to gnash their teeth about America finally becoming fascist. 
Fuck them. 
If Trump is a fascist, them countless prominent American liberals are too, chief among them the widely beloved Barack Obama. Contemporary America doesn’t look like Nazi Germany for the simple reason that it isn’t Nazi Germany (J. Sakai argues that “ Settlerism filled the space that fascism normally occupies”). What the Democrats offer is a slightly more “woke fascism,” in which the slave-owning settlers are remade in entertainment media as cool black guys , with all the “problematic” racist history elided via a harmonious multi-ethnic makeover. It’s worth noting that Donald Trump makes overtures to the same woke fascism as Obama and Clinton: after the Pulse nightclub massacre, Trump promised to defend “ the LGBTQ community ” from foreign attackers. In other words, Trump and Clinton alike promise a typically colonialist defense of liberal values like gay rights from the swarthy hordes. 
So color me unim-fucking-pressed that now that a blatantly villainous Republican is headed for the White House, everyone is talking about a united front against fascism. Of course, given that the vast majority of the newly radicalized loved and still love the child-murdering white supremacist Barack Obama, what we’re talking about is a just another united front against the GOP. 
I know it’s ancient history to be talking about the Bush years, just like it’s hopelessly passé to unironically talk about “imperialism” in 2016, but please indulge me. I remember back when George W. Bush was president, torturing people around the world, “shredding the Constitution,” attacking Iraq and Afghanistan and threatening Iran with nukes. At the time, it was pretty common, even popular and fashionable, to call the president a fascist. Even on TV! Everyone who wasn’t a Republican was radical: it seemed like Democrats and communists alike could gripe over everything from a stolen Florida election to the invasion of Iraq. 
“What the Democrats offer is a slightly more ‘woke fascism.’” 
Then sometime around 2007, a neoliberal and fundamentally conservative mediocrity named Barack Obama showed up, and while he made a lot of noise about how different he was, there was almost nothing of substance to back it up. Once he was president, all the stuff that was proof of George W.’s fascism became a trifling issue, a simple mistake, or a regrettable necessity when Obama did it. As Obama continued George Bush’s legacy, and as Dick Cheney came out in support of Hillary Clinton, liberals stopped thinking of the Bush administration as a fascist criminal enterprise and started seeing it through Sorkin-colored glasses, with a George Bush-Michelle Obama hug at the twilight of the Obama presidency marking the decisive transition. 
So I actually remember how this went down the last time the mainstream was this comfortable talking about fascism—although the chorus was never this deafening. I remember that all the liberals quieted down about fascism when their guy was doing it. So did a lot of the radicals, to the eternal shame and discredit of those absolute frauds. As the popular Democrat Obama brought hell to millions with the brazenness of a Duce , calling the president a fascist went back to the fringes, where it had been, and where it will be again once it’s no longer politically expedient for people at the top to have us raising hell against Trump. I know exactly how this goes, since it all happened before, and not very long ago, either. And just like with Obama, whose coronation was a sort of inversion of this, I remember that anyone who’s remotely skeptical of this obviously elite-approved narrative will get dismissed as a crank or a spoilsport. 
However, maybe for now we could have some perspective. I know he’s popular and cool, but Obama’s been in office nearly a full eight years. Maybe these last 70 days, the radicals now hyperventilating over Trump could develop some idea of what Obama’s actually been doing this entire time? 
And if the still-uncompromising black revolutionary and political prisoner Mumia Abu-Jamal can say “If Trump is the price we have to pay to defeat Clintonian neoliberalism–so be it,” then maybe some of the liberals still dry-heaving can pull themselves together and learn a single thing about what America and the world are really like outside their privileged little bubbles? I mean, I know how fond these people are of pretending that they’re the only adults in the room, the only people using their inside voices. Maybe they could try to be as smart as Trevor Noah keeps telling them they are. 
“Maybe these last 70 days, the radicals now hyperventilating over Trump could develop some idea of what Obama’s actually been doing this entire time?” 
In the meantime, I’ll go ahead and be skeptical about all the no pasarán shit that cropped up the instant Hillary lost. Maybe if the inspiring new Credulous Dipshit Brigades could name a single fucking instance of fascism that’s not practiced by Obama, then this whole thing wouldn’t look like such an obviously astroturfed, color-revolutiony scam. 
What I know for sure is that any radicals who end up calling liberals comrade in the coming weeks are allying themselves with people who want a more violent, more genocidal , and ultimately more fascist president. Almost every liberal complaint includes references to Donald Trump weakening NATO , as though that wouldn’t be one of the most progressive developments for the good of humanity. This is where liberals give themselves away: just like they wanted Obama to restore America’s reputation after Bush so it could be the most effective fortress of capitalism, they trust Clinton to be a more capable imperial steward than Trump. If you find yourself shoulder-to-shoulder with liberals at the barricades, know that your allies are fighting on behalf of American fascism, if the word means what we keep hearing it does. 
And if you think Trump is more evil than Obama or Hillary Clinton, you’re ignorant as fuck and you’re a liberal. Dolores Vek can be contacted through her web site: https://doloresvek.wordpress.com",0
17323,Nonprofit Work After Retirement? Maybe You Can Make It Pay - The New York Times,"ARCHIE ELAM is on his third career transition. Now 61 and living in Stamford, Conn. Mr. Elam is a 1976 graduate of West Point. His   Army career included acting as head of operations for the 18th Airborne Corps 24th Infantry Division in the first war against Iraq. The Army sent him to get an M. B. A. at Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business, a degree that started his private sector career in 1996. He was a manager at General Electric, United Technologies, Accenture and elsewhere, mostly focused on Six Sigma, a collaborative program for improving company performance by cutting out waste, and running customer relations management systems and overseeing other   operations. His next act? Working at a nonprofit organization. Mr. Elam recently graduated from Encore! Hartford, a   training program for corporate professionals over age 50 looking for a career in the nonprofit sector, public agencies and government. “The stuff you volunteer for, you care about, you do for free, and then one day you realize you can get paid to do something you care about,” he said. “How cool is that!” Baby boomers closing in on the traditional retirement years often seek purpose and a paycheck in a second career, also known as an encore experience, next chapter or unretirement. Whatever the term, nonprofit work  —   focused on addressing society’s pressing needs and promoting arts and culture  —   has a particular allure for many in this group. “People want to give back they want that social impact in the next phase of their life,” said Kate Schaefers, a career and leadership coach in the  . Paul area. “They also turn the   retirement stool  —   Social Security, personal savings and retirement savings  —   into a   stool by adding paid work. ” The timing is auspicious. The nonprofit sector has been vibrant in recent years. From 2007 to 2012, nonprofit employment increased every year, from 10. 5 million jobs to 11. 4 million jobs, for a gain of about 8. 5 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By contrast, total private sector employment dropped by 3 percent in that period. This year, 57 percent of nonprofit groups surveyed said they expected to create new positions, an increase of 7 percentage points from last year, according to the 2016 Nonprofit Employment Practices Survey by Nonprofit HR, a the human resources firm. By comparison, the firm notes that only 36 percent of private companies surveyed said they intended to increase staff size, the same percentage as in 2015. Catherine Foley, 62, is among those who have shifted from the corporate world to the nonprofit sector. She worked for 25 years at Salt River Project in Arizona, among the nation’s largest public utilities. For 17 of those years she was manager of corporate affairs with responsibility for advertising communications, philanthropy and community outreach. In 2008, Ms. Foley, known as Rusty, took advantage of an early retirement opportunity. In the middle of the worst recession in decades, the timing was “scary,” she said. But she knew that “there were other things I wanted to do with my life. ” For the next two years, she sat on a number of community boards, including that of the Arizona Citizens for the Arts. In 2010 she became its interim executive director, and a year later she took on the job permanently, overseeing its two employees, many volunteers and $350, 000 budget. “It’s an opportunity to use the professional skills I had accumulated over the years for something I had a personal passion for,” she said. “It’s energizing. ” The transition for experienced baby boomers from corporate America to nonprofit America is probably easier than ever. The management guru Peter F. Drucker wrote in The Harvard Business Review in 1989 that “management was a dirty word for those involved in nonprofit organizations. ” The word suggested a hardhearted focus on the bottom line instead of pursuing a social mission. Mr. Drucker noted, however, that nonprofit boards and donors had come to realize that good management was critical to fulfilling their mission. “The nonprofits are, of course, still dedicated to ‘doing good,’” he argued. “But they also realize that good intentions are no substitute for organization and leadership, for accountability, performance and results. ” The gap has narrowed considerably further since the Drucker article 27 years ago. On the corporate side, many businesses explicitly embrace social responsibility as an important goal, while others embrace ventures that seek to blend purpose and profit. At the same time, nonprofit organizations have moved from society’s tributaries into the mainstream. “There is a greater flow of ideas between the two sectors,” said Thomas J. Tierney,   of the Bridgespan Group, which has headquarters in Boston and helps nonprofit organizations and foundations increase their social impact. “There is a greater flow of talent between the sectors. ” That said, the transition remains personally challenging.   writing grants and dealing with donors are unfamiliar tasks to those who forged their careers in   companies. Those who worked for big corporations are used to much more support. Ms. Foley, only   said that what she really missed was an information technology department. And the pay is almost always lower, with more modest benefit packages. “If it isn’t a mission personal to you, you will not get through the tough times,” said Nora Hannah, executive director of Experience Matters in Phoenix, an organization that works with private sector workers who want to shift into   nonprofit groups. The transition from a corporate environment to a nonprofit is largely a    effort. But programs like Encore! Hartford, Experience Matters, Social Venture Partners and Encore Fellowships offer valuable educational and matchmaking services for those seeking a   career. “I can’t tell you how many times we have been approached by people in the   sector wanting to make the transition to nonprofits and they struggled with it,” said Marc Freedman, founder and chief executive of Encore. org, which is based in San Francisco and promotes second careers for social good. “There needs to be something more like a Match. com. ” The techniques that work well in any job search apply here. Think about your passions. Understand the underlying skills accumulated over a lifetime of work rather than job titles. Network, network and network. That is what Catherine Bergstrom, 56, a former first selectman in Burlington, Conn. did. She completed the Encore! Hartford program in 2013. The program encourages its students to set up informational interviews with nonprofit organizations, and she said she found them invaluable for figuring out what she wanted to do next. “I would call people up and everyone said, ‘yes,’” she said. “I would talk to the executive directors. ” She ended up becoming director of community engagement for Jewish Family Services in Hartford, one of the organizations where she had an informational interview. The nonprofit job seeker has an additional option for learning about a particular organization: volunteering. The sector is incredibly diverse and complicated, ranging from small   groups mostly dependent on the passions of a handful of volunteers and donors to professional   and   social service organizations. The advantage of volunteering is that it is like dating, a way of figuring out whether an organization is a good match without making a   commitment. Here is a safe bet: The baby boomers making the transition from business into nonprofit careers are carving a work path that will become ever easier for those behind them to follow.",0
17324,PressTV-Americans ‘repudiated Clinton foreign policy’,"Interviews US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton stands with President Barack Obama during an election eve rally on November 7, 2016 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 
The American people have “repudiated the foreign policy” of President Barack Obama and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton which was “a complete disgrace” for the United States, according to James Fetzer, an American scholar and political analyst. 
Professor Fetzer made the remarks in a phone interview with Press TV on Monday, days after Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump stunned the world by defeating the heavily-favored Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, in the November 8 election. 
During the election campaign, Trump repeatedly expressed his willingness to work with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other leaders in order to resolve global problems, including the issue of Daesh terrorism, which he has blamed on the policies of the Obama administration. 
On the other hand, Clinton has shown eagerness to confront Russia and continue the interventionist policies US administrations have practiced since 9/11. 
Professor Fetzer said that “Clinton was behind the massacre of Libya, the butchery of Benghazi, the transfer of weapons to ‘rebels’ in Syria.” 
More than five years after the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi, Libya has become a failed state, with the central government holding no sway over the country, and Africa’s wealthiest nation has become a haven for terrorist organizations. 
And since 2011, the United States and its allies have been sponsoring terrorists wreaking havoc in Syria. 
Professor Fetzer stated that Clinton was being advised by Israeli intelligence, telling her ""how to conduct American foreign policy. It was a complete disgrace.” 
“The American people have repudiated the foreign policy of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton,” the scholar said. 
“Donald Trump is going to restore a measure of sanity. He is going to end the wars in the Middle East. He is going to restore the reputation of the United States for integrity, and dealing with the international community,” he noted. 
“He respects Russia as should any president of the United States, where Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton fell miserably short,” the analyst pointed out. 
“I believe we are already seeing signs that the situation for the world community is going to vastly, dramatically improve, that the United States is going to conduct itself in accordance with international law, and restrain from regime change, and hopefully we will no longer be the greatest aggressor nation in the world,” Fetzer said in his concluding remarks.

17325,New Bulgakov museum to open in Moscow - Russia News Now,"This post was originally published on this site 
A new museum dedicated to the writer Mikhail Bulgakov soon will open at 35a Bolshaya Pirogovskaya Street in Moscow, near the Sportivnaya and Frunzenskaya metro stations. The decision to use the apartment as a museum was made in December 2015, and a small exhibition was held in the space in May. 
“Small and very intimate, [the exhibition] was only put on for 10 days. We brought a first edition of The Master and Margarita and a few important bits of paraphernalia. It was an announcement of the future of this space as a museum,” Peter Mansilla-Cruz, the director of the museum, told RBTH. 
Bulgakov lived in this apartment in the 1920s and 1930s and it is where he wrote his best-known work, The Master and Margarita . The novel recently was part of Google’s online reading project. 
“The house where Bulgakov lived and worked is a memorial to our cultural heritage,” said Mansilla-Cruz, “behind its façade is a 19 th century mansion, which was rebuilt and reconstructed from top to bottom in the Soviet period. The apartment was occupied by yard and district services, and by lifters at the Housing Department, so it is suitably well-worn. It has been redesigned inside – the arch which led into his famous office has been re-laid with brick.” 
Bulgakov described the apartment in another of his works, Heart of a Dog . 
From the exhibition “Manuscripts don’t burn” at Bolshaya Pirogovkaya St., 35A. Source: Moskva Agency 
The development of the museum’s concept and the restoration will continue into 2017, but Mansilla-Cruz says that the place will become a memorial space furnished with Bulgakov’s desk and other artifacts. “Luckily, many of his photos from that time have been preserved, so all the details can be restored.” 
Moscow is already home to the State Bulgakov Museum. It is located near metro Mayakovskaya at 10 Bolshaya Sadovaya Street, the address at which Woland (Satan) and his entourage lived in The Master and Margarita . The museum organizes tours around Moscow featuring sites connected to Bulgakov. Related ",0
17326,70-Year-Old Veteran Kills Robbery Suspect Who Points Gun at Him,"When a    Vietnam veteran from St. Louis was confronted by armed suspects in Madison County, Illinois, on Thursday, he pulled his own gun and opened fire, killing one and wounding the second. [According to KSDK, the veteran was dropping off a friend in the “  of Abbott Street. ” Madison County State’s Attorney Tom Gibbons said, “Two individuals rolled up next to [the veteran and his friend] in a vehicle, asked for directions, and when they had their attention, took out a firearm. ” When the veteran saw the gun, he reacted by pulling his own weapon and opening fire.  The veteran killed    Billy Dickerson and hospitalized    Perry Richardson. Gibbons pointed out that both suspects were “wanted for other violent crimes” and suggested the veteran’s actions would bring “closure” to cases police had been trying to solve.

Fox 2 quoted Gibbons saying, “The Courts have consistently recognized the right of a   citizen to carry a concealed weapon for the purpose of  . This incident yesterday morning is the exact situation where the necessity for this right becomes crystal clear. ” Gibbons said the veteran’s actions should be a warning to all criminals planning to target   victims in Metro East. “You could end up staring down the barrel of a gun. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

17330,Two Mysterious 'Secret Chambers' Discovered Inside Egypt's Great Pyramid Using Cosmic Rays And Space Particles,"Two Mysterious 'Secret Chambers' Discovered Inside Egypt's Great Pyramid Using Cosmic Rays... Two Mysterious 'Secret Chambers' Discovered Inside Egypt's Great Pyramid Using Cosmic Rays And Space Particles By 186 
Two secret chambers have been discovered in Egypt’s 4,500-year-old Great Pyramid of Giza . 
Researchers confirmed they had found the mysterious cavaties after scanning the centuries old tomb using revolutionary radiography equipment. 
The Scan Pyramids project made the latest discovery after being able to demonstrate the efficiency of non-evasive Muons technology at the Bent Pyramid in Dahshour this May. 
Last year thermal scanning identified a major anomaly in the Great Pyramid, sparking a debate over whether there was a long-running network of tunnels hidden away inside. 
But now the mystery has been answered as the Ministry of Antiquities announced on Thursday that ‘two anomalies’ were found in the pyramid built under King Khufu. 
They are now looking to conduct further tests on the 146m-high monument to determine their function, nature and size. 
The pyramid, also known as the Pyramid of Khufu, named after the son of Phara oh Snefru, is considered one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. 
It has three known chambers, and like other pyramids in Egypt was intended as a pharaoh’s tomb. 
Operation Scan Pyramids scientists said: “We are now able to confirm the existence of a ‘void’ hidden behind the north face, that could have the form of at least one corridor going inside the Great Pyramid.” 
Another ‘cavity’ was discovered on the pyramid’s northeast flank but there is currently no link between the two cavities, according to Mehdi Tayoubi, founder of the Heritage…",0
17331,Megyn Kelly Makes BOMBSHELL Admission About Trump And The Media,"on November 13, 2016 12:43 pm · 
Before the leaked tape of Donald Trump describing his propensity to grab women “by the pussy” to Billy Bush, it seemed that the media was ignoring Donald Trump’s glaring faults as a presidential candidate. During the primaries , for example, he received far more positive media coverage than any of his competitors. It turns out there might be a reason for that – Trump was bribing the media – at least that’s the accusation being made by Megyn Kelly of Fox News. 
In her memoire “Settle for More,” which will be released this week, Kelly said that Trump likely received the infamous question, in which she asked about the fact that he has called women “fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals.” That question set Trump off on one of his Twitter tirades. These are only a portion: 
The worst and most controversial of which was this: 
As the election progressed, it became more and more apparent that Trump expected that no matter how egregious his behavior, he expected, no, demanded that the media kiss his orange ass. If they didn’t, he would cut off access, but before that, he tried bribery. 
While Kelly couldn’t speak for other members of the media, she alleges that Trump attempted to buy positive coverage by offering free stays at his hotels, with full perks. While the attempt clearly didn’t work on Kelly, she says that with some, their loyalty came cheap, or perhaps not so cheap. 
“This is actually one of the untold stories of the 2016 campaign: I was not the only journalist to whom Trump offered gifts clearly meant to shape coverage,” Kelly said. He also attempted to woo them with praise, she said, adding, “This is smart, because the media is full of people whose egos need stroking.” 
“Trump tried to work the refs, and some of the refs responded,” she said. 
When it became obvious that some reporters were “in the tank” for Trump, she alleges in one chapter, “certain TV hosts” would work with the candidate in advance on occasional Trump criticism so they would appear unbiased. She didn’t identify them by name or media outlet.

Kelly also asserts that the day before the debate in which Kelly asked about Trump’s treatment of women, the candidate called Fox News exec. Bill Sammon, who told him about the first question. All we heard about, though, during the election, was that it was Hillary Clinton who was fed a town hall debate question and it was hardly earth shattering. The insider knowledge said that a woman, in the Flint, Michigan debate, would ask a question about the Flint water .

17332,Trump and Putin Begin Work on US-Russia Reset,"Written by Melkulangara Bhadrakumar   The Russian President Vladimir Putin made the long-expected phone call to the US president-elect Donald Trump on Monday. It stands to reason that the presidential spokesman in the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, one of Putin’s closest aides, travelled to New York last week ostensibly to attend a world chess event, but principally to prepare the ground for the phone conversation on Monday. The agenda of such Russian-American conversations is usually agreed upon beforehand. The Kremlin readout (and the brief statement by Trump’s transition team in New York) gave a positive account of the phone conversation. From available details, it was a substantive conversation, which focused on reviving the Russian-American relationship, and, most important, also took up the Syrian conflict in some detail, including “issues related to solving the crisis”. So, what emerges is that Putin and Trump have begun discussing Syria in their very first conversation as statesmen, hardly 6 days after the latter got elected, even before his key cabinet posts have been filled, and with 8 weeks still to go to before the new presidency commences. Clearly, Syria is right on top of Trump’s mind – and the need to engage with Russia. Again, Trump had touched on Syria during his weekend interview with Wall Street Journal (when he made it clear that the US should dump Syrian rebels.) Quite obviously, Monday’s phone conversation underscored that Trump was not at all fanciful or a maverick when he repeatedly stuck out his neck on the campaign trail and took much flak, including wild allegations of him being a Russian poodle, when he kept insisting on the imperative need of constructively dealing with Putin, as a collaborator rather than as adversary. As could have been expected, Putin said to Trump that Moscow is ready “to develop a dialogue of partnership” with the US based on the “principles of equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other’s domestic affairs” – in short, a principled relationship that could be the core of a US-Russia reset . From the Kremlin point of view, what Putin articulated is a minimalist agenda. Putin has not spoken of any balancing of interests or the desirability of the two countries showing sensitivity to each other’s interests – although they discussed the fight against the “common enemy” – international terrorism and extremism. Trump’s transition headquarters quoted the president-elect as saying to Putin that “he is very much looking forward to having a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and the people of Russia.” With Monday’s conversation, one controversial part of Trump’s foreign-policy plank is gaining transparency. Both Trump and Putin “expressed support for active joint efforts to normalise relations and pursue constructive cooperation on the broadest possible range of issues. They emphasised the importance of establishing a reliable foundation for bilateral ties by developing the trade and economic component,” which in turn “would help “stimulate a return to pragmatic, mutually beneficial cooperation.” The twitter from New York said Trump and Putin discussed “strategic economic issues.” Energy issues? Western sanctions against Russia? We should know in a near future. Something seems to be brewing here. At any rate, it is a terrific forward- looking signal. For, how can the “trade and economic component” be developed so long as the sanctions continue, or when New Cold War clouds are hanging so low? Yet, the Kremlin readout omitted any reference to Ukraine. However, both Putin and Trump noted that at the leadership level, they “should encourage a return to pragmatic, mutually beneficial cooperation in the interests of both countries, as well as global stability and security.” By the way, on Monday, Trump also spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The Xinhua news agency reported that Trump paid fulsome compliments to China as “a great and important country with eye-catching development prospects”. Trump added that Sino-American relations “will witness even greater development” during his presidency. Trump and Xi agreed to meet “at an early date”. Interestingly, Putin and Trump also agreed to not only keep in touch by telephone but also begin planning for an in-person meeting. Would such a meeting take place before or after Trump’s inauguration in January? Conceivably, these could be the first signs of a new type of big-power relationship. Trump may seek a US-Russia-China entente cordiale to carry forward the US’ global leadership while America attends to the repair and reconstruction of its economy and society. Such an approach dovetails with Trump’s agenda of ‘America First’. No doubt, Trump has started running no sooner than he hit the ground. This seems to confirm the general impression of him as a man in a hurry. And Putin seemed to expect it. The Kremlin aide Peskov’s prognosis has been that Putin and Trump are two men “very much alike… in their basic approach towards international relations”, and there’s good reason “to believe that they will manage to establish good relations.” However, this sort of extraordinary ‘pro-active’ diplomacy by the president-elect, as he has shown on Monday, may not go down well with the American foreign policy and security establishment. Some of the irritation may even have welled up to the surface when the Obama administration chose Monday itself to announce even more sanctions against Russia – against six Russian parliamentarians representing Crimea and Sevastopol in the Duma. At any rate, Moscow too bid farewell on Monday to the Obama administration. Reacting to the reported advice by US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter to Trump not to cooperate with Russia over Syria, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said in Moscow on Monday that Moscow is no more interested than the United States (read Obama administration) in such cooperation and will proceed on that basis. Ryabkov said derisively that in any case, Moscow does not intend to “persuade the Pentagon leadership to change something in this regard.” To be sure, things have touched a nadir in Russian-American relations, and from this point things can only get better. Having said that, a genuine Russian-American reset depends on the balancing of mutual interests on a number of fronts where progress will be slow and needs to be hard-won. It is the Eurasian theatre that poses formidable challenges. Issues such a NATO expansion, Crimea, US missile defence, forward deployments of NATO along Russia’s borders, ‘colour revolutions’ — these are difficult topics. Maybe, the experience in working together on Syria — and an easing of western sanctions against Russia, which is entirely conceivable sometime through 2017 — would have a positive effect on the overall climate of trust and mutual confidence. What Monday’s phone conversation testifies is that Russia definitely sees a window of opportunity in the incoming Trump presidency; a reset in the troubled relationship is possible; and, that Putin and Trump could strike personal chemistry of a kind that was never found possible for the Russian leader with Obama.

17333,15 Secret iPhone Codes And Tricks,"Share on Facebook A list of secret Apple iPhone codes that can unlock a raft of hidden features and settings has been revealed, allowing users to do anything from enhancing their call quality to checking their mobile balance. While Android is particularly well known for offering a rabbit-hole of an operating system that can be tweaked and tinkered with, Apple's iOS has kept menus and settings relatively simple and locked down. However, there is a way that users can drill down to find some gems not seen on the surface. If you want to find out how many minutes you have left on your phone tariff, what your IMEI number (something you'll need if you swap phone networks) or even find out a way to enhance your iPhone's voice quality there's a way to do it that you won’t find by going to your normal phone's settings. Redmond Pie revealed a full list of the codes and how to use them. By typing in the following secret USSD codes on the dialpad of the phone then pressing the call button you can bring up these tricks: *3001#12345#*: Field Test mode *#5005*7672#: SMS centre number *3370#: Turn on or off EFR (Enhanced Full Rate), a mode that improves your iPhone's call quality *#06#: Find out your iPhone's IMEI number *#31#: Hide your number on calls option *#43#: Check if call waiting is on or off *43#: Turn on call waiting #43#: Turn off call waiting *646#: Check minutes left on contract *225#: Find out your current mobile account balance *777#: Find out prepaid account balance *#61#: Number of missed calls *#21#: Call forwarding status *#67#: Call forwarding number *#33#: Find out what mobile services are disabled on your phone One of the most interesting of the USSD codes is the Field Test mode, which allows users to see their phone-signal strength measured in numbers rather than those five bars. You'll see something displaying such as ‘-90’, with the number going up and down depending on signal. A value above -80 is a full-bar strength, but anything below -110 is very weak. This is a more accurate way of seeing whether you have enough signal to make a call, rather than holding on to hope with one-bar. It's worth noting that you should only use these codes and play around with your settings at your own risk, if you're not sure what something does better leave it be. Related:",0
17334,"Hurricane Matthew, Donald Trump, Nobel Prize: Your Friday Evening Briefing - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The extent of the devastation Hurricane Matthew inflicted on Haiti is becoming clearer. The death toll is now believed to be over 800 and some villages are under several feet of water. The storm continues to move up the East Coast, weakening slightly to a Category 3. President Obama warned against complacency. “I just want to emphasize to everybody that this is still a really dangerous hurricane,” he said. ____ 2. Donald Trump is facing sharp criticism over a recently surfaced tape of him talking lewdly about trying to have sex with a married woman shortly after his own third wedding. He’ll likely have to field questions about it when he meets Hillary Clinton on Sunday for their second debate (9 p. m. Eastern). But this time, the questions will be from undecided voters instead of a moderator. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate, didn’t make the polling cutoff for the debate. We joined him on the campaign trail, where he browses Yelp to figure out where to eat. ____ 3. The U. S. has formally accused Russia of stealing and disclosing emails from the Democratic National Committee in an effort to interfere with the election. “We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia’s   officials could have authorized these activities,” said a statement from the Department of Homeland Security. ____ 4. The latest jobs report supports what both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump have been saying about the economy. Yes, the economy is growing steadily and creating   jobs, as Mrs. Clinton says. But manufacturing jobs have fallen and millions of Americans remain economically sidelined, as Mr. Trump says. Employers added 156, 000 jobs last month, average hourly earnings moved slightly higher and 500, 000 people entered the labor force in September. ____ 5. The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Juan Manuel Santos, above, the president of Colombia, for pursuing a deal to end the country’s    war with the leftist rebel group known as the FARC. But the timing of the announcement is bittersweet: Five days ago, Colombians rejected the peace deal in a shocking referendum result. The prize could revive hopes for the agreement, but Colombians remain deeply polarized. ____ 6. Iraqi and American troops are preparing to retake the city of Mosul from the Islamic State. But concerns are rising over how well the city can be secured afterward. Driving the Islamic State out of Mosul would be a significant defeat for the group, but not a final one: Raqqa, in Syria, is the group’s de facto capital. ____ 7. It was a humid evening on a Bronx playground when a gunshot rang out. A mother leapt to protect her children, and a bullet pierced her heart. Her killer has not been found. The story of Jessica White is the latest chapter in our examination of every murder this year in one of New York City’s deadliest police precincts. ____ 8. In cinemas this weekend:  “The Girl on the Train,” “Voyage of Time: The Imax Experience,” the controversial “Birth of a Nation,” and “The Greasy Strangler. ” Some notes: Our critic described “The Girl on the Train,” above, as a preposterous movie but not an unenjoyable one. And we’ve termed “The Greasy Strangler” maybe the weirdest movie ever. The choice is yours. ____ 9. Adele. Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani activist. The television producer Shonda Rhimes. Senator Elizabeth Warren. These are among the women featured in new work from Annie Leibovitz, above, the celebrity photographer. She is expanding on the 1999 project “Women,” a book collaboration with her partner, Susan Sontag, who died in 2004. This time, Ms. Leibovitz says, it was easier to find women in leadership positions. And she has a powerful advocate for women as a mentor on the project: Gloria Steinem. ____ 10. Finally, six scientists took a   road trip in Alaska for the sake of finding Bombus polaris, an Arctic bumblebee. The goal was to learn how the bees are faring in a place where climate change is occurring rapidly. The group spent its days battling mosquitoes, but prevailed. And in the end, they found 40 of the big, fuzzy,   creatures. Almost cuddly, the hunters said (until one got stung). “They’re the pandas of the insect world,” one of the scientists said. ____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.

17335,"‘Westworld’ Season 1, Episode 6: The Tipping Point - The New York Times","Perhaps the bleakest in a catalog loaded with bleak albums, Radiohead’s “Kid A” closes with “Motion Picture Soundtrack,” a song that obliquely suggests the end of a relationship but is, more broadly, about disillusionment and death. “It’s not like the movies,” singer Thom Yorke laments. “They fed us on little white lies. ” Radiohead has provided the musical accompaniment for Maeve since the second episode, when “No Surprises” scrolled through the player piano as she unsuccessfully solicited a guest. In this week’s episode, Maeve wakes up to an instrumental version “Fake Plastic Trees,” which continues as she walks to work, unfazed by the mundane spectacle of a bloody shootout on the streets behind her. When “Motion Picture Soundtrack” plays, it again serves as a kind of coda, as a technician gives her a guided tour through the Westworld sausage factory. Maeve witnesses the creation and processing of synthetic beings, having come to realize she is one of them the steady diet of “white lies,” as it were, is over. It’s the most haunting and affecting sequence the show has yet produced. The obvious reason the robots of “Westworld” draw more sympathy than the humans is their vulnerability, the fact that their daily lives require a passive acceptance of the abuse, terror, and tragedy that’s heaped upon them. But Maeve’s peek behind the curtain hints at a more fundamental cause: As the engineers, coders and technicians dismantle and reconstruct the hosts, the show constantly forces us to reflect on how we humans are composed, too. How many of our own actions are scripted? How much can we really improvise? And what purpose did our own creator have in mind for us? If we were put through the full diagnostic test Maeve experiences here, perhaps the results would be equally unsettling. The tour signals a tipping point for Maeve, the season and the series at large. The world as Maeve has understood it is gone  —   and, more painfully still, she learns that neither she nor it was ever authentic. She sees dead bodies getting hosed off before the techs throw them on the slab and reanimate them. She sees buffalo and deer getting their movements calibrated in glass pens. She sees the programmed interaction, like lesbian playacting and a    . She sees a designer literally sculpting facial details. And finally, she sees her life and memories edited into a slick advertisement for real people to “Live Without Limits. ” For Maeve, it’s simultaneously a death and a reawakening, the end of her old life (or lives, given the sloppy accumulation of past constructs) and the beginning of a new one. What happens to Maeve in Episode 6 is a variation of what happened in the previous episode to Dolores, who gunned down a pack of   outlaws and chose to pursue a destiny more assertive than her    loop. Both women are now   though Maeve has the extra advantage of being able to manipulate her “attribute matrix,” dialing down her sense of loyalty and her ability to feel pain while amping up her “bulk apperception,” which will make her smarter and more powerful than the humans who built her. Having played the victim for years in Sweetwater, Maeve has essentially turned herself into a monster, hellbent on revenge. Beyond Maeve’s request for alterations, we learn that someone else with high clearance has already been manipulating her attributes. In Michael Crichton’s original “Westworld,” the robot revolt was as preordained as the dinosaur rampage in his “Jurassic Park,” an example of chaos theory in action. The root causes here are a little more ambiguous, a cocktail of design flaws, human weakness and the development of   and free will. But “The Adversary” reveals that someone  —   most likely Arnold, our ghost in the machine  —   has been tweaking with the earlier android models in the park, which Arnold had a hand in creating. Whether Arnold is alive or not is an open question, but he appears to have tweaked his creations from within  —   and maybe with Theresa’s help. Questions about Ford are floating around, too, particularly about his secret plans to expand Westworld. But this episode finds him in a rare state of powerlessness. When Bernard discovers a group of unregistered “anomalies” residing in the unused Sector 17, his investigation leads him to a family scene with a stern father, a mother, two young sons and a dog. Ford modeled the family from his own past and has been keeping these older machines around as an act of nostalgia, so he can interact with “ghosts” from his childhood. It’s yet another example of the creators imprinting the hosts with their flaws, but a poignant one for a man like Ford, who’s defined more by his aloofness than by his soul. “If you could see your son again, Bernard,” he asks, “wouldn’t you want to?” When you have the power to raise the dead, as Ford does, it’s hard to keep yourself from doing it. But then, there are consequences. Ford finds the robot dog dead. He asks the boy about it. The boy lies about killing it. Prime directives have been violated here and elsewhere, as the protections put in place to keep the hosts from lying to humans or from killing them have eroded. The final lyric of “Motion Picture Soundtrack is “I will see you in the next life. ” Hosts like Maeve and Dolores have died and been reborn, but the form that next life will take  —   and the amount of control they will exert over it  —   is a mystery. Paranoid Androids • A note on sex and nudity in “Westworld”: Last week’s episode got a lot of media attention for the big orgy   in Pariah, but I wound up addressing it lightly, because William and Dolores’s lack of interest in participating seemed much more notable than the event itself. But I feel like “Westworld” has been tossed into the same   basket as HBO shows like “Game of Thrones,” “True Detective,” and “Rome,” which have brought the network some criticism for appealing heavily to libidinous men. The difference is that “Westworld” has been, from the very first image of the show, studiously   despite a premise whose human subjects indulge a lust for   sex and violence. If you were bored by the orgy, that’s not a mistake on the part of the filmmakers. • Asked by Elsie if they’re in a    or   situation, Bernard replies: “We’re engineers. It means the glass has been engineered to the wrong specifications. ” That joke will not curb the popular fan theory that Bernard is a robot. • The Man in Black and Teddy continue their hunt for Wyatt and the center of the maze, leading to the disturbing news that Teddy might not be the White Hat he appears to be. Teddy’s decision to slaughter the soldiers with a Gatling gun startles even the Man in Black, who thinks it’s more prudent to flee than to fight. “They’ll just follow us,” he says coldly. • Teddy also supplies more information about the “old native myth” of the maze, with the ominous news that the man responsible “vanquished all his oppressors in a tireless fury. ” Finding the center of the maze would appear to be an   mission.",0

17337,"Al Qaeda Turns to Syria, With a Plan to Challenge ISIS - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   Al Qaeda’s top leadership in Pakistan, badly weakened after a decade of C. I. A. drone strikes, has decided that the terror group’s future lies in Syria and has secretly dispatched more than a dozen of its most seasoned veterans there, according to senior American and European intelligence and counterterrorism officials. The movement of the senior Qaeda jihadists reflects Syria’s growing importance to the terrorist organization and most likely foreshadows an escalation of the group’s bloody rivalry with the Islamic State, Western officials say. The operatives have been told to start the process of creating an alternate headquarters in Syria and lay the groundwork for possibly establishing an emirate through Al Qaeda’s Syrian affiliate, the Nusra Front, to compete with the Islamic State, from which Nusra broke in 2013. This would be a significant shift for Al Qaeda and its affiliate, which have resisted creating an emirate, or formal sovereign state, until they deem conditions on the ground are ready. Such an entity could also pose a heightened terrorist threat to the United States and Europe. Qaeda operatives have moved in and out of Syria for years. Ayman   the group’s supreme leader in Pakistan, dispatched senior jihadists to bolster the Nusra Front in 2013. A year later, Mr. Zawahri sent to Syria a shadowy Qaeda cell called Khorasan that American officials say has been plotting attacks against the West. But establishing a more enduring presence in Syria would present the group with an invaluable opportunity, Western analysts said. A   Qaeda state would not only be within closer striking distance of Europe but also benefit from the recruiting and logistical support of fighters from Iraq, Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon. Mr. Zawahri released his first audio statement in several months in early May, and it seemed to clear the way for the Qaeda figures to use the Nusra Front to form an emirate in Syria with his blessing. Some Nusra leaders, however, oppose the timing of such a move, so the affiliate has not yet taken that step. “The combination of an Al Qaeda emirate and a revitalized Al Qaeda central leadership in northern Syria would represent a confidence boost for the jihadi organization’s global brand,” Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, wrote this month in Foreign Policy. “Al Qaeda would present itself as the smart, methodical and persistent jihadi movement that, in contrast to the Islamic State, had adopted a strategy more aligned with everyday Sunni Muslims,” Mr. Lister wrote. Al Qaeda and the Islamic State have the same ultimate objective to create an Islamic state, but they have used different tactics, Mr. Lister and other scholars said. The Islamic State moved quickly to impose harsh, unilateral control over territory in Iraq and Syria and declare its independence. The Nusra Front has painstakingly sought to build influence over areas it wants to control and with other Syrian rebel groups opposed to the government of President Bashar  . American officials say the Islamic State has largely eclipsed Al Qaeda in the global jihadist hierarchy, with Al Qaeda hemorrhaging members to its more brutal and   rival. Many of the Khorasan operatives, including their leader, Muhsin   have been killed in eight American airstrikes in northwest Syria since September 2014. The Islamic State has between 19, 000 and 25, 000 fighters, roughly divided between Iraq and Syria, American intelligence analysts estimate. The Nusra Front has about 5, 000 to 10, 000 fighters, all in Syria. An emirate would differ from the Islamic State caliphate in the scale of its ambition, in that a Nusra emirate would not claim to be a government for all the world’s Muslims. Some senior American and European intelligence and law enforcement officials say the small but steady movement of important Qaeda operatives and planners to Syria is a desperate dash to a haven situated perilously in the middle of the country’s chaos. These officials say Qaeda operatives in Syria are determined but largely contained. “There’s always been a steady trickle, and it remains,” said Col. Steve Warren, a military spokesman in Baghdad for the   campaign in Iraq and Syria. Nonetheless, the presence of a senior cadre of experienced Qaeda leaders in Syria  —   some with   American bounties on their heads  —   has raised alarms in Washington as well as in the allied capitals of Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. “We have destroyed a large part of Al Qaeda,” John O. Brennan, the director of the C. I. A. said this month on NBC’s “Meet the Press. ” “It is not completely eliminated, so we have to stay focused on what it can do. ” The evolving assessment about Al Qaeda and the Nusra Front in Syria comes from interviews with nearly a dozen American and European intelligence and counterterrorism officials and independent analysts, most of whom have been briefed on confidential information gleaned from spies and electronic eavesdropping. They also analyzed the public statements and social media commentary among Qaeda and Nusra Front members. One of the operatives Western intelligence officials are focused most intently on is Saif   a senior member of Al Qaeda’s ruling body, known as the Shura Council, who oversaw the organization immediately after Osama bin Laden was killed by Navy SEALs in Pakistan in 2011. It is unclear whether Mr. Adl is in Syria, North Africa or somewhere else, American intelligence officials said. The government of Iran released Mr. Adl and four other senior members of Al Qaeda early last year as part of a secret prisoner swap with Al Qaeda’s branch in Yemen, the group holding an Iranian diplomat, Nour Ahmad Nikbakht. Mr. Adl, a former colonel in the Egyptian military who is believed to be in his 50s, is listed on the F. B. I. ’s Most Wanted Terrorist list and was indicted in the 1998 United States Embassy bombings in East Africa. He is the subject of a $5 million American bounty. “As a senior adviser to Al Qaeda’s networks in Syria and proximate environs,   could be especially useful in helping to define strategies that will help the group achieve   successes,” said Michael S. Smith II of Kronos Advisory, a terrorism research and analysis firm. The other four men released by Iran are also suspected of being in Syria. They are Abdul Khayr   an Egyptian who formerly led Al Qaeda’s foreign relations council Abul Qassam, a Jordanian who was a deputy to Abu Musab   the founder of the organization that later became the Islamic State Sari Shibab, a Jordanian operative and Abu Mohamed   an Egyptian who helped orchestrate Al Qaeda’s major attacks before Sept. 11, 2001, according to American officials briefed on details of the transfer. They agreed to discuss the matter on condition of anonymity because of the issue’s confidential nature. It is unclear how and when Al Qaeda might form an emirate in Syria that would hold territory and most likely harden its position toward more moderate Syrian opposition groups. The Nusra Front was created in 2012 as an offshoot of Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Iraq  —   which under the leadership of Abu Bakr   later declared itself the Islamic State  —   to fight Mr. Assad’s government. That same year, the United States designated the Nusra Front as a terrorist organization. But in 2013, the Nusra Front balked at joining Mr. Baghdadi when he announced the creation of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, and instead pledged allegiance to Mr. Zawahri in Pakistan. This ignited an often bloody rivalry between Nusra and Islamic State fighters in Syria. Now Al Qaeda’s top leadership is looking to stanch its losses in Pakistan and score a propaganda coup in Syria by establishing a formal emirate. A portion of Nusra’s leadership, however, supports continuing the group’s more pragmatic strategy of cultivating local support. “The fundamental disagreement is over how far Al Qaeda’s   strategy should be sustained before revealing more and more of Nusra’s real face and solidifying territorial control through the formation of an emirate,” Mr. Lister said in an interview. Many of the Syrian rebel groups that are fighting alongside Nusra against Mr. Assad’s government reject the idea of forming an emirate, fearing it would further splinter the opposition to Mr. Assad. “From Al Qaeda’s religious perspective, the declaration of a state or of an emirate should only happen in a context where it is possible to govern effectively,” said Firas Abi Ali, a senior principal analyst with IHS Country Risk in London. “It would be ironic for Al Qaeda to declare an emirate while there’s a caliphate that it rejects. ”",0
17339,Patriots Mount a Comeback for the Ages to Win a Fifth Super Bowl - The New York Times,"HOUSTON  —   The chants rang out loud and long at NRG Stadium in South Texas, not from bars or living rooms across New England, until a wall of sound enveloped a team and a quarterback on a mission. “Brady, Brady,” the fans screamed, and it is in moments like this  —   the first overtime in Super Bowl history  —   that Tom Brady appears most comfortable, as if lounging on his sofa in his beloved Uggs. In each of his previous four Super Bowl victories, Brady guided   drives for the Patriots. However sublime, those efforts against the Rams, the Panthers, the Eagles and the Seahawks all seemed quaint before Sunday night. That is when Brady again summoned the sorcery of his right arm to stun the Atlanta Falcons in what is undoubtedly the greatest late surge in a Super Bowl. When James White sneaked into the end zone from 2 yards away, completing a   victory that defied the bounds of credulity and secured the Patriots’ fifth title, his teammates stormed onto the field, flung their helmets and hugged anyone who moved. Across the field, the Falcons watched from their sideline as if fossilized in amber, too exhausted and dumbstruck to move. The Patriots trailed by 25 points with 2 minutes 12 seconds remaining in the third quarter  —   and by 19 with 9:48 left in regulation  —   and they won. They won because of Dont’a Hightower’s critical   and Julian Edelman’s Velcro hands and the clock management and coaching of a maestro, Bill Belichick, but mostly because of a truism that has beleaguered the league’s other 31 teams for 16 years running: the Patriots have Brady, and no one else does, not even the Falcons, who boasted the N. F. L. ’s most valuable player in Matt Ryan. Super Bowl LI Box Score Not including their   possession at the end of regulation, the Patriots, after mustering only a field goal on their first seven drives, scored on their final five possessions. “At halftime, I would say we weren’t down at all,” Brady said. “We were disappointed in the way we played, and we knew that we could go out and do a lot better in the second half. ” Brady completed 43 of 62 passes for 466 yards, with two touchdowns and an interception, a performance that earned him Super Bowl M. V. P. honors for the fourth time in his career. In none of the other three instances did he handle a season as challenging as this, from the illness plaguing his mother, Galynn, to the   suspension served for his role in that protracted saga known as Deflategate, after the underinflated footballs meant to give him a throwing advantage. In accepting the Vince Lombardi Trophy from Commissioner Roger Goodell, who meted out the punishment, the owner Robert K. Kraft did not outright address the scandal. But he did allude it to it in perhaps the strongest possible terms. “A lot has transpired in the last two years, and I don’t think that needs any explanation,” Kraft said. Because of that, he said, this title is “unequivocally the sweetest. ” His reputation sullied, Brady embarked on a nationwide tour of vindication that reached its climax in the venue where he won his second Super Bowl, back in February 2004, long before the Patriots achieved modern dynasty status in an era designed to encourage parity. Brady was 26 then, and it is possible that he is now superior in all facets, six months shy of his 40th birthday, at an age when most of his peers have either retired or entered a noticeable decline. By going   during his suspension, the Patriots created the farcical perception that they no longer needed him  —   that quarterbacks in New England’s ruthless machinery are interchangeable, even Brady. He turbocharged the Patriots’ offense with 33 touchdowns to four interceptions heading into Sunday, when he toiled, misfiring wide and long, until late in the third quarter. Powered by three touchdowns in a 9:54 span of the second quarter, Atlanta led by   with 10 minutes left before the Patriots unleashed 10 minutes of mayhem. Hightower’s   catalyzed the comeback, with Brady capitalizing on excellent field position to find Danny Amendola from 6 yards out. Less than 6 minutes remained, and though the Falcons advanced deep into New England territory, a holding penalty knocked them out of   range, forcing them to punt. This might be the appropriate point to note the travails of the Falcons franchise. Their woeful inaugural season of 1966, completed weeks before the first Super Bowl, presaged Atlanta’s struggles for the next  . It took more than a decade for the Falcons to reach the playoffs, more than three to advance to a conference championship and more than four to stack consecutive winning seasons. The Falcons traded Brett Favre and had a coach, Bobby Petrino, notify players that he was quitting by leaving notes at their lockers. The only other time Atlanta reached the Super Bowl, in January 1999, one of its best defensive players, Eugene Robinson, was arrested for soliciting a prostitute the night before. They have lost far more than they won, endured more agony than ecstasy and been lampooned for everything from their attendance to their uniforms, and for all those reasons  —   and more  —   a city that had not claimed a champion since the Braves won the World Series in 1995 was ready to celebrate with abandon once more. But first, Brady. He still had to contend with a defense overseen by the Falcons’ coach, Dan Quinn, who nearly foiled him two years ago, when he worked in Seattle. For all of Belichick’s experience, Quinn had coached in more Super Bowls recently, three in the last four seasons. The memory of that loss to New England still smolders for Quinn, who from that game remembers not the     interception by Malcolm Butler, but how the Seahawks went ahead to stay with about two minutes left. Quinn may never again coach a defense as fast and physical  —   words emblazoned on a bracelet he has worn  —   as Seattle’s, but for the first three quarters on Sunday, the Falcons harassed Brady, swarmed the ball and created turnovers, converting both of New England’s mistakes before halftime into 14 points. Most obvious was the Falcons’ speed advantage, and how, as Quinn’s Seahawks did against Denver in the 2014 game, they parlayed it into momentum. Robert Alford’s   interception return for a touchdown, the   return in a Super Bowl, had the same effect on the Patriots as Malcolm Smith’s for Seattle three years ago. And that, to an extent, was part of the plan Quinn toted along with him to Atlanta, whose ascension under him began with an evolved way of thinking forged by his time in Seattle: He wanted his players to work as hard as they ever have  —   but have a great time doing it. The Super Bowl was enjoyable, until it wasn’t. “That’s a hard one in the locker room,” Quinn said. “No place to put that one mentally for us. ” One of the Patriots’ underappreciated assets during their dominant stretch has been their resilience, which seems odd given how rarely they tend to lose, or even trail. They fell behind Sunday for the first time since Week 12 against the Jets. But the ethos cultivated by Belichick demands an uncommon fortitude. Those who cannot handle the atmosphere are weeded out like overwhelmed med students. Belichick built this reputation by twice smothering prolific offenses in Super Bowls  —   the 1990 Bills, when he coordinated the Giants’ unit, and the 2001 Rams, in the championship that launched New England’s dynasty. As potent as that Rams team was, it actually averaged fewer points and fewer yards per play during the season, and committed 33 more turnovers, than these Falcons. Scoring 80 points across two playoff victories emboldened Atlanta running back Devonta Freeman to call the Falcons’ offense “unstoppable. ” Except that the Patriots did, in fact, stop Atlanta on all four   possessions, empowering Brady with two timeouts and 3:30 left, chasing an   deficit. They marched 91 yards on a drive extended by a reception by Edelman as absurd as the comeback itself, one that evoked so many catches of past New England Super Bowls. Only this time, instead of watching opponents do the impossible  —   David Tyree hugging the ball against his helmet or Mario Manningham tiptoeing along the sideline or Jermaine Kearse contorting himself  —   it was the Patriots who amazed. While falling, Edelman caught a tipped pass, then dropped it, then cradled the ball just before it would have touched the ground. “It was one of the greatest catches I’ve ever seen,” Brady said. “I don’t know how the hell he caught it. I mean, I don’t think anybody  —   I don’t think he does. ” It only mattered that he did, and after White scored with 57 seconds left and Danny Amendola converted the tying   conversion, the Patriots called heads, won the coin toss and never let Atlanta touch the ball again. Only with a cleareyed view of these last five months, after the completion of another N. F. L. season, can it now be said: The anxiety, anger and exasperation that pervaded New England for months, after the scandal that cost the Patriots their sainted quarterback for a spell and dented their reputation  —   none of it mattered. The Patriots reached the final game, just as they thought they would. And they won, just as they thought they would all along, even if they never could have conjured how they did it. Brady and the Patriots were down for much of Sunday night, but they reappeared in the fourth quarter. And now, after Sunday, after winning yet another Super Bowl, he struck a familiar pose: holding the Lombardi Trophy as confetti fell.",0

17343,"Deluged Immigration Courts, Where Cases Stall for Years, Begin to Buckle - The New York Times","ARLINGTON, Va.  —   Walk into the immigration court here, and scenes of a justice system in collapse abound. In the overflowing courtrooms, one judge raced through hearings, opening 85 cases on a recent day, and several others were not far behind. The judge in Courtroom 2 had unsettling news for Edhite Pouken Shienji, a woman from Cameroon seeking asylum. After 14 years of delays, she was finally scheduled for a hearing. But at the last minute, the judge was reassigned to handle the cases of some migrants from Central America. Her hearing was postponed once again  —   to 2019. In Courtroom 8, there was a deportation hearing for Damián Martínez, from Mexico. The judge soon discovered he was a    infant, dozing on the shoulder of his mother. Somehow the baby’s case had become separated in court records from hers. The bewildered mother, in court without a lawyer, had no clue how to fix the problem. The judge could only urge her to make sure that Damián “presents himself in all of his future hearings. ” Weighed down by a backlog of more than 520, 000 cases, the United States immigration courts are foundering, increasingly failing to deliver timely, fair decisions to people fighting deportation or asking for refuge, according to interviews with lawyers, judges and government officials. With too few judges, overworked clerks and an antiquated docket based on stacks of paper files, many of the 56 courts nationwide have become crippled by delays and bureaucratic breakdowns. The courts will be a major obstacle for   Donald J. Trump and his plans to deport as many as three million immigrants he says have criminal records. Many of those deportations  —   at least hundreds of thousands  —   would have to be approved by immigration judges. Mr. Trump has also said he intends to freeze federal hiring, which would prevent the courts from bringing on new judges and clerks, who are federal employees. Without significant new resources, the courts would probably slow Mr. Trump’s deportations to a stall. On a visit to the immigration court in Denver four years ago, cases were moving briskly, but judges were starting to worry because hearing delays were reaching 18 months. Now in Denver, the court with the longest wait times in the country, most cases drag on more than five years, the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a research group studying federal data, has found. In Arlington, by reputation one of the nation’s   courts, eight judges have more than 30, 000 cases, with some scheduling hearings in 2022. “The system has been failing, but now it is reaching a tipping point,” said Benjamin Johnson, the executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Unlike other federal courts, which are part of the judiciary, immigration courts are run by the Justice Department, making them subject to shifting political priorities in Washington. The backlog started building years ago, as President Obama stepped up immigration enforcement while Congress clamped down on spending. A hiring freeze at the Justice Department under the budget sequester from 2011 to 2014 exacerbated the problem. In the past two years, the administration won increases for the courts from Congress, and the number of immigration judges rose by 65 to about 300 today. But the hiring of judges is glacially slow. With each judge completing an average of 750 cases a year, the courts would need at least 520 judges to eliminate the backlog within one year, according to an analysis by Human Rights First, a watchdog group in New York. The worst crunch was created by the Obama administration after families from Central America surged across the southwest border in 2014 and again this year. In late 2014, justice officials ordered the courts to rush asylum claims of Central American parents and children to the front of their dockets, pushing other cases back. Officials hoped migrants who were denied would be deported quickly, sending a message to others in Central America to stay home. Judge Paul W. Schmidt observed the effect of this edict from his bench in an austere Arlington courtroom. “It’s total chaos,” he said in an interview, after retiring from the immigration bench in June after nearly two decades. Mr. Schmidt was given cases that were not priorities. Before long, his docket was piled with more than 10, 000 cases. The only dates open on his hearing calendar were six years away. Mr. Schmidt recalled the shock on the faces of those before him when he announced the distant date when they could expect a decision. “It becomes clear to people these are just imaginary dates,” he said. “That robs the judges of credibility. The court as a whole loses credibility. ” The administration’s   plan did not succeed, Justice Department officials acknowledge. Across the country, more than 161, 000 cases of parents and children from Central America have been opened since 2014, but so far judges have finished only about 67, 000  —   or about 40 percent  —   of them, according to records. Other cases are inching forward as migrants fearing for their safety press their arguments for protection. In nearly 41, 000 of the cases completed, judges ruled against immigrants and ordered them deported, the records show. But in practice, with enforcement agents under instructions from the administration to focus on deporting dangerous criminals, few deportations of families from Central America, who mostly do not have criminal records, have been carried out. “The system is there to provide due process. It isn’t there to send enforcement messages,” Mr. Schmidt said. Mr. Trump has said he will choose as his nominee for attorney general Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, a vigorous proponent of strong immigration enforcement. With broad powers over the immigration courts, Mr. Sessions could appoint tough judges and change procedures so the system in the future would move faster and be more restrictive. Mr. Sessions could cancel the appointments of roughly 75 new judges selected by Attorney General Loretta Lynch to choose judges to his liking. But it might be a year or longer before they took the bench. And Mr. Sessions would not have authority to summarily reduce the backlogs, lawyers said. As the backlogs grow, they create new problems. People who come to the courts with urgent stories of terrifying dangers that drove them from their homes find they cannot be heard for years. Circumstances change, evidence grows old, witnesses move on. Cases get scrambled or misplaced. When Reina Rojas de Ayala first filed for asylum in Arlington in 2012, she had a strong argument that she would be in grave danger if she was forced to return to El Salvador. By the time she had a hearing four years later, her legal case was diminished even though the perils at home were not. Ms. Ayala, 43, lived in Virginia with her Salvadoran husband, a legal immigrant. But she was undocumented, and in 2009 she went to El Salvador to try to obtain papers to return legally, taking two children born in the United States. The danger came from one of her older sons in El Salvador, Samuel Ayala, now 26. He demanded money, saying he needed to pay dues to a criminal gang. “He was violent, telling me he had to have the cash,” Ms. Ayala said. “I told him to get a job. Many times he shoved me down and hit me. ” Fearing he would kill her, she sent her American children to Virginia by plane while she went to the border to request asylum. Over time, the gang turned on Mr. Ayala, threatening the whole family. He fled to the United States, making peace with his mother. But her legal case, based on his threats, unraveled. At her hearing, the judge denied asylum but agreed to dismiss her deportation. She is in immigration limbo, allowed to remain with her family but uncertain for how long. Many foreigners cannot afford to pay for lawyers indefinitely, and in a court system where there is no right to   counsel, volunteers are reluctant to take cases that could last for years. Among those who need a lawyer is a woman who crossed the border in August 2014, after hiding for months in her own darkened house in a Salvadoran mountain village to protect her family from a gang. When she could not pay the $6, 000 they demanded, she said, they went to her daughter’s high school, dragged her into the street and beat her unconscious. “I saw her blood,” said the woman, 36, who asked that she be identified by only her initials, Z. A. which are used on her court docket. Still fearful after two years in Virginia, in her small apartment she keeps the lights low and the curtains drawn. The daughter had scars from the beating, which persuaded a judge to grant her asylum in January. Z. A. should have won as well, but the government lost track of her case. It took a lawyer to recover it, but Z. A.’s case will begin moving forward only at a hearing next May. “This case could be done in 10 minutes,” said the lawyer, Christina Wilkes. “But the court is so overwhelmed, no one can look at it. ” There are some benefits for people stalled in the courts, as immigrants can stay legally in the United States and many receive work permits while their cases wind through the system. But for asylum seekers, endless waiting can be agonizing. Until they are approved, they cannot help spouses and children escape the same dangers that caused them to run. Another immigrant fled Ethiopia in 2012, one step ahead of government officials coming to jail him. An Arlington judge set the hearing to decide in his case in May 2019. His wife and two young sons, still in Ethiopia, have been continuously harassed. “My kids are suffering because of me,” said the man, who requested that he be identified by only the initials on his case file, S. Y. “I used to call them two times a day. But now I stopped because I feel like I am lying to them. I used to be sociable, but now I don’t even know who I am. I just sit in my house alone. ”",0
17344,Voting Machines Stolen Before Georgia Special Election,"Several voting machines were stolen in Georgia as the state gears up for a hotly contested special election to replace a Republican who left Congress to take a job in the Trump administration, reports say. [The devices were taken on Monday from a Cobb County precinct manager’s vehicle, according to Channel 2 Acton News.  In a public statement, Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp said, “It is unacceptable that the Cobb County Elections Office waited two days to notify my office of this theft. ” “We have opened an investigation, and we are taking steps to ensure that it has no effect on the election tomorrow. I am confident that the results will not be compromised,” Kemp added. Cobb County’s elections director, Janine Eveler, insisted that the information on the machines is “hard to access” and says she does not think the thieves will be able to interfere in the election. The election has been called to fill the House seat vacated by Rep. Tom Price, who left Congress to become President Trump’s secretary of Health and Human Services. In 2016, Price won his seat by a lopsided 20 points in the conservative Sixth District. The GOP side of the election features a crowded field of 11 candidates, but there are five Democrat candidates, as well. Democrat candidate Jon Ossoff, a former congressional staffer, seems to be the favorite on the left, with actors and activists aligning behind him and raising funds for him. The election pits all candidates against one other, but to win outright, the top   must garner 50 percent or more. If no candidate gets that 50 percent, a runoff election will determine the winner.

17345,Calexit Leader Moves to Russia Permanently - or Until California Secedes - Breitbart,"The leader of a California movement to secede from the United States of America, or “CalExit,” does not want to live under the American flag  —   and is now settling in Russia. [In a statement issued this week, Louis Marinelli announced that he is moving to his wife’s native Russia permanently, or at least until California secedes, calling himself the   “representative of the Republic of California to Russia”.  Marinelli posted a long message on yescalifornia. org about his decision to seek permanent residence in Russia, and to abandon the effort he started in 2014 to see California secede from the union. Marinelli states that he led the group in the absence of a native Californian to lead it, adding, “From the beginning, I have pointed out the trouble I bring to the table with my political background and my history in Russia, a country I have grown to love. ” As I have stated in the past, I do not wish to live under the American flag. I do not wish to live under the American political system or within the American economic system. Regardless, I had long planned to eventually return to occupied California and struggle for her independence from the United States so we could build the kind of country that reflects our progressive values. However, while my frustration, disappointment and disillusionment with the United States remains, these feelings now point me in a different direction. I have found in Russia a new happiness, a life without the albatross of frustration and resentment towards ones’ homeland, and a future detached from the partisan divisions and animosity that has thus far engulfed my entire adult life. Consequently, if the people of Russia would be so kind as to welcome me here on a permanent basis, I intend to make Russia my new home. Accordingly, as the author and architect of the Calexit ballot initiative petition which is currently circulating in California, it is only proper, given my intention to seek permanent residence in Russia and not return to California in the foreseeable future, to withdraw that petition from circulation, and to allow a new petition, free from ties to me and drafted by others, to be resubmitted at future date of their choosing. In Marinelli’s lengthy address, he attempts to explain some of his disdain for the U. S. and the motivation for his “CalExit” campaign as he writes that he brought his foreign wife to America, but says there were issues with the process of her immigration status. He says his allegiance to the United States shifted to allegiance to California. In a prior interview with Breitbart California, Marinelli had indicated that his wife is a citizen of Russia and her family still resides there. He continued, in his address: And so,   months ago, I started the Calexit campaign in order to establish a country where my wife would not need to live in the shadows and where my family would feel welcome. And I wanted a country to be proud of again  …     and California, unlike the United States, is a great source of pride for me. But three weeks ago, my wife finally received her green card and now my personal struggle against the United States government has ended. He called himself a Californian “first and foremost, and that my claim to being an American is the same claim that could be made by the other inhabitants of North and South America because we are all Americans. ” Marinelli boasted that Yes California has compiled a mailing list of 110, 489, with 97, 463 of those as registered supporters and 8, 510 designated volunteers, but just 1, 201 actual financial contributors. The CalExit leader concluded by stating that he would return to California once the state secedes from the union. “Until then I will continue to serve as the representative of the Republic of California to Russia,” he wrote. Yes California filed papers last November to begin collecting signatures in an effort to put a California secession measure on the 2018 ballot. The group needed to collect 585, 407 valid signatures to qualify. Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana ",0
17346,Federal Transgender Bathroom Access Guidelines Blocked by Judge - The New York Times,"A federal judge has blocked the Obama administration from enforcing new guidelines that were intended to expand restroom access for transgender students across the country. Judge Reed O’Connor of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Texas said in a   ruling, which he said should apply nationwide, that the government had not complied with federal law when it issued “directives which contradict the existing legislative and regulatory text. ” Judge O’Connor, whom President George W. Bush nominated to the federal bench, said that not granting an injunction would put states “in the position of either maintaining their current policies in the face of the federal government’s view that they are violating the law, or changing them to comply with the guidelines and cede their authority over this issue. ” The judge’s order on Sunday, in a case brought by officials from more than a dozen states, was a victory for social conservatives in the continuing legal battles over the restroom guidelines, which the federal government issued this year. The culture war over the rights of transgender people, and especially their right to use public bathrooms consistent with their gender identities, has emerged as an emotional cause among social conservatives. The Obama administration’s assertion that the rights of transgender people in public schools and workplaces are protected under existing laws against sex discrimination has been condemned by social conservatives, who said the administration was illegally intruding into local affairs and promoting a policy that would jeopardize the privacy and safety of schoolchildren. The ruling could deter the administration from bringing new legal action against school districts that do not allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms of their choice. “We are pleased that the court ruled against the Obama administration’s latest illegal federal overreach,” Attorney General Ken Paxton of Texas said in a statement on Monday. “This president is attempting to rewrite the laws enacted by the elected representatives of the people and is threatening to take away federal funding from schools to force them to conform. ” A spokeswoman for the Justice Department, Dena W. Iverson, said the department was disappointed with the decision and was reviewing its options. In a statement, several civil rights organizations that had submitted a brief opposing the injunction called the ruling unfortunate and premature. “A ruling by a single judge in one circuit cannot and does not undo the years of clear legal precedent nationwide establishing that transgender students have the right to go to school without being singled out for discrimination,” the groups  —   Lambda Legal the American Civil Liberties Union and the A. C. L. U. of Texas the National Center for Lesbian Rights the Transgender Law Center and G. L. B. T. Q. Legal Advocates  Defenders  —   said in their statement. The ultimate impact of the Texas decision is unclear and is likely to be limited, legal experts said. For one thing, more senior courts in other regions have agreed with the administration that transgender students and workers are protected by existing laws against sex discrimination, and their decisions will not be altered by the Texas ruling. Also, the decision will not necessarily affect the outcome of other current cases. In the most prominent one, a federal court in North Carolina is weighing almost identical issues in suits brought by civil rights groups and the Justice Department that seek to block a state law requiring people in government buildings, including public schools, to use bathrooms that correspond to the gender on their birth certificates. Adding another major note of uncertainty, the United States Supreme Court has temporarily blocked a decision by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals that required a school district in Virginia to allow a transgender boy to use the boys’ bathrooms. The Supreme Court issued a temporary injunction until it decides, probably this fall, whether to hear the case. If the Supreme Court does take the case and reaches a majority decision one way or another, then existing rulings by district and appeals courts could be superseded. If the Supreme Court takes the Virginia case but then is divided, four to four, on the issues, the Fourth Circuit’s existing decision in favor of transgender rights would take effect, although it would not be a nationally binding precedent. The Texas lawsuit, filed by Mr. Paxton on behalf of officials in 13 states, argued that the Obama administration had overstepped its authority in a series of pronouncements in recent years holding that discrimination against transgender people is a violation of existing laws against sex discrimination, including Title IX in federal education laws and Title VII in federal civil rights laws governing the workplace. In May, in the latest such statement, the federal Justice and Education Departments issued a letter to public schools stating that transgender people should be free to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identities, and that schools that refused could lose federal funds. “A school may not require transgender students to use facilities inconsistent with their gender identity or to use   facilities when other students are not required to do so,” the letter stated. The letter was quickly condemned by social conservatives, leading numerous state governments and school districts around the country to file lawsuits seeking to prevent the administration from taking action. The Obama administration, seeking to deflect the Texas lawsuit and another brought by 10 other states, argued that the directive was not a regulation or mandate but rather an explanation of how the administration interpreted existing   protections. But it carried a threat that the administration might sue noncompliant school districts and seek to cut off vital federal education aid. The states argued not only that the administration was wrong as a matter of law, but also that it had failed to follow legal procedures for issuing what the states called a “new mandate” that “harms school districts from coast to coast by usurping lawful authority” and jeopardizing “billions of dollars in federal funding. ” The Justice Department countered that the case was not suitable for litigation because the states had not shown evidence that they faced imminent harm, let alone a likelihood of success on the merits. If the administration brought action against school districts, the government and groups supporting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights argued, the school districts or states could make their case in court. “There is a multistep procedure before a state might lose federal funding,” said Jon W. Davidson, the legal director of Lambda Legal. “The government would have to specifically challenge a state, the state could respond, the government could bring a lawsuit, and then litigation in the courts would decide whether the government’s interpretation of the law is correct or not. ”",0
17347,U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara Says He Was Fired After Refusing to Quit - The New York Times,"The call to Preet Bharara’s office from President Trump’s assistant came on Thursday. Would Mr. Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, please call back? The following day, Mr. Bharara was one of 46 United States attorneys appointed by President Barack Obama asked to resign  —   and to immediately clean out their offices. The request took many in his office by surprise because, in a meeting in November, Mr. Bharara was asked by the    to stay on. Mr. Bharara refused to resign. On Saturday, he announced on Twitter that he had been fired. It was unclear whether the president’s call on Thursday was an effort to explain his change of heart about keeping Mr. Bharara or to discuss another matter. The White House would not comment on Saturday. However, there are protocols governing a president’s direct contact with federal prosecutors. According to two people with knowledge of the events who were not authorized to discuss delicate conversations publicly, Mr. Bharara notified an adviser to the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, that the president had tried to contact him and that he would not respond because of those protocols. Mr. Bharara then called Mr. Trump’s assistant back to say he could not speak with the president, citing the protocols. Mr. Bharara was a highly public prosecutor who relished the spotlight throughout more than seven years in office. He pursued several   cases involving Wall Street, and he was in the midst of investigating   by Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, and preparing to try former top aides to the governor of New York, Andrew M. Cuomo, who are both Democrats. It was not immediately clear how his departure would affect those cases and others that were pending. Mr. Bharara stayed quiet until Saturday afternoon. Then, on his personal Twitter account, he wrote: “I did not resign. Moments ago I was fired. ” Referring to the Southern District of New York, he continued, “Being the US Attorney in SDNY will forever be the greatest honor of my professional life. ” Peter Carr, a Justice Department spokesman, declined to characterize Mr. Bharara’s departure that way, saying only, “I can confirm that Mr. Bharara is no longer the U. S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. ” All presidents choose their own appointees for United States attorney positions and almost always ask those from their predecessors to leave. But the process under Mr. Trump was unusually abrupt, and it was yet another rocky encounter between the Trump administration and the nation’s law enforcement apparatus. Mr. Bharara’s job had appeared to be secure. In November, he met at Trump Tower with the   and several of his advisers, including Mr. Trump’s    Jared Kushner, and his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, according to two people briefed on that discussion who requested anonymity. At the meeting, according to those briefed, Mr. Trump asked Mr. Bharara to remain in the job, which Mr. Bharara relayed to reporters and television cameras in the Trump Tower lobby. Then came the order to resign on Friday, creating what was described as a feeling of whiplash in the prosecutor’s Manhattan office. One person familiar with the views of current prosecutors described an oddly subdued reaction mixed with anxiety as the events unfolded. “You have a sense of how it’s going to end, and it’s not going to end well,” the person said. But Mr. Bharara, unlike his fellow United States attorneys, publicly refused to leave. He gave no statement citing a policy or legal issue affecting his decision to refuse the resignation order. It was unclear how many of the 46 holdovers had submitted resignations. Mr. Bharara’s colleague Robert L. Capers, the United States attorney in Brooklyn, announced his resignation Friday. Two White House officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid offending the president, said the promise to keep Mr. Bharara on was a product of a chaotic transition process and Mr. Trump’s desire at the time to try to work with Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, with whom Mr. Bharara is close. The relationship between Mr. Trump and Mr. Schumer, the Senate minority leader, has since soured. It was Dana Boente, the acting deputy attorney general, who called Mr. Bharara on Saturday. According to a Justice Department official, Mr. Boente told Mr. Bharara that he was one of the 46 United States attorneys being told to resign. Mr. Bharara, the official said, replied that that was in conflict with Mr. Trump asking him to stay on. Mr. Boente reiterated that Mr. Bharara was being asked to resign, and Mr. Bharara said that he was interpreting that as being fired. Mr. Boente then said again that the department was asking him to step down, according to the official. Mr. Bharara’s office is overseeing the case against the former aides to Mr. Cuomo and the inquiry into   by Mr. de Blasio, who has been a target of Mr. Trump’s ire as he has positioned himself as a vocal opponent of the president’s on the left. His office is also overseeing an investigation into whether Fox News, which is owned by the media magnate Rupert Murdoch, failed to properly alert shareholders of settlements with female employees who had accused the channel’s former chief, Roger Ailes, of sexual harassment. The investigation of Mr. de Blasio’s campaign   has been going on for about a year and is examining whether the mayor or his aides traded beneficial city action for political donations. Mr. de Blasio was interviewed recently by prosecutors who appeared to be in the final stages of determining whether to seek charges in the matter. Mr. de Blasio’s press secretary has said that the mayor has cooperated with Mr. Bharara’s inquiry and that he and his staff had “acted appropriately and well within the law. ” White House officials have said little about the timing of the mass push for resignations, other than insisting it had not been a response to a call for a purge on Fox News, where one host, Sean Hannity, urged the president to clean house at the Justice Department. Phil Singer, a former aide to Mr. Schumer and a Democratic strategist, called it “absurd” to suggest that Mr. Bharara’s firing had been meant to punish Mr. Schumer. He noted that any investigation involving Trump Tower would fall within the purview of Mr. Bharara’s office. The Southern District of New York, which Mr. Bharara has overseen since 2009, encompasses Manhattan, Mr. Trump’s home before he was elected president, as well as the Bronx, Westchester County and other counties north of New York City. The Thursday afternoon phone call from the Oval Office was a curious sidelight to the   events. Mr. Trump’s assistant asked the prosecutor to return the call. Before doing so, Mr. Bharara called Mr. Sessions’s chief of staff, Jody Hunt, to alert the Justice Department to the call and express concern about contacts between presidents and federal prosecutors. Aides to Mr. Trump did not respond to three emails seeking comment about the nature of Mr. Trump’s call to Mr. Bharara.",0
17348,North Korea’s Nuclear Ticket to Survival,"Share This 
In recent months, a number of U.S. officials have begun to reassess their understanding of why the North Korean government wants nuclear weapons. Rather than repeating the standard claim that the North Korean government is taking extreme measures to intimidate its enemies into making concessions, some officials have begun to suggest that the North Korean government desires nuclear weapons for defensive purposes. 
After the North Korean government conducted its fifth underground nuclear test on September 9, 2016, former US official Victor Cha presented the new line of thinking. “This is not a cry for negotiations,” Cha told The New York Times . “This is very clearly a serious effort at amassing real nuclear capabilities that they can use to deter the US and others.” 
A few days later, Cha shared the same logic with a subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “Testing was once interpreted by pundits to be an attention-getting effort for dialogue with the United States,” but “it would be irresponsible today to adhere to such an interpretation,” Cha stated . In today’s world, “North Korea is executing a strategy designed to demonstrate a survivable nuclear deterrent before the next US administration comes into office.” In short, Cha insisted that the North Korean government sought to acquire nuclear weapons for the purpose of deterring its enemies. 
Threat or No Threat? 
Of course, not everyone in Washington agrees with such thinking. Although Cha and other strategic analysts have proposed that the North Korean government is rationally pursuing a nuclear deterrent to defend itself against the United States, high-level officials in Washington insist that nothing could be further from the truth. 
Notably, Secretary of State John Kerry has refuted the idea that the North Korean government needs to take defensive measures. For “any person of common sense,” the answer to the question of whether the North Korean government has to defend itself against the United States is “no,” Kerry announced on October 19, 2016. “Everybody knows that.” 
After making his point, Kerry then insisted that the United States posed no threat to North Korea because the US government has made no recent efforts to destroy the country. “The United States has had the power to wipe out North Korea for years – for years,” Kerry noted. “And if indeed that was our goal, we wouldn’t be sitting around waiting while they’re getting additional nuclear weapons.” 
Certainly, US officials have not recently attempted to wipe out North Korea. Although the United States had once destroyed most of North Korea during the Korean War, when it spent three years carpet-bombing the country and destroying most North Korean cities, US officials have not resorted to comparable tactics in the country since the armistice ended the fighting in 1953. 
At the same time, US officials have continued to take other actions to pressure, marginalize, and isolate North Korea. For starters, US officials have worked with their allies to impose restrictive sanctions on the country. Certainly, “we’re always looking at ways we can continue to apply pressure,” State Department Spokesperson Mark C. Toner acknowledged during a press briefing on July 19, 2016. In fact, “the sanctions are pretty severe right now.” 
Two months later, White House official Ben Rhodes made a similar point, only providing more emphasis. “So we’ve passed now through the U.N. Security Council the strongest sanctions ever on North Korea,” Rhodes stated . The sanctions are “having an impact” and “putting a tighter squeeze on North Korea.” 
To put an even tighter squeeze on North Korea, US officials have also made it clear that they are ready to take more direct action. Taking advantage of their extraordinary military power in the region, including the 28,500 US soldier s that are stationed in South Korea, US officials have continually reminded the North Korean government that they are ready to resume the Korean War at a moment’s notice. 
On the day that the North Korean government conducted its fifth underground nuclear test, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter made the point by stating that “US forces on the Korean Peninsula are always ready, and this is true every single day, to fight tonight.” 
A few days later, US officials then sent an even more powerful signal of their preparedness, flying two nuclear-capable B-1B bombers over South Korea in a display of military power. As US General Vincent K. Brooks explained at the time, US officials wanted to demonstrate their commitment to using their “full range of military capabilities,” such as nuclear weapons. 
Expect Serious Consequences 
By applying constant pressure to North Korea, US officials have sent another powerful message to the North Korean government. Although officials in Washington may deny that they are threatening North Korea, they have made it clear that the North Korean government can expect to face serious consequences for continuing to defy the United States with its nuclear weapons program. 
“What I can tell you is our policy, with respect to North Korea’s provocations and the resolve of the United States and the international community to try to put adequate pressure on them to change their behavior, has not changed and remains the same,” State Department Spokesperson John Kirby confirmed on October 25, 2016. 
Even so, some officials are now providing another way of understanding the situation. On the same day that Kirby made his statement, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper indicated that the United States has ultimately left the North Korean government with no serious alternatives. “I think the notion of getting the North Koreans to denuclearize is probably a lost cause,” Clapper stated . “They are not going to do that. That is their ticket to survival.” Indeed, Clapper indicated that the North Korean government would find it necessary to maintain a powerful nuclear arsenal in order to deter the constant threats it faces from the United States. 
“And I got a good taste of that when I was there, about how the world looks from their vantage,” Clapper added. “And they are under siege and they are very paranoid.” 
In short, a number of US officials are now beginning to come to terms with one of the main reasons why the North Korean government is making such a major effort to acquire nuclear weapons. These officials are starting to believe that the North Korean government is working to build an arsenal of nuclear weapons to create a powerful deterrent against the United States.

17349,"Criticizing Israel, Bernie Sanders Highlights Split Among Jewish Democrats - The New York Times","It was the sort of question  —   Does Israel have a right to defend itself as it sees fit?  —   that had often caused candidates, especially those with designs on winning a primary in New York, to produce paeans to the strength of the   relationship and a stream of   orthodoxy. But Senator Bernie Sanders dug in. “There comes a time when if we pursue justice and peace, we are going to have to say that Netanyahu is not right all of the time,” Mr. Sanders said, referring to the Israeli prime minister, amid cheers from the crowd at Thursday’s Democratic debate in Brooklyn. He added: “All that I am saying is we cannot continue to be  . There are two sides to the issue. ” Jewish Democrats, like the rest of the party, have been struggling for years over the appropriate level of criticism when it comes to Israel’s policies in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. But that debate burst onto a big national stage this week thanks to Mr. Sanders, the most successful Jewish presidential candidate in history. Mr. Sanders’s comments, in the de facto capital of Jewish American politics, buoyed the liberal and increasingly vocal Democrats who believe that a frank discussion within the party has been muzzled by an older, more conservative Jewish leadership that is suspicious of criticism of Israel. Jeremy   the president of J Street, a progressive   lobbying group whose more critical view of the Israeli government has gained influence on Capitol Hill, said Mr. Sanders’s comments were “very different from the stale talking points that have dominated those types of discussions before” and contributed to a “meaningful redefinition of what it means to be  . ” But the comments, as measured as they were striking, worried more traditionally   Jewish Democrats and Jewish organizations trying desperately to maintain bipartisan support for the Israeli government but watching it slowly being chipped away. “I thought that Bernie Sanders’s comments were disgraceful and reprehensible, and I thought he was just over the top,” said Eliot Engel, a Jewish congressman from the Bronx who supports Hillary Clinton. He said that Mr. Sanders’s comments were irresponsible, giving radical   elements in the party more license to attack Israel. “Maybe he feels like he has to bend over backwards because he’s Jewish?” Mr. Engel said, adding, “It bothers me a great deal. ” Even before the debate, unease over Israeli policies within the Democratic Party was rising. At the 2012 Democratic National Convention, delegates lustily booed officials who reinstated in the party platform a recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, at odds with the United States’ official position that the city’s status must be negotiated between Israelis and Palestinians. Protesting Israel’s policies and advocating boycotts to pressure its government are practically electives for liberal college students furious about the growth of Israeli settlements in the West Bank. In Washington, relations between President Obama and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are acrid, and last year more than 50 members of the Democratic caucus boycotted Mr. Netanyahu’s speech to Congress in which he criticized Mr. Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran. Mr. Sanders’s response on Thursday was to a question about his past statement that Israel had used disproportionate force in responding to Hamas’s rocket attacks from Gaza into Israeli towns. One of the moderators, Wolf Blitzer of CNN, asked whether Israel had a right to defend itself. Mr. Sanders said Israel had “every right in the world to destroy terrorism. ” “But,” he said, “we had in the Gaza area  —   not a very large area  —   some 10, 000 civilians who were wounded and some 1, 500 who were killed. ” The applause and cheers that accompanied Mr. Sanders’s answers  —   someone yelled “Free Palestine!”  —   might have been the most vocal signs yet of shifts in the Democratic Party. A Pew Research Center poll in 2014 about violence in Gaza found that Americans under 30 were more likely to blame Israel than to blame Hamas, though half blamed both or did not have an opinion.   and Hispanics also blamed Israel more often than Hamas. Those surveyed who were over 30 found Hamas more responsible, and the older the respondents were, the less they blamed Israel. “The roar in the crowd was telling,” said Peter Beinart, a leading voice in the liberal Zionist movement. “A Democratic Party dominated by progressive millennials,   and Latinos will gradually defect more and more from the   line,” he added, referring to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and to Mr. Netanyahu by his nickname. “Those aren’t their values,” Mr. Beinart continued. “What Bernie said last night, and the crowd’s response, were a sign of things to come. ” Younger Jews’ waning support for Israel in its dealings with Palestinians may not be so surprising. Unlike their parents and grandparents, who grew up when Jews were still reeling from the Holocaust, they know Israel primarily as a powerful nation rather than an existential necessity. Andy Bachman, a prominent Brooklyn progressive rabbi, said the energetic applause at Mr. Sanders’s criticism of Israel “spoke to this growing rift in the Democratic Party  —   it was proof of a major crisis in the Jewish community that no major Jewish organization has resolved or figured out to handle. ” Mr. Sanders, who is not observant, has spoken at times about family members killed in the Holocaust, and he spent time in an Israeli kibbutz after college. But he has had some stumbles related to his views on Israel. His hiring of a young activist leader, Simone Zimmerman, as his Jewish outreach director turned out to be a rare blunder for his campaign when Facebook posts turned up in which she referred to Mr. Netanyahu with a vulgarity. She was suspended a few hours before the debate. Supporters of Mrs. Clinton raised concerns about the substance of Mr. Sanders’s statements, arguing that he showed his haphazardness on the issue in a recent Daily News interview in which he greatly exaggerated the number of civilians killed in Gaza, saying more than 10, 000 had died. Clinton supporters also said he had supplied no specifics when he called for an “evenhanded” approach. In Mrs. Clinton’s response to the same question Thursday night, she stopped short of endorsing Israel’s response but echoed its argument that Hamas fighters were often mixed in with civilians. She noted her experience dealing with both sides as secretary of state and said  —   to applause  —   “I believe that as president I will be able to continue to make progress and get an agreement that will be fair both to the Israelis and the Palestinians without ever, ever undermining Israel’s security. ” Mr. Engel, the congressman, said he took solace in the fact that Mrs. Clinton still had a large delegate lead. “I don’t have a fear because he’s not going to be the nominee,” Mr. Engel said of Mr. Sanders. “Hillary is going to be the nominee, and she’s just fine. ” Still, Jewish activists who are highly critical of Israel said they would be thankful for his contribution even if he did not win. Minutes after the debate, Rebecca Vilkomerson, the executive director of Jewish Voice for Peace, a growing   organization that advocates pressuring Israel with the threat of boycotts, released a statement calling Mr. Sanders’s remarks “heartening” and added, “Today showed that the movement for Palestinian rights is shifting the discourse at the highest political levels. ”",0

17352,"Leaked Deutsche Bank Speech Shows Clinton Asking Wall Street To Police Itself, Supporting US Pivot To Asia","Videos Leaked Deutsche Bank Speech Shows Clinton Asking Wall Street To Police Itself, Supporting US Pivot To Asia Clinton’s October 2014 speech to Deutsche Bank was leaked as part of WikiLeaks’ archive of John Podesta’s Gmail account, revealing more of the nominee’s agenda for the financial sector and global affairs.   Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton waves to supporter as she arrives at a town hall meeting, Tuesday, Nov. 3, 2015, in Coralville, Iowa. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall) 

MINNEAPOLIS — With just days to go before the election, a two-year-old speech to a prominent global bank provides new insight into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s possible agenda if she takes control of the White House. 
Clinton delivered the speech on Oct. 7, 2014 to Deutsche Bank in New York , but the content of that speech and an ensuing Q&A session wasn’t made public until WikiLeaks released it as part of the organization’s ongoing publication of emails and files taken from the private Gmail account of John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chair. 
Clinton has faced pressure to release her speeches to banking executives throughout her presidential campaign, and particularly while vying for the Democratic nomination against Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who made campaign finance reform a central plank in his presidential platform. 
In her speech, Clinton acknowledged the pressures facing Wall Street in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. She referenced the legacy of President Theodore Roosevelt in calling for moderate economic reforms: 
“Remember what Teddy Roosevelt did. Yes, he took on what he saw as the excesses in the economy, but he also stood against the excesses in politics. He didn’t want to unleash a lot of nationalist, populistic reaction. He wanted to try to figure out how to get back into that balance that has served America so well over our entire nationhood.” 
Roosevelt was known as a “trust buster” who was responsible for breaking up massive corporations, and he was outspoken about his wariness of big banks and wealthy business executives. 
Clinton also acknowledged “that many Americans feel frustrated, some even angry,” about the economic downturn, adding: “And a lot of that anger has been directed at the financial industry.” 
While recognizing the need for reforms, Clinton also seemed to suggest that the financial sector might be allowed to police itself: 
“Today, there’s more that can and should be done that really has to come from the industry itself, and how we can strengthen our economy, create more jobs at a time where that’s increasingly challenging, to get back to Teddy Roosevelt’s square deal. And I really believe that our country and all of you are up to that job.” 
According to one analysis of the speech and related emails, this attempt to acknowledge critics of the banking industry could have been intended as a way to placate Clinton’s critics in the event of the eventual release of the speeches. 
“In an email on November 20, 2015 Clinton speechwriter Dan Schwerin explicitly noted how he left an ‘easter egg’ in the DB speech precisely in case the world came knocking and asking for Hillary’s speeches,” wrote an anonymous contributor at Zero Hedge using the name “Tyler Durden,” a shared pseudonym adopted by many writers at the site, in an analysis of the speech published on Wednesday. 
In the 2015 email , Schwerin wrote: 
“I wrote her a long riff about economic fairness and how the financial industry has lost its way, precisely for the purpose of having something we could show people if ever asked what she was saying behind closed doors for two years to all those fat cats. It’s definitely not as tough or pointed as we would write it now, but it’s much more than most people would assume she was saying in paid speeches. … Perhaps at some point there will be value in sharing this with a reporter and getting a story written.” 
Ultimately, “Tyler Durden” noted, the Clinton campaign opted not to release the speeches . 
Elsewhere in the Deutsche Bank speech, Clinton acknowledged the crucial role big banks will play in Washington’s strategic pivot to Asia. She said: 
“Will we have the discipline and dexterity to follow through on our pivot to Asia where so much of the history of the 21st century will be written, while managing new and old crises in the Middle East and Europe? 
Can we get our relationship with China right, navigating between the twin shoals of excessive accommodation and the potential for dangerous conflict? 
Will our traditional allies in Europe and East Asia step up and share the responsibilities of upholding a global order under pressure from so many fronts?” 
The focus on Asia, started under the Obama administration and likely to continue under Clinton, if her speech is any indication, involves encircling China with economic and military allies as a way to undercut China’s growing global influence. However, some historic allies like the Philippines have begun to push back against U.S. influence in the region. 
Many analysts see the Trans-Pacific Partnership , a controversial trade deal, as a key element to the U.S. pivot to Asia. While initially supportive of the deal, Clinton now promises to oppose the TPP as president after facing intense pressure from Sanders and activists opposed to the deal .",0

Brutus Centinel is an American Christian patriarch, leading a family resistance to the decline. Because guns are ""liberty's teeth,"" Brutus is a firearms enthusiast, and a militia officer. Brutus fights to help Americans across the political spectrum wake up to the tyranny of our corporate overloads. November 4, 2016 Religion 
I live in America, and I am happily married, with kids. I do not write this because I am more manly, or intelligent, or successful than you; I am not. I write this to share the main key to my success: patriarchal, traditional religion. 
I am writing from my own religious convictions, which I believe are true. You are free to disagree, but you may still find value here. I have read the writings of other religions, and consider them “True Myths,” useful for their wisdom, even though I may disagree with their theology. Neomasculinity itself is a philosophy that can be accepted by people of different religions, or no religion. Modern Religion I’ll find another church, thanks 
Modern religion is a feminized wasteland. God exists to impose obligations on men, and excuses women’s evil acts. Faith is blind, irrational, and collectivist. 
Men hate modern religion, which is why most churches in the West are demographically imbalanced toward women. Men are bored to death with touchy-feely sermons, endless committee meetings, female gossip, and the losers sitting in the pews around them. This is not how it should be. Patriarchal Religion That’s more like it. 
Patriarchal religion is interesting to men. It teaches that God is a man, creator of rationality, slayer of evil men, protector of the innocent: Praise be to the Lord my Rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle. (Psalm 144:1) 
In male-led churches, women are taught to be respectful to their fathers, husbands, and legitimate authority. They understand that their role is to raise and care for children, and support their husband’s mission: Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. (Ephesians 5:22) 
In patriarchal religion, female sins, like rebellion, envy, dishonesty, hypergamy, dressing and acting like a whore, and “hamstering” or rationalizing sin are condemned: When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. (Genesis 3:6) I also want the women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, adorning themselves, not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God. (1 Timothy 2:9-10) And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner. (1 Timothy 2:14)” This is the way of an adulterous woman: She eats and wipes her mouth and says, ‘I’ve done nothing wrong.’ (Proverbs 30:20) Finding A Virtuous Woman This is the unicorn I married. 
All women are tempted towards sins like envy, but not all women act on their impulses. In spite of what many observe in the West, I have met many virtuous women: few sexual partners before marriage, respectful, submissive to their husbands, physically fit, feminine, good mothers. Most are in the older generations, especially before the Boomers. Most are involved in traditional religion. There are fewer younger women who are virtuous, and every single one that I have met is involved in traditional religion. They tend to be more rural, from small churches. 
Traditional religion can be extremely helpful to finding and vetting women. It provides a community with certain values that you want in a woman, and it provides reliable references for a person’s character. A woman who spent her younger years “out in the world” and came back at 29 be a “born-again-virgin” is a red flag, but a woman in her early 20s who teaches Sunday School and helps with the potluck dinners is far more likely to be wife material. The older women in the church will usually let you know if a woman is a whore. Patriarchal Religion Helps Control Women’s Sinful Tendencies With proper training, woman can be virtuous. 
Traditional religion acts as a curb (but not a cure) for women’s immoral, rebellious, destructive behavior. My wife goes to a women’s bible study group, where she often receives instruction from older religious women. This includes things like telling her to be submissive to me, lose weight and be healthy, not waste money, have cheerful sex on a regular basis, and to learn how to get some control over her emotions: Teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but to teach what is good. Then they can urge the younger women to love their husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands. (Titus 2:3) 
One of my wife’s friends once corrected her attitude toward sex, saying: “you need to view your body as a sheath for your husband’s sword.” She now routinely thanks me after we have sex. I am not a natural alpha, but I have little fear that my wife is going to suddenly cut off sex if I have a minor slip up. Band Of Brothers We’ve got your back, bro! Deus Vult! 
With this great power comes great responsibility. As a patriarch, I am commanded to lead my family, instructing my wife and kids on how to act properly, with genuine love for their well-being. I must be on top of my game, be physically fit, and think rationally when my wife is irrational. I attend a men’s Bible study, where we talk about leading as men. Every man in my group owns a gun, and we often go shooting together. 
We encourage, support, teach, and correct each other. I have had sharp, intense, discussions with my pastor and men in my church about my own character and life decisions. Things are handled like men, discussed in the open, with real-talk (not rhetorical bullshit), and masculine love and concern for each other. This has aided me in thinking deeply about my life, and correcting bad decisions I have made. 
Awhile back we helped another man who was on the verge of divorce. He was working 100 hours a week because he would not stand up to his employer, and had no energy to lead his family. We told him that the marriage counseling he was getting was bullshit (“talk about your feelings more!”), and that his slavish attitude toward his employer was making his wife lose respect for him. The women in our church also talked to his wife about choosing to be respectful and submissive, in spite of her rebellious emotions. 
He cut back hours at work, which enabled him able to be captain of his ship again. This, along with training his wife received, helped her become more respectful. Now, his wife is less of a bitch, and they have sex several times a week. I doubt this would have happened without patriarchal religion. Children I’ve succeeded as a father! 
We see that our culture is toxic, feminized, and immoral. Men need a place to raise children apart from these toxins, and church is a great place to do this. My kids go to Sunday School classes where they are taught to be respectful to me, my wife, and legitimate adult authorities. We have several families with well-disciplined children that we can trust won’t corrupt our kids. My wife often takes the kids for play-dates so she can socialize with wholesome women, which is a great alternative to sitting around on social media all day. Conclusion Patriarchal, traditional religion will not change female nature, but it can help restrain it. This is how past generations maintained civilization. I can confidently say that traditional religion is the main reason I can maintain a happy marriage in this cesspool of a culture. Those who are not religious might consider other institutions that may provide similar support for their marriage and child-raising.",0
17357,Alien Visitors? No Explanation for Mysterious Lights in Night Sky Over Arizona,"Strange lights were spotted flying through the night sky in Arizona on Tuesday, leading some to take to social media declaring that they had just witnessed a UFO.
Witnesses described seeing three to four lights appear and begin traveling from north to south, and many called local station KTVK to report what they saw. The Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office, however, stated that they did not receive any calls about the lights.
DID ANYBODY ELSE JUST SEE A UFO!?
— Todd (@tater_todd55) October 26, 2016 

Residents who called another local station reported seeing lights above Glendale, Gilbert, Queen Creek and other East Valley cities.

The National Weather Service did not report any calls regarding the matter, but based on videos provided to them by ABC15 they stated that the lights appeared to be “very far away and flying at a high altitude.”
Nearby Luke Air Force Base stated that they did not have any aircraft flying after 5:30 PM, and that they were not the source. Witnesses tweeted videos at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who stated that “it is not known what may have caused them to occur.” In June, a massive asteroid zoomed over Arizona skies, and entered the Earth’s atmosphere east of the Arizona town of Payson.

“There are no reports of any damage or injuries — just a lot of light and few sonic booms,” Bill Cooke, the head of NASA’s Meteoroid Environment Office at the Marshall Space Flight Center said in a statement at the time. “If Doppler radar is any indication, there are almost certainly meteorites scattered on the ground north of Tucson.”
That meteor was estimated to be approximately 10 feet in diameter and travelling at roughly 42,000 mph.

Again, if we had anything resembling a rule of law, Huma would be in jail. People in Federal investigations have gone to jail for much lower acts of dishonesty and deception . 
The rebooted FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton's emails was spurred by emails turned up during the Anthony Weiner sexting investigation. Those emails that Huma Abedin swore she gave up . 
But the new information that the FBI found State Department-related email on her home laptop also calls into question whether Abedin in fact turned over all of the devices she used to send and receive email while working at State. 
On June 28, 2016, Abedin said under oath in a sworn deposition that she looked for all devices that she thought contained government work on them so the records could be given to the State Department. (These records were subsequently reviewed by the FBI.) 
“How did you go about searching for what records you may have in your possession to be returned to the State Department?” Attorney Ramona Cotca for Judicial Watch asked her. 
“I looked for all the devices that may have any of my State Department work on it and returned — returned — gave them to my attorneys for them to review for all relevant documents. And gave them devices and paper,” Abedin answered. 
Is anyone really surprised that Huma Abedin lied. The real question is whether or not she will be held accountable.",0
17359,22 Signs That You Are Embodying Your Higher Self,". 22 Signs That You Are Embodying Your Higher Self The Higher Self is the blissful superconscious, higher mind part of ourselves that is the expression... Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/22-signs-that-you-are-embodying-your.html The Higher Self is the blissful superconscious, higher mind part of ourselves that is the expression of Divine Love, spiritual wisdom, and creative power. During spiritual awakening , our personal consciousness grows to become aware of the greater parts of ourselves. We may feel energies, intuition and even psychic knowledge. We raise our energy vibration and spiritually purify ourselves to embody more of our Higher Self – the eternal Soul aspect of our being. Full spiritual realization and enlightenment occurs when we attain the conscious experience of blissful union with the Source of Life and all of creation. Everything is One and we are home! 1. Higher Sensory Perception Your intuition is developing at a rapid rate. Other higher senses like clairvoyance and clairaudience can also be turned on. These higher senses allow you to access information and wisdom that otherwise would be unavailable through the use of your rational mind. Harmonious lucid dreaming and out of body experiences are also ways to access higher dimensional information. 2. Knowing Your Soul Purpose With your higher senses turned on, it has become crystal clear what your Soul’s Purpose is. Not only you know what your mission here on earth is but you are fulfilling this mission by taking action and walking your path. Your are fulfilling your basic human needs of self-growth and contribution by being on the path of eternal self actualization and being at the service of others. 3. Meeting Your Soul Family Your frequency has attracted you to people with whom you resonate at a soul level. When you met these individuals you felt a strong and undeniable connection with them, like if you had met them before (from a past life). Even if they live on the other side of the world, the spiritual ties between you are so strong that years can go by and when you meet again is like no time has passed. 4. Meeting Your Twin Flame or Soul Mate You are in a relationship with a person that highlights and enhances your best qualities. As well, this person will mirror back to you everything you need to work on yourself. This relationship thrives on self-growth, contribution, higher giving love and fulfillment. A necessary step for the manifestation of this relationship is cutting cords of attachments and karmic ties with previous relationships. 5. Synchronicities and Accelerated Manifestations Your connection with the universe and life is evident. Your questions are answered through synchronicities and hidden messages are easily revealed to you by the power of your higher senses . You find messages and answers in books, nature and even random conversations. As well, you become aware of how strong and powerful your intent has become. Whatever you focus on manifests at a much faster than ever before. 6. Taking Responsibility For Your Happiness As you embody your Higher Self you realize how powerful you are and how you co-create reality through your thoughts and emotions . You take full responsibility for your own happiness and you stop blaming other people, the government or any other outside sources. Victimization is a thing of the past and you take full charge of your healing and evolutionary process. 7. Embracing All Emotions You have finally transcended the spiritual bypass that some emotions are ‘bad’ or ‘negative’. Instead you embrace all e-motions and instead of repressing them you allow them to flow through you. You can use anger for passion or motivation. You can easily empathize with others while maintaining the integrity of your field. 8. Holographic Nature of Reality Like Rumi said ‘You are not a drop of water in an ocean, you are the entire ocean in a drop of water.’ The holographic nature of reality is encoded within you and you can sense the interconnectedness of everything. It is obvious to you that we live in a multidimensional matrix and that you have a multidimensional anatomy. You also feel very attracted to sacred geometry. 9. Alchemical and Healing Powers Whether it’s hands on healing, soul retrieval or any other type of healing modality you have learned how to direct your intent and manipulate energy to remove energetic blockages. You can easily connect to your Higher Self and disengage discordant energies that hinder your spiritual evolution. Often you will assist others in their healing and ascension process with your siddhis. 10. Activating Your DNA DNA activation is the process of accreting more light into your morphogenetic field by activating the dormant strands of DNA that correspond to your Higher Self. You have at least a 12 strand DNA template that allows 12 dimensions of consciousness. DNA activation is the key to spiritual ascension and the embodiment of your Higher Self. It’s quite common for a person who goes through DNA activation to progressively experience all the other signs mentioned in this page. 11. Unconditional Self-Love Your 4th strand of DNA corresponds to your heart chakra. One of the main benefits of DNA activation is being able to access and embody a state of unconditional self-love. No longer do you feel the need to extract love from other people, instead you see yourself as an infinite source of love. A sense of wholeness begins to unfold as you love ALL aspects of yourself, including your shadow self. 12. Integrating and Transcending Your Shadow Self Your shadow self is the part of you that is running in reverse. It is mainly made up of archetypes, personas and complexes. Some examples are the Professional Victim Persona, the Rescuer Archetype, the Sorcerer, The Tyrant and the Absolute Perfectionist. The shadow self is what causes self-sabotage and causes you to create chaos in your life. The shadow self is created by making decisions that are not aligned with your Higher Self and manifest as reverse codes in your DNA. 13. Frequency Resonance As you continue to raise your frequency you notice how some people begin to fall out of your holographic reality . You understand that your frequencies no longer match. The same can happen with your job or even your country of origin. In turn your higher frequency attracts you to a new grid of people, places, times, things and events that are in line with your Higher Self. 14. Honest Yes and Honest No You are not afraid of saying ‘no’ to other people when you inner guidance tells you not to do something or go somewhere. You are not afraid of other people’s reactions and you are true to yourself. Every time you are congruent with what you want and what you don’t want you feel more powerful. As well you embrace the art of an honest ‘yes’ when the universe delivers what you desire. You don’t try to appear ‘humble’ or ‘spiritual’ by rejecting what you truly desire in your life. 15. Harmonious Family Relationships ‘If you think you are enlightened, go spend a weekend with your family.’ Ram Dass You have realized that enlightenment doesn’t happen in a cave. You have cleared the cords of attachments and karmic ties with your family. Gone are the days where you kept experiencing the same old family drama. Your family members have shifted their approach to connect with you to higher ways and you accept/love them just how they are. 16. No Guilt, No Shame Shame and guilt are the two lowest frequency energetic blockages in humanity. In order to embody your Higher Self you have let go of the identification with shame and guilt. You have cleared the guilt and shame you inherited from your parents through the DNA and you have released the shame and guilt that has been implanted by society and religions. Instead you choose to embrace the states of joy and bliss. You have become immune to guilt manipulating strategies often used by victims. 17. Making Decision In Line With Your Higher Self Instead of making decisions based on fear, righteousness, competition or lack you are making decisions in line with your Higher Self and ultimately with Source-will. You are aware of Source’s intentions: the Law of One, Unconditional Love, Cooperation, Evolution, Perpetual Motion, Cause and Effect, Non-Judgment and Free-will. Even though we all have free-will and can ultimately go against Source-will (you’re unconditionally loved), you’re aware that making such decisions will trigger the Law of Cause and Effect and create a karmic imprint to re-mind you must heal that karmic miasm at some point. 18. Inner and Outer Abundance Lack and limitation are a thing of the past. You have embodied a state of absolute inner abundance that is being reflected onto your holographic reality. You no longer seek to extract love, approval and appreciation from other people, you are the source. Happiness is within you. As well you have transcended the spiritual bypass that money is ‘evil’ and you know that money is just energy, made up of consciousness just like everything else. You enjoy financial abundance and use this abundance to create a more harmonious reality for yourself and others. 19. Mind Unplugged From the Matrix One sign that your mind has been unplugged from the matrix is that you can clearly see the hidden agenda of those who desire to control this planet. You no longer resonate with the news and their ‘official story’. You inner truth detector can sense when someone is lying and you have become immune to the low frequency strategies and implants that constantly try to tell you ‘you are not enough’. Mindless consumerism and the herd mentality seem absurd to you. 20. Bye-Bye Idolatry As you awaken to your co-creative powers and God-like nature, you no longer put other people on a pedestal. Your inner guru precedes any external guru and you see teachers as a reflection of your own unlimited potential. The forces of your worthiness and deservedness drive you to achieve whatever you set your mind upon. You have become the master of your own reality . 21. Overflowing with Gratitude Gratitude is your attitude. Gratitude is your prayer . The sense of lack has become foreign to you, instead you cannot stop counting your blessings. The feeling of gratitude multiplies whatever you have and brings you even more positive experiences. You are even grateful for the challenges and setbacks that are inevitable in life, you can’t help to see them as opportunities for growth. And you probably have a gratitude journal. 22. Don’t Take Yourself Too Seriously Life is meant to be fun, you know that. Being extremely rigid and disciplined suck the fun out of everything. Even though you are adamant when it comes to working on yourself and achieving self mastery, you always allow yourself to make mistakes. In fact making mistakes is part of the learning process. You have a great sense of humor and you don’t take yourself too seriously. Your inner child is thriving and you often feel energized, inspired and overflowing with creativity.

17360,"Oakland Fire Victims Included Performers, Educators and Lawyers - The New York Times","They were musicians, poets, educators and baristas.   people were killed in a fire at an electronic dance party at a warehouse in Oakland, Calif. last weekend, and the coroner’s bureau in Alameda County is releasing their names. It was one of the worst structure fires in the United States in over a decade. Amanda Allen Kershaw, 34, San Francisco Early on Dec. 3, Lea Romingquet and her friends were camping in the Santa Cruz mountains when they received a message that stunned them: A fire had raged through the Ghost Ship warehouse the night before. Ms. Romingquet knew Ms. Kershaw, one of her closest friends, had been there that night and had planned to join the group in the mountains. But it was not to be. “She really was the best of humans,” Ms. Romingquet said in a telephone interview, reflecting on her friendship with Ms. Kershaw, whom she had first met on a dance floor in 2009. Ms. Kershaw, a photographer, grew up in Chelmsford, Mass. and moved to San Francisco with her husband, Andy Kershaw, in 2008, The Lowell Sun reported. She worked at the Trust for Conservation Innovation, which said she had left behind a “devastated work family. ” “Family” was a word that Ms. Romingquet used, too. Ms. Kershaw’s death, she said, “has really dialed in how important chosen family is. ” Wolfgang Renner, 61, Oakland Mr. Renner, who was originally from Germany, was a fixture in the underground electronic music scene for decades, according to The East Bay Times. “Wolfgang was about as free of an individual as anyone is likely to ever meet,” said a friend, Robert Janca, on Facebook. “When we were close, it was a joy to go and visit him, as he was a capable host who made all of his friends feel welcome and celebrated. ” Michele Sylvan, 37, Oakland Mr. Janca was also mourned the death of Ms. Sylvan. He described her as a “lovely, wildly creative” woman. “Michelle was a potent visionary and was always up for life’s adventure. The world is a decidedly less colorful one without them. ” Nicholas D. Walrath, 31, Oakland When the fire started at the Ghost Ship, Mr. Walrath texted his girlfriend, Alexis   to say that he loved her, she told  The Pittsburgh  . His goal in life was to care for other people, and that was what inspired him to be a lawyer, she added. “He could really step outside of himself and care and listen to other people and feel their struggles, and want to help,” she said. His mother, Deborah D. Walrath, said in a telephone interview, “Above all, he was kind to every person he came into contact with. ” Mr. Walrath, who grew up in Pittsburgh, took a roundabout career path. He studied physics and philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and then went on to pursue a graduate degree in atomic physics. But then he chose law over the laboratory, and graduated from New York University’s law school in 2013. “He was committed to social justice,” his mother told The San Francisco Chronicle. Durie Tangri LLP, the San Francisco law firm where Mr. Walrath last worked, said in a statement: “In the short time he had been at our firm, Nick already had shown himself to be a fine lawyer as well as a good and caring person. ” Johnny Igaz, 34, Oakland Kevin Hunsanger, an owner of Green Apple Books in San Francisco, was unnerved recently when one of his staff members, an experienced music buyer, announced he was leaving. But the employee suggested a replacement, saying, “I have got the right guy. ” That “guy” was Johnny Igaz, Mr. Hunsanger said. “In all these years of training staff members, he was as close to a    employee that I have ever had,” Mr. Hunsanger said in a telephone interview. “It was a driving passion in Johnny’s life. He was really tied into the community of record collectors. ” Mr. Hunsanger is a   music nerd who said he has a record collection of 2, 500 items. But Mr. Igaz, in the months he spent in the store as its buyer of CD’s and records, introduced Mr. Hunsanger to the work of an artist he did not know  —   Betty Davis, the wife of Miles Davis  —   who recorded funk albums in the 1960s and ‘70s. “He had encyclopedic knowledge of all types of music and genres,” Mr. Hunsanger said. Mr. Igaz was working as a D. J. at the Ghost Ship on the night of the fire, which has gutted the community of musicians and artists in the Bay Area, Mr. Hunsanger said: “Everybody knows someone who perished. ” Griffin Madden, 23, Berkeley, Calif. The staff at Cal Performances, the performing arts presenter and producer at the University of California, Berkeley, had planned this year’s holiday party long before the devastating fire that claimed so many lives. So on Tuesday, the party was transformed into a remembrance of the life of one of their own, a “beloved” member of the staff, Griffin Madden. He had started out as an usher at the theater when he was an    freshman at Berkeley, the artistic director, Matías Tarnopolsky, said in an email. Mr. Madden graduated in 2015 with a double major in philosophy and Slavic languages and literature. He had recently been hired full time as an audience services associate with Cal Performances. His girlfriend, Saya, and his father, Mike, attended the Cal Performances gathering, Mr. Tarnopolsky said. “Their extraordinary example of grace and optimism was truly inspiring to all of us who knew Griffin,” he said. “Our community is heartbroken at this news. ” Hanna Ruax, 32, Helsinki, Finland Ms. Ruax, a yoga instructor and jewelry designer from Finland, was the owner of a yoga and wellness center in Helsinki called Pihasali, which was founded by her mother, Kirsi   over 10 years ago, according to the company’s website. Ms. Ruax, whose fiancé, Alex Ghassan, was also killed in the fire, wrote on social media that she was inspired by how her father went from modest beginnings in a small village to become a successful businessman. In some of the last photographs posted on her Facebook page, Ms. Ruax was cuddling and kissing Mr. Ghassan. In one of them, published on Nov. 22, she announced with an excited smile that she was on her way from Finland to California to see him. The next day, united in Oakland, the two made funny faces for the camera. “Home sweet home!” she wrote. As a child, Ms. Ruax played piano and danced, and she loved to hike in Koli National Park in eastern Finland. At her yoga studio, she taught a “reggae yoga” signature class with a D. J. her friends and family in Finland said in an emailed statement in response to questions. She met Mr. Ghassan at a music video shoot, and they were thinking of moving to Europe together, they said. On her Instagram account, Ms. Ruax had described her relationship with the world: “When your heart is open and you embrace the world everywhere with an open mind, there’s no difference in the end. The cultures are different, but the hearts are the same. ” Vanessa Plotkin, 21, Lakewood, Calif. Ms. Plotkin was a student at the University of California, Berkeley. She was a junior majoring in sociology there, a spokeswoman for the university, Janet Gilmore, said in an emailed statement. She was also a volunteer at the campus radio station, KALX.

Her father wrote on his Facebook page about how devastated he was to have lost his child in the fire. He noted that she had recently begun her transition to becoming a “beautiful, happy woman. She at last was living as she was meant to live. I only wish she had more time to fully enjoy her life. ” She graduated from the University of California, Riverside, with an English degree and went on to get a Masters in English Literature at California State Polytechnic University in Pomona. She was getting ready to move to New York City, but had been working at High Wire coffee shop in Berkeley and had gone to the Ghost Ship that night with Donna Kellogg, who was also an employee at the coffee shop and who died in the fire. In the telephone interview, Mr. Bohlka noted that the Ghost Ship was considered a safe space for the transgender community. “I know there are far too few spaces for trans people to feel safe and free to express themselves,” Mr. Bohlka said in a statement. “Although the building itself was not physically safe, the community of beautiful people felt safe with each other. ” Benjamin Runnels, 32, Oakland Mr. Runnels was a musician and vocalist who founded the electronic pop group Introflirt. Its musical genre was referred to as “croonwave. ” He performed along with a fellow band member who played an electronic musical instrument called an omnichord. According to Introflirt’s website, Mr. Runnels, who also went by the stage names Ben Benjamin and Charlie Prowler, spent countless weekends in an Oakland piano bar, “honing his chops with midcentury jazz standards, realizing a vintage flair and rich vocal technique rarely heard in electronic music. ” Mr. Runnels was a native of Mariaville, N. Y. but was lured to the Bay Area by the location’s vibrant music scene, family members said. He lived in Oakland for five years. “He was one of those people who could pick up any instrument,” his sister, Erin Runnels, told The San Francisco Chronicle. “It would be really rare that a song, whether it was Glenn Miller or The Grateful Dead or some obscure European house music, would come on without him being able to tell you something about it. ” Alex Ghassan, 35, Oakland Mr. Ghassan planted a kiss on the cheek of his younger sister, Francesca, pulling her close with his right arm around her neck. The smile on her face, turned directly to the camera, could not have been broader. That was the image she posted on Facebook Tuesday morning under the words “RIP big brother. ” Mr. Ghassan, a director and producer, was the father of twin daughters, according to a biography on a   page set up by his mother, Emilie Grandchamps. He moved to Oakland from Jersey City, N. J. two years ago. “He was family man and loved spending quality and creative time with his daughters. His love and adoration for his mother was so warm and humbling,” it said. It said he was visiting the Ghost Ship warehouse to support other artists there that night. He died from smoke inhalation, the page said. “I loved how he brought my words to life and how he made music films for all the artists he worked with,” a fellow artist, Hasan Salaam, was quoted as saying on the memorial   page. David Cline, 24, Oakland Friends described Mr. Cline, an alumnus of the University of California, Berkeley, as someone with a fun personality and a penchant for bear hugs. On Facebook, his former clarinet teacher posted an autobiography that Mr. Cline wrote before his senior recital, in which he called himself a “devoted volleyball player” and member of the   Band. “This summer he looks forward to spending time at the beach, enjoying the sunshine with his friends and observing a variety of aquatic animals,” Mr. Cline wrote. Mr. Cline recently graduated with a double major in cognitive science and computer science, and was a “ferociously brilliant student and impossibly bright mind,” his brother, Neil Cline, said in a statement. “To David, we love you,” he wrote in a Facebook post on Sunday. “You will be with us always. ” Donna Kellogg, 32, Oakland Ms. Kellogg worked as a barista at Highwire Coffee Roasters in Berkeley, a person who answered the telephone there said on Monday. An article in The San Francisco Chronicle described her as a “freewheeling and  ” person who loved cooking and played the drums. “She liked   music,” said her father, Hugh Slocum. A recent graduate of San Francisco State University, Ms. Kellogg was studying for a degree in culinary arts at Laney College in Oakland. Travis Hough, 35, Oakland Mr. Hough was an educator at two elementary schools, focusing on psychological counseling, according to Demetrio Gonzalez, the president of a local teachers union. He was an alumnus of California College of the Arts, according to a post on its Twitter account. He was also an art therapist and a musician. He and his band,  Ghost of Lightning, played in November at Oakland. Secret, a performance and art space, Zoe Ceja, a founder of the site, said in an interview. Sara Hoda, 30, Walnut Creek, Calif. Ms. Hoda was a teacher at a Montessori school who loved gardening, according to her former housemate Carol Crewdson, who helped her start a communal house in Oakland, hoping to help combat the housing crisis. “We sort of tried to make community work in a small space,” Ms. Crewdson said. “We would make gardens, and she would teach kids about gardens. ” Ms. Crewdson said Ms. Hoda was an “honorable” person. Ms. Hoda was previously a representative for a local union assisting teachers. Brandon Chase Wittenauer, 32, Hayward, Calif.  Mr. Wittenauer was the vocalist in the music duo Symbiotix Fungi, who went by the name Nex Iuguolo, according to his Facebook page.

He was kind, considerate, hilarious. .. In short, he was an essential part of our team. ” Riley Fritz, 29, Berkeley Ms. Fritz, a musician, artist and transgender woman, had been in Oakland only a few months, but she was already enjoying her life there, said her brother, Ben Fritz, a newspaper reporter in Los Angeles. “She came down here for Thanksgiving and she seemed to me to be the happiest that I’ve seen her in quite a while,” he said. After graduating from high school in Westport, Conn. where she grew up, Ms. Fritz studied printmaking at the School for the Visual Arts in Manhattan. She later lived with friends in North Carolina and Indiana, where she worked odd jobs to support her art. But ultimately Oakland, with its supportive artist and transgender communities, beckoned. Ms. Fritz had many passions: She played the bass guitar, experimented with other music and had plans to start a band. She was an artist, a supporter of animal rights, and a voracious reader. “She’s the only person I’ve ever known who read David Foster Wallace’s ‘Infinite Jest,’” Mr. Fritz said. Ms. Fritz, who also went by the name Feral Pines, adopted the name Riley as a woman in her 20s. She exhibited a strength that her brother admired. “I think she was very brave to follow her truth and be who she felt she was,” he said. Chelsea Dolan, 33, San Francisco Ms. Dolan, a musician, was at the warehouse on Friday night to perform, her grandmother, Marion Dolan, told WGRZ, an NBC affiliate in upstate New York. “Music was her life. Everything was centered around her music, and if she got a chance to play, she went,” she said in an interview before her granddaughter’s death had been confirmed. Indeed, when Ms. Dolan wasn’t playing, she was a volunteer D. J. under the name Cherushii at the KALX community radio station, which is licensed to the University of California, Berkeley, the school said on Tuesday. Ms. Dolan visited her grandmother in the Buffalo area this past summer to celebrate her 90th birthday, the elder Ms. Dolan said. “All I saw of her was a happy gal,” she said. Jennifer Morris, 21, Foster City, Calif. Ms. Morris was one of three members of the University of California, Berkeley, community who were killed in the fire, the school announced on Tuesday. She was a junior and had plans to major in media studies. Before coming to Berkeley, Ms. Morris had studied at UC Santa Cruz. “We are working together as a community to help process this tragic loss,” Chancellor Nicholas Dirks said in a Sunday message to the Berkeley community. Jennifer Kiyomi Tanouye, 31, Oakland Music was central to Ms. Tanouye’s life, both personally and professionally. By day, she worked for Shazam, a music discovery service, which remembered her fondly on Twitter and encouraged visitors to its site to donate to a fund for victims of the fire. In a 2012 profile, The East Bay Express described Ms. Tanouye as “easily as stylish” as any of the artists she booked for an annual Mission Creek Music and Arts Festival that she helped run at the time. The author also credited her with “creating what may be the most promising arts event that the city has seen this year. ” Edmond Lapine, 34, Oakland Growing up, Mr. Lapine moved around Utah several times, but music was always a constant, The San Francisco Chronicle reported. He taught himself how to play the guitar and joined several bands. Later, he became a D. J. Throughout, he was surrounded by friends, his father, Bob Lapine, said. “When Edmond was in high school, they took a field trip to England,” he told The Chronicle. “My son was the tallest kid in the class and he dyed his hair bright green. I go, ‘Oh, Ed.’ I was so embarrassed. But wherever Ed went, a lot of kids would follow. He went over to England and the teachers said all they had to do was look for Ed and his green hair and there would be everybody else. ” Those who knew him remembered him as social and supportive  —   someone who sought out common ground when discussing music. Micah Danemayer, 28, Oakland Mr. Danemayer had just moved in with his girlfriend when the pair attended the party at the warehouse on Friday, a friend told KRON, an Oakland television station. The friend, Eric Stucke, said he met Mr. Danemayer through the electronic music scene and the two would frequently meet up at Brotzeit Lokal, an Oakland restaurant. During those meetings, Mr. Danemayer would make new friends, too, Mr. Stucke said. “He was basically an open book,” Mr. Stucke said. “He had his thing, he had very specific tastes, but yet he was a   person. ” Nicole Siegrist, 29, Oakland Ms. Siegrist, originally from Lincoln, Neb. played the synthesizer in a band called Introflirt. “People were just drawn to her from her energy, her unique perspective, optimism and creativity,” Carina McCormick, who knew her in Lincoln, told The Omaha  . Ms. Siegrist went to the warehouse with five friends, her mother, Carol Cidlik, said in an online post, according to the newspaper. As conditions worsened, she wrote in a text message to her mother: “I’m going to die now. ” Alex Vega, 22, San Bruno Mr. Vega had not yet decided on a career, but worked at a mortuary and as a valet at a hospital, according to The East Bay Times. He loved music and cars and liked to dabble in art, painting and photography, the newspaper reported. Mr. Vega’s girlfriend, Michela Gregory, was also killed in the fire. “There were some folks that were found hugging each other,” said Ms. Gregory’s father, David Gregory. “I believe my daughter and Alex were hugging each other. To the end, they were together, trying to help each other, I’m sure. I know it. ” Michela Angelina Gregory, 20 Ms. Gregory was studying communication disorders at San Francisco State University, hoping for a career in helping children with special needs, according to The Los Angeles Times. She had   jobs at a clothing store and a funeral home, the newspaper reported. Her boyfriend, Alex Vega, worked with her at the funeral home and also died at the warehouse. “They were each other’s best friends,” said her mother, Kimberly Gregory. “They were just like two peas in a pod. ” Ara Christina Jo, 29, Oakland Ms. Jo was a   of the East Bay Alternative Book and Zine Fest and worked at an art and printing retail store in Berkeley, according to The Los Angeles Times. “She’s an incredibly energetic person, who can cheer up a room just by existing, a lot of energy packed in that small body,” Jeremy Erickson, a   told The San Jose  . On her website, Ms. Jo listed her specialties as illustration, graphic design, crafting and  . Jennifer Mendiola, 35, Oakland Ms. Mendiola was a graduate student studying psychology at the University of California, Merced, according to Dorothy Leland, the school’s chancellor. “Colleagues have described Jennifer as a passionate and determined scientist, with an inquisitive mind and a collaborative spirit,” Ms. Leland wrote in a letter to the campus community. In 2015, Ms. Mendiola was a   of an   in The Los Angeles Times about the reluctance of Latinos to get flu shots. She had been finalizing her dissertation proposal for her defense in January. Jason McCarty, 35, Oakland Mr. McCarty moved from Iowa to California to pursue a master’s degree at the San Francisco Art Institute, and had dabbled in illustration, design, photography, painting and music, according to The San Francisco Chronicle. A former teacher, Andrew Benson, described him as “one of the hungry ones. ” His girlfriend, Grace Lovio, told The Los Angeles Times that he worked for an audiovisual company and was a sound artist for bands. “Love you a zilliopzazillion,” he wrote to her in a Facebook message on Saturday. Draven McGill, 17, San Francisco  Mr. McGill, the youngest victim, was a junior at Ruth Asawa School of the Arts, where he was a baritone in the choir, according to The San Francisco Chronicle. “As parents, teachers, children, students, brothers, sisters, and friends, we share in the heartbreak of his family and will embrace them and each other as Asawa SOTA family,” Barnaby Payne, the school’s principal, wrote in a statement. Mr. McGill was the son of a deputy in the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office, which was in charge of recovering and examining the bodies from the scene of the fire, according to the newspaper. “It really touches home with all of our people who worked alongside our deputy for the past 10 years,” Greg Ahern, the Alameda County   said at a news conference, according to KPIX, a local TV station. “So it is really emotional for people working on this site and the families that have lost a loved one. ” Joseph Matlock, 36, Oakland Joseph “Joey Casio” Matlock belonged to the music collective Katabatik, which lost three members to the fire, according to The East Bay Times. “He was really kind of enigmatic,” said Michael Buchanan, of the collective. “Very down to earth at times but with an interesting and unique way about him. ” Friends said he had a great sense of humor and loved puns. They also praised his music. His sets incorporated natural and ambient sounds into an “audio assault that was cathartic,” said Nihar Bhatt, a San Francisco D. J. Peter Wadsworth, 38, Oakland Tammy Tasoff, 29, first met Mr. Wadsworth years ago when they both lived in Boston. He was almost a decade older and quickly became an unofficial older brother to her. “I’m kind of disorganized as a person, and he would just see these things I needed to get done,” she said. “If I had piles of papers, he would buy a filing folder. ” He could be serious and enterprising  —   some friends called him “Business Pete. ” But he was also playful and thoughtful, Ms. Tasoff said. When she visited Los Angeles to interview at dental school over her birthday, he came along for moral support and to celebrate the occasion. He was eclectic in his interests and drawn to technology, often geeking out over the latest gadget: a phone,   lights, a drone. “He was into innovation,” she said, adding that he was always coming up with new projects. Mr. Wadsworth’s death was especially devastating, Ms. Tasoff said, because the two had discussed his moving out of the warehouse destroyed by the blaze and in with her in San Francisco before he changed his mind. Barrett Clark, 35, Oakland Mr. Clark, another member of the Katabatik collective, was a sound engineer, according to The East Bay Times. “He did the sound because he wanted to make the musicians sound as good as they possibly could,” Mr. Buchanan, who collaborated with Mr. Clark on various projects, told the publication. “We knew that place was unsafe  —   we had many conversations about it. But he chose to take the risk because it was outweighed by his intense feelings of generosity. ” His friends remembered him as funny and    and said he had a deep love for the outdoors. Jonathan Bernbaum, 34, Berkeley Like Joseph Matlock and Barrett Clark, who also died in the fire, Mr. Bernbaum belonged to the Katabatik collective, The East Bay Times reported. But Mr. Bernbaum’s expertise was in the visual arts. He traveled the world performing electronic dance music shows that featured complex light designs, the University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts, where he earned a master of fine arts degree, said in a remembrance. “He was a true renaissance man. He loved to engage with you about issues,” said Prof. Brenda Goodman, who mentored Mr. Bernbaum at U. S. C. “He was opinionated, but he also listened. He was a visual artist in every sense of the term. ” Billy Dixon, 35, Oakland Mr. Dixon, an Ohio native, was remembered as cheerful and universally loved. “He had a smile that would light up the room when he walked in,” Justice Bill O’Neill of the Ohio Supreme Court, a longtime family friend, told the CBS affiliate in Cleveland,  . “Everybody was always happy when Billy was there. He wasn’t real interested in rules. He was an artist. ” Mr. Dixon sought to make people around him feel special, his family said in a statement provided to The Associated Press. He had “a hug for everyone no matter how long he has known them and has an amazing gift of making people feel appreciated,” the statement read.",0

17362,The New Party of No - The New York Times,"On’u2009the morning after Election Day, Chuck Schumer’s phone rang. It was Donald Trump. Trump has repeatedly described Schumer as his friend  —   which, the New York senator was at pains to clarify when we first spoke in   “isn’t quite true. ” There had been the occasional favor at Schumer’s request, Trump hosted a   for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee at    in 2008, and Schumer made a cameo on “The Apprentice” in 2006. Beyond that, Schumer told me: “I bump into him at meetings here and there. We never went out to dinner once. We never played golf together. I sort of knew him. ” On election night, Schumer was at Hillary Clinton’s party at the Javits Convention Center in Midtown Manhattan when, around 8 p. m. he saw some troubling exit polls coming out of Florida and North Carolina. They showed that   women in both states  —   a demographic that everyone assumed would be a lock  —   were underperforming for Clinton. Schumer called one of her top campaign advisers, who tried to reassure him. “He says, ‘Don’t worry, our firewalls in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and Michigan are strong,’’u2009” Schumer recalls. “’u2009‘There’s no way Trump can win. ’’u2009” Schumer kept up appearances. He tweeted a photo of himself in front of a catering table with Kate McKinnon, who plays Clinton on “Saturday Night Live” (“I got to congratulate Hillary Clinton  —   oops, wrong Hillary! ”) and then took the stage, leading the crowd in a chant of “I believe that she will win!” But by shortly after 11 p. m. Trump had taken Ohio and North Carolina. The probability dashboards on the   websites had lurched Trumpward, and an unthinkable future was lumbering into view. Schumer, who was in line to succeed Harry Reid as the   Democrat in the Senate after Reid’s retirement in December, had spent roughly $8 million of his own campaign funds on Democratic senatorial campaigns in other states in hopes of retaking control of the upper chamber, which the Democrats lost in 2014, and of making himself the majority leader. On his bookshelf he kept a copy of “Master of the Senate,” the historian Robert Caro’s exhaustive chronicle of Lyndon Johnson’s years as the Democratic majority leader, which Caro had inscribed to Schumer: “Whose career I have been following for years with real admiration, so that I have no doubt that he will be a great leader of senators. ” But by the early hours of Wednesday it was clear that the Democrats would not take the Senate and that Schumer would not be Lyndon Johnson. “We’ll work together,” Trump said on the phone call. He said he wanted to repeal the Affordable Care Act  —   “that A. C. A. is terrible,” he told Schumer  —   which was an obvious nonstarter for the incoming minority leader. He also said he wanted a   infrastructure plan. “I said, ‘Well, a trillion dollars sounds good to me,’’u2009” Schumer told me. But to get Democrats on board, he warned, three conditions had to be met. “You can’t do it with these tax breaks,” he said. Second, he could not “cut the programs we care about  —   Medicare, education, scientific research  —   to pay for this. It’s got to be new spending. ” Finally, the bill had to preserve existing environmental and labor protections. “I said, ‘To do that, you’re going to have to get half your party really mad at you. ’’u2009” Schumer, as he saw it, was calling Trump’s bluff. “Donald Trump ran as an   populist  —   against both the Democratic and Republican establishments,” he told me. Whether or not he had meant it, the Democrats could try to hold him to it. On the several occasions that Trump called Schumer in the weeks after the election, Schumer argued that he could try to govern as a   conservative, but “America is not a   country,” and there would be electoral consequences. It might not have been the strongest card to play, but Schumer did not have a strong hand. The election in November left the Democrats stripped of power at every level of federal authority. Schumer would now possess the only means they had of exerting even limited influence over Trump’s agenda: a Senate Democratic caucus that, while several seats shy of a majority, was large enough to make life complicated for Senate Republicans. But that could happen only if the Democrats formed a united front  —   and it was unclear whether they could, or even wanted to. The 2016 election was not just an electoral crisis for the party but also an existential one, more severe than any that the Democrats had experienced in decades. The party had glided through the campaign with a sense of destiny: In July, Schumer breezily remarked that “For every   Democrat we will lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two, three moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia, and you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin. ” Then Hillary Clinton lost to a candidate who revived a strain of nativist, nationalist politics that had been dormant in the Republican Party for at least a generation, and who won in part on the ballots of Barack Obama voters in traditionally Democratic strongholds like Michigan and Wisconsin. “I sleep like a baby,” Chris Murphy, the Democratic senator from Connecticut, told me. “And I can sleep anywhere  —   on the road, on the floor, in my kid’s bed jammed up against the wall. ” But on election night, he says: “It’s so cliché, but I stayed up all night. I was, mentally, totally unprepared. At some level, you do have this  —   ” he trailed off and was silent for a moment. “You do start to question whether you know the country as well as you thought. ” The Democratic primaries and caucuses, meanwhile, had left the party sharply divided. Clinton lost 22 states to Bernie Sanders, Vermont’s independent and   socialist senator, whose    challenge had stirred a   excitement that Clinton’s campaign conspicuously lacked and acrimoniously split the Democratic Party’s centrist and   contingents  —   the latter of which viewed the Obama years as a missed opportunity to fight economic inequality, reorient trade policy and rein in Wall Street. Clinton might have won the popular vote, but in a way, this only amplified the confusion: about whether the party needed to transform or simply tinker whether it needed to move to the right or to the left whether the voters who were willing to vote for a candidate who said the things Trump said could be won back at all. These were problems for anyone trying to chart a course for the Democrats, but in a particularly acute way they were problems for Schumer, a politician who was better known as a dealmaker, a student of consensus, than as a pathfinder. As majority leader, the next two years might have been the pinnacle of his career: bill signings, valedictory news conferences (and few politicians visibly delight in news conferences the way Schumer does) the sorts of   negotiations that historians like Caro write books about. Instead, Schumer found himself with a job that The Times Union, in Albany, observed two days after the election was “something of a booby prize. ” The Democrats, who spent Obama’s presidency railing against Republican obstructionism, would soon be facing a president who, in his stated ambitions to unmake much of Obama’s legacy, was all but inviting them to try the same. Whether this was in Schumer’s’u200b ’u200bDNA was one question. Whether it was in t’u200bhe party’s’u200b ’u200bwas another. The Democrats have never been a natural opposition party, or a particularly effective one. Republicans from Reagan to the Tea Party broadly believed in reducing government, as the   activist Grover Norquist famously put it, “to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub. ” Cutting budgets and eliminating programs might require a Republican president and a congressional majority, but lacking this, a disciplined minority party could gum up the works, starving existing initiatives and blocking attempts to expand them. Democrats, by contrast, have generally been united by a belief in government that tries to do big things, in the manner of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal or Johnson’s Great Society or, later, Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act  —   a belief that, practically speaking, requires either landslide majorities or a willingness to compromise. Several   polls in recent years have found that this difference is reflected in the party’s electorates, which have increasingly come to view the political process in starkly different ways. In a 2014 Pew survey, 82 percent of people who identified as “consistently liberal” said they liked politicians who were willing to make compromises just 32 percent of “consistently conservative” respondents agreed. The week of Trump’s inauguration, David Brock  —   the onetime conservative journalist turned liberal gadfly  —   hosted a private gathering of Democratic luminaries at Turnberry Isle, a golf resort outside Miami. One speaker Brock invited was Ronald Klain, the former chief of staff to Vice Presidents Al Gore and Joe Biden, who previously worked for Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader, in the aftermath of the 1994 midterms, when the Republicans took control of both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years. Addressing Brock’s crowd, Klain called for Democrats to embrace what he dubbed the   Fight Club. As Klain learned from working with Daschle, “You have to take on a lot of fights to win any fights,” he told me recently. “When you’re in the minority, you can’t be too choosy. I advocated a strategy of more comprehensive opposition. ” But plenty of the Democrats present  —   among them the Chicago mayor and former White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, who was sharing the stage with Klain  —   disagreed. “At the time, there was more of a divide,” Klain told me. “The ‘we gotta pick our spots’ philosophy: ‘He’s a new president  —   we don’t want to look like McConnell looked in 2009. ’’u2009” Mitch McConnell, the Republican senator from Kentucky who was then the minority leader and is now majority leader, reportedly mapped out a program of   resistance shortly before Obama took office  —   a strategy that Democrats spent subsequent years attacking as cynical and irresponsible. “We’re Democrats,” Klain said. “We like to govern. ” Among the Democrats who appeared to share Klain’s postelection view was Harry Reid, Schumer’s predecessor as minority leader, who would be retiring in December. Reid and Schumer, then Reid’s deputy, were an effective team for years in the Senate, partners in a       act. Schumer was known as a   partisan during his 18 years in the House of Representatives, but in the Senate he had become an avatar of the gabby   bonhomie that had historically characterized the upper chamber. “You know, I get along,” Schumer told me. “I’m in the gym in the morning, I’m talking with Thune, and Lamar, and Cornyn all the time,” he said, referring to the Republican Senators John Thune, Lamar Alexander and John Cornyn. “I’m friends with them. They attack me, I attack them. We understand that. ” This was the old way of the Senate  —   one that began to fade in the late 1970s as the ideological consolidation of the parties accelerated, reducing their need and taste for compromise. By the time Schumer arrived in 1999, four years after the Newt   Republican revolution, it was fast becoming an anachronism, with meals in the senators’ bipartisan dining room giving way to   caucus lunches. By the time Reid became minority leader, amid the   polarization of George W. Bush’s second term, it was all but gone. Reid, like his Republican counterpart, McConnell, was one of the rare politicians who seemed to genuinely not care if people liked him or not. He was known for his   floor speeches, sandbags of verbiage delivered with minimal theatrics and less ambiguity of purpose. It was in this mode that he took to the Senate floor, a week after the election, and drew a line. Senate Democrats had tried for years to pass the kind of infrastructure bill Trump had suggested, Reid reminded his colleagues, only to run up against Republican opposition. “If Trump wants to pursue policies that will help working people, Democrats will take a pragmatic approach,” he said. “But we also have other responsibilities. ” He made clear that the price of Democratic cooperation should be Trump’s dropping of Stephen K. Bannon, the former Breitbart News executive chairman who ran his campaign and whom Trump named as his chief White House strategist two days earlier. “In his first official act, Trump appointed a man who is seen as a champion of white supremacy as the No. 1 strategist in his White House,” Reid said. “As long as a champion of racial division is a step away from the Oval Office,” he added, “it will be impossible to take Trump’s efforts to heal the nation seriously. ” Reid and Schumer might have differed temperamentally, but they were both thinking about the 2018 midterm elections, in which 25 Democratic senators would be defending their seats. Lose eight seats, and the Republicans would have 60, enough to override a Democratic filibuster  —   at which point the Democrats’ debates about what they stood for or against would be academic. Five of the those senators  —  “the Big Five,” Schumer called them  —   were moderate Democrats in states in the Midwest, the Mountain West and Appalachia that Trump had just won handily. The abiding question was what, exactly, the voters who cast ballots for both Trump and, say, North Dakota’s Democratic senator, Heidi Heitkamp, were voting for in 2016 the party was still far from a clear answer. Schumer, who began holding weekly dinners with the Big Five after the election, believed it was best to allow these senators to cooperate with Trump as necessary. But according to members of Reid’s staff at the time, Reid (who declined to comment) worried that, given Trump’s lack of interest in policy detail and disregard for ethical conflicts, even   legislative compromises could prove to be politically costly  —   that an eventual backlash against the president would also fall upon Democrats who gestured toward working with him. “Reid didn’t want to validate the assumption that this incompetent blowhard could get a bill to the floor in the first place, which has proved to be a struggle for Trump so far,” Adam Jentleson, at the time Reid’s deputy chief of staff, told me. Democrats were also still deeply divided over whether it was even possible to navigate 2017 without resolving the ideological and policy differences that fractured the party in 2016. At a   meeting of the Democracy Alliance  —   a network of   Democratic campaign donors  —   at the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Washington the week after the election, Senator Elizabeth Warren delivered an emotional address, excoriating the party for losing its way. One attendee paraphrased her speech to me: “People want someone to fight for them  —   that’s why they voted for Donald Trump. He might not actually do it, but he said he would fight for them. On trade, in American politics, we’ve gotten where we either look like we’re all about free trade without any empathy for people who have lost their jobs, or we’re rabid  . We need to build a policy in between. In 2016, we did not come out clear. When we are clear about what we believe, when we fight for people, we’ll win. ” To beat pugilistic   populism, maybe you needed pugilistic   populism. Reid brought Warren onto the Democratic Senate leadership team in 2014, and she was one of the people he most trusted to keep the Senate caucus on its bearings through the difficult weather ahead. Shortly before Thanksgiving, he summoned Warren to the minority leader’s office. When she arrived, the room was littered with art supplies on an easel was a   portrait of Reid that would be unveiled at his retirement party the following month. Its subject was preoccupied with the future of the party to which he had dedicated decades of his life. Reid told Warren she needed to think seriously about running for president in 2020. “He was worried in November,” Warren told me recently. “For me, it was so important to make clear: We will fight back  —   we will fight back. We’re not here to make this normal. ” Warren believed that the Democrats’ first postelection battle should be over the   Cures Act, a $6. 3 billion   funding bill then before the Senate, which she argued gave away too much to the pharmaceutical industry and would weaken drug regulations. At a Nov. 28 meeting of the party’s Senate leadership team, she argued that the Democrats should negotiate harder than they had on the bill. But the idea was dead on arrival Trump was not in office yet, and the Obama administration supported the legislation, which among other things would finance the Cancer Moonshot initiative that Joe Biden planned to make his life’s work after leaving office. Warren crusaded against the bill on the Senate floor anyway, but only two Democrats joined her in voting against it. It was a minor fight, but an illuminating one. From one perspective, Warren’s move looked quixotic at a time when the party had bigger problems. From another, it was an argument for survival: Whatever unity the Democrats could manage would be worthless without settling what, and who, the party stood for. On the evening of Dec. 14, as Democrats were still struggling to find their way, a Google Doc appeared online titled “Indivisible: A Practical Guide for Resisting the Trump Agenda. ” Its main authors were three young former Democratic congressional staff members whose ambitions were at once modest and sweeping. “We’re not starting an organization, and we’re not selling anything,” they wrote. What they were offering was a blueprint. “The guide is intended to be equally useful for stiffening Democratic spines and weakening   Republican resolve,” they wrote. “We believe that the next four years depend on citizens across the country standing indivisible against the Trump agenda. We believe that buying into false promises or accepting partial concessions will only further empower Trump to victimize our fellow citizens. ” The Twitter account that first circulated the blueprint belonged to Ezra Levin, then a    associate director for federal policy at an antipoverty nonprofit and one of the document’s authors. Shortly after graduating from college, Levin was hired by Lloyd Doggett, a Democratic congressman representing Levin’s hometown, Austin, Tex. and he was working at Doggett’s office on Aug. 1, 2009, when the congressman went to meet his constituents at a Randalls grocery store in South Austin. At the time, Democrats were trying to maneuver the Affordable Care Act through the House of Representatives, and organizers of the nascent Tea Party movement decided to mount a show of force at the town halls that representatives typically held in their districts during the August recess. As Doggett spoke outside the Randalls, a large crowd of demonstrators gathered, armed with DON’T TREAD ON ME flags, signs assailing “socialized health care” and, in one case, a large poster of Doggett’s face augmented with devil horns. “They chased him out into the parking lot,” Levin told me recently. When Doggett tried to leave, the crowd surrounded his car. For the congressional staff members who experienced the uprising that August, the lessons of the Tea Party were mostly tactical, and unambiguous. Representatives live in fear of the wrath of their constituents, but also at a remove from it the legislative process is complicated, blame is easily distributed and Washington is far away. There is an adage on Capitol Hill that five letters from the district about a bill is cause for alarm, and 10 is a   emergency. By those standards, a couple hundred Tea Partyers besieging their elected officials in person was a borderline apocalypse. Republicans had in recent decades outperformed Democrats at this kind of dispersed,   activism. This was in part because the party was more geographically distributed than the Democrats, who were increasingly concentrated in urban areas and interior suburbs. But Democrats had also historically relied heavily on unions and urban party machines to reach voters  —   a support apparatus that receded sharply by the late 20th century. The Republicans, who never had such luxuries, assiduously cultivated their own grass roots  —   an effort whose success has contributed to the deep erosion of the Democrats’ presence in state legislatures (down 23 percent) and governor’s mansions (down nearly 45 percent) since 2008. The most combustible Tea Party town halls were confrontations with Democrats, like Doggett, whose positions on the A. C. A. stood little chance of changing. But these representatives weren’t really the intended audience Republicans were. The shaky,   videos posted to YouTube  —   the first real recognition, in American politics, of the platform’s potential as a stage for agitprop theater  —   and looped endlessly on Fox News were a message to wavering Republicans that obstruction would be rewarded and compromise would be punished. “They were really smart on strategy,” Levin told me: “Focus on your local members, and be defensive in nature. ” Perhaps most important, “They understood that ‘No’ was a complete sentence. ” “Indivisible” was a   précis of the tactics the document’s authors had seen work against them  —   a guide to getting to “No. ” “We’re under no illusion that the resistance will defeat every piece of Trump’s agenda,” Levin told me. The Tea Party lost many battles, including its biggest: “Obamacare was passed.   did pass. Lloyd Doggett did vote for health care. But it did slow down and water down legislation. We didn’t get card check for unions. We didn’t get cap and trade. We didn’t get a lot of things. ” If the Indivisible Guide was a blueprint for a movement, it was an unusual one, bearing little resemblance to liberal or   movements of the past. It called for no ideological remaking of the Democratic Party, no housecleaning of the establishment, no   of the bums  —   or at least not the Democratic ones. Its authors weren’t political outsiders they were members of Washington’s mainstream Democratic professional class. The document presented not just a strategy for standing up to Trump but also an argument for sidestepping the party’s most divisive internal conflicts. It offered a way of thinking about resisting the Trump administration that set aside the debate over what kind of party the Democrats should be. “This is not a panacea,” the authors wrote, “nor is it intended to stand alone. ” It was not a policy agenda, and that was the point. “The Tea Party took root in 2009, focused on fighting against every proposal coming out of the new Democratic administration and Congress. This focus on defense rather than policy development allowed the movement to avoid fracturing. Tea Party members may not have agreed on the policy reforms, but they could agree that Obama, Democrats and moderate Republicans had to be stopped. ” Within two days of Levin’s initial tweet, the guide was enthusiastically circulated by Democratic old hands (like Robert Reich, Bill Clinton’s first labor secretary) liberal journalists (New York magazine’s Jonathan Chait) and celebrities (George Takei, Miranda July). When the authors set up a proper website, it was viewed more than five million times in its first month  —   a testament to how closely the guide mirrored where Democratic voters already were. Demonstrators flocked to impromptu protests in the days immediately after the election, prompting Trump to fume on Twitter less than two days after his victory: “Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!” Five days before Trump’s inauguration, congressional Democrats  —   aided by Bernie Sanders, who deployed the formidable email list he built during his presidential campaign  —   held rallies in defense of the Affordable Care Act across the country, in some cases drawing thousands of demonstrators. What the crowds lacked for now, however, was any particular focal point besides the simple fact of Trump’s presidency and what they anticipated it might try to do in its early days. They were a force in search of an object. The first significant chances for Democratic lawmakers to stand against Trump’s presidency in some concrete form were the votes for his cabinet appointments. Five hours after he was sworn in, on Jan. 20, the Senate considered James Mattis, a retired   Marine Corps general, for defense secretary. Democrats broadly considered Mattis to be far from the worst pick for the Pentagon that Trump could have made. As Schumer told me, “He was against torture and got Trump to actually shift. ” The only member of either party to vote against him was Kirsten Gillibrand, New York’s junior Democratic senator. Gillibrand’s stated objection to Mattis was that his appointment would weaken civilian control over the military. She personally forced a   vote on his appointment  —   an opportunity to literally stand up and be counted, as the lone opposition figure  —   which seemed to indicate that she understood the significance of the moment. Gillibrand was initially a moderate Democrat representing an upstate district in the House of Representatives, then almost immediately established herself as one of the most liberal members in the Senate after arriving there in 2009. She was also one of the first senators to grasp the importance, and potential, of the Women’s March, which would descend on Washington the day after the Mattis vote. March organizers say they invited some senators to speak, but Gillibrand came to them asking to be involved. In the days after the Women’s March, the rest of the party began to figure out what Gillibrand had already grasped: Maybe the party’s base wanted the Democrats to act like McConnell. A protest against one aspect of Trump quickly became a protest against all aspects of him. A demonstration in Washington also drew crowds in Louisville, Ky. Boise, Idaho Charleston, S. C. Des Moines. “I lived very personally through the loss in 2000, the Supreme Court decision,” Klain, who was general counsel for Al Gore during that year’s presidential recount, told me. “And the response this time has been nothing like that. There has been genuine   activism  —   not just in the big cities but also everywhere else. ” The Democratic base, at least, had gotten to “No. ” And it expected the Senate Democrats to get there too. The first demonstrations outside Schumer’s Brooklyn apartment building were slightly apologetic affairs. The crowd of about 100 protesters who gathered on Jan. 8 around the   prewar   across the street from Prospect Park carried unequivocal signs: MAKE US PROUD OR WE’LL PRIMARY YOU DON’T CUT DEALS WITH THE DEVIL! But Mark Dunlea of 350Brooklyn, a group that put together the rally, was quick to explain to a reporter from the website DNAInfo that “we see Schumer primarily as an ally. We’re just trying to encourage him to be more aggressive on these issues. It’s not like we’re protesting Schumer  —   we’re urging him to be stronger. ” By the week after Inauguration Day, however, rallies were happening nationwide every Tuesday and had acquired an angrier edge. Trump was issuing a flurry of executive orders: reduced regulations on manufacturing, a pledge to disassemble the Affordable Care Act, advancements of the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines, the end of federal funding for “sanctuary cities”  —   municipalities that limit their cooperation with federal authorities in detaining people suspected of   violations  —   and the   to build his   United   border wall. Then, on the afternoon of Friday, Jan. 27, the White House announced it was immediately blocking all travel to the United States by citizens of seven   countries. The next evening, thousands of demonstrators converged on international airports around the country as travelers who were caught up in the ban languished behind security cordons. Some Democratic lawmakers who were back in their districts for the weekend joined them. Warren was at Boston’s Logan International Airport, red megaphone in hand. Cory Booker was at the Alfalfa Club dinner  —   a cozy Washington institution that Trump skipped but several White House officials were, reportedly, attending  —   when his chief of staff called him from Dulles International Airport. “I basically bolted,” Booker told me. “I mean, just compare: Who do I want to be standing with?” By 11:45 p. m. he was in the terminal, his tuxedo jacket exchanged for a sweater, addressing the protesters: “This is going to be a long, arduous and tough fight. And let me tell you right now: We have to be determined to continue the fight. ” The following afternoon, when a crowd of 10, 000 gathered to protest in Manhattan’s Battery Park, the first person in line to address the demonstrators, after the rally organizers, was Chuck Schumer. Taking the microphone, Schumer led the crowd in an old standby of a chant  —   “A people united will never be divided!”  —   and, somewhat tentatively, raised his fist. A couple near where I was standing, next to the stage, started laughing. It was a strange thing to see: Schumer was at the barricades, but Schumer was not really a barricades kind of guy. “What we’re talking about here is life and death for so many people,” he intoned, and waved his arm in the direction of the Statue of Liberty, glinting in the distance over his shoulder. “What we’re talking about here is that beautiful lady in the harbor  —   and what America is all about. ” Schumer’s presence at the rally suggested just how quickly, and definitively, the politics of the moment had been settled. In the week since the Women’s March, Trump’s executive orders had confirmed liberals’ worst fears of his intentions and the helplessness of congressional Democrats to stand in his way. And by the end of that week all four cabinet appointees under consideration  —   Mattis Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly Mike Pompeo, director of the Central Intelligence Agency and Nikki Haley, ambassador to the United Nations  —   sailed through their confirmation votes with no serious opposition. Schumer, in particular, had become a target of outrage. He had not only declined to rally his caucus against the cabinet nominees, but he had also voted for all four of them himself. As he was speaking, I heard a burst of effusive applause and cries of “Senator! Senator!” coming from behind me. I turned and saw, gliding through the scrum in the direction of the stage, the bald dome of Cory Booker’s head. He was beaming, obliging fans with   and back slaps. By some measures, Booker’s voting record in the Senate placed him a couple of clicks to the right of Schumer. But Booker voted no on Kelly and Pompeo, and Schumer did not. Booker was at the airport protests the night before, and Schumer was not. “My middle name is Ellis  —   Charles Ellis Schumer,” Schumer was saying. “I was named after Uncle Ellis, who was named after Ellis Island. I named my daughter’s middle name Emma, after Emma Lazarus, and what she said 100 years ago that’s emblazoned on that beautiful statue  —   ” “Vote no on Sessions!” a handful of people around me were chanting now. Jeff Sessions, Schumer’s Senate colleague, would be up for a confirmation vote as attorney general the following week. “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore  —   ” “Chuck loves Trump! Chuck loves Trump!” the hecklers chanted. “Don’t vote for one of them!” a woman next to me yelled. After Schumer yielded the stage to Gillibrand  —   “She voted no!” another woman near me shouted approvingly  —   he started making his way through the crowd, right into what happened to be a particularly dense pocket of his detractors. “Put ’em up, everybody!” he said, grinning, offering his hands for  . “Put ’em up for our immigrants!” “Vote no, Senator,” someone yelled. “Vote no!” “I’m no on DeVos,” Schumer said. “No on Tillerson. No on Mulvaney. No on Carson. No on Mnuchin. No on all of them!” (He had, in fact, already announced he was voting against Betsy DeVos, Rex Tillerson and Mick Mulvaney  —   the prospective secretaries of education and state and head of the Office of Management and Budget, respectively.) “Why did you confirm Haley and Mattis?” someone demanded. “Grow a spine, Chuck!” a   trimly mustachioed man screamed, practically in Schumer’s ear, his voice cracking: “Grow a spiiiiiiiine!” A scruffy young man, perched in the crook of a tree, began leading a chant: “Grow a spine, Chuck! You must obstruct!” Schumer is one of those politicians who seem to feed on the attention of a crowd, even a largely hostile one, and he pressed on gamely, smiling and shaking hands, pointing in the direction of the occasional familiar face: “Hey Dave, nice to see you!” He was almost out to the street, the crowd around him thinning, when a   woman in a “pussy hat” called out, in a Brooklyn accent nearly as thick as Schumer’s, “What about the first four votes?” Schumer stopped, a hint of a smile on his face, as if intrigued by the specificity of the harangue. “Would you have voted against Mattis?” he asked. “Everything they do. ” “He’s the only one who came out against torture. ” “So it’s a defensive vote?” “Yeah. ” “So we’re going to keep figuring out who’s a relief?” “No, no, no  —   all the other bad ones, we’re going against. ” He swept off up the block with his aides, a man trying to figure out how to be reasonable in deeply unreasonable times. The next cabinet vote, as it happened, was for DeVos, a nominee whom Democrats considered as vulnerable as she was objectionable. In   Schumer wrote to McConnell demanding that certain conditions be met  —   only two cabinet votes a week, and all background checks by the Office of Government Ethics completed before the confirmation hearings  —   or else he would lead his caucus in opposing eight of the nominees, including DeVos. Two Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, had announced their opposition to DeVos. One more no vote would sink the nomination. The Democrats called for an   marathon debate of DeVos’s nomination leading up to the vote on Feb. 7. It wasn’t a filibuster  —   Reid had done away with those for cabinet nominees in 2013  —   but a kind of  : an effort to draw attention to the vote in hopes of further overloading the Senate office buildings’ phone lines and nudging off the fence one of several Republican senators who had been identified, perhaps wishfully, as potentially persuadable. It was also an unsubtle challenge to Senate Democrats: the first moment since the airport protests for the party to stand up and stand together. As they held the floor Monday night and through the early hours of Tuesday, the senators stood in front of the   cameras and read off messages from constituents, urging them to send more to their Republican colleagues before the noon vote. By Monday evening the hashtag #HoldTheFloor was trending on Twitter, accompanied by emoji of praying hands, by inspirational quotes, by photos of Nelson Mandela or of Hodor from “Game of Thrones. ” It was odd, amid the online clamor, to arrive at the Capitol shortly before 2 a. m. and find it   quiet, nearly empty. The Democratic senators filed in one at a time, spoke for an hour to the rotating crew of stenographers and left. Brian Schatz, a young senator from Hawaii, was waiting for his turn to speak and checking Twitter on his phone. He had voted for the first four nominees but then loudly declaimed against others. Shortly after the travel ban, he tweeted: “I’ve never been a     guy. But I do think it’s time to march on the street. ” After an hour, the camera cut away, and a mildly   Tim Kaine ambled onto the floor to take his turn. “Timmy!” Schatz exclaimed. “Are you going to speak for, like, an hour without notes?” Kaine grinned. “I’ve got three pages,” he said. The Senate chamber has the oxygenated,   atmosphere of a casino on a slow night, the same woozy contextlessness. Sitting in the   press gallery as the clock inched toward 4 a. m. I began to have the strange sensation of not knowing exactly what I was watching. The Democrats, it was clear by then, would lose this fight. But the point of the fight was to show that they would fight, to generate the affirming images and video clips that were cascading through   social media, demonstrations of the efficacy of a resistance whose   prospects rested largely on the impression that Democratic lawmakers were hearing, and responding to, its demands. “Fourteen Democrats voted for Mike Pompeo,” Ezra Levin, the Indivisible Guide   told me. “This was a man who slandered Muslims, was open to torture, and 14 Democrats voted for him! That’s why you saw people outside Dianne Feinstein’s office, outside of Schumer’s office, Amy Klobuchar’s office. The base wants them to stand on principle. In the two weeks between Pompeo and DeVos, there were massive protests. And zero Democrats voted for DeVos. Pompeo was an awful pick DeVos was an awful pick. The thing that changed was not the degree of their awfulness, it was that people stood up. ” The next day, at a confirmation hearing for Jeff Sessions, Elizabeth Warren read from a letter that Coretta Scott King wrote in 1986 opposing his judicial appointment, prompting McConnell to censure her with an obscure procedural rule. McConnell’s justification  —   “She was warned she was given an explanation nevertheless, she persisted”  —   quickly evolved into a rallying cry, prompting nearly twice as many Google searches for Warren’s name as her election to the Senate did in 2012. In the next 24 hours, members of the   organization MoveOn raised $300, 000 for her 2018   campaign, and Sessions was confirmed as the attorney general of the United States. Who could claim this as a victory? Trump? Warren? Both of them? By   spirits in Democratic Washington had palpably lifted. You wouldn’t have described the mood as triumphal it was more as if everyone had emerged from the basement after a tornado to discover that, while the car was upside down somewhere, at least the house was still standing. The travel ban remained marooned, at least temporarily, in the courts. (A redrafted executive order was issued on March 6, but it was unclear if it had fully resolved the legal issues of the first.) Trump’s nominee for labor secretary, the   C. E. O. Andrew Puzder, backed out of consideration for the job in   after the Republicans concluded that they did not have the votes to confirm him. The project of doing away with the Affordable Care Act was still tied up in committee amid disagreements among the Republicans themselves  —   an inevitable consequence, perhaps, of their      opposition effort that the Democrats were now studying. And the infrastructure bill that had threatened to divide Democrats against themselves never materialized there was talk now of it being pushed back to 2018. On Feb. 28, a few hours before Trump was due to give his first speech to Congress, I went to see Schumer in the minority leader’s chambers in the Capitol. The senator was sitting in a leather wingback chair in his shirt sleeves, and he seemed to be in a genuinely upbeat mood. “Things look much better for us and much worse for him than I ever imagined based on the first month,” he told me. The day before, three Republican senators  —   Ted Cruz, Mike Lee and Rand Paul  —   had held out for nothing less than full repeal of the Affordable Care Act. “That’s the three votes they need, even with 52!” Schumer crowed. (The following week, a replacement bill finally began to advance through committees in the House of Representatives, but Paul declared in a Fox News interview that it would be “dead on arrival” in the Senate.) He pointed to the crowds that Indivisible and other groups had turned out in the thousands at town halls across the country the previous week. “Trump is the enemy, and his Republican acolytes  —   not Democrats,” he said. “We’re already beginning to coalesce around that. It was very positive. They throw a few brickbats, fine. This energy is enormous. ” But even as a sort of guarded optimism set in among many Democrats, there was a gloom among the party’s left flank that appeared nearly as thick as it was in November  —   a sense that the party, buoyed by the easy gratification of opposition, was punting on resolving difficult questions, at its own peril. Just before visiting Schumer, I went to see Bernie Sanders in his Capitol Hill office. In a couple of hours, the Vermont senator’s colleagues would be gathering in Senate dining room to share a meal  —   a bipartisan tradition before presidential speeches to Congress. But Sanders did not intend to be among them. “I think I’m going to skip the dinner tonight,” he said. “I’m not in a very convivial mood. I don’t want to pretend. These are very, to my mind, frightening times. ” Since ending his presidential campaign in July, Sanders, who caucuses with the Democrats in the Senate, had been managing the complicated task of redirecting the movement that materialized around his candidacy toward a Democratic Party with which he had a tetchy relationship. Schumer had created a post for him in the party’s Senate leadership, and Sanders had helped mobilize his   network for two rounds of rallies in defense of the Affordable Care Act. But earlier in the week, he said in a CNN interview that “a total transformation of the Democratic Party” was still in order, and that he had also not yet given the D. N. C.  —   which he called the “establishment’s house”  —   access to his campaign email list. “It’s not some magical system,” Sanders told me, disdain dripping off the word “magical. ” “How do we bring in, how do you raise money from, those people? You know what? You’ve got to stand for something. ” I asked him if he thought the Democratic Party knew what it stood for. “You’re asking a good question, and I can’t give you a definitive answer,” he said. “Certainly there are some people in the Democratic Party who want to maintain the status quo. They would rather go down with the Titanic so long as they have   seats. ” In early February, Elizabeth Warren, in a speech to the Congressional Progressive Caucus, warned that while the Democrats were fashioning themselves into an opposition party, that was not enough to solve the problems that put them in the position of becoming an opposition party in the first place. “Men like Donald Trump come to power when their countries are already in deep trouble,” she said. “There are some in the Democratic Party who urge caution. They say this is a tactical problem: ‘We need better data. We need better social media. We need better outreach. We need better talking points.’ Better talking points? Are you kidding me? People were so desperate for economic change in this country that Donald Trump was just inaugurated as president, and people think we need better talking points? What alternative planet are they living on?” When I met Warren a few weeks later, I asked her about the speech, and whether the postelection unity that Trump provided the Democratic Party made her ambitions to reform it easier or harder to realize. “I think it has reminded Democrats we need to run on our values,” she replied, parrying the question. “Because our values are more in line with most of America. ” If you squinted at the bodies packing the streets and the town halls, though, the picture looked an awful lot like the recent past: Here were people drawn together in defense of liberal immigration and refugee policies, reproductive rights, civil liberties and preserving Obama’s policy legacy, and in opposition to a president who was moving against all those things. These were last year’s arguments, only louder. If Trump, as president, seemed unable to let go of his 2016 campaign, the Democrats seemed like they were acting out an improved version of their own  —   the crowds bigger and more unified, the stakes more clearly understood. “There’s more enthusiasm, more energy, more passion now than there was at any point in the 2016 campaign  —   which is both heartening and discouraging, all at the same time,” Guy Cecil, the chairman of Priorities USA, the largest Democratic super PAC, told me. “’u200bI think that’s what a lot of us are seeing and feeling. And we’re trying to figure out the right way for us to respond to it. ” For now, the question was how far “No” could carry the Democrats. The Indivisible Guide, in the three months since Levin first posted the Google Doc, had birthed the organization he and his colleagues had not intended to start, with Levin as the executive director. It had registered more than 5, 800 local affiliate groups, at least two in each of the country’s 435 congressional districts. In February, Priorities USA, which raised $192 million to support Clinton in 2016, announced it was reorienting itself to support   organizing  —   including an investment in online advertising driving people to the Indivisible Guide’s website listing congressional members’ town halls. Schumer, meanwhile, was planning to lead the Democrats against Neil Gorsuch’s Supreme Court nomination, forcing the Republicans to find 60 votes or get rid of the filibuster. If Republicans tried to gut federal funding for Planned Parenthood in a forthcoming budget bill, he told me, he was perfectly willing to filibuster that too. “I think McConnell and Ryan know they can’t shut down the government,” he said. “Because they’re in charge now. ” And Schumer, precisely no one’s idea of a revolutionary, was now, at least in a narrow constitutional sense, the leader of the resistance. On my way out of his new office, I noticed a green marble fireplace and asked him if he’d used it yet. “Oh, man,” he said. “It’s my favorite perk. I live in Brooklyn  —   I never had a fireplace. I’m learning to start fires. ”",0

17365,"With Donald Trump in Charge, Republicans Have a Day of Reckoning - The New York Times","Republican elected officials, donors and strategists grappled uncomfortably on Wednesday with the inevitability of Donald J. Trump as their presidential nominee, an unexpectedly sudden denouement that left many in a state of political paralysis and others vowing to oppose the party’s new  . While some called for unity, many Republican leaders refrained from falling in line behind Mr. Trump, with dozens avoiding inquiries about where they stood or saying they wanted Mr. Trump to detail his policies or tone down his language first. Others tied themselves in knots as they praised and criticized Mr. Trump in a single breath, or suggested that they could abide Mr. Trump but loathed his agenda. Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who is in a tough   race, signaled that she would “support” Mr. Trump but not “endorse” him, as a spokeswoman put it, a rhetorical contortion that other Republicans repeated privately. Representative Raúl R. Labrador of Idaho, a staunch conservative, said he would support Mr. Trump but derided him for “not knowing much about the Constitution or politics. ” Former Gov. Bob Martinez of Florida, who retains a strong network of donors, said he would raise money for Mr. Trump but was unsure about his proposals, like temporarily banning foreign Muslims from entering the United States. For a party that usually rallies around its presumptive nominee quickly, the brutal primary campaign and the questions about Mr. Trump’s substance and style have fueled a remarkable level of dissatisfaction  —   antipathy that will not fade simply because Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio have ceded the race to him. The journey from denial and resistance to grudging acceptance, and even peace, with the Trump nomination may never be complete for some Republicans. But leaders hope to change that quickly, to save the party from splintering and to have a real shot at winning in November. “There will be some that will take days and weeks to realize that there are two choices and that it’s between Donald Trump and the Democratic nominee, which most of us believe will be Hillary Clinton,” said Gov. Phil Bryant of Mississippi. Mr. Bryant, who supported Mr. Cruz, called on him and others to back Mr. Trump. “Realistically, and I think Republicans are realists, this is an opportunity to have a Republican president sitting in the Oval Office,” he said. But Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a veteran House member and Republican strategist, said he was counseling his colleagues in competitive races to be coldblooded about how they approach their nominee. “Position yourself in the way you think is best for you,” he said, allowing that “it is difficult” for some members. “I know a lot of Republicans who are in   districts in blue states who see Trump as more helpful to them than they would have Cruz,” Mr. Cole said, citing Representative Elise Stefanik, who represents a sprawling district in upstate New York. “But if you’re in a heavily Hispanic district, your calculation is very different. ” Mr. Trump’s achievement also drew a rebuke of sorts from the last two Republican presidents. Aides to former Presidents George Bush and George W. Bush said they would not participate in or comment on the presidential campaign. By contrast, they supported the Republican nominees in the last two elections: John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012. Mr. Trump ran a sharply negative campaign against former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, the son of the elder Mr. Bush and brother of the younger, who dropped out in February. For some in the party, the question of whether to embrace Mr. Trump is not merely an intellectual exercise. Some staff members at the Republican National Committee were told Wednesday that if they were unable to get behind the nominee, they should leave by the end of the week. Representative Peter T. King of New York, whose Long Island district Mr. Trump won overwhelmingly in the April 19 primary, echoed other Republicans in pledging to vote for Mr. Trump even though he had reservations, calling Mr. Trump “a guy with no knowledge of what’s going on. ” “As far as any involvement or campaigning, it’s really going to depend on him filling in the gaps and consolidating his policies,” Mr. King said. “Right now, there’s no real coherence. ” The lingering resistance to Mr. Trump is especially strong in some of the states and congressional districts with hotly contested races this year. Representative Carlos Curbelo, who is from a competitive district in South Florida and has been outspoken about his refusal to support Mr. Trump, said Hispanics in his district were furious at Mr. Trump over his inflammatory language about Latinos. “Resentment is a kind way of putting it,” Mr. Curbelo said. “People are offended and really incredulous. ” He added that he would consider supporting a   presidential candidate, though that option did not appear to have much support among other Republicans on Wednesday. But the widespread discomfort and anxiety about Mr. Trump was utterly clear in the hours after he became the presumptive nominee on Tuesday night. Most leading Republicans were publicly silent. And the dearth of congratulatory news releases and Twitter posts spoke volumes. Over the last two days, more than 70 Republican governors, senators, representatives, officials and donors were contacted directly or through aides for comments about Mr. Trump. Only about 20 replied, with many aides saying their bosses did not want to take a stand yet others begged off by saying the officials were traveling or “too busy” to email, call or release a statement. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said in a news release issued after 7 p. m. Wednesday that Mr. Trump had “the opportunity and the obligation to unite our party around our goals. ” Democrats were gleeful: Mrs. Clinton’s campaign issued a list of more than 40 conservatives denouncing Mr. Trump’s success, among them Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, who said Wednesday that he would not vote for Mr. Trump. (A spokeswoman later said Mr. Baker would not vote for Mrs. Clinton, either.) Some of the biggest Republican donors were warily eyeing Mr. Trump on Wednesday. Associates of the billionaire Paul E. Singer and of the Ricketts family, both of whom helped finance the failed “Stop Trump” efforts, said they were still evaluating the race. While most donors and Republican leaders had become resigned to the probability that Mr. Trump would be their nominee, the withdrawals of Mr. Cruz on Tuesday night and Mr. Kasich on Wednesday forced them to face up sooner than expected to a question they had been dreading. “A ton of Republicans are waking up this morning  —   and I know because we’ve already chatted  —   and many are saying, ‘I’m not getting in this mess,’ ” said Gregory W. Slayton, a top Republican   who remains adamantly opposed to Mr. Trump. “Some are saying, ‘Well, I’m going to have to back Trump,’ and of course many are saying, ‘I don’t know what I’m going to do.’ ” Two influential Republican groups, the Club for Growth and the Republican Jewish Coalition, said they planned to focus on helping House and Senate candidates this fall and on keeping both chambers under Republican control, rather than making the presidency their top priority. William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, said the hostility toward Mr. Trump could be damaging if the Republican convention this summer gets out of hand or if his unusually high negative ratings end up hurting other Republicans on the ticket. “I think people are underestimating the degree to which you could see a crisis in the Republican Party,” he said. Still, in some quarters, reconciliation between Mr. Trump and his onetime critics is underway. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who clashed bitterly with Mr. Trump before dropping out of the presidential race, has had multiple phone conversations with him recently, according to Republicans close to Mr. Trump. (Aides to Mr. Rubio declined to comment.) And Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, who supported Mr. Rubio and had castigated Mr. Trump at times, issued a statement Wednesday reiterating that she would support “the Republican nominee for president. ” A spokesman for Ms. Haley said she and Mr. Trump had not spoken. Trent Lott, a former Senate Republican leader from Mississippi who supported Mr. Kasich, said he thought more Republicans would come around to Mr. Trump once they appreciated his appeal among conservative Democrats and independents, as well as among Republicans who do not traditionally vote. “The thing about Trump is, he has been turning out historic numbers, even in my state here,” Mr. Lott said. “I talk to some labor union people in my hometown, they’re for Trump. ”",0
17366,Bus Bombing in Jerusalem Wounds 21 - The New York Times,"JERUSALEM  —   A bomb exploded on a bus in Jerusalem on Monday, wounding about 21 people and feeding a sense of vulnerability among many Israelis after months of simmering violence. The sights and sounds were familiar: Television images of a   hulk of a bus and wailing sirens, immediately reminding many Israelis of the second Palestinian uprising, which erupted in 2000, when suicide bombers blew up buses in Jerusalem and other Israeli cities, killing scores. Attacks on buses have been rare in recent years. Describing the blast as a terrorist attack, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose image as Israel’s security czar has been dented in recent months, vowed to track down those responsible. “We will find whoever prepared that explosive device, we will get to those who sent it and we will also get to those who stand behind them,” he said, adding, “We will settle accounts with those terrorists. ” The bombing came as many Israelis were already on edge after a   wave of stabbings, shootings and vehicle attacks by Palestinians that have killed about 30 people. More than 200 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces during that period, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Israeli officials say that most of the Palestinians were killed while carrying out, or attempting, attacks, and that others were killed in clashes with Israeli security forces. Unlike the major assaults of the second uprising, which were engineered by the main Palestinian groups, most of the recent attacks appear to be the almost spontaneous work of by individuals. “We are in an ongoing battle against terrorism,” Mr. Netanyahu said, “terrorism of knives, terrorism of shootings, of bombs, of rockets and even of tunnels. ” He was referring to a tunnel that the Israeli military said on Monday it had discovered and “neutralized. ” Running from the Gaza Strip into Israeli territory, it was the first such tunnel found since a   ended 50 days of fighting in the Palestinian coastal territory in summer 2014. Mr. Netanyahu hailed the discovery, saying, “the State of Israel has achieved a global breakthrough in the ability to locate tunnels. ” He described the breakthrough as “unique,” but did not provide any details about the technology involved. The military said the tunnel had been built 100 to 130 feet underground by Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza that it could have been used for terrorist attacks against Israeli border communities and that it was equipped with electricity and communications lines. Israeli officials have said in recent months that Hamas had most likely rebuilt much of the tunnel network that was damaged by Israel during the   war. The officials also said Hamas was trying to restock its rocket supplies. The threat of the tunnels continues to sow fear in Israeli communities along the border. Some residents have reported hearing digging underground. Feeding those anxieties, Hamas’s military wing said in a statement that the recently discovered tunnel “is only a drop in the ocean of resistance preparations” meant to defend the Palestinians. Hamas also praised the Jerusalem bus bombing on Monday, without claiming responsibility for it. “We bless the   operation,” the organization wrote on its Twitter account, using the Arabic name for Jerusalem. The details of the bus explosion on Monday emerged slowly. The blast came shortly before 6 p. m. in Moshe Baram Street, by the Talpiot industrial zone in southeast Jerusalem. A fire caused by the explosion spread quickly to a second bus, but the police said it was not immediately clear whether the blaze was the result of a bomb or caused by a mechanical flaw. More than two hours later, Yoram Halevy, the Jerusalem district police chief, said in a televised statement that a bomb had caused the blast, but the police were cautious about determining if it involved terrorism, or crime. Mr. Halevy said the police were still investigating the circumstances surrounding the blast, including whether one of the people who was wounded had brought the bomb onto the bus. Two victims were in serious condition. The identity of at least one of the wounded was still unknown hours after the blast, Micky Rosenfeld, a police spokesman, said. Mr. Rosenfeld said the police were investigating how the bomb got onto the bus, and if it was meant to go off there or was intended for another location. Racheli Dadon, a Jerusalem resident, described from her hospital bed how she had boarded the No. 12 bus with her daughter, Eden, 15. “I had not even sat down when I heard a huge blast and all the glass fell on us,” she told the Israelie news site Ynet. She said she searched for her daughter amid smoke and darkness, finding her with burns all over her body. The driver of the No. 12 bus, Moshe Levy, said he had inspected the vehicle twice before setting out on his route. “The whole way was fine,” he said. “I got to Baram Street in Talpiot and stopped in a traffic jam. I heard a blast in the back portion of the bus and I opened the doors and told people to exit the bus. ” Prof. Avraham Rivkind, head of the trauma unit at the Hadassah Medical Center in Ein Kerem, on the southwestern edge of Jerusalem, said the hospital received several of the wounded who had suffered burns as well as injuries from nails and bolts  —   “wounds,” he said, “that are familiar to us from past events in our city. ” Also on Monday, Israeli military prosecutors filed a manslaughter charge against a soldier who fatally shot a Palestinian assailant in the West Bank city of Hebron last month as he lay on the ground, wounded and subdued. The military court lifted an order banning the publication of the name of the soldier, Sgt. Elor Azaria, from Ramle, in central Israel, and said his trial, in a military court, would begin on May 9.",0
17367,"Man Killed by Tulsa Police Posed No Threat, His Family Says - The New York Times","The family of Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man whose fatal confrontation with the Tulsa, Okla. police was recorded on video, said Tuesday that Mr. Crutcher had posed no threat and that his hands were in the air when he was shot. “We watch the video and it’s clear to see that Terence did not have a weapon in his hand,” a lawyer for the family, Damario   said at a news conference Tuesday. “It’s clear to see that Terence was not being belligerent. ” The shooting, the family and its lawyers said, was a clear case of excessive force. Mr. Crutcher, 40, was killed Friday evening on a Tulsa street by an officer identified as Betty Jo Shelby, a   veteran of the city’s Police Department. Officer Shelby, who is white, was responding to reports of a tan S. U. V. abandoned in the middle of the road  —   its motor running, the driver’s door open and the driver nowhere in sight. The family’s news conference came as the Tulsa police promised a thorough investigation and as a lawyer for Officer Shelby, Scott Wood, defended her actions. The case is the latest in a series of deaths across the country at the hands of the police that have raised questions about officers’ use of force, particularly against   men. Mr. Wood said Mr. Crutcher had behaved erratically and refused to comply with police commands. He said that Mr. Crutcher had been reaching through the vehicle’s window when he was shot, and that Officer Shelby believed he had a weapon. “She is extremely distraught over what has happened,” Mr. Wood said. “She has never used deadly force in her   career. She is a pretty seasoned officer and has worked in a lot of different areas. She is viewed by everyone as someone who is really squared away. ” The family’s lawyers, who include Benjamin L. Crump, who represented the relatives of Michael Brown, the unarmed black teenager who was killed in 2014 by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo. challenged Mr. Wood’s account. Mr. Crump displayed photos at the news conference showing that the window of the S. U. V. had been rolled up. On Tuesday, the Tulsa police declined to comment on whether Mr. Crutcher had been reaching inside the car. “This investigation is ongoing, and the U. S. attorney and the district attorney has requested no additional information be released,” a police spokesman, Officer Leland Ashley, said. Protesters gathered in Tulsa on Monday and Tuesday, calling for an unbiased investigation. At a prayer vigil Tuesday afternoon, a pastor, Jeremiah Hale, called for prayers for the family. Adrian Colbert, who is   said the shooting occurred near his house, and he referred to the riots in the 1920s, in which white residents killed up to an estimated 300   in the city. “He had his hands up, and they popped him,” Mr. Colbert said. “But that’s something we’re used to. It goes back to 1921. What happens here usually gets swept under the rug. ” The Tulsa police have opened a criminal investigation into the shooting, and the Justice Department has started a civil rights inquiry. A police video of the shooting from a department helicopter shows Mr. Crutcher slowly walking away from Officer Shelby and toward his vehicle. Moments after Mr. Crutcher is seen reaching the driver’s side of the vehicle, one officer fired a Taser and Officer Shelby fired a single round, killing Mr. Crutcher. Videos from the police helicopter and dashboard cameras did not capture the shooting itself. The helicopter video appears to show that at least one of Mr. Crutcher’s hands was raised when he was shot. The police said Officer Shelby did not have any disciplinary actions against her that resulted in a suspension or loss of pay since she joined the department in 2011. Before that, she worked for the Tulsa County sheriff’s office. Deputy Justin Green, a spokesman for the sheriff’s office, said she joined the department in June 2007 and was a member of the agency’s dive team. Mr. Wood, the officer’s lawyer, said that when Officer Shelby arrived at the scene Friday, she found Mr. Crutcher walking nearby. He did not respond to her questions, Mr. Wood said, but instead “locks his eyes on her,” which the officer described as “a   stare. ” Mr. Wood said Officer Shelby was “a drug recognition expert,” who had received specialized training in 2014. Officer Shelby, the lawyer said, believed Mr. Crutcher was “under the influence of something. ” When Mr. Crutcher ignored the officer’s order to get on his knees, she drew her gun, the lawyer said. But Mr. Crutcher continued to keep his hands in the air. He was shot about 30 seconds after other officers arrived. On Tuesday, referring to reports that Mr. Crutcher had been using drugs, David Riggs, one of the Crutcher family’s lawyers, said: “We do not know if that’s true or not. We are looking into that. ” He added: “Let’s assume that it was. You have to ask yourself again, what is the proper way to handle a situation where someone is acting in a strange way and perhaps not entirely in control of his emotions or his mental state at that time? This is a textbook case of how not to treat someone in that condition. ” Mr. Crump said the Tulsa police needed sensitivity training, a reference to comments heard on the videos by two officers in a helicopter. One was Officer Shelby’s husband, David H. Shelby. The other officer in the helicopter, whom the department did not identify, can be heard saying, “Time for a Taser, I think,” as they watched the confrontation “I got a feeling that’s about to happen,” David Shelby said. “That looks like a bad dude, too,” the second officer said. Mr. Crutcher was shot moments later “They should not look at citizens like that,” Mr. Crump said of the officer’s comment. “Because if every big black man is going to be looked at as a criminal and taken down with lethal force, then our society is in a lot of trouble. ”",0
17368,Piles of Dirty Secrets Behind a Model ‘Clean Coal’ Project - The New York Times,"DE KALB, Miss.  —   The fortress of steel and concrete towering above the pine forest here is a     power plant that was supposed to prove that “clean coal” was not an oxymoron  —   that it was possible to produce electricity from coal in a way that emits far less pollution, and to turn a profit while doing so. The plant was not only a central piece of the Obama administration’s climate plan, it was also supposed to be a model for future power plants to help slow the dangerous effects of global warming. The project was hailed as a way to bring thousands of jobs to Mississippi, the nation’s poorest state, and to extend a lifeline to the dying coal industry. The sense of hope is fading fast, however. The Kemper coal plant is more than two years behind schedule and more than $4 billion over its initial budget, $2. 4 billion, and it is still not operational. The plant and its owner, Southern Company, are the focus of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, and ratepayers, alleging fraud, are suing the company. Members of Congress have described the project as more boondoggle than boon. The mismanagement is particularly egregious, they say, given the urgent need to rein in the largest source of dangerous emissions around the world: coal plants. The plant’s backers, including federal energy officials, have defended their work in recent years by saying that delays and cost overruns are inevitable with innovative projects of this scale. In this case, they say, the difficulties stem largely from unforeseen factors  —   or “unknown unknowns,” as Tom Fanning, the chief executive of Southern Company, has often called them  —   like bad weather, labor shortages and design uncertainties. Many problems plaguing the project were broadly known and had been occurring for years. But a review by The New York Times of thousands of pages of public records, previously undisclosed internal documents and emails, and 200 hours of secretly though legally recorded conversations among more than a dozen colleagues at the plant offers a detailed look at what went wrong and why. Those documents and recordings, provided to The Times by a   an engineer named Brett Wingo, and interviews with more than 30 current or former regulators, contractors, consultants or engineers who worked on the project, show that the plant’s owners drastically understated the project’s cost and timetable, and repeatedly tried to conceal problems as they emerged. The system of checks and balances that are supposed to keep such projects on track was outweighed by a shared and powerful incentive: The company and regulators were eager to qualify for hundreds of millions of dollars in federal subsidies for the plant, which was also aggressively promoted by Haley Barbour, who was Southern’s chief lobbyist before becoming the governor of Mississippi. Once in office, Mr. Barbour signed a law in 2008 that allowed much of the cost of building any new power plants to be passed on to ratepayers before they are built. Seeing so many of the problems from the inside, at least one employee felt the need to speak up. “I’ve reached a personal tipping point and feel a duty to act,” Mr. Wingo wrote in a 2014 email, which was among several that he sent to officials of Southern Company and Mississippi Power, the state utility that runs the plant, alleging that the company had broken federal law and engaged in corporate fraud. “Hope is not a strategy,” he added. “This is a   project with many misguided enemies, so why give them free ammo?” In their recorded conversations with Mr. Wingo, at least six senior engineers from the plant said that they believed that the delays and cost overruns, as well as safety violations and shoddy work, were partly the result of mismanagement or fraud. “It has nothing to do with the design, it has nothing to do with the technology, it just has to do with poor project management,” Landon Lunsford, an engineer at the plant, said during one recorded call with Mr. Wingo last December, when they discussed an email from Southern’s legal department telling senior employees to retain all emails because of a continuing S. E. C. investigation. The company will never admit the   problems because they will attract more scrutiny from regulators, Mr. Lunsford said. “As long as they can talk away the results as attributable to something else other than just poor performance, the other public service commissions can’t hold them over the fire as much,” he added. Officials from Southern Company and Mississippi Power, which is a Southern subsidiary, said that they could not comment on Mr. Wingo’s allegations but that all decisions about cost and budget projections were made by consensus. They also said that Mr. Wingo’s accusations had previously been investigated by the company and could not be substantiated. Mr. Wingo was fired in February, a move that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration later ruled illegal. Ed Holland, the former chief executive of Mississippi Power, added that one of the project’s biggest mistakes was to start construction with little of the plant designed. “We still believe that from our investors’ standpoint, this was a wise investment to prove the technology,” he said in an interview. In the end, the Kemper project is a story of how a monopoly utility, with political help from the Mississippi governor and from federal energy officials who pressured state regulators in letters to support the project, shifted the burden of one of the most expensive power plants ever built onto the shoulders of unwitting investors and some of the   ratepayers in the country. Kemper’s rising price tag and other problems will probably affect the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed rules on new power plants, and also play into broader discussions about the best way to counter climate change. E. P. A. regulations in effect require new coal plants to have carbon capture technology but are being held up in federal court partly by arguments that the technology is not  . The importance of this technology grows, as well, after President Obama said last week that the United States would join Canada and Mexico in pledging to reach a shared goal of generating 50 percent of North America’s electricity from   sources by 2025, up from 37 percent today, with a power mix that includes wind, solar, hydropower, nuclear energy and coal or gas power paired with carbon capture technology. “The big question with clean coal has always been whether it’s a moonshot or a money pit,” said Charles Grayson, the director of the Bigger Pie Forum, which advocates fiscal conservatism in Mississippi and has been critical of the Kemper project for years. “The Obama administration and my state made a really bad wager in trying to use Kemper to make the economic argument for this technology. ” Coal represents a conundrum: It is among the dirtiest sources of fuel, producing roughly 45 percent of the emissions that contribute to climate change. And yet the world still relies on it for power, with more than a quarter of the electricity used globally coming from coal plants. Southern Company proposed a promising idea with the Kemper project. Providing a cleaner way to use coal, which is cheap and abundant in the United States, the plant also offered the means to preserve many   jobs that are fast disappearing in this part of the country. Kemper County, with mostly   roads cutting through clay hills and pine forest, has an average per capita income of $14, 837 and an unemployment rate roughly double the national average. To the region, the plant offered more than clean power: It promised hope, at least 12, 000 jobs and   savings. As construction ramped up, the county took in over $8 million annually in extra tax money, which went toward repairing roads, bridges and schools, lowering local property taxes, and clearing debt. In the summer of 2005, as Hurricane Katrina toppled drilling rigs and uprooted pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico, the price of natural gas rose by more than 40 percent. In Mississippi, utility regulators saw the Kemper plant as a way to diversify its energy options in a state that relies on natural gas for nearly 80 percent of its electricity. The plant, which broke ground in 2010, would run on lignite, a type of coal that is difficult to process but is plentiful in the region. Most of the carbon dioxide produced by the plant would be captured, compressed, sold and piped to oil fields. There, it would be pumped underground in a process known as enhanced oil recovery, to help push up previously unrecoverable oil to levels where it could be reached. Though carbon capture technology is proven and widely viewed as a potentially important tool to slow global warming, the question has been whether it can be scaled up affordably. Before becoming governor, Mr. Barbour helped orchestrate the transfer of about $270 million in federal subsidies from a canceled coal plant in Florida to the proposed Mississippi plant. As governor, Mr. Barbour then signed the Baseload Act, which shifted much of the cost and risk of building power plants from investors to consumers, and allowed utilities such as Mississippi Power to charge ratepayers for projects before they were completed. Carbon capture has been considered a holy grail for decades. For Ronald Reagan, it was a solution to acid rain for Bill Clinton, an alternative to nuclear power. George W. Bush billed his FutureGen project as the world’s first   coal plant but mothballed it when it became too expensive. As the emphasis on fighting climate change grew, the Obama administration hung many of its hopes on Kemper. Gina McCarthy, the E. P. A. administrator, cited federal support for the project as proof that her agency was not   despite strict new rules on   emissions. The Energy Department repeatedly wrote state regulators emphasizing the importance of the project. By 2012, though, “Miss Power,” as locals called the state utility, was facing mounting criticism about the plant. In May of that year, after the utility said that the Kemper project was $366 million over budget, it announced a plan to raise its customers’ rates by 13 percent. Campaigning for a seat on the Mississippi Public Service Commission, Thomas A. Blanton, an opponent of the project, ran television ads featuring an older woman eating dog food and warning of sacrifices that poorer people sometimes make to afford electricity. In cramped trailers where some of the poorest people in the state live, summer temperatures topped 110 degrees  —   potentially deadly for older residents who could not pay to keep their   running. “You don’t want to pay to build my home, and I don’t want to pay to build your plant,” John Gooding, a cabinetmaker from Bay St. Louis, who lost his home in Hurricane Katrina, said during a public hearing about the rate hikes. “Some people are still living in trailers, and now you want to build a plant you can’t guarantee. ” Other critics piled on. Environmentalists called the plant the “Solyndra of clean coal,” a reference to the heavily subsidized but failed federal solar project. They asked whether the plant’s climate change benefits were overstated because the carbon it would capture from coal was going to be used to pump more oil. Why was Kemper being cited as a model worthy of replicating, they asked, given that other plants would not share one of Kemper’s main advantages: a plentiful supply of cheap coal nearby. Alleging that Southern Company and Mississippi Power had overstated the plant’s   the Bigger Pie Forum sued to unseal project records. To help make their case that the Kemper plant would be competitive with natural gas, which is coal’s main competitor, utility executives predicted to investors and regulators that the   price for natural gas would be higher than $11 by 2016. But gas remains less than $2 per unit, undermining the business case for the plant. The project did create jobs, but Mark Klinedinst, a retired economics professor from the University of Southern Mississippi, said that more were lost in the region as businesses laid people off to pay for the higher electrical bills caused by Mississippi Power rate increases from plant construction. The University of Southern Mississippi also raised annual tuition $236 per student, partly to offset its additional $1 million in higher electrical costs, he said. Mr. Wingo, 48, had lived paycheck to paycheck for years, working at small, struggling engineering firms. When he was hired in 2007 by a subsidiary of Southern, it was a big step up. He doubled his salary to become a midlevel manager to help oversee scheduling and some design decisions on a project that he believed would make history. Before long, Southern began flying him around the country to explain the project to others. He received glowing performance reviews and was awarded an annual $2, 000 “Southern Excellence” employee award. By 2012, though, Mr. Wingo had begun his transition to  . About two weeks after state regulators renewed the license for the project to continue, Mississippi Power admitted to regulators that it had concealed cost overruns of about $366 million. In increasingly testy meetings and emails over succeeding months, Mr. Wingo told his supervisors that other scheduling information that Mississippi Power and Southern Company were providing to the public was infeasible and misleading. Ed Day, Mississippi Power’s chief executive at the time, tried to tighten control over what was shared. “I would like to remind everyone ‘again,’ no numbers, schedules, or information in general should be communicated to external parties until I review   first,” Mr. Day wrote in an Aug. 8, 2012, email to senior staff. Others shared Mr. Wingo’s growing concerns. Tom Theodore, a scheduling consultant who worked on the Kemper project for about eight months in 2012, described the company’s stated schedule as little more than “a pretty picture to show everybody that we’re all doing wonderful as opposed to what reality showed on the ground. ” His predecessors had altered the software so it no longer automatically adjusted the final price and completion date to reflect problems as they emerged, he said. Greg Zoll, who had been hired by the state to be the project’s independent monitor, also grew skeptical. While engineering expenses and purchases went up, reported construction costs went down and scheduling timelines were shortened. “These trends are illogical,” he wrote in of one of a series of highly critical reports that he filed with regulators from 2012 to 2014. Documents show that in a rush to qualify for federal subsidies, Mississippi Power started construction with less than 15 percent of the plant designed, Mr. Zoll told regulators. Mississippi Power rejected Mr. Zoll’s criticism, responding that the delays were caused by glitchy software and shifts in design, and that the company was absorbing most of the additional costs. But Brandon Presley, now the chairman of the Mississippi Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities, said that the project was troubled from the start and he voted against it. “The train left the station,” he said, when, in a rush to qualify for millions of dollars in federal subsidies, the commission approved the project. He added that the problem was not the federal subsidies, which are necessary to develop innovative technology, but the failure by all parties to slow down and ask enough questions. On May 20, 2013, Mr. Day abruptly stepped down as chief executive. His replacement, Ed Holland, told regulators that Mr. Day had directed or allowed employees to withhold from regulators documents about cost overruns. That sparked public outcry because the information was withheld from the commission while it was deciding whether to reapprove the project. “I will see that it never happens again,” said Mr. Holland, according to news articles at the time. In February 2014, an argument erupted at the plant. Engineers told   managers that the company should not promise to regulators and investors that the project would be done before the end of the year, emails and recorded calls show. Weeks later, the company did so anyway. The next day, the owner of the project’s scheduling firm sent an email saying that he could not in good conscience continue to work on a project that did not “fairly and accurately represent the work that still remains. ” Mr. Wingo wrote in a subsequent email to an official at PricewaterhouseCoopers, an auditing firm that was helping to manage the project, “This has really put the entire project at a crossroads. ” The other engineers in his division were in “utter disbelief” that the company had published a false schedule, he added. On March 10, Mr. Wingo called Mr. Fanning, the chief executive of Southern Company, to ensure the message reached him. “I’m glad you brought this to me,” Mr. Wingo said Mr. Fanning told him. “I plan to get to the bottom of this. ” Instead, Southern Company and Mississippi Power focused in subsequent months at least as much on damage control as they did on rooting out wrongdoing. In meetings, Mr. Wingo and other engineers said that they were told by plant managers that they needed to present an optimistic timetable for the project or the utility risked “financial Armageddon” of lost tax subsidies, spooked investors, possible bankruptcy, and harsh criticism from the news media, regulators and lawmakers. After Mr. Wingo provided company officials with a binder of documents corroborating his allegations, he said he was ordered to stop sending emails on the matter because they could become public through litigation. After he told his manager in an email that most project engineers agreed that the plant could not be completed by 2014, the manager continued telling executives that “to a man” all of the plant’s engineers thought that finishing by 2014 was feasible, Mr. Wingo said, and Mr. Lunsford, the engineer at the plant, reiterated in a recorded call that the manager’s comment was false. Mr. Wingo, who began speaking to reporters, refused an offer of roughly $975, 000 from the company to keep quiet, according to interviews and court records related to his   claims. Southern was then granted a restraining order, later dropped, forbidding him from speaking publicly about the plant, court records show. Mr. Wingo said that he began recording his phone conversations in August 2014, hoping to protect himself. During those calls, at least two of Mr. Wingo’s colleagues said that they strongly disagreed with what one of them called “his grand conspiracy. ” A   other engineers told Mr. Wingo that they shared his views. The Times contacted each of the engineers whose conversations were recorded and shared by Mr. Wingo. All declined to comment. The recordings include commiseration among colleagues, and ambivalence from engineers who vacillated between criticizing and defending the project. They include typical workplace grousing about bosses who workers say are in need of “Viagra for the brain” and are incapable of running even a Popsicle stand. They also reveal an internal struggle that Mr. Wingo faced: While still a believer in the possibility of clean coal, he was uneasy to find himself on the same side as environmental groups that oppose fossil fuels. “My enemy’s enemy is not necessarily my friend,” he said in one recorded conversation in February 2015. What troubled the engineers most was the poor quality of work: leaking gaskets, cracked ductwork, and pipes missing inspection records, valves and supports. Ryan Brown, a plant engineer, said during a phone call that he was having to “go back and do some sort of repair or rebuild” for every piece of work handed to him by the plant’s construction teams, which were under intense deadline pressure. In a call on Aug. 22, 2014, Mr. Wingo confronted one of his superiors, Brett Wingard, about photographs covertly taken by an inspector who was concerned about defective pipes at the plant. Mr. Wingard dismissed the threat, saying that the pipes were only in a section of the plant not yet in operation (part of the project is running on natural gas already). GPS information in the images indicates otherwise. Other workers recounted in phone calls to Mr. Wingo that they had discovered a large section of outdoor exhaust pipe that was glowing cherry red one night in September 2014 because   gases were misdirected through it. “That’s so bad that it made people all over the company stand up and say this is ridiculous,” Mr. Lunsford said in an October call with Mr. Wingo. Several   warned Mr. Wingo against being “a martyr. ” One engineer, Donald Falletta, told him in a phone call that jumping on a grenade “when there ain’t nobody else in the damn room don’t save nobody. ” In a call six months later, Mr. Falletta added that he too believed that managers were being “told to lie” about the pace of progress. In February 2015, Southern sued Mr. Wingo, alleging that he had agreed to a settlement but failed to comply with its terms, which included keeping quiet about the plant. Mr. Wingo said that he never signed or agreed to any settlement. Tim Leljedal, a spokesman for Southern Company, added that Mr. Wingo’s allegations had been thoroughly investigated by the company and by outside counsel and were found to be unsubstantiated. He added that with any project of this scope, detractors are inevitable. Shortly after the lawsuit was filed, Mr. Wingo’s colleague, Robert Adams, called him to say that he was leaving the company and to ask whether he would be legally allowed to speak publicly about the plant at that point. “Once we resign, do you think they will try to silence us?” asked Mr. Adams, who left the company shortly thereafter. In March, the company dropped its case against Mr. Wingo. “Hug that wife,” Donald Falletta said in a phone conversation congratulating Mr. Wingo. “She’s been through a damn   ride. ” The utility was on a roller coaster, too. In February 2015, the state Supreme Court ruled that Mississippi Power had to repay ratepayers roughly $377 million for increasing rates by 15 percent in 2013 and 3 percent in 2014 without proper approvals. Utility officials responded that the requirement would bankrupt it, and several months later persuaded regulators to approve a new increase, 15 percent. Meanwhile, engineers discussed the pressure to hurry construction. One of them, Brent Duncan, recounted in a phone call that he told a scheduling contractor how discouraged he was that managers were being allowed to “screw” with the schedule and “then claim they can meet all these dates, and there’s no way. ” The engineers joked that Mississippi Power, eager to show progress to investors and regulators, overstated certain milestones. For example, it bragged of achieving the “first fire,” which involves the lighting of the gasifier, when what they did fell far short of the actual definition, according to Mr. Wingo. “We burned natural gas in a pilot” light, Brandon Davis, an engineer, said during one phone conversation. “I accomplish that every day in my garage. ” Some engineers wondered aloud whether accurate information was making it to the top. “By the time the message gets to Tom Fanning,” Mr. Lunsford said in a September 2015 call, “it’s so muddled and messed up that he’s not even hearing the truth. ” In March, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration alerted Southern that it had violated   protections. The agency rejected the company’s claim that it was justified in firing Mr. Wingo because he could “not be trusted to support the chain of command. ” Mr. Wingo filed his   claim against Southern Company under the   Act. While that law does not lead to paying a cash bounty to successful   Mr. Wingo declined to say whether he has also filed a claim with the S. E. C. under the   Act, which does pay awards for successful cases. In April of this year, Southern informed the S. E. C. for at least the eighth consecutive month of a new delay and cost overrun, this time for $60 million, bringing the total spent on the Kemper project to about $6. 7 billion. In May, the Obama administration said that it planned to cut spending on   technologies by 3 percent in next year’s budget. Supporters of carbon capture say that Kemper’s problems are not representative of the entire industry, and that one part of the plant  —   the gasifier that converts cheap coal into synthetic gas  —   is primarily causing the delays. But critics say that the principal challenge of carbon capture is cost, and that the gasifier’s ability to use cheap coal has always been advertised as key to making the project affordable. As Mississippi Power and Southern Company have continued struggling to bring the plant online, Southern has repeatedly promoted in calls to investors its plans to help offset the project’s cost by selling the   technology abroad. For now, Mr. Presley, the chairman of the Mississippi Public Service Commission, says he is taking a    approach, hoping that when and if the plant finally comes online, it works as promised. Mississippi Power has said that every month of delay adds more than $20 million to the overall cost, but it will charge customers for extra costs from the plant only with approval by the commission. Mr. Presley will eventually have to grapple with what he called the “awful task” of not pushing the utility into bankruptcy while determining how much electricity customers, taxpayers and investors should pay for the billions of dollars in cost overruns.",0
17369,ISIS Said to Target Foreigners in Bangladesh Attack - The New York Times,"The Islamic State assailants who killed 20 people in a restaurant in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, on Friday picked a place that attracted students, textile producers and employees at nonprofit groups. The people they killed were interested in art, world peace and international business. The victims were from at least four countries, and they were thriving in an interconnected world. The gruesome attack wrenched the customers of the Holey Artisan Bakery from a world of curiosity, tolerance and cultural exchange and thrust them into the world of global terrorism. After an   standoff between the attackers and the Bangladeshi security forces, the death toll included people who were part of Dhaka’s   group of Italians, and a group of young students with ties to America. Diego Rossini, an Argentine chef who survived the attack by escaping to the roof, told C5N, an Argentine television station, that the gunmen had singled out foreigners. “That’s who they were particularly looking for,” he said. But in the end, three Bangladeshis were listed among the dead, including Ishrat Akhond, a human resource specialist who also worked at art galleries and spent her spare time volunteering for nonprofits. JCI Bangladesh, a group focused on global peace and a former employer of Ms. Akhond’s, said in a Facebook post on Saturday that she had been killed. “A passionate and lovely human being,” a friend, Shakhawat Khan, wrote on Facebook. “She used to start her status with the following words, ‘I am happy because. ’” Nine Italians, whose identities were confirmed by Italian authorities on Saturday, were also among the dead. They were among about 200 Italians living in Dhaka, said Tullio Ferri, an Italian who lives there and a friend of eight of the nine victims. “It’s a small community,,” Mr. Ferri said. “We are all very close. We’re more like a family. ” He said that all of the Italians worked in the apparel industry. Some were producers, some direct clients, and others worked as agents for Italian importers. One of the victims, Adele Puglisi of Catania, Sicily, had for years managed the Dhaka office of a large Italian company that makes children’s clothing. The restaurant “was a place to go to feel more at home,” said Mr. Ferri, adding that it was a regular hangout for foreigners living and working in Dhaka. “Sometimes we went together, sometimes we met up there by chance,” he said. Another Italian victim, Nadia Benedetti, owned a textile business and had worked in Bangladesh for 12 years, her landlord, Tarique Hyder, said in a Facebook post. Mr. Hyder called her contributions to Bangladesh “remarkable. ” Another victim, Simona Monti, 33, was thinking of moving back to Italy because she had just discovered that she was pregnant. She loved her hometown, Magliano Sabina, just north of Rome, but she had taken a job in Bangladesh’s textile industry, said Alfredo Graziani, the town’s mayor. Claudia D’Antona had lived in India and Bangladesh for 18 years, said her sister Patrizia. Ms. D’Antona and her husband, Giovanni Boschetti, were not afraid of living in Dhaka, but they were careful, the sister said. She said that on Friday night the couple “had dined at that restaurant because they felt safe there, because of where it was, close to the embassy where they were married. ” Mr. Boschetti survived because he had been called away for a phone call and was outside when the gunmen attacked. Seven Japanese citizens who were in Dhaka to work on a project sponsored by the Japan International Cooperation Agency were also killed in the attack. Their names were not immediately released. A    Indian student named Tarishi Jain was one of the first victims to be identified. In a statement that condemned the “brutal act of terrorism in Dhaka,” John Kirby, a State Department spokesman, said an American citizen had been killed at the restaurant. That victim’s name was not released. On Saturday, Emory University in Atlanta said that two of the victims, Abinta Kabir and Faraaz Hossain, were students at Oxford College, a division of Emory that enrolls only freshmen and sophomores. They were visiting family in Dhaka for the summer. The university said in a statement that Ms. Kabir was a sophomore from Miami and that Mr. Hossain was an Oxford graduate with plans to attend the university’s business school. The victims’ social media profiles reflected interests in world travel and in their school’s student community. Both listed Dhaka as their hometown on Facebook. In March, Mr. Hossain posted a Spirit Week flyer to his Facebook page. The colorful sign featured famous structures from around the world, including the Eiffel Tower and the Taj Mahal. Both students knew Ms. Jain, who attended the University of California, Berkeley, and was a graduate of the American International School in Dhaka. At Berkeley, Ms. Jain participated in a   business that     and used the proceeds to support underprivileged entrepreneurs around the world.",0
17370,"Trump Surrounded By Bankers, Wall St. Insiders Banging on the Door to Get In: “Draining the Swamp?”","
This article was written by Michael Krieger of Liberty Blitzkrieg.com . 
Editor’s Comment: If Jamie Dimon (of JP Morgan Chase) or anyone else that heads a Wall Street mega-bank, etc. does become Treasury Secretary – and that’s a big if for now, as reports on Jamie Dimon remain unconfirmed – then it will be the clearest signal yet that this latest round of “change” will be more of the same once again. If this proves true, then Trump becomes Obama in 2008 faster than a sportscar goes from 0-to-60. 
Meanwhile, there will be many appointments, and it would be difficult for any president, no matter how well meaning, to hold onto the image and promises they conveyed during campaign time after going through the gauntlet of hiring America’s most powerful axe-men. It is our duty to stay focused on these individuals and pressure Trump to dump or block the worst of these appointments. 
Once again, we see the worst and most dangerous elite insiders looking for yet another bailout in the form of jobs, appointment and power over the levers of government policies – climbing back onto the government lifeboat (now in the Trump administration) while working to swamp the rest of the struggling passengers who were on-board the U.S.S. Titanicamerica. A new Captain still can’t stop this trainwreck, even if any change is welcome. A real #drainingtheswamp would be a great start, but early signs cast doubt on that happening. 
This was the exact rationale for “The Obama Deception” expose at the start of Obama – it’s a deception because it’s a brand new face frontin’ for the same ol’ gang – and people are slow to catch on, and even less willing to admit they got conned. Is Trump the new Obama for the alt right/populist uprising to keep them complacent and blow off enough steam to avert a destabilizing revolution? 
The Obama Deception HQ Full length version

Draining the Swamp? Wall Street is Already Loving Donald Trump 
by Michael Krieger
Before we move forward, let’s start with the following extraordinarily disturbing report out of CNBC :
In the wake of Donald Trump’s upset victory, advisors to the president-elect have floated the possibility of naming JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon Treasury secretary, according to two people familiar with the matter, but one of them added that Dimon said he would not be interested in the role. 
A Trump spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment, and a spokesman for Dimon declined to elaborate beyond his past remarks that he would not be interested in the job. 
First off, I want to say that the above isn’t confirmed. If it’s totally false, the Trump campaign should come out with a quick and vehement denial. I sincerely hope that happens.
That said, the report is cause for serious concern. Why? Because Trump’s reluctance to go after Wall Street was apparent throughout his entire campaign (as opposed to Bernie Sanders), and it was one of the main reasons I could never get comfortable with him. I wrote several posts where I articulated my concerns, but here’s an excerpt from one of them, Donald Trump’s True Colors Emerge as He Snuggles up to Wall Street :
While I’m not a Dodd-Frank fan, it’s not because it was too harsh, but because it didn’t really do much of anything. It was the typical neoliberal bait and switch, designed to look tough for public consumption, while merely making tweaks around the edges of a financial system that requires systemic, paradigm level change. 
Trump’s support of repealing Dodd-Frank tells you all you need to know. A Trump Presidency will see Wall Street felons who should be in prison, running as wild and free as ever. 
He will be the same thing to distressed working class whites that Obama was to the black community. A fake messiah and a shyster. 
Read that last line over and over again until you understand it. If it is true that Trump considered the CEO of the largest “Too Big To Fail” and “Too Big to Jail” U.S. bank for Treasury Secretary, we can be pretty much assured that Donald Trump is the Republican version of Barack Obama. A fraud who talked a good game in order to get elected, but who will be a willing pawn of crony corporations and Wall Street. You can’t drain the swamp by surrounding yourself with the swamp. 
If I don’t hear a denial about this rumor, I will assume it’s true, which means Trump and I are off to a very bad start. Whether Dimon takes the role or not (I doubt it), is irrelevant. Merely considering Dimon tells you all you need to know about the types of status quo people who are likely to surround President Trump.
As I warned in yesterday’s post, Americans Roll the Dice With President Donald Trump , 
People = Policy 
Trump will be a failure unless he brings the right people into his inner circle. This is of the utmost importance. Indeed, I knew for certain Obama was a total fraud the moment he appointed Larry Summers and Timothy Geithner to key positions within his administration. This is the area I think Trump is most vulnerable to making some very big mistakes. Indeed, I was very bothered by the effusive compliments he showered upon one of the nation’s worst political figures, Chris Christie, during this victory speech. 
If Trump really wants to shake things up, he needs to think outside of the box and look far beyond the Chris Christies of the world, and consider some very sharp people he’s never heard of. If he surrounds himself with the old, tired political characters we already know, I fear very little will change for the better. 
You can’t get more inside the box, status quo than Jamie Dimon. Period. Which brings me to a conspiracy theory about the whole thing. I think there’s a remote possibility that the Trump campaign leaked this themselves with the hope that he can then appoint his preferred candidate, former Goldman Sachs partner, Steve Mnuchin, with little outrage. That’s typical Donald Trump behavior. People will then say, “well at least it’s not Jamie Dimon.” Unfortunately, Steve Mnuchin would be a terrible choice too. As we learned in the post, A Nation of Sheep, Afraid of Words :
Mnuchin’s presence in the campaign reveals how the qualities Trump loyalists projected on their hero don’t measure up to the truth. They have venerated him throughout the Republican primary for rejecting the dirty business of pay-to-play politics, and for populist vows to protect the ordinary worker. But in selecting Mnuchin, not only has Trump submitted to the realities of presidential campaign finance; he’s chosen one of the most notorious bankers in America to carry it out. 
When I heard Mnuchin’s name last week, I immediately remembered the front lawn of his mansion. Back in 2011, local housing activists and the Occupy movement in Los Angeles camped out on that lawn to save the home of Rose Mary Gudiel, a La Puente, California, resident who faced eviction after being just two weeks late on one mortgage payment. The activists threatened to move all of Gudiel’s furniture into Mnuchin’s $26 million Bel Air estate if the eviction wasn’t stopped. Twenty police officers and a helicopter met the protesters. 
The OneWest subsidiary Financial Freedom executed 39 percent of all foreclosures on reverse mortgages between 2009 and 2015, despite servicing only 17 percent of the market, according to data from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) obtained by the California Reinvestment Coalition. OneWest disclosed in its most recent annual report that it’s under investigation for this disproportionate share of “widow foreclosures” by HUD’s Inspector General. The victims include 103 year-old Myrtle Lewis of North Texas, who OneWest put into foreclosure after her insurance coverage lapsed; Karen Hunziker , who got a foreclosure notice from OneWest ten days after her husband passed away in 2014; and a host of others . 
Trump’s loyal fans aren’t likely to scrutinize Mnuchin’s record, but they should. You can measure political candidates in part by who they associate with. The foreclosure history in Mnuchin’s past reflects an extreme mentality of profit at all costs, and hardly a viewpoint of standing up for the little guy. Trump as populist was always something of a pose, covering for a deep nationalism and antipathy to immigrants. The Mnuchin pick just brings that into sharper relief. 
Meanwhile, what was Mnuchin doing right before the election? Why he was the personal guest of Blackstone head Steve Schwarzman at the New York Public Library’s Lions gala. 
Bloomberg reported:
Steve Schwarzman, who’s declined to say which presidential candidate he’s voting for, spent Monday night two seats away from Trump finance chair Steven Mnuchin, a possibility for treasury secretary if Trump wins. 
The setting was the New York Public Library’s Library Lions gala, where the Rose Main Reading Room’s tables were covered in gold cloth, the place mats were made of gold paper laser-cut to resemble the rosettes on the room’s ceiling, and the books were lit with spotlights. 
Mnuchin was Schwarzman’s guest — an experience sort of like hanging with Donald Trump in Trump Tower: The gala took place in the library’s Stephen A. Schwarzman Building. The New York Public Library includes this flagship center for collections and exhibitions, as well as more than 80 branch libraries where children learn to read, teens do homework and job-seekers work on their resumes. 
Here’s a photo of Trump’s “drain the swamp” finance chair hanging with billionaire private equity mogul Schwarzman.

Steve Schwarzman…you know that name don’t you? Of course you do. He’s the guy that said the following about the threat to repeal the carried interest loophole:
Word of mouth says that Blackstone founder Steve Schwarzman got suddenly very passionate when talking about tax hikes in July. 
“It’s a war.” 
“It’s like when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939.” 
With that in mind, it’s no surprise that Schwarzman had the following to say in Davos earlier this year. From the post, Billionaire CEO of Blackstone Trolls the American Public – He Doesn’t Get Why People Are Angry :
“I find the whole thing astonishing and what’s remarkable is the amount of anger whether it’s on the Republican side or the Democratic side,” the Wall Street mogul said at the World Economic Forum in Davos. “Bernie Sanders, to me, is almost more stunning than some of what’s going on in the Republican side. How is that happening, why is that happening?” 
This is the guy Trump’s finance chair was hanging with a day before the election . You don’t get more status quo than Steve Schwarzman. While we’re at it, here are just a few examples of what Blackstone’s been up to since the financial crisis:
America Meet Your New Slumlord: Wall Street 
A Closer Look at the Decrepit World of Wall Street Rental Homes 
Leaked Documents Show How Blackstone Fleeces Taxpayers via Public Pension Funds 
Meanwhile, I think the performance of Wall Street shares since the election tells you all you need to know.


To conclude, this article is primarily written for all my readers who are either Trump supporters, or who reluctantly voted for him. My message to you is that we need to hold this man’s feet to the fire. The election is over, and you got your desired outcome. Now is not the time to be a cheerleader. Now is not the time to behave exactly like Obama zombies did after he became an obvious betrayal. What allowed Obama to do all the bad things he did, was the fact that his supporters made endless excuses for him. Don’t make excuses for Trump. If you do, your life will get a lot worse and this country will decay far more into an authoritarian oligarchy than it already has. It is up to you to make sure he doesn’t become the Wall Street puppet I always feared he would be.
Remember the timeless words of Mark Twain and please take heed.

This isn’t the time for playing around. This isn’t the time for looking the other way. You voted him in to take down the status quo system. Make sure he does it. 
In Liberty,

17374,One Dead and 3 Hurt After Off-Duty Officer’s S.U.V. Hits Pedestrians in Brooklyn - The New York Times,"The scene that unfolded in Brooklyn early on Saturday was a tragically familiar one in New York City: a driver losing control of his sport utility vehicle, mounting a sidewalk and plowing into a group of pedestrians, leaving one man dead and three other people seriously injured. The driver of the vehicle was an   New York police officer who was intoxicated, the police said. The officer, Nicholas Batka, 28, was suspended without pay and arrested on eight charges, including manslaughter, assault and driving while intoxicated. Officer Batka, the police said, was driving west on North 8th Street in the Williamsburg neighborhood around 3 a. m. when he turned on Bedford Avenue, jumped a sidewalk and struck a group of friends in their 20s who were walking past a row of townhouses near North 8th Street. He was taken into custody at the scene. A   old man who was hit by the S. U. V. a silver 2012 Dodge Durango, was pronounced dead at Bellevue Hospital Center, the police said. Two women, ages 22 and 23, remained at the hospital in stable condition. One of them had been upgraded from critical, the police said. Officer Batka and a    man who was hit were taken to    Cornell hospital and were in stable condition. None of the victims were identified on Saturday. Officer Batka, who joined the New York Police Department in January 2015, was assigned to the Transit Borough Manhattan Task Force and had been scheduled to start a shift on Saturday at 7 a. m. the police said. He was suspended without pay and had to surrender his badge and his gun, the police said. Jaminah King, 35, and a friend were walking on the other side of Bedford Avenue when she saw the vehicle, a silver Dodge Durango, speeding and swerving. Then, she said, she heard a “loud, horrible sound” of the crash and saw the driver trying to reverse. Ms. King said she ran across the street, screaming for help, and called 911. She said she saw several people badly injured. The driver moved to the passenger seat and tried to exit the S. U. V.  but another bystander held the door shut to keep the driver inside, Ms. King said. “People just ran,” Ms. King said. “I was screaming at the top of my lungs for people to just help. So many people just ran to help people they didn’t even know. ”",0
17375,"Gene Tests Identify Breast Cancer Patients Who Can Skip Chemotherapy, Study Says - The New York Times","When is it safe for a woman with breast cancer to skip chemotherapy? A new study helps answer that question, based on a test of gene activity in tumors. It found that nearly half of women with   breast cancer who would traditionally receive chemo can avoid it, with little risk of the cancer coming back or spreading in the next five years. The   genomic test measures the activity of genes that control the growth and spread of cancer, and can identify women with a low risk of recurrence and therefore little to gain from chemo. “More and more evidence is mounting that there is a substantial number of women with breast cancer who will not need chemotherapy to do well,” said Dr. Rachel A. Freedman, a breast cancer oncologist at the   Cancer Institute in Boston. She was not involved in the study. The researchers estimated that their findings, published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, would apply to 35, 000 to 40, 000 women a year in the United States, and 60, 000 to 70, 000 in Europe. They are patients with early disease who because of tumor size, cancerous lymph nodes and other factors would normally be prescribed chemo. Genomic tests, which doctors have been using for about 10 years in some breast cancer patients, are part of a growing effort to spare women from chemo and its harsh side effects whenever it is safe to do so. But the decision to forgo a potentially lifesaving treatment is never taken lightly, and doctors have been eager for more data to make sure they are on the right path. The new study is one of the largest and most rigorous trials of genomic testing, and offers reassurance to doctors and patients that the technology can be trusted to help identify patients who do not need chemo. But an editorial accompanying the report said the study was not the final word, and additional research now underway would provide more clarity. Although women who skipped chemo had low recurrence rates, their rates were slightly higher than those of women who had chemo. A test called Oncotype DX is widely used in the United States. The new study used another, called MammaPrint, which is used less often. The tests cost several thousand dollars, and insurance coverage varies. Dr. Kathryn J. Ruddy, a breast cancer specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. who was not part of the research, said in an email that the study was important because “it will help more patients avoid the toxicities of chemotherapy (potentially including permanent nerve damage, heart failure and leukemia). ” The risks from certain types of chemo increase with the patient’s age. The risk of leukemia is about 0. 5 percent to 1 percent, and the heart risk can reach 4 percent or 5 percent in older women, Dr. Freedman said. The results of the study will be of most use for cases that have fallen into a gray zone, when the disease is in an early stage but has some anatomical features that suggest it may be aggressive. But the genomic test says it is low risk. “We all see these patients in our practice all the time,” Dr. Freedman said. “What do you do with that person?” The study involved women with early cases of the most common type of breast cancer:   tumors that test negative for a receptor called her2. In the United States, about three quarters of breast cancers are that type. Early stage in the study referred to Stage 1 or 2, meaning the tumors were generally no bigger than five centimeters and had spread to no more than three lymph nodes. The study was done in Europe, where “early stage” includes somewhat larger tumors than would be included in the United States. More than half of the breast cancers in the United States are diagnosed at early stages. The research involved 6, 693 women with   breast cancer at 112 hospitals in nine European countries. The study was paid for by grants from governments, drug companies and charitable groups. Agendia, the company that markets MammaPrint, did the testing at no cost. The women had the usual initial treatments  —   surgery, hormonal therapy and radiation. Then, researchers determined whether each woman had a high or low risk of recurrence based on genomic testing and on clinical features like tumor size and number of positive lymph nodes. Sometimes, the clinical and genomic risks did not match. MammaPrint looks at the activity of 70 genes. In a   tumor, 50 genes are turned off and 20 are active, according to Laura J. van ’t Veer, a molecular biologist at the University of California, San Francisco who was an author of the study and a developer of the test. In   cases, 50 genes are on and 20 off. The researchers were especially interested in the women  —   about a quarter of those in the study  —   who seemed to have a high clinical risk but a low genomic risk. Dr. Fatima Cardoso, an author of the study and a breast oncologist at Champalimaud Clinical Center in Lisbon, said that traditionally, women with early cancer but a high clinical risk were usually given chemotherapy. She said that doctors knew that not all would benefit from it, but gave it to all anyway to err on the side of caution, because they could not identify which women did not really need it. The main goal of the study was to find out whether women with a high clinical risk but a low genomic risk could safely forgo chemo. There were 1, 550 women with high clinical risk and low genomic risk. They were assigned at random to be treated according to their genomic risk or their clinical risk. So some received chemotherapy, and others did not. Then the researchers watched to see if any had distant spread of the cancer to other organs, which is often fatal. After five years, among those who did not receive chemotherapy, 94. 4 percent had no distant spread. Those who received chemo fared slightly better: 95. 9 percent had no distant spread. “We have to continue to follow these patients and see what happens at 10 years,” Dr. Cardoso said. But given the small difference so far, the researchers said that it was safe for women with early disease and high clinical risk, but low genomic risk, to skip chemotherapy. The findings, they said, mean that 46 percent of women with   disease who are thought to be at high clinical risk may be able to skip chemo. An editorial accompanying the article praised the research but sounded a note of caution. The authors, Dr. Clifford A. Hudis and Dr. Maura N. Dickler, from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said that the study was not large enough to be sure that the 1.   difference would hold up statistically. The editorial also noted that other studies of genomic tests had identified groups of women in whom the   recurrence risk was only 1 percent, and asked what level of risk was acceptable. Patients’ attitudes also differ. Dr. Freedman said some women wanted no part of chemo, even if it offered a significant benefit. But, she added, “others line up at the door for almost no benefit, just so they can have peace of mind. ”",0

17378,"Donald Trump, François Fillon, Opel: Your Monday Briefing - The New York Times","Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump demanded that Congress investigate whether former President Barack Obama abused his power after accusing Mr. Obama of ordering a wiretap of phones at Trump Tower before the election. Mr. Trump has offered no evidence to support his accusation, which began as a rant by a conservative talk radio host. The F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, asked the Justice Department to publicly reject Mr. Trump’s assertion. The episode has heightened interest in several related surveillance issues. _____ • Mr. Trump is expected to issue a new version of his executive order on immigration. The new order, reworked to try to withstand legal scrutiny, would exclude Iraq but retain temporary travel restrictions on six other predominantly Muslim countries and on all refugees. In his first six weeks in office, Mr. Trump has delayed or suspended more than 90 federal regulations  —   affecting everything from Wall Street to gun shops. Here’s a list of more rules that could be erased in coming weeks. _____ • North Korea launched several ballistic missiles from its   rocket site on Monday morning, the South Korean military said. The launch came as the U. S. and South Korea were conducting their annual joint military exercise. A Times investigation found that Mr. Trump had inherited a covert cyberwar against the North’s nuclear launch systems, which he must decide whether to continue. _____ • China’s premier, Li Keqiang, addressed pollution, debt and foreign policy at the opening of the National People’s Congress in Beijing. Mr. Li gave a slightly more modest target for economic growth this year of 6. 5 percent, which many economists argue is still too ambitious. _____ • South Sudan, not yet six years independent, has been engulfed by conflict for four. The tribal warfare threatens nearly every pillar the young nation was relying on: oil production, agriculture, education and, most especially, unity. _____ • Deutsche Bank plans to raise $8. 5 billion in capital with its third share sale in four years, after disclosing a loss of about $2 billion in the fourth quarter. • PSA Group of France on Monday announced a deal to buy General Motors’ Opel and Vauxhall brands for $2. 3 billion. The deal would make PSA, the maker of Peugeot and Citröen, the   car company in Europe. • U.

On Feb. 22, The Washington Post added a new slogan beneath its nameplate  —   “Democracy Dies in Darkness. ” The motto was not, The Post said, a response to President Trump’s attacks on the news media, which he has called “the enemy of the people. ” Executives at The Post had planned on a slogan long before Mr. Trump even became the Republican presidential nominee. Their criteria was a phrase that “must be memorable and may be slightly uncomfortable for us at first. ” The newspaper acknowledged that the motto was “dramatic” and had become fodder for comics (Slate made a list of “15 Metal Albums Whose Titles Are Less Dark Than The Washington Post’s New Motto”). The Columbia Journalism Review pointed out that slogans have been a tradition in American newspapers since the 16th century. Consider such classics as “Daily Diary of the American Dream” (The Wall Street Journal) or “If You Don’t Want It Printed, Don’t Let It Happen” (The Aspen Daily News in Colorado). The New York Times has used “All the News That’s Fit to Print” since 1897, but that wasn’t its first motto. When Adolph Ochs bought the paper he held a contest for the new slogan. The winning entry was “It Will Not Soil the Breakfast Cloth. ” Charles McDermid contributed reporting. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

17380,"Deplorables 1, Empire 0      : Information"," Deplorables 1, Empire 0 By Paul Edwards
November 11, 2016 "" Information Clearing House "" - Its done. The foolish, arrogant propaganda excreted by the captive press of the Imperial Establishment is flushed, and they and their owners are eating their hubris, choking down the bitter, toxic medicine they inflicted on themselves. The nightmare they swore could never win is the Chosen One.
What this may mean to them, to all of us, and to The Empire, no one can guess. The origin, though, of what Michael Moore called the greatest Fuck You in our political history, is clear behind the shock and awe of the elite.
Between them, Trump and Clinton diligently stripped away the last shreds of the rent and ragged camouflage that disguised our zombie body politic.
Behind the mantra of Exceptionalism, the American Empire has behaved with exactly the same solipsistic arrogance all empires have embraced.
Internationally it has raged, as imperial China did, as if with a Mandate of Heaven, flaunting self-interest with no regard for other nations or the laws of war. It has inflicted misery, chaos, and death on many millions of the poor and helpless for a Full Spectrum Dominance it could never impose. Americas Capitalist War Machine has raped and destroyed many countries for its profit, and destablized the entire world in its megalomania.
Schumpeter said it best, of Imperial Germanys military industry: Created by the wars that required it, the Machine now creates the wars it requires.
America has been transformed over time from a civil democracy with imperial economics to a militarist empire with vaudeville democracy. This was accomplished by binding both wings of the duopoly to the exclusive interest of Predatory Capitalism with corrupting money. A corporate state imposed via political and military power is the essence of Fascism.
For generations, Americans have been dosed with the ultra-nationalist poison of Exceptionalism, with its implicit racist subtext, and its sexism buried in a hoo-rah masculinity cult, but it has always been flavored with the sweetening agent that We, The People, were both masters and beneficiaries of our benign, patristic system. The last several decades have painfully taught any conscious observer that this is a cynical fiction.
In this election, the threadbare mythology of the duopoly was ripped away in a manner that left no doubt, in even the least informed, most credulous minds, that the American political system was a dead, stinking fraud. Each party, with its purblind lack of understanding of, and connection with, the mass of American people, suffered uniquely humiliating public pantsings.
Having stealthily, assiduously cultivated and nurtured the most regressive, dim, and hateful elements in its Redneck Wing for decades, the CEO Wing gaped impotently as Dogpatch was appropriated by a vulgarian who spoke to peckerwoods directly, not in code. He jettisoned the few Silverspooners and Coupon Clipper Bosses, stole their ground troops and mobilized their outrage. He only succeeded then due to the universal rage of the working class that has been dealt out and bankrupted, its jobs and prospects stolen and its lives sunk, for the benefit of a tiny clique of professional criminals.
The Republican Party is done, killed because Trump grabbed its posse.
Democrats, confident of being lesser evils, opted for selbstmord. After Occupys warning, exposes of record financial inequality and the rapid unravelling of democracy, one might have thought a show of fight against those evils would be mandatory, but no: they pre-selected the candidate who embodied them instead. As the long, impassioned cry went up across the country, from the young, working people, the ill and poor, disabled and elderly, for an old man who would be their champion, Party commissars chose to freeze out Bernies burn and go geriatrically into that good night. Then, when caught out in their shoddy chicanery, they Hitlered Putin.
The Democratic Party is done, dead of peritonitis from undigested hubris.
The failure of faction, the implosion of coherent parties, means more, not less division and acrimony. America faces now the same degree of crisis that has blown the senile Parties in pieces. The time ahead is fraught with tremendous and unknown perils and challenges with no precedent. Our Republic stands a good chance of becoming ungovernable.
Franklin said, with the tough days in Philadelphia over and the Constitution signed, that we had a Republic, if we could keep it. Were about to find out.",0
17381,The Myth of the McMahon Line,"  Recipient Email => 
There’s playing with fire and there’s dousing yourself with gasoline and jumping into a flaming pit. I do the latter in a piece for SCMP’s This Week in Asia magazine, The British Forgery at the Heart of India and China’s Tibetan Border Dispute . 
My proposed title, Uncle Sam Plays the Great Game in Arunachal Pradesh, didn’t make the cut. 
In my piece I take the visit of the US Ambassador to India, Richard Verma, as an opportunity to unpack the history and significance of the 1914 Simla Convention between Great Britain, Tibet, and China, an imperial episode which also saw the birth of the notorious McMahon Line. 
The McMahon Line is notorious since India unilaterally—and with some help from the United States and zero agreement from the PRC—asserts that the McMahon Line is the indisputable boundary between India and the PRC in India’s Northeast. 
The McMahon Line is a hot-button issue for Tibetan nationalists as well, since Great Britain negotiated it directly with the government of Tibet, so supporting the McMahon Line delivers the dual benefits of supporting the narrative of the existence of a recognized independent Tibetan government and giving aid and comfort to the Tibetan diaspora’s Indian patron. 
The actual situation and significant consequence of the McMahon Line is complicated but, I believe, accessible thanks to some deft historical research by several scholars and despite some litigating by Indian and Tibetan partisans. 
Having said that, I welcome correction and instruction, so in this post I’m going to lay out the arguments behind the assertions in my SCMP piece in greater detail. For sourcing, I lean on Neville Maxwell India’s China War (Maxwell was the Times of London ’s India correspondent during the 1962 war and a key figure in revisionist analysis of the roots of the war), and an unpublished dissertation by Dr. Heather Spence, British policy and the ‘development’ of Tibet, 1912-1933, that I found very informative on the diplomatic and geopolitical context of the Great Britain-Tibet relationship pre-and-post-Simla. 
The story of the McMahon Line is inseparable from—but not identical with—the story of the Simla Convention negotiations between Great Britain—represented by Henry McMahon–China, and Tibet at the hill town of Simla in India in 1914. 
First off, the key and most interesting aspects of the Simla Convention are both the de facto independence of Tibet (which had expelled the Chinese by 1914 and had a government in Lhasa under the Dalai Lama with effective control over much of the area of Tibet)…and Great Britain’s consistent and overriding interest in denying de jure independence for Tibet. 
Great Britain was obsessed, perhaps unhealthily so, with playing the “Great Game”: forestalling the southern creep of Russian influence in Asia toward India. 
In India’s northeast, this translated into the desire to establish Tibet as a buffer state that was pro-British and secure. 
“Pro-British” was not an issue in 1914, since the Dalai Lama at the time was an ardent Anglophile who had spent several years of exile in the sympathetic company of the British administrator Charles Bell. 
“Secure” was the problem. The Raj had no interest in rolling the geopolitical dice by endorsing Tibetan independence and with it the possibility that a hostile new regime and adverse set of circumstances might bring the Chinese or Russians into Tibet and up to India’s doorstep; but it also lacked the will or capacity to assert and enforce a unilateral protectorate over Tibet. 
It was deemed necessary that, if and when China emerged from the chaos of the 1911 Revolution as a power-projecting state, it would acquiesce to the existence of an autonomous Tibetan government that had a special relationship with Great Britain. 
So Henry McMahon summoned Tibetan and Chinese representatives to Simla to order the relations between Tibet and China, and between Tibet and Great Britain. The Tibetans were eager to attend; the Chinese were compelled by McMahon’s threat that he would conclude a bilateral agreement with Tibet if they didn’t show up. 
One can speculate—and I will—that the Chinese showed up primarily to stall and throw a spanner in the works. Simla acknowledged China’s role—and also gave China the chance to act as the spoiler, by participating in the negotiations but refusing to endorse the outcome. 
The core of the British agenda at Simla was to partition Tibet into “Inner” and “Outer” Tibet as the Russians had just done with “Inner” and “Outer” Mongolia. Inner Tibet, the parts abutting Sichuan in which Chinese control was stronger, would be incorporated into China. Outer Tibet—the big part, the strategic part, the highlands run out of Lhasa by the Dalai Lama—would not become independent: it would be an autonomous government lacking control over its foreign affairs. 
Autonomy, but autonomy of a specific type was preferred. McMahon came up with the idea of “suzerainty”. 
“Suzerainty” served multiple purposes. By invoking a Chinese aegis, “suzerainty” was a legal fig leaf providing diplomatic cover to Great Britain, which had concluded an agreement with Russia in 1907 that promised neither state would conduct direct negotiations with the Tibetan government. At the same time, “suzerainty” was intended to forestall any claims from Russia and other nations that “Outer Tibet” was part of China and therefore subject to the Open Door policy declaring that the rights and access of one state in China were to be enjoyed by all. 
But most importantly, “suzerainty” was used to assert that, by China’s leave, Tibet would be autonomous, but still conduct its foreign affairs independently with respect to only to one, and only one country: Great Britain. 
So, in essence, the Simla Convention was designed to secure a special relationship between Great Britain and Tibet with Chinese endorsement to compensate for the fact that Great Britain lacked the resolve to secure Tibet as a formal British protectorate. 
The Chinese, however, did not endorse. The Chinese representative initialed the draft agreement, but the Chinese government withheld authorization to sign. 
To explain its refusal, the Chinese government placed the onus on the issue of boundary delimitation. 
The Chinese foreign affairs office formally notified Great Britain that “This Government has several times stated that it gives its support to the majority of the articles of the Convention. The part which it is unable to agree to is that dealing with the question of boundary. [Spence, pg. 36] 
I expect it was McMahon’s fallback plan from the gitgo to try to take in the bilateral what China refused to cede in the trilateral. 
McMahon had been instructed by London not to sign bilaterally with just Tibet, but he decided to exceed his instructions, concluding an agreement with Tibet that finessed the Chinese non-participation in the Simla Convention with a declaration that China, by not signing, had simply forfeited the privileges for China negotiated in the Convention. 
According to this formula, Great Britain and Tibet would execute the parts of the Convention that pertained to them—mainly diplomatic (Tibet would not enter into agreements with any other foreign power without Britain’s OK) and trade. The agreement waived all tariffs between British India and Tibet, a piece of free-trade maneuvering that advantaged the Raj but caused no small fiscal problems and resentment of the Tibetan government (which had relied on taxing exports of wool to India for a significant part of its revenue) in the 1920s. 
At Simla the Chinese representative, Ivan Chen, was excluded from these discussions, unaware of the content of the bilateral undertakings, and invited to go to a separate room while British and Tibetan representatives signed them. Unsurprisingly, he declared the Chinese government would not recognize any agreement concluded bilaterally between Great Britain and Tibet, a declaration that was repeated by the Chinese Minister in London. 
No one regarded the gains of the bilateral track as an adequate replacement for a trilateral pact. 
It was understood by all concerned—Great Britain, India, Tibet, China, indeed, McMahon himself—Simla was a bust. McMahon reported to London: 
It is with great regret that I leave India without having secured the formal adherence of the Chinese Government to a Tripartite Agreement…The fact is that the negotiations at Simla…broke down… [Maxwell, 49] 
Mindful that without China’s formal participation the agreement at Simla was in conflict with the 1907 convention with Russia, Great Britain did not publish the Simla Convention. Instead, it belatedly took notice of the negotiations in its official compendium, Aitchison’s Treaties and Sanads 1929 Edition Volume XIV , with the terse remark: “The convention was initialled and sealed on 3 July 1914. As this Convention was not signed and ratified by all three parties, the current Chinese Government does not consider itself bound by the terms of this convention.” 
As for the McMahon Line, it was a separate bilateral sideshow to the main issue of trying to demarcate a border between Tibet and China a.k.a. “Inner” and “Outer” Tibet trilaterally at Simla. 
Prior to and contemporaneously with the tripartite negotiations on the Simla Convention, the British and Tibetan teams had conducted bilateral discussions in Delhi and Simla as to the position of the boundary between India and Tibet. 
Since Great Britain regarded Tibet as de facto autonomous in its dealings with Great Britain (and presumably hopeful the special relationship would be shortly confirmed at Simla as de jure ) , no effort was made during the negotiations to involve China, with rather disastrous implications for the future. 
In 1962, India would be facing not the Tibetan government across the McMahon Line but the People’s Republic of China, which with very good reason considered itself in no way bound as a successor to any previous border negotiations. 
With equally disastrous consequences for Nehru and India in 1962, McMahon, instead of drawing the boundary in the foothills of the Himalayas, drew it along the crestline, in easy reach of attackers from the north but virtually indefensible from the south. 
The key horsetrading occurred in the matter of the “Tawang Tract”. Tawang was an indisputable locus of Tibetan control, with a big monastery dominating a fertile valley at the southern reaches of the Tibetan plateau and also dominating, in a less than admirable way, a local population of ethnic Manpo serfs exploited in the most dire fashion. 
By virtue of its riverine topography, Tawang straddled an important trade route between Lhasa and northern India and was therefore seen as a potential military threat/power point that the Raj wished to control. 
In the bilateral British-Tibetan boundary discussions, the western terminus of McMahon’s line crept north until it included all of Tawang. The Tibetan delegation was apparently not happy about this state of affairs but accepted it as the price of British support and with the reassurance that they could continue to tax Tawang despite its inclusion into British India. The Indian-Tibetan boundary agreement was enshrined in an 8 mile to the inch map and held in two copies, one by the British and one in Lhasa. 
The McMahon Line was introduced into the Simla negotiations through the back door, as it were, by presenting it as a fait accompli on the large-scale map intended for attachment to the Simla Convention as a continuation of the crucial line defining the boundary between Inner and Outer Tibet which had indeed been the subject of genuine tripartite negotiations. 
Interestingly, the British and Tibetans also bilaterally extended the boundary to enclose Aksai Chin, a barren waste to the west of Tibet, as Tibetan (not Indian) territory in order to give Tibet the incentive or responsibility to keep the Russians out of that sensitive strategic area. 
Ivan Chen initialed the treaty and map—the sole, shaky basis for India’s subsequent insistence that China had accepted the McMahon Line—but was rebuked by Peking for exceeding his instructions and, as noted above, declined to sign the final Convention. 
At the time, as recorded in Aitchison, it was universally understood that China had rejected the Simla Convention, and that this was a problem that overshadowed whatever informal gains had accrued to Britain through the bilateral agreements with Tibet. We know this thanks to documents demonstrating that both the Tibetans and Great Britain clung to the Simla “suzerainty” gambit, and that they labored fruitlessly for decades to get China back to the negotiating table to validate the policy. 
The key concern was that China, by refusing to sign the tripartite Simla Convention, had refused to countenance the Inner/Outer Tibet arrangement that would have fixed the Sino-Tibetan border, assured the autonomy and security of the government in Lhasa– and justified to Lhasa Great Britain’s extensive, unique, and increasingly onerous diplomatic and trading privileges in “Outer Tibet”. 
Immediately subsequent to the Simla negotiations, 1915, internal British correspondence characterized the Simla Convention as “invalid” [Spence, pg. 59] and, in the context of the Great War, without basis as an obligation for arming Lhasa to forestall Chinese mischief. In 1919, the Tibetan chief minister evocatively expressed his concern that Tibet would find itself abandoned “like tiny fledglings on an open plain.” [Spence, pg. 48] 
As for China, instead of returning to negotiations and acquiescing to “suzerainity” over a virtually independent Tibet–an arrangement it was perhaps only pretending to countenance before it backed out at Simla, when China was flat on its back and the Raj was at its zenith—it preferred to mass troops on Tibet’s Sichuan frontier and agitate for direct engagement with Lhasa. 
It soon became apparent that China was, shall we say, the “rising power” in the Himalayan regions, the British were the “declining power”, and it became a matter of considerable anxiety in Lhasa that China was piling up troops in the eastern marches and the Tibetan government was being forced to confront these forces without any significant military or diplomatic support from Great Britain. 
Faced with niggardly and tardy provision of guns and ammunition by Great Britain, Lhasa began playing footsie with Russia and Japan via Mongolia to pursue the supply of arms; amazingly, Great Britain was able to veto these initiatives thanks to the special position in Tibetan security affairs it had negotiated bilaterally at Simla. 
The Tibetan government came to understand that the Simla Convention and the idea that Britain had the sincerity and capacity to protect Tibet against China were, at best, on life support. 
By 1936, a British political officer reported on the mood in Lhasa as follows: 
They regarded the adjustment of the Tibet-Indian boundary as part and parcel of the general adjustment and determination of boundaries contemplated in the 1914 Convention. If they could, with our help, secure a definite Sino-Tibetan boundary they would of course be glad to observe the Indo-Tibetan border as defined in 1914… [Maxwell, 59] 
With Simla moribund, the McMahon Line was never demarcated on the ground and as a result it never acquired any customary force as a precedent. 
Notably, there were no serious efforts to assert effective British rule in the remote tribal reaches of the McMahon line, or even over Tawang until the 1930s. Then, with the Japanese menace replacing Russia as the focus of the Great Britain’s anxieties concerning northern encroachment, the Raj adopted a policy which might be characterized as “F*ck Tibet”: unilaterally extending British control northwards without reference to the original and unrealized vision of backing Tibet in return for the trade and territorial privileges that Great Britain had negotiated two decades before. 
At this point, Olaf Caroe enters the picture. Caroe was a key official in the British Raj and an enthusiastic geopolitical strategist. In 1935, Tibetan authorities in Tawang arrested a British spy/botanist and the government in Lhasa made the decision, unwise in retrospect, to issue a protest to the British authorities and thereby bring Lhasa’s claims to Tawang to Caroe’s attention. 
In response, Caroe pulled off a rather notorious subterfuge in order to buttress the British claim to Tawang: he published the Simla Convention for the first time in 1938 with a note misrepresenting that it had included settlement of the border (and alienation of Tawang); and he arranged for the publication of official Survey of India maps that, for the first time, showed the McMahon Line as the official boundary. To advance the narrative, he also corresponded with commercial atlas publishers to put the McMahon Line on their maps as well. 
In a telling indication of Caroe’s jiggery-pokery, to avoid the awkward question of why he was first publishing the Simla Convention twenty-four years after the fact in 1938, he instead arranged for the surreptitious printing of a spurious back-dated edition of Aitchison , deleting the original note about the Chinese government’s non-signature, and replacing it with a lengthy note stating, quite falsely, that “The [Simla] Convention included a definition of boundaries…” 
Since 1) the McMahon Line had been concluded in secret bilateral negotiations between Tibet and Great Britain outside the Convention and 2) the Chinese had officially refused to recognize any bilateral agreement, boundary or otherwise, between Tibet and Great Britain and 3) had declined to sign the Simla Convention itself and 4) had notified Great Britain in 1914 that the specific sticking point was “the boundaries” this was hoo-hah. 
The replacement copy was distributed to various libraries with instructions to withdraw and destroy the original edition. 
The subterfuge was only discovered in 1963 when J.A. Addis, a British diplomat, discovered a surviving copy of the original edition at Harvard and compared it to Caroe’s version. 
That was too late for Nehru, who apparently sincerely accepted Caroe’s maps as holy writ i.e. the accurate depiction of borders that had been trilaterally negotiated at Simla, published, openly acknowledged, and a moral imperative and worthy object of Indian military defense in 1962. 
It was also too late for Harvard’s own John Kenneth Galbraith, who as ambassador to India successfully lobbied President Kennedy to declare the McMahon Line as India’s recognized border, apparently as part of his campaign to support India and elevate the PRC-India conflict beyond the mundane sphere of “clash over disputed border” to “Chicom aggression against India”. 
In response to Galbraith’s urgings, President Kennedy overrode the concerns of the State Department and the vociferous objections of Chiang Kai-shek on Taiwan (the government of China in 1962 as far as the US was concerned) to give Galbraith the leeway to announce “The McMahon Line is the accepted international border and is sanctioned by modern usage. Accordingly we regard it as the northern border of the [North East Frontier Agency] region.” 
Well, “accepted international border sanctioned by modern usage” is something of a stretch. As noted above, not only the Chinese but the Tibetan government of the 1930s, itself to be extinguished by the Chinese in 1959, regarded the McMahon Line as a dead letter. 
In discussions with Nehru in the 1950s, Zhou Enlai had made the rather telling statement that “he had never heard of the McMahon Line”. The Chinese government only understood the full extent of the boundary understandings between the Tibetan and British governments in 1914 after the PLA seized documents in the Potala Palace during the 1959 invasion, and Zhou subsequently declared the McMahon Line a piece of imperial fraud. Imperial historians—Addis, Maxwell, and Lamb–had the opportunity to examine British records a few years later, when the fifty-year embargo on government records expired, and agreed with Zhou. 
The revelation of these contacts made a good case for de facto Tibetan independence between the two world wars; unfortunately, they also at the same time clearly demonstrated that the Chinese government had never been party to them, or to the McMahon Line. 
Much has been made in Indian and Tibetan nationalist circles of Zhou Enlai’s willingness to use the McMahon Line as the basis for a border settlement between India and the PRC. However, this had nothing to do with any acknowledgment of the legitimacy of the line (which, after all, had never been demarcated in the field) and perhaps had something to do with the fact that, as the 1962 war demonstrated, the task of defending the McMahon Line on the edge of the Tibetan plateau is a tremendous strategic burden for India. 
The truth about the legal and military aspects of the 1962 Sino-Indian War are, I would venture, still a matter of denial and disinformation, especially in India. The Henderson-Brooks Report, which details the strategic and operational failings of the Indian military establishment in 1962, has never been declassified, despite Prime Minister Modi’s previous promises in that regard; only portions of it are in the public domain thanks to Neville Maxwell, who somehow got his hands on a copy. 
Asserting the purported sanctity of the McMahon Line (and Chinese perfidy in refusing to honor it) is a staple of the patriotic narrative. 
In its combination of nationalist posturing and pseudo-historical bullsh*t, the Indian position on the McMahon Line bookends the PRC’s claims in the South China Sea in interesting ways. 
And, of course, the United States, as part of its pro-India/anti-China tilt is more interested in enabling the myths of the McMahon Line than supporting resolution of the Sino-Indian border dispute through equitable negotiation.

Accuracy in Media 
I missed a few losers in my column on the big media losers of the 2016 campaign. One person told me, “Bret Stephens of The Wall Street Journal has totally lost all credibility with his anti-Trump rants in his weekly column right up to the very end. We used to be ardent fans of his, but no more!!!” 
I agree that Stephens is a big loser. His attacks on Trump were relentless and he declared that he wanted to build a new political party to compete with Trump. Sounding like The Huffington Post, Stephens used his November 8 column to find Trump guilty of “unrelenting and apparently irrepressible bigotry, misogyny, bullying and conspiracy-mongering…” 
After the election, his readers responded with comments like: YOU ARE FIRED! Deep breaths Bret. You’ll be ok. MSNBC has several openings on their Jobs page, Bret. Stephens, you have climbed out on a limb and sawed it off. Best way to handle Stephens is to NOT read his columns anymore. That’s my solution to George Will also. Eventually, they will be fired. 
Speaking of The Huffington Post, consider these post-election headlines from the online publication: “Why HuffPost’s Presidential Forecast Didn’t See A Donald Trump Win Coming. Here’s how we blew it and what we’re doing to prevent a repeat.” 
But no resignations or firings were announced, and Stephens will also apparently keep his job. 
Journalists and columnists should not be fired for their opinions, but for their lack of objectivity. It’s fine to have anti-Trump opinions, but that should not have interfered with an analysis of why Trump was striking a chord with the American people. 
My own views of Trump changed as I saw how the people were responding to him. One good source was Right Side Broadcasting , which aired live coverage of Trump rallies. Their broadcasts captured the size of the crowds. I saw Trump’s appearance in the heavily-Democratic city of Toledo, Ohio, where he was greeted by enthusiasm. I also took trips to states like Pennsylvania and saw the dozens of “Trump for President” signs. My July 29 column, “ Democrats Abandon Workers to Trump ,” looked at how the Democratic Party had abandoned the working class. My column on the eve of the election examined how “people power” could guarantee a Trump victory. 
These Trump supporters were not serial liars, rampant xenophobes, racists, misogynists, etc. They were ordinary people who were sick and tired of the liberal establishment. 
By contrast, the elitist Bret Stephens wrote about the Trump rallies, “The fervor of his crowds recalls Nasser’s Egypt.” Stephens had nothing but contempt for the average American. 
The problem with people like Stephens and publications like The Huffington Post is that they let their anti-Trump orientation interfere with the need for a professional analysis of what was actually happening in America’s cities and towns. 
One Huffington Post writer with egg on his face is Ryan Grim, who was promoting the bogus story that Trump had raped a 13-year-old girl. Regarding the rape story, Grim informed his readers on November 2 that “a woman who says Trump raped her as a 13-year-old in the 1990s is planning a press conference at 6:00 EST today. I coincidentally was working on a piece explaining why this case has gotten so little coverage.” 
It got little coverage because it was false. 
The woman, who had a history of drug abuse, pulled out of the news conference. She was identified by name and dropped the lawsuit. The allegations were obviously fabricated. 
Grim also promoted the publication’s inaccurate predictions, saying on November 8, “Our final forecast is that she’ll [Hillary will] win 323 electoral votes, far more than the 270 she needs to win. According to our model, she’ll win Florida, North Carolina and New Hampshire, and that’ll be that. Early night.” 
The story by Natalie Jackson of The Huffington Post about how the publication totally botched coverage of the campaign admits the magnitude of the mistake: “Our model predicted that Democrat Hillary Clinton had a 98 percent chance of being elected. That was more pro-Clinton than most other forecast models (although all of them predicted a Clinton win). Our model said five Senate seats would shift from Republican to Democratic, giving Democrats a likely majority.” 
But nobody in the media loses their jobs for getting the facts wrong and doing their work in an unprofessional manner. 
What’s more, we see the same left-wing pundits and reporters on networks like CNN coming back for more, giving viewers more slanted coverage and commentary disguised as news. Consider “former” communist Van Jones using CNN to accuse Trump supporters of being white racists. The same old liberal talking heads are currently trying to dictate the make-up of Trump’s cabinet and staff by warning against certain people deemed too conservative or “controversial.” 
James O’Keefe of Project Veritas comments that millions overcame “the firewall that existed within the media.” That partly occurred because of his undercover videos that led to resignations by Democratic operatives. In a post-election video , he explained that the most stunning admission of election night was “the power shift in this country,” as citizens exercised their power, “despite the overwhelming forces working them against them.” 
We can see that, as a result of the media’s failure to clean house, those who opposed Trump will not give up their power. Since they have shown that they have no professional standards, the only answer is to further drain the media elite of viewers and readers, and build up the power of alternative sources of news and information. 
Any ordinary business that got things so wrong and performed so incompetently would go out of business. Let’s help the liberal media bite the dust. Cliff Kincaid

17383,"John Carney on Dow 20,000: ‘There’s a Sort of Hope Reborn’ After Trump’s Election","Veteran financial journalist John Carney made his debut appearance as a Breitbart News commentator on Thursday’s edition of Breitbart News Daily to discuss the historic rise of the Dow Jones average above 20, 000 points. [Carney cheerfully veered off topic five seconds into his talk with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow, expressing his fascination with the current discussion of voter fraud, and wondering how anyone can claim there is “no evidence” of a problem the authorities resolutely refuse to study in a serious way.  “How would they know whether there’s illegal voting, when you don’t have to show an ID?” he asked. “They say there’s no evidence. How would anybody know? Who’s been investigating? There’s no evidence because nobody’s been looking. ” “I vote here in New York. Nobody checks IDs. You just walk in, you give them your address, and you go on in and vote,” he said. “It would be really easy for there to be voter fraud. ” Marlow recalled the infamous  —   but evidently not infamous enough  —   incident in 2012 when an undercover filmmaker working for James O’Keefe was handed Attorney General Eric Holder’s ballot. “I cover Wall Street, and one thing we know about Wall Street  —   and it applies to everything  —   but when we make fraud really easy, fraud always happens,” Carney pointed out. “That’s a rule. If fraud is easy, fraud occurs. ” Marlow noted that while the media obsess over President Trump’s claim that millions of illegal votes were cast in the 2016 election, the Dow hit 20, 000, and everything “seems to be going Trump’s way. ” “And now he’s got the media focused on basically defending themselves for not covering this widespread fraud, and it’s a fraud not just in a literal sense, but also in the figurative sense, that the mainstream media has allowed this to happen because they have shown no interest in voter integrity,” Marlow said. “You would think this would be a huge story, but of course, it’s one that wasn’t in the interests of the mainstream media to cover, so they ignored it,” Carney agreed. “It’s yet another one of these stories that, I think, is going to wind up being one of the greatest unreported stories  —   that now we’ll get to the bottom of this. ” As Carney has assumed the lead role in Breitbart News’ financial and economic coverage, Marlow was most eager for his thoughts on the historic stock market high. “It’s a big deal. It’s a big milestone that reminds us how far we’ve come, just since election week,” Carney said. “The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 9. 5 percent just since Election Day, which is a big deal. ” “Just to give a sense, on average, the SP  —   which is a broader index, the SP 500, more stocks  —   is up about 7. 4 percent. On average, it’s about 7 percent a year,” he noted. “In just a couple of months since Election Day, we’re up what we usually do in about a year. Investors are very excited about the changes they see coming. ” As Marlow observed, this is the exact opposite of what many in the press predicted would occur after Trump won the election. “I’m divided in my own mind about whether it was just pure scare tactics or the bias of both the press and a lot of economists,” Carney said. “There were very prominent economists who were saying if Donald Trump is elected, the stock market will fall ten, fifteen percent. Beforehand, I understood this didn’t make any sense, and there were some of us out there saying no, why would the stock market fall? It will rise if you get a guy who’s going to pare back government regulation and cut taxes. ”  “This is actually what we’re seeing now,” he asserted. “There’s a sort of hope reborn. Economists are actually now moving up their economic expectations. Everybody from the Federal Reserve now expects the economy to grow a little bit faster. The International Monetary Fund, of all places, has said they think under Trump, the economy will grow faster. ”  “Investors had gotten very used to the idea that projections about where the economy was going were going to keep being lower and lower and lower,” he explained. “Ever since the great financial crisis, we would begin each year with some sort of rosy expectations, and then everybody would say, “Oh no, it’s going to be worse.’ For the first time in a long time, we’re actually seeing people move up their economic expectations. When it comes to the stock market, that translates into investors seeing more upsides than downsides. ”  “In other words, people are willing to look at the future and say, ‘You know what? I think the risk is that we do better than we thought, rather than worse, which translates into higher stock prices.’ The   term for this is just: people have hope again,” Carney said. Carney said Trump’s proposed tax cuts were one of the major policy initiatives driving this sense of renewed optimism in the markets. “If you cut the corporate tax rate, that just translates directly into higher earnings for companies,” he noted. “Another is the possibility of companies being able to move,” he continued. “You know, we’ve been hearing for years about how companies hold all this money abroad because they’re afraid to repatriate it, reinvest it in the U. S. economy, because they’re going to get a big tax hit. Well, if we cut taxes, a lot of that money can come back, get reinvested in expanding business in the U. S. which means more jobs, and, more importantly, better jobs for the American people. When the American people have better jobs, that means they can spend more, buy more, save more, and invest more. So there’s a sort of virtuous cycle going on here where that pushes up stocks. ” Carney also saluted Trump’s cabinet picks as being people who don’t “see business as the enemy. ” “These are guys who think that one of the things we need to do is remove some of the regulatory barriers that stand in the way of Americans expanding their businesses, starting their own businesses. That is really helping fuel this enthusiasm about the economy, and, therefore, about the stock market,” he said. Marlow pointed out that Trump has been criticized precisely for putting “too many Wall Street guys” in his cabinet, making it look like “a Goldman boardroom. ” “There’s something funny about that, right?” Carney responded. “A lot of the guys who they say are Wall Street guys or Goldman guys haven’t been on Wall Street or at Goldman for a long time. Steve Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary nominee, he hasn’t touched Goldman Sachs for a long time. A guy very familiar to Breitbart people, Steve Bannon  —   yeah, he was at Goldman at one point, but that was ages ago. So a little bit of that is phony. ”  “There are guys actually direct from Goldman, like Gary Cohn was president, he was the number two guy at Goldman. You know what? I think that it’s actually a sign of, rather than Donald Trump being sort of   by Wall Street, Wall Street being   by Donald Trump,” he mused.  “In other words, Goldman wasn’t a friend of Donald Trump’s before he got elected, but now these guys are saying, ‘You know what? Let’s be a part of what’s happening in the American economy. This is a really exciting time. I want to be a part of this.’ So I welcome it,” he said. “Rather than standing in opposition, I think there was a lot of fatalism,” Carney theorized. “People said, ‘Yeah, we’re going to get on Hillary Clinton’s side because we think it’s just going to be another eight years of Obama followed by the Clintons.’ They see change in the air, and they say, ‘You know what? Let’s get on board. ’” Carney anticipated that markets would “continue to go higher. ” “After we hit 20, 000 yesterday, we stayed above 20, 000. We’re set to go even higher today,” he pointed out. “Today is my birthday, so I look at this almost as a birthday gift for me. We’re going to open for the first time higher than 20, 000 on my birthday, and it’s largely because we elected a guy who is going to improve the American economy, and it’s going to just keep happening. It’s a very helpful sign, not just for investors. Investors are enthusiastic because they believe the economy is getting better. We’ve thrown off the slow growth of the last eight years, and we’re set for something better. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern.

17384,Is Robert Mugabe on his deathbed? UK planning for transition phase in Zimbabwe,"Zimbabwe Daily — Oct 29, 2016 
LORD Peter Mandelson has warned the UK Government that an “endgame” was underway in Zimbabwe giving two examples of how the “crisis” will play out. 
Mr Mandelson, the chair of Lazard International investment bank, told British civil servants the Zimbabwean dictator is preparing an “endgame” for the country, suggesting he believes he is close to being on his death bed. 
One of the creators of New Labour under Tony Blair, Mr Mandelson visited the country in February for business and civil purposes, he claims. 
However he later became embroiled in a lobbying row after Mr Mugabe’s finance minister Patrick Chinamasa flew to London to discuss a bail-out plan for the country. 
Mr Mugabe’s regime was apparently attempting to borrow $1.1 billion (£900m) facilitated by the peer’s bank. 
Now it can be revealed that Mr Mandelson sent a letter to the UK Government giving them advice on how they should approach their diplomatic relations with the country. 
And he warned that the country needs “encouragement, debt restructuring, and an injection of additional liquidity” just a few months before he met the Zimbabwean government minister to discuss the bail out. 
In the letter to the Parliamentary Secretary of State at the Foreign Office Mr Mandelson also discussed the country’s “corruption.” 
He wrote: “The most immediate danger is that the supply of cash dollars is drying up and there is a danger of banking failure and a liquidity crisis with consequent impact on the functioning of the whole economy.” 
Mr Mandelson issued a statement to a British newspaper in August about his trip in which he denied he was advising the Zimbabwean government. 
The spokesman said he was there to meet “representatives of the business community and civil society to encourage them to continue the process of reform”. 
However it can now be revealed he decided to inform the UK civil servants he believes Mr Mugabe is at a point where an “endgame is underway.” 
The partially redacted Freedom of Information requests do not highlight who Mr Mandelson met but clearly point to “political factions.” 
He wrote: “Any discussions of business – or indeed most aspects of life – was inevitably a discussion of politics and the intense speculation and manoeuvring over the succession to President Mugabe is dominating. Armed police surround a protester in Harare, Zimbabwe on Monday, July, 4, 2016. Click to enlarge 
“It is clear that the endgame is underway, and the battle is being vociferously played out in the Zimbabwean press. 
“Less clear is how it will end and who will prevail – and whether it will play out while the president is still alive.” 
Mr Mugabe who is 92 recently appeared in public to open a school, following rumours of his death , and has maintained he will retain his grip on the country until he dies. 
In 2008 Mr Mugabe was stripped of his British Knighthood despite opposition from Mr Mandelson’s then Labour colleagues Gordon Brown and Lord Malloch Brown, the Foreign Office Minister. 
Now Mr Mandelson appears to have warned the British government of a “crisis that threatens to unfold soon” hinting that the international community must “establish the right incentives for reformers.” 
Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, has led the former British colony since independence in 1980. 
His critics say he has presided over the destruction of a once-promising country with policies such as the seizures of white-owned farms. 
But Mugabe’s ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front party blames foreign powers for sabotaging the economy with sanctions. 
Mugabe’s government has experienced increasingly bad cash shortages over the past seven years since abandoning its own currency in a bid to end hyperinflation. 
The Zimbabwean dollar was abandoned after Mugabe ordered 1,000billion Zimbabwean dollar notes to be printed, quickly becoming worthless and black market US dollars taking over before becoming the southern African country’s official currency in 2009. 
Much of Zimbabwe’s industrial companies have had to close down due to demands white-owned businesses hand over 51 per cent to black Zimbabweans, high taxes and labour laws which make it almost impossible to sack anybody, all under Mr Mugabe’s rules. 
The highly controversial eviction of white farmers has meant nearly every supermarket product is imported, unlike 15 years ago when most produce was locally sourced. 
Protests have marred the dictator’s leadership this year, with workers across the country taking part in a “shut down” strike in July – the biggest protests since April 20017 when opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai led anti-Mugabe demonstrations.",0
17385,WaPo: Jared Kushner Now a ’Focus’ in Russia Investigation - Breitbart,"A week after reporting a significant “person of interest” is the focus of the investigation of possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, the Washington Post revealed on Thursday that the person is Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s    and senior adviser.

17386,"Floyd Mayweather Next Fight: 'Money' Considering Manny Pacquiao, Canelo Alvarez? - Morning News USA","Comment 
Floyd Mayweather Jr. insisted that the only reason he attended the Pacquiao vs Vargas fight was so that he could take his daughter to see the match. Boxing pundits think there’s more to the story than meets the eye. 
Mayweather retired from boxing after his 12-round domination of Andre Berto in September 2015. His record currently stands at 49-0. He shares that feat with boxing legend Rocky Marciano. 
Many believe Mayweather is too ambitious to turn down a shot at 50-0. The five-division world champion even left the door open for a comeback fight, but only if the price is right. 
“Right now, I’m happy on this side, but I’ve been talking and you just never know,” he told The Telegraph . “If I came back, of course, it would have to be a nine-figure payday and probably a championship fight and a nine-figure payday.”

There are only two names in boxing today that could make Mayweather’s comeback fight a reality: Manny Pacquiao and Canelo Alvarez. Both have lost to Mayweather in the past and have been grumbling for a rematch ever since. 
Pacquiao is emerging as the clear-cut favorite. The Filipino icon is fresh off his unanimous decision victory against Jessie Vargas for the WBO welterweight title. 
Top Rank CEO Bob Arum stated that negotiations for a Mayweather vs Pacquiao rematch would be easier this time around since most of the legal work have already been ironed out before the first fight, Boxing News Online reported.

Pacquiao is also doing his part in building hype for the possible rematch. He hasn’t been a tad shy about wanting to fight Mayweather next. 
Just recently, Pacquiao posted a strong hint on Instagram that he could be set for a second go around with Mayweather. The first-term senator showed of his new jacket, which featured a sewn image of him on the right inner pocket and an image of Mayweather on the left inner pocket. 
Pacquiao then asked his followers, “Like my jacket?” Only time will tell if his sleek coat is an accurate omen of things to come.

17387,Currency Crisis: Alasdair MacLeod On The Vexed Question of the Dollar,"Tweet Home » Gold » Gold News » Currency Crisis: Alasdair MacLeod On The Vexed Question of the Dollar There is little doubt that the rapid expansion of both dollar-denominated debt and monetary quantities since the financial crisis will lead us into a currency crisis. We just don’t know when, and the dollar is not alone… 

From Alasdair Macleod : All the major paper currencies have been massively inflated in recent years. With the dollar acting as the world’s reserve currency, where the dollar goes, so do all the other fiat monies . Until that cataclysmic event, we watch currencies behave in increasingly unexpected, seemingly irrational ways. The fundamentals for Japan are not good, yet the yen remains the strongest currency of the big four. The Eurozone risks a systemic collapse, overwhelmed by political and financial headwinds, yet the euro’s exchange rate has proved relatively impervious to this deep uncertainty. The British economy is strongest, yet sterling is the weakest of the four majors. If nothing else, today’s foreign exchanges are evidence that subjectivity triumphs over macroeconomic thinking. Mackay’s Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds beats computer modelling every time. Furthermore, any official attempt to establish a rate for the dollar has to address two separate questions: the value of the dollar relative to other currencies, and its purchasing power for goods and services. The chart below indicates how the dollar has behaved against other currencies over the last five years, both on a trade weighted and on a predefined currency basis (DXY). It should be noted that the dollar has risen on both these measures by roughly 18% since early 2014. At the same time, the Chinese yuan has fallen against the dollar by about 12%, so it has actually risen slightly against the DXY basket as a whole, particularly against the euro component, where it has gained 12% since early 2014. This matters, because far from devaluing, which is what we are routinely told by dollar-centric analysts, the yuan has been relatively stable over time against a basket of currencies. It has been weak against the dollar and yen, but strong against both the euro and sterling. We should look at this from the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee’s point of view. America runs a record trade deficit with China, and the only major economies where China’s terms of trade have improved are with the US, excepting Japan . Therefore, the Fed is bound to be very sensitive to the dollar’s exchange rate with China’s yuan Furthermore, on two occasions when the Fed had signalled it was going to raise the Fed Funds Rate, it backed off when the Chinese lowered the rate at which it had pegged the yuan to the dollar. Chinese devaluation against the dollar is obviously a prime concern for the Fed. The situation becomes better understood when the Peoples Bank’s position is taken into account. The bank has been selling US Treasury stock in large quantities, stockpiling commodities and oil with the proceeds, though it has been diversifying into Japanese Government bonds as well. China’s dollars have been welcomed by markets, which are short of both quality collateral and raw currency. However, China’s supply of both has failed to stop the dollar rising against the yuan. Furthermore, China isn’t the only Asian and Middle Eastern state selling American paper, so the demand from other international players on the buy side has been immense, enough to determine the underlying direction of the dollar’s exchange rate. The situation is being exploited by the Peoples Bank. In effect, the Peoples Bank is in a position to dictate Fed policy by adjusting the rate at which it is prepared to supply dollars into the market. So long as the dollar remains fundamentally strong, it only has to slow the pace of Treasury and dollar sales for the dollar to rise, and therefore the Fed’s planned interest rate rises to be deferred. This is not understood properly by western commentators, who erroneously think China is being forced to defend a declining yuan. Nothing could be further from the truth. It will be interesting to see whether this happens again ahead of the December FOMC meeting, when for the umpteenth time we have been promised a rise in the Fed Funds Rate. A major consideration behind China’s foreign exchange policy is the outlook for the euro. The Eurozone represents a market as large as the US, with the added importance of being tagged onto the Asian continent. There can be little doubt that China sees her own long-term future being aligned more with Europe than America, despite Europe’s current troubles. It is, if you like, a situation that is primarily of strategic importance. Europe’s economy will need rescuing at some stage, and is therefore a future opportunity for China’s intervention. That plan is for the long term, and becomes increasingly valid the deeper the hole the Eurozone digs for itself. A disintegration of the EU would also be beneficial for Chinese ambitions. Meanwhile, in the short-term the euro has broken a crucial trend-line against the dollar, having completed a continuation head-and-shoulders pattern, targeting the 1.0600 area, which is the previous low seen in March and November 2015. This is our second chart. Neither the Peoples Bank nor the Fed need to be chart experts to see what’s happening. Brexit was very bad news for the euro, because it is a racing certainty that the event will turn out to be just the start of a new round of political and economic trouble for the Eurozone. The Italian economy in particular is imploding, with a non-performing loan problem that is roughly 40% of private sector GDP. So China can for the moment steer a course for the yuan between the euro’s devaluation and the dollar’s rise. The Fed sees in euro weakness an increase of currency-induced deflation for the US economy, and a loss of competitiveness for US exports. Chinese exporters are obvious beneficiaries as well, so the blame for deflation will be on China’s foreign exchange machinations. Anyway, China probably cares less than she ever did about the long-term consequences of her actions on the US economy. China has been selling her US Treasuries and reducing her dollar exposure to add to her stockpiles of raw materials and oil. She wants to keep her over-indebted businesses trading by maintaining a favourable exchange rate with the dollar, particularly given the developing train wreck that’s the Eurozone. And there’s not a lot the Fed can do about it. Gold and commodities The principal driver for the gold price is the prospect of monetary inflation transmuting into price inflation, and the inability of central banks to respond to this threat by raising interest rates sufficiently to control the balance of consumer preferences between goods and holding money. We are, of course, measuring gold in dollars, because the latter is the reserve currency for all the others. But, as stated above, there are two exchange considerations, the first being the dollar against other currencies, and the second the dollar against a basket of commodities. And here, we should note that over the long-term, the prices of commodities measured in gold are considerably more stable than the prices of commodities measured in fiat currencies. China has behaved as if she is thoroughly aware of gold’s pricing attributes, and has a deliberate policy of dominating the market for bullion. This is very different from the US’s domination of gold paper markets. Not only has China invested in unprofitable gold mines to become the largest producer at about 450 tonnes annually, but the state monopolises China’s refining capacity. She also imports doré for refining from other countries, and without doubt since 1983 has accumulated substantial quantities of bullion not included in monetary reserves. Furthermore, it is the only country that has encouraged its population, through television and other media, to accumulate physical gold. Make no mistake, for the last thirty-three years, the Chinese government has made a credible attempt to gain ultimate control over the physical gold market, and to extend gold’s protection to her own citizens. China does not manipulate the gold price. Instead, as described earlier, she is manipulating the dollar by regulating the exchange rate and by discouraging the Fed from raising interest rates. It is a temporary balancing act that only continues so long as desperate banks and their indebted borrowers continue to scramble for dollars, and China knows it. The Fed, for the moment, appears to be powerless to manage economic outcomes and is firmly trapped by China’s currency management, with interest rates stuck at the lower bound. And to make it worse, the weak euro, against which the dollar index (DXY) is very heavily weighted (57%!), threatens to force the DXY index even higher. The result, inevitably, is that monetary policy cannot be used to address future price inflation, which virtually guarantees there will be a higher gold price in 2017 and beyond. This is why, despite American wishful thinking, gold remains at the centre of the financial system. It is central partly because China’s ensures it is, and it is also China’s ultimate money for commodity and trade purposes. China most likely has enough gold to fully compensate for her reserve losses from the destruction of the dollar and the other fiat currencies on her reserve book. She is deliberately selling down her dollar exposure anyway, while she can. Lest we forget, communist economists in China were taught that capitalism destroys itself. For them, there is no clearer proof than the performance of the US economy and the dollar, and they do not intend to get caught up in its demise. Understand this, and you understand all. While the monetary role of gold in the future has yet to be determined by China, and it will be China or the markets that make the decision, for the moment it can be regarded as the ultimate insurance against global currency failure.",0
17388,"A Year After Earthquake, Nepal’s Recovery Is Just Beginning - The New York Times","SANKHU, Nepal  —   As the anniversary of Nepal’s devastating earthquake came and went last week, Tilakmananda Bajracharya peered up at the mountainside temple his family has tended for 13 generations, wondering how long it would remain upright. The temple walls, which shook violently for more than a minute during the earthquake, are now split by fat, snaking cracks. Rescue workers braced the building’s sides with wooden planks last year, said Mr. Bajracharya, the temple’s priest, but they will snap as soon as the next large earthquake hits. “Nothing will remain,” he said. “We will live with the consequences. ” Seeing the face of a foreigner last week, the priest brightened. Many people here pin their hopes on promises of foreign aid: After the disaster, images of collapsed temples and stoic villagers in a sea of rubble were beamed around the world, and donors came forward with pledges of $4. 1 billion in foreign grants and soft loans. But those promises, so far, have not done much to speed the progress of Nepal’s reconstruction effort. Outside Kathmandu, the capital, many towns and villages remain choked with rubble, as if the earthquake had happened yesterday. The government, hampered by red tape and political turmoil, has only begun to approve projects. Nearly all of the pledged funds remain in the hands of the donors, unused. The delay is misery for the 770, 000 households awaiting a promised subsidy to rebuild their homes. Because a yearly stretch of bad weather begins in June,   rebuilding is unlikely to begin before early 2017, consigning families to a second monsoon season and a second winter in leaky shelters made of zinc sheeting. Veterans of immense relief efforts in Haiti and after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami say it is normal for spending to remain low for the first year after a disaster, then ramp up gradually after detailed surveys and construction standards are in place. And since the earthquake, which killed almost 9, 000 people, other problems have besieged Nepal, including violent protests over the passage of a new Constitution and a blockade of fuel imports from India that lasted four and a half months. Still, some visitors who came here to assess the reconstruction expressed shock at how little had been done. In March, a German lawmaker, Dagmar Wöhrl, publicly warned Nepal’s leaders that private donations to foundations and nongovernmental organizations would no longer be available if Nepal did not use the aid soon. She said it was the first time in her seven years as the head of Parliament’s economic development committee that she had given such a warning. “I had the feeling that someone has to raise a voice and give an input from outside, because time is running out,” Ms. Wöhrl said in an interview. “It does not help a single Nepalese if there are millions of dollars of donation money on charity accounts. The money has to be invested now. ” Others urged patience, saying the effort had shown signs of picking up steam. “Compared to where we were six months ago,” said Renaud Meyer, country director for the United Nations Development Program, “we’ve moved at thunderstorm lightning speed. ” Sites like the ancient, battered town of Sankhu were a major reason foreign donors came forward so readily. Just before noon on April 25, the earthquake, with a magnitude of 7. 8, sent   brick buildings crashing into the streets, crushing 45 people and destroying 1, 200 homes.   temples sacred to Hindus and Buddhists tumbled down the hillsides. Mr. Bajracharya, the priest, recalled struggling to stay on his feet as the ground beneath the Bajrayogini Temple lurched violently, and then scrambling out of the complex to get clear of a storm of falling bricks. “I myself surrendered,” he said. “I concluded that I was not going to live. ” Relief efforts kept pace during the weeks after the disaster, when half a million homeless families received about $140 in emergency aid. The good will reached Sankhu: By summertime, a foreign country had promised $570, 000 to rebuild Bajrayogini and surrounding structures, said Christian Manhart, who represents Unesco, the United Nations cultural heritage agency, in Nepal. That early progress then halted. Leaders swung their attention to the   adoption of the country’s first Constitution, and its division of power infuriated ethnic communities in the south. Bloody clashes between protesters and the police ensued, and Indian border crossings shut down, leading to acute shortages of fuel and building supplies. Parliament did not pass a law creating the National Reconstruction Authority until December. By then, friction had begun mounting between the government, which preferred foreign grants to be deposited directly into its budget, and donors, who complained of excessive red tape and often preferred to work through nongovernmental organizations. Until April, the government refused to allow international organizations to use their funds to begin building permanent housing, saying it wanted to control the standards. “We are always dancing a little bit on the volcano,” Mr. Manhart said of international donors. “We have the feeling we should assist the government in doing the reconstruction in a better way, but on the other side is inherited sensitivity not to intervene too much. ” In January, Mr. Manhart said, the country that had promised to rebuild the Bajrayogini Temple informed Unesco that the grant had been withdrawn because of budget cuts. He would not identify the country. He said that Unesco had found a new benefactor, but that the slow pace of work had clearly tempered donors’ enthusiasm. The Nepali authorities say they must maintain control over the actions of nongovernmental organizations and foreign donors. Bhishma K. Bhusal, an under secretary of the reconstruction authority, said some nongovernmental organizations had used relief funds “to distribute Bibles and Qurans and the Gita, when the people needed food and shelter. ” Other donors, he said, sent costly but unnecessary aid, like sniffer dogs and unusable helicopters. “We didn’t want to make Nepal like Haiti, where more than $14 billion has been spent, but still people are living in tents,” he said. Mr. Bhusal acknowledged that the reconstruction agency remained weak, with more than half of its 208 positions unfilled, because civil servants were refusing to accept transfers to an overloaded,   division. The agency is struggling to spend its own, largely   budget before the end of the fiscal year, and the office has a ghostly feeling, with rows of empty cubicles and some swivel chairs still wrapped in plastic. “We don’t sleep more than four hours a night,” he said. Reconstruction spending was set to increase steeply, Mr. Bhusal said, as 329, 000 homeless families  —   promised a sum of 200, 000 rupees, or about $2, 000, for rebuilding  —   receive a first payment of about a quarter of that sum. Word of this has not reached the residents of Sankhu, many of whom remain crowded in   enclosures. “It has been a horrible year,” said Anju Shrestha, 36, whose shed stands on a site that once held a   brick house. A neighbor, Kanchhi Shrestha, guessed her age at about 75, based on a major earthquake that occurred two years before she was born. She pulled her skirt up to show feet splotchy with raw sores. “I will die in this shelter if they do not give me money,” she said. “I have nothing to eat. ” However, she added, it would be inappropriate for a person like her to demand assistance from Nepal’s government. “We cannot scold the government,” she said. “If the government provides, we will fold our hands and tell them, ‘You are God.’ ”",0
17389,"Before The Great Flood 8 Kings Ruled Earth For 241,200 Years","“…In 5 cities 8 kings; they ruled for 241,200 years. Then the flood swept over…” that is written on the first part of the Sumerian King List. But how is it possible for eight kings to rule for a period of 241,200 years? 


If we take a look at the Sumerian King list, we will find fascinating details that contradict everything we have been told about our history. This ancient text describes a time on Earth when Gods ruled humankind for tens of thousands of years. It explicitly says that before the Great Flood swept across Earth, eight ancient kings lived on Earth and ruled for a total period of 241,200 years. Today, this historical fact is dismissed as mythology.

Many of us will agree that the most puzzling detail about the Sumerian King list is that it describes EIGHT kings who ruled over planet Earth for a total period of 241,200 years after the ORIGINAL kingship ‘descended from heaven’ lasting all the way until the ‘Great Flood’ which swept over mankind and once more “the kingship was lowered from heaven” after the Flood.

So how is this possible? What exactly are we missing here? How could eight kings have ruled over five cities for hundreds of thousands of years? Where they immortal? Were they otherworldly beings? Or is it possible that we misinterpreted years for days? Or, as many others believe, did these ancient kings really live through such lengthy reigns?


According to this ancient text its crystal clear: the first part of the Sumerian King List reads : 
After the kingship descended from heaven, the kingship was in Eridug. In Eridug, Alulim became king; he ruled for 28800 years. Alaljar ruled for 36000 years. 2 kings; they ruled for 64800 years. Then Eridug fell and the kingship was taken to Bad-tibira. In Bad-tibira, En-men-lu-ana ruled for 43200 years. En-men-gal-ana ruled for 28800 years. Dumuzid, the shepherd, ruled for 36000 years. 3 kings; they ruled for 108000 years. Then Bad-tibira fell (?) and the kingship was taken to Larag. In Larag, En-sipad-zid-ana ruled for 28800 years. 1 king; he ruled for 28800 years. Then Larag fell (?) and the kingship was taken to Zimbir. In Zimbir, En-men-dur-ana became king; he ruled for 21000 years. 1 king; he ruled for 21000 years. Then Zimbir fell (?) and the kingship was taken to Curuppag. In Curuppag, Ubara-Tutu became king; he ruled for 18600 years. 1 king; he ruled for 18600 years. In 5 cities 8 kings; they ruled for 241200 years. Then the flood swept over. 
There are more than a dozen of copies of Sumerian King Lists, found in Babylon, Susa, and Assyria, and the Royal Library of Nineveh from the VII century BC. All of these are believed to originate from one original list believed to have been written during the Third Dynasty of Ur or even earlier. The best-preserved specimen of the Sumerian King List is called the Weld-Blundell Prism, which is a clay, cuneiform inscribed vertical prism housed in the Ashmolean Museum.

17390,Intent on a Reckoning With Georgetown’s Slavery-Stained Past - The New York Times,"MARINGOUIN, La.  —   The rental car sped past acres of farmland and across a muddy bayou to an old plantation rippling with sugar cane. Stepping out was John J. DeGioia, the president of Georgetown University, who was on the most unusual journey of his tenure. Nearly two centuries ago, scores of slaves were shipped here in a sale that helped save Georgetown from financial ruin. Last month, Mr. DeGioia stood in the cane fields where they once labored, visited the cemetery where they buried their dead and met for hours with their descendants. Mr. DeGioia oversees one of the nation’s elite universities, managing more than 17, 500   students campuses in Washington and Doha, Qatar and an endowment of about $1. 5 billion. But on this scorching summer day, his mission was to help Georgetown begin the uneasy process of reckoning with its past. “I think all of us need to get it right this time,” Mr. DeGioia said as he stood beside Maxine Crump, whose    was sold in 1838 along with 271 other enslaved  . College presidents are increasingly grappling with the legacy of slavery as student protests and scholarly research illuminate how many universities participated in and profited from the domestic slave trade. In March, Harvard’s president described the institution as “directly complicit in America’s system of racial bondage” and days later commemorated four slaves who had worked in the households of two of its early leaders. In April, representatives from a consortium of nearly 20 colleges  —   including the University of Virginia, the College of William and Mary and Roanoke College  —   met to discuss their efforts to study and memorialize the enslaved blacks whose forced labor on campus had been mostly forgotten. The new initiatives have been greeted with both cheers and consternation. Some applaud efforts to bring a largely untold history to light. Others argue that the focus on the past exacerbates racial tensions on campuses and distracts from more pressing matters. “People said it’s not enough or it’s too late or there should have been a different take,” said Drew Gilpin Faust, the president of Harvard, describing the range of reactions to her proposals, which she said were generally well received. She has convened a committee of historians to identify university sites linked to this history and will host a national conference on universities and slavery next year. “What’s difficult about it is that we want this discussion to be one that ultimately unifies and doesn’t divide,” Dr. Faust said of the conundrum facing many of her peers. At Georgetown, founded by Jesuit priests in 1789, Mr. DeGioia contends that his university will not overcome its past without addressing and making amends for its role in slavery, which he often describes as the nation’s “original evil. ” Over the past several weeks, he has traveled to Spokane, Wash. New Orleans Baton Rouge, La. and the rural Louisiana community of Maringouin to meet with dozens of descendants of the slaves who were sold. He has also addressed alumni on the subject, convening a panel to discuss the efforts of his working group on slavery. The group spent months studying the university’s history and weighing whether Georgetown should apologize for profiting from slavery, create a memorial to the slaves and offer scholarships to their descendants, among other options. Historians believe this is the first time that the president of an elite university has met with the descendants of slaves who had labored on a college campus or were sold to benefit one. The working group’s report is expected to be released this summer. Several faculty members and administrators described the reaction to Mr. DeGioia’s efforts as overwhelmingly positive, pointing out that he is also creating the university’s first department of   studies and a center for researching racial injustice. “I think he’s a very moral man and I think he sees a moral obligation in this,” Maurice Jackson, a historian at the university and a member of the working group on slavery, said of Mr. DeGioia, who is a practicing Catholic. “He wanted us to get together, to effect change and to use the past to make the present better. ” But some alumni have voiced concern that by focusing on the wrongs of the 19th century, Mr. DeGioia is unnecessarily besmirching the reputation of a venerable institution. His decision to support student protesters and the members of his working group who called for renaming two buildings on campus raised eyebrows among some graduates. Even some members of his executive board, which supports Mr. DeGioia’s efforts to address Georgetown’s history, raised questions at first. The buildings had carried the names of the two Georgetown presidents who organized the slave sale in 1838. “People have had questions: Where are we going with this? Are we going to be changing the names of every building?” said Paul Tagliabue, the former commissioner of the National Football League and the vice chairman of the university’s board. Mr. Tagliabue, who described Mr. DeGioia as a leader who prides himself on building consensus, said the college president answered the questions. “Everyone gets it,” he said, referring to fellow board members. Mr. DeGioia, who at age 59 is Georgetown’s   president, said he knew there were lingering doubts among some alumni. “‘Why is there a need to resurface the pain and the agony of this part of our history? ’” he said, recalling their concerns. “‘Haven’t we moved beyond this? ’” But he said that the nation’s racial divisions, highlighted by the string of killings of black men by the police and persistent racial disparities, suggested that Americans have yet to come to terms with their roots in legalized discrimination and slavery. “I don’t think we can say we’ve sufficiently moved beyond it,” said Mr. DeGioia, who became the university’s first lay president in 2001. Georgetown relied on enslaved labor for decades. The Jesuit priests, who owned the slaves and ran the college, used their plantations in Maryland to help finance operations. And the institution’s portion of the slave sale’s profits  —   about $500, 000 in today’s dollars  —   helped pay off Georgetown’s debts. In August, Mr. DeGioia announced the creation of his working group and called for a campuswide discussion about slavery after reopening a building named after one of the early presidents involved in the slave sale. After student protests in November, a Georgetown alumnus, Richard J. Cellini, established the Georgetown Memory Project and hired a team of genealogists to identify and locate the descendants of the people who had been sold. Last month, dozens of those descendants gathered to meet with Mr. DeGioia. Some brought older relatives and photographs of grandparents and  . Ms. Crump and her siblings invited him to their family home here, where he fielded questions over cold lemonade and spicy jambalaya. “It means so much to me to have this door opened to my past,” Ms. Crump said. Most people welcomed him warmly, but there were also flashes of anger, Mr. DeGioia said, and some skepticism. Sandra Green Thomas, who met with Mr. DeGioia in New Orleans, noted that he was short on specifics about how  —   or whether  —   he would make tangible amends to descendants by offering them scholarships or financing other educational opportunities. “Is this a way to pat us on the head and send us on our way?” she wondered. “Or is this a way to do something really meaningful?” Mr. DeGioia said he was just beginning the process of engaging with families and addressing their concerns. He told the descendants that he hoped Georgetown could help reknit families torn apart by the sale, providing them with access to records about the Jesuit slaves in the university archives and possibly hosting a gathering of descendants on campus. Jessica Tilson wanted something more. She asked Mr. DeGioia to issue a declaration of posthumous manumission, granting the slaves their freedom. Then she handed him several jars of soil. She has been haunted in recent weeks by the knowledge that her      died without returning to their birthplace in Maryland. So she dug up soil from the old plantation here  —   symbols of her enslaved forbears  —   and asked him to help her ancestors get back home. Before he boarded his flight back to Washington, Mr. DeGioia shipped the jars to Georgetown.",0

17393,"Bernie Sanders Endorses Hillary Clinton, Hoping to Unify Democrats - The New York Times","PORTSMOUTH, N. H.  —   After 14 months of policy clashes and moments of disdain, Senator Bernie Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination on Tuesday, clearing away the last major obstacle to a united front for the party heading into its convention this month and the fall election. Yet for all the smiles and hugs between the former rivals here at their first joint rally, Mrs. Clinton’s next challenge was on vivid display as some Sanders supporters jeered her name and held signs saying “Won’t Vote Hillary” while Clinton partisans hissed “shhhh” and others chanted “unity. ” In the coming weeks, from Mrs. Clinton’s choice of a running mate to her convention speech, campaign commercials and overtures to Republicans, the 13 million voters who backed Mr. Sanders in the primary contests will be watching her for any hint of wavering from their progressive causes. Mrs. Clinton needs to convert many of these liberals and independents in states like New Hampshire and Wisconsin, which Mr. Sanders won and she wants to carry in November. And Mr. Sanders, in his remarks at the rally, signaled what may be her best hope of attracting them: drawing sharp contrasts between her and Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, so his admirers feel they have no choice but to support Mrs. Clinton. Dropping his portrayal of Mrs. Clinton as a captive of Wall Street billionaires and   interests, for instance, Mr. Sanders redirected those sorts of accusations to Mr. Trump, saying his proposed tax cuts would be a windfall to wealthy Americans. “His reckless economic policies will not only exacerbate income and wealth inequality, they would increase our national debt by trillions of dollars,” Mr. Sanders said. Standing beside him at Portsmouth High School, Mrs. Clinton beamed and applauded at first as Mr. Sanders spoke, but the two exuded little warmth and looked stiff  —   especially Mr. Sanders  —   as they waved to the audience and cameras. When he finished speaking, he reached out his hand to her, but Mrs. Clinton went in for a hug and a microphone caught her saying, “You were great, so great,” and “thank you so much. ” Then, in her appeal to his supporters, Mrs. Clinton sought to pick up his political mantle and pledged to overhaul Wall Street and the campaign finance system, two issues that Mr. Sanders largely left for her to address. “It is past time to end the stranglehold of wealthy special interests in Washington,” she said as Mr. Sanders smiled and clapped. Mrs. Clinton did not promise to forgo major donations herself, however: After the endorsement event she flew to New York for a private matinee performance of the hit Broadway musical “Hamilton” for donors who gave $2, 700 to $100, 000 to her campaign or the Democratic National Committee. She tried to strike the right notes, though, such as pledging to uphold “our progressive values. ” “You will always have a seat at the table when I am in the White House,” she said to Mr. Sanders’s backers. For many of those supporters, voting for Mrs. Clinton is still hard to fathom. About 85 percent of Democrats who backed Mr. Sanders in the primary contests said they planned to vote for her in the general election, according to a Pew poll released last week. Yet other polls show that only a small fraction of them would do so enthusiastically. “I’m a Bernie guy,” explained Noah Levin, a college student in Hampstead who wore an “H” for Hillary sticker on his   but said he wasn’t sure he would support Mrs. Clinton in the fall. “I won’t vote for Trump, but November is a long way away,” he said. On the campaign trail, Mrs. Clinton has been focused on winning over independents and   women who are turned off by Mr. Trump, exuding confidence that the young voters and liberals who backed Mr. Sanders will get in line and support her when faced with the prospect of a Trump presidency instead. But behind the scenes, her senior campaign aides have been in frequent contact with Sanders advisers while also trying to build bridges to a wing of the party skeptical of Mrs. Clinton and the brand of moderate politics her husband advanced. Since she clinched the number of delegates needed to secure her party’s nomination on June 7, the campaign has reached out to Mr. Sanders’s supporters, dispatching three top staff members  —   the campaign manager, Robby Mook director of states and political engagement, Marlon Marshall and the top policy adviser, Jake Sullivan  —   to states that Mr. Sanders won, including New Hampshire, Wyoming, Vermont and Washington. Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, was in a bittersweet but resolute mood on Tuesday, according to his advisers, as he took the stage with Mrs. Clinton. He was back in a state that once filled his campaign with hope after he crushed Mrs. Clinton by 22 percentage points in the February primary, and he came around grudgingly to supporting her, the advisers said. But he was also determined to make a strong case against Mr. Trump and, in doing so, champion Mrs. Clinton as the only chance to defeat him. Taking the stage together in the high school gymnasium, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders stood before a giant American flag and Mrs. Clinton’s motto, “Stronger Together. ” The clashes in the audience quickly subsided, and Mr. Sanders drew some of his strongest cheers as he described his unexpectedly competitive challenge against Mrs. Clinton and his primary and caucus victories in 22 states. In an odd passage for a concession speech, Mr. Sanders said that Mrs. Clinton had “389 more pledged delegates than we have, and a lot more superdelegates”  —   a reference to party leaders that drew boos from the audience and a steely look from Mrs. Clinton. One person close to Mr. Sanders said that the senator and his wife, Jane, were “putting on a good face” on Tuesday, but that they were disappointed that his campaign had not been more successful after he gave it so much of his energy and rallied millions of people around his ideas. The person, a longtime top political adviser to Mr. Sanders who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share the private views of the couple, also said that the senator had resolved to keep his word to endorse the Democratic nominee and that he had been told by some   Democrats that he could become chairman of the committee that would work on trying to carry out a proposed $15 federal minimum wage. Still, Mr. Sanders uttered the words that Mrs. Clinton needed him to say  —   “I am endorsing Hillary Clinton”  —   and aligned himself with her on creating more jobs, raising the minimum wage, expanding access to   health care, combating climate change and offering relief to college students in deep debt. “There is no doubt in my mind that as we head into November, Hillary Clinton is far and away the best candidate,” he said. “It is no secret that Hillary Clinton and I disagree on a number of issues  —   that is what this campaign has been about, that is what democracy is about,” said Mr. Sanders, who only three months ago declared that Mrs. Clinton was “unqualified” to be president. As Mr. Sanders delivered his endorsement, the Trump campaign, hoping to appeal to disaffected Sanders supporters, sent out a statement saying, “Bernie is now officially a part of a rigged system” for “endorsing one of the most     Street, and   candidates in the history of the Democratic Party. ” But Mrs. Clinton would not be deterred from her unity message, urging Democrats to come together against Mr. Trump. “With your help, we’re joining forces to defeat Donald Trump, win in November and build a future we can all believe in,” Mrs. Clinton said. “I am proud to be fighting alongside you because, my friends, this is a time for all of us to stand together. ”",0
17394,Rift Between Labor and Environmentalists Threatens Democratic Turnout Plan - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Two of the Democratic Party’s most loyal constituencies, labor and environmentalists, are clashing over an effort to raise tens of millions of dollars for an ambitious voter turnout operation aimed at defeating Donald J. Trump in the November election. The rift developed after some in the labor movement, whose cash flow has dwindled and whose political clout has been increasingly imperiled, announced a partnership last week with a wealthy environmentalist, Tom Steyer, to help bankroll a new fund dedicated to electing Democrats. That joint initiative enraged members of the nation’s biggest construction unions, already on edge about the rising influence of   activists. The   unions view Mr. Steyer’s environmental agenda as a threat to the jobs that can be created through infrastructure projects like new gas pipelines. The dispute, laid bare in a pair of blistering letters sent on Monday to Richard L. Trumka, president of the A. F. L. . I. O. underscored the tensions between the two pillars of the Democratic coalition. For decades, organized labor was among the most powerful forces on the left, financing Democratic candidates and reliably delivering   votes, and political foot soldiers, for the party in crucial states and districts. But with   white voters shifting to the Republican Party and Democrats growing more reliant on   voters and liberal donors like Mr. Steyer, environmental activists are increasingly muscling out unions. Nowhere was this more evident than during the tense debate over the Keystone XL oil pipeline, in which President Obama and Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, ultimately came down on the side of the environmentalists by opposing a project that some of the     unions fervently wanted. The friction is not just confined to the Democratic Party: The labor movement itself is changing. As manufacturing has declined, power has flowed away from the unions representing factory and construction workers and toward   and   workers. The unions that formed the alliance with Mr. Steyer included the two largest teachers’ unions and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. The goal of the new voter turnout “super PAC,” announced last week with an initial goal of raising $50 million, was to ensure that liberal groups did not duplicate their efforts, as had happened in some elections. Some unions were asked to give as much as $1 million. Mr. Steyer, founder of the advocacy group NextGen Climate, announced that he would give $5 million and said it was “highly likely” other unions would participate. But Mr. Steyer has opposed oil and gas projects like the Keystone pipeline, and the construction unions assailed the A. F. L. . I. O. ’s willingness to make common cause with him as an abandonment of their members and the federation’s principles. In one of the two letters sent on Monday, presidents of seven of the nation’s biggest construction unions threatened to boycott the new     effort, called For Our Future PAC. “It saddens us that the very labor movement we have fought for and supported for over a century seems to have lost sight of its core mission and has moved away from us and our membership in the interest of   political expediency,” wrote the leaders of the operating engineers, plumbers, elevator constructors, roofers, laborers, plasterers, and heat and frost insulators. In a separate and even more harshly worded letter to Mr. Trumka, the president of the   laborers union, Terry O’Sullivan, called the partnership a “politically bankrupt betrayal” of union members. “We object to the political agenda of the A. F. L. . I. O. being sold to a   hedge fund manager with a bag of cash,” he wrote. Both letters were provided to The New York Times by a labor official who insisted on anonymity. The schism comes as Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, is running a populist campaign that could appeal to some union members, castigating free trade agreements and illegal immigrants while vowing not to cut entitlement spending. Some of the   unions have already gotten behind Mrs. Clinton, but some labor holdouts remain: The Teamsters, for example, have yet to endorse a candidate. And among    workers, Mr. Trump could well outperform Mrs. Clinton with the unions that signed on to the letter, a heavily   and white male demographic. Membership in most   unions has steadily declined, leaving organized labor under pressure to find new ways to demonstrate its influence. Mr. O’Sullivan, in his letter, zeroed in on this challenge. “Years of financial distress have left the A. F. L. . I. O. desperate for cash, and it appears that the answer is to sell out to a billionaire who not only has little or no stake in our movement, our members or their work but who has actively fought against our members’ interest,” Mr. O’Sullivan wrote. Told of the criticism of Mr. Steyer, an executive at NextGen, Sky Gallegos, underscored the new super PAC’s goals of “preventing climate disaster and promoting prosperity. ” “Our new unified effort will help elect progressive leaders who are committed to a just transition to a   economy that will benefit working families across the nation,” she said.",0
17395,"Job Growth Loses Steam as U.S. Adds 98,000 in March - The New York Times","Looking for a Trump bump in the economy? Keep waiting. After two months of stellar job creation that convinced administration officials that President Trump’s policies were paying off immediately, employers pulled back sharply on hiring in March. The economy added 98, 000 jobs, the Labor Department reported Friday, fewer than half the monthly number for January and February. The report contained some notable good news: The unemployment rate fell to 4. 5 percent, the lowest level in almost a decade and a milestone in the long road back from the Great Recession. The rate was 4. 7 percent in February. Wages also continued to rise. But the disappointing number of new jobs was jarring for the administration, and well below what economists had expected. It comes as the stock market surge, which followed the November election, subsides and amid signs that economic growth in the year’s first quarter proves weak. Economic perceptions, as well, may not be playing out in reality. Sentiment among consumers and businesses rose after Mr. Trump’s election, but so far, it has not been matched by a comparable increase in spending by either group. “We’ve given up on waiting for hard data to improve,” said Rob Martin, an economist at Barclays. “It’s been five months since confidence increased. If consumption were going to improve, it would have already. ” Industries that Mr. Trump emphasized in his campaign  —   particularly manufacturing  —   continued to add jobs last month, but at a slower pace. Payrolls in the retail sector, meanwhile, declined further, shedding tens of thousands of jobs. The response from the White House, which crowed last month after more than 200, 000 jobs were produced in Mr. Trump’s first full month in office, was muted Friday. Gary D. Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs executive who is director of the White House’s National Economic Council, emphasized the decline in the unemployment rate. “When you look at the jobs report as a whole, I think there’s an awful lot of good news in here,” he told Fox Business Network. Congressional Democrats took a dimmer view. Also watching closely are the policy makers of the Federal Reserve, which has begun to reel in its   stimulus. It raised interest rates last month and said it planned to do so twice more this year. But signs of a sluggish economy could affect how quickly the central bank moves. “This raises the stakes for the April report,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR, a research firm. “You need to see things pick up in April, or else March won’t look like aberration. ” The market reaction, in any case, was sanguine, with stocks essentially flat for the day. Barclays has said it expects the economy to actually slow in the first half of 2017, before rebounding modestly in the second half. “Given this data today, we see downside risk in our already soft expectations for the first half,” Mr. Martin said. The consensus view on Wall Street is that the economy expanded at an annual rate of 1 percent last quarter, with the pace of growth in the current second quarter rising to 3. 5 percent. The March report represents a snapshot of the economy, not an oil painting. And snow and cold weather in many parts of the country clearly took a toll on the construction sector, which barely grew after gaining a total of more than 90, 000 jobs in January and February. “January and February were abnormally warm, so they were pumped up, and you had some payback in March exacerbated by the harsh weather,” Mr. Shapiro said. On Capitol Hill, Republicans acknowledged a    view of the report. “The economy clearly should be generating higher job growth,” said Representative Pat Tiberi, an Ohio Republican who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee. “However, the unemployment rate fell to the lowest rate since before the recession. ” The top Democrat on the committee, Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, ignored the new jobless rate and focused instead on the disappointing payroll gain. “Today’s jobs numbers show there are still challenges ahead that this administration must address,” Mr. Heinrich said. “President Trump promised that he would be ‘the greatest jobs producer that God ever created.’ Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee will hold him to this promise. ” Last month, when February’s payroll gain turned out to be much better than expected, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, claimed credit for Mr. Trump. Mr. Spicer called the job creation a result of “the surge in economic confidence and optimism that has been inspired since his election. ” Part of the problem for the administration is that its legislative accomplishments in the first hundred days are falling far short of the expectations  —   notably, for tax cuts and infrastructure spending  —   since the election. Whether or not they support Mr. Trump, mainstream economists say it will take many months for policy shifts in Washington to move a   economy with 153 million workers. What is more, the tepid numbers for March mask pockets of strength. For example, a few   sectors like professional and business services are holding up well, adding 56, 000 jobs last month. Hyland, a business software designer in Westlake, Ohio, plans to hire at least 300 people this year, Bill Priemer, its chief executive, said. That is a 15 percent increase in head count at the company, and it is a sign of just how quickly demand is growing for new technologies like content management, one of Hyland’s specialties. “We are growing faster than the economy and the enterprise software sector overall,” Mr. Priemer said. “Digital transformation is a big buzzword, but it’s just fancy terminology to describe how business can use technology to streamline their operations. ” On the other hand, new technologies are upending venerable industries like retailing, as consumers shift to shopping online and department stores close. The retail sector lost almost 30, 000 jobs last month, after a decline of about 31, 000 in February. The headline numbers for hiring and the unemployment rate are derived from separate surveys by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, one of establishments, the other of households. Although the two tends to converge over time, they can vary widely from month to month, and March was one of those times. So while businesses showed an anemic gain of 98, 000 jobs in terms of payrolls, households reported a 472, 000 increase in employment, without any fall in labor participation. That explains why the unemployment rate could fall by 0. 2 of a percentage point, even as the number for job creation was far short of expectations. “I think the headline number was clearly impacted by the weather,” said Michelle Meyer, head of United States economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. But at some point she said, rosy economic expectations are likely to catch up with a more sober reality. “Sentiment surveys moved sharply higher after the election on expectations of   policies and tax reform,” she added. “So far, that hasn’t happened, and the big question is whether confidence can remain as strong. ”",0
17396,Blue State Blues: Donald Trump Exposes Media’s Jenga Journalism - Breitbart,"For months, the mainstream media played a game of “Jenga journalism,” building a tower of accusations against Donald Trump, using flimsy, speculative claims of Russian collusion. [None of the different pieces of the conspiracy theory could hold up on their own, but journalists  —   and the Hillary Clinton campaign  —   treated the pile of Russia innuendo like a real monument. But then Trump made the move that forced them to tug at the foundations of their own illusion, and it crashed.  @joelpollak comes up with amazing new meme in @chucktodd interview #JengaJournalism https:  .   —   TundraTabloids (@TundraTabloids) March 17, 2017,   In the past several days, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former Acting Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Mike Morell have both stated publicly that there is no evidence that the Trump campaign cooperated with Russia. But they held their tongues for months as the false accusations mounted against Trump. It was only after the president tweeted that former President Barack Obama had wiretapped him that they found the courage to tell the truth. Trump based his claim on the mainstream media’s own reporting  —   a point made by conservative talk radio host Mark Levin and then later at Breitbart News. The New York Times, the BBC, and others had reported that the Obama administration had carried out surveillance on people close to Trump. Furthermore, the Times reported that the previous administration relaxed the rules of the National Security Agency to disseminate the results of that surveillance, some of which was evidently leaked. The media latched onto Trump’s claim that Obama had tapped his “phones,” as if that proved Trump was lying. But no one could dispute any of the core elements of Trump’s claims  —   until this past Thursday, when the Senate Intelligence Committee issued a short bipartisan statement: “Based on the information available to us, we see no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance by any element of the United States government either before or after Election Day 2016. ” The committee’s statement was interpreted by the media as a definitive conclusion  —   though the investigation is ongoing. But if true, the only part of the story that has been debunked concerns surveillance of Trump Tower itself, a claim first made by the Heat Street website. It does not mean the warrant that Heat Street reported  —   and which the BBC reported as well  —   was never sought. That warrant, reportedly rejected by a FISA court, amended, and then approved, concerned a computer server. The New York Times also reported in October that the FBI had been investigating that server for “a possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump Organization to a Russian bank. ” (The FBI found no evidence of any “conclusive or direct link,” which did not stop Democrats and the media from claiming there was one.) All the Senate committee did this week was confirm what Clapper had already said  —   that there had been no warrant for surveillance of Trump Tower itself. So no “phones,” but the basic case still stands: there was surveillance of the Trump campaign, the results were shared widely within the government, and the intelligence made its way  —   often illegally  —   to the mainstream media. The people leaking the intelligence are happy to defend what they are doing, through surrogates like former CIA agent and presidential candidate Evan McMullin, who told CNN the leakers were stopping “a security threat coming from the White House. ” Yet the mainstream media are behaving as if Trump’s tweets about having his “wires tapped” are a very serious lie that undermines his entire administration. Having congratulated each other for exposing Trump on an entirely trivial matter, journalists are now using Trump’s tweets to badger other Republicans, like UN Ambassador Nikki Haley. (How many Obama Cabinet members had to face such questions about their “credibility” after he was caught spying on foreign leaders?) Moreover, in skewering Trump for claims about “wiretapping” and “phones,” the media are holding Trump to a standard of literalism they would never apply to themselves. For example, mainstream media headlines screamed for months about a “love affair” between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin: “The curious   love affair” (CBS) “Trump and Putin: A Love Story” (New Yorker). But it turns out there is no evidence Trump had sexual intercourse with Putin. Liars! Nervous Republicans like Rick Santorum fret that Trump is “hurting himself” with his tweets. On the contrary: not only has he exposed the media’s double standards, but he is also forcing them to impeach their own evidence. After all, if there was no surveillance of the Trump campaign, then there was no Russian collusion, and the media are simply “fake news” partisans. By tweeting about Obama, Trump moved the last weak Jenga block. Now the tower is wobbling. Your move, journalists. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

17397,#RESIST as Marketing: ’Fearless Girl’ Statue Taking Home Awards at Cannes - Breitbart,"The “Fearless Girl” statue which stands opposite of the iconic charging bull on Wall Street is racking up awards this week at Cannes Lions, the largest annual gathering of marketing executives. [The statue was commissioned on behalf of asset manager State Street and advertising agency McCann New York as a way of encouraging firms to hire more female executives.  “Its simplicity in the use of symbolism transcends geography, it transcends language, it transcends culture,” Wendy Clark, CEO of DDB North America, told Adweek. “For us, while it is a girl, it elegantly captures women’s journeys and our path to empowerment. And it also encapsulates our hopes and our ambitions for every little girl in the world. ” Clark also serves as the jury president of the Cannes Lions awards week, which was inspired by the Cannes Film Festival and takes place at the same conference center in Cannes, France. The “Fearless Girl” statue took home the Grand Prix in the Glass, PR and Outdoor Lions categories on the festival’s first day. The statue was sculpted by artist Kristen Visbal in an effort to encourage gender diversity amongst corporate executives. “The girl is standing there like this in front the bull, saying, ‘Now, what are you going to do?’  Arturo Di Modica said, who sculpted the Charging Bull statue. Di Modica argues that the “Fearless Girl” statue violates his artistic rights as it changes the meaning of the bull statue. “Remove her and place her somewhere else in the city,” Di Modica’s attorney said. “We’ve got lots of ideas. And damages must be awarded to Arturo for violation of his legal, statutory rights. ” Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about economics and higher education for Breitbart News.

17398,What Is Behind The Push For War With Russia?,"What Is Behind The Push For War With Russia? What Is Behind The Push For War With Russia? By 0 23 
This is a Jewish thing. But it is not just that Jews want to destroy things for no reason. But this is, especially among the American Jewish elite, a vendetta against Vladimir Putin. This vendetta was described by American academia’s preeminent Russia scholar, Professor Stephen F. Cohen. 
To be sure, Cohen did not say in so many words that this was a “Jewish” vendetta. But he also did not call it a “globalist” or “corporate” or “reptilian Nazi” vendetta, which are just ways of distracting attention away from the Jewish role. He blamed a war party which he described as led by the (((New York Times))), the (((Washington Post))), and officials in the Defense and State Department like (((Victoria Nuland))). Connect the dots for yourselves, goys. 
He does not say why this “war party,” as he calls it, wants to regime change Putin. But a look at recent Russian history, a history that he has written so much about, makes it clear. 
After the Soviet Union was dismantled in what was basically an unconstitutional coup carried out by the Russian President Boris Yeltsin at a time when Russia was just one (although by far the largest) of the 15 Soviet republics that made up the Soviet Union, he proceeded to privatize state assets as part of a “shock therapy” program pushed by Harvard Professor (((Jeffrey Sachs))), who was brought in as an advisor by Privatization Minister (((Anatoly Chubais))).

17399,"Qandeel Baloch, Pakistani Social Media Celebrity, Dead in Apparent Honor Killing - The New York Times","ISLAMABAD, Pakistan  —   Qandeel Baloch, a Pakistani social media sensation, was strangled by her brother in central Pakistan, police officials said Saturday, in what appears to have been a   honor killing. The police said Ms. Baloch was apparently attacked on Friday night while she was asleep in her parents’ house in Muzaffarabad, a town on the outskirts of Multan in the province of Punjab. Ms. Baloch’s brother, Waseem Ahmed Azeem, was arrested late Saturday night in connection with her death. Ms. Baloch, 26, a model, singer and social media celebrity, had gained notoriety in Pakistan recently because of provocative, seminude photographs of herself that she posted on social media sites, and appearances in music videos. Her bold persona defied the conventions of Pakistan, a deeply conservative society. She was reviled by some in the country for being crass and vulgar, and prone to   stunts. But other Pakistanis admired her defiance and independence. She attracted more than 700, 000 followers on Facebook and at least 40, 000 on Twitter. “Qandeel was probably the first true female internet celebrity in Pakistan, in that her celebrity had nothing to do with any achievement beyond her provocative presence on social media,” said Hasan Zaidi, a Pakistani filmmaker and media critic. “It was unfathomable to a lot of Pakistanis that a real woman could be as brazen or shameless about her sexuality publicly, because her entire persona was built around flaunting her body, talking about sex and being in everyone’s face,” Mr. Zaidi said. Ms. Baloch’s latest appearance was in a video by an unknown singer, in which she danced provocatively to a song titled “Ban. ” The producers of the song anticipated that it could not be broadcast on mainstream entertainment channels and instead posted it on YouTube. Born to a poor family from the backwaters of Punjab, Ms. Baloch, whose real name was Fauzia Azeem, said she had run away from home to pursue her dream of becoming a star. She took to social media after unsuccessful efforts to enter the mainstream entertainment industry. In interviews, she acknowledged that she was pushing the traditional boundaries of socially acceptable behavior in Pakistan. “I know I exploited the freedom given to me by my parents,” she said in an interview with BBC. “But now, it is too late. ” In June, Ms. Baloch posted photographs of herself with a   Muslim cleric, Mufti Abdul Qavi, which attracted much attention on social media. The pictures show Ms. Baloch pouting and wearing the cleric’s hat while he, seemingly bedazzled, stares into the camera. Many Pakistanis saw the photographs as scandalous, and Mr. Qavi was removed from his position on the country’s   committee, which determines when Ramadan starts and ends in accordance with the Islamic lunar calendar. On Wednesday, she found herself in the spotlight again after local media outlets reported that a man identified as her former husband claimed that he had a son with her and that he had divorced her after he could not meet her demands to provide a house and a luxury car. In response, Ms. Baloch said she had been a victim of domestic abuse. Ms. Baloch was not shy about saying she wanted to be famous. In a Twitter post on Wednesday, Ms. Baloch wrote: “I will fight for it. I will not give up. I will reach my goal  absolutely nothing will stop me. ” The news of her death prompted an immediate outcry on Twitter and Facebook in Pakistan, with many people condemning her killing and praising Ms. Baloch for her irreverent and uninhibited ways. “Qandeel Baloch was no role model,” Sherry Rehman, an opposition politician and a former Pakistani ambassador to Washington, posted on Twitter. “But she deserved a better life and death. Strongly condemn. ” The killing has put the spotlight back on   honor killings in Pakistan. Each year, hundreds of Pakistani women are killed by relatives angered by behavior they believe has tarnished the family’s reputation,   activists say. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has vowed to strengthen laws intended to prevent such killings, but critics say no concrete steps have been taken yet. In most cases, the honor killings take place within the family, said Syeda Sughra Imam, a former senator from Punjab who has pushed for legislation against the practice. “The accused and the complainant are from the same family and they forgive each other,” Ms Imam said. “No one is ever prosecuted. ” Ms. Imam’s proposed legislation calls for eliminating a “forgiveness clause” in Pakistani law that allows families to reach a financial settlement or to forgive the killer. “This killing with impunity has to stop,” Ms. Imam said.",0
17400,FCC Deregulation: Merger Mania as Courts to Rehear AT&ampT Mobility Case - Breitbart,"President Trump’s deregulation of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) went into overdrive this week, with Sinclair Broadcasting launching the first of what will be many television industry consolidations, and the Ninth Circuit granting a   rehearing of its August ATT Mobility decision. [The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) now under Trump Administration control, made a late April move to relax regulatory restrictions on how many television stations an owner may control. That kicked off an immediate bidding industrywide bidding war to achieve greater competitive efficiencies through consolidation.  Sinclair Broadcasting, America’s largest broadcast group, bid $240 million on May 1 to buy 14 more New   stations. According to the Deal Book blog, a bidding war is breaking out for Tribune Media, owner of Chicago’s WGN America and New York’s PIX 11. Commenting on the March 9 willingness of the full Appeals Court to reconsider an August 29 decision that held that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) could no longer could control Internet activity, Republican FCC Chairman Ajit Pai issued a statement: “Today’s action by the Ninth Circuit is a big win for American consumers. Now that the court’s prior decision is no longer effective, it will be easier for the FTC to protect consumers’ online privacy. ” The Appeals Court opinion last year relied on the Obama   FCC’sissuing of a massive   regulatory grab in March 2015, referred to “Net Neutrality. ” The order reclassified the treatment of broadband Internet from a growing competitive industry to “common carrier” monopolies, like the old American Telephone and Telegraph. The original appeals court decision last year dramatically altered the regulatory boundaries between the FTC’s and FCC’s authority over phone companies and other common carriers. It dismissed the FTC’s unfair act or practice suit against ATT for not disclosing it was “throttling” data transfer speeds for customers that paid for unlimited wireless data plans. Breitbart News noted that Republican FCC member Ajit Pai tweeted in 2015that President Barack Obama’s Net Neutrality scheme was aimed at the federal government   the Internet to extract billions of dollars in new consumer taxes, and rigidly to enforce progressives’ idea of honest, equitable, and balanced content fairness.",0

[Over the past year or so the district has become a   area for women as migrants and drug dealers have flooded the area. Dozens of these groups of young men crowd the streets, harassing women who walk by wearing what they consider to be immodest clothing Le Parisien reports.  The situation for women has gotten so bad in the area that many women are effectively banned from cafes and bars.    Natalie, who has been a resident of the area for 30 years said, “these are insults, incessant reflections. The atmosphere is agonising, to the point of having to modify our itinerary, our clothes. Some even gave up going out. ” An    female resident is said to have totally stopped leaving her apartment after being sexually assaulted as she was returning home one day. Aurélie, 38, who has lived in the area for 15 years said that the cafe below her apartment has turned into an exclusively male establishment. “I have to listen to a lot of remarks when I pass in front, especially since they drink a lot,” she said. “A few days ago, the simply standing by my window triggered a flood of insults and I had to lock myself in my apartment. I used to walk down the Boulevard de la Chapelle from Stalingrad [metro station] even late at night   …     It’s unthinkable today,” she added. The Stalingrad metro was the former location of a large makeshift migrant camp in Paris which was cleared and relocated to Porte de la Chapelle. Earlier this month Breitbart London visited the camp and talked to the migrants there. All blamed Europe for their situation and demanded handouts from the French government. Another woman said she would not allow her    daughter to walk the streets of the area alone anymore. She said that after getting off at the Chapelle metro station she ended up in the middle of a brawl of migrants who pulled knives out and threatened her with them. “I thought my last hour had arrived,” she said. Due to mass migration, the situation in various parts of Paris has rapidly deteriorated over the last few years. Various suburbs of Paris, such as    have become breeding grounds for radical Islam according to France’s top expert on the subject, Gilles Kepel. The women of   have said they will organise a walk around the area with female city officials in order to bring attention to the problem and perhaps find a solution. So far newly elected French president Emmanuel Macron has not addressed the issue of safety in the French capital, using his first weeks as president to court the approval of German Chancellor Angela Merkel instead.",0
17402,Report: Anti-Trump Hollywood Wins Big with President’s Tax Cut Plan,"In a column for the Hollywood Reporter, Senior Editor Eriq Gardner notes that Hollywood’s major film industry players  —   who have often been the most vocal critics of President Donald Trump and his administration’s policies  —   could actually be among the greatest beneficiaries of the president’s proposed tax cuts. [From the Hollywood Reporter:  If Donald Trump gets his way on tax reform, Hollywood actors, directors, and writers stand to be among the biggest beneficiaries. Understanding why takes some appreciation of the fact that the entertainment industry isn’t just five big corporations, but also thousands of smaller ones  —   almost all incredibly obscure even if their owners are quite famous. As the tax code currently stands, the richest individuals pay almost 40 percent on individual income (or less after deductions). Businesses pay a separate rate, which Trump wishes to set at 15 percent. Most importantly, the proposal outlined by the Trump Administration has this latter rate being applied to all businesses, including “ ” organizations like S corporations that distribute a salary to   and count the rest as profits. Under the current law, personal income and business income is taxed roughly the same, but if Trump succeeds, many folks may aim to establish   for themselves to get their taxes down to 15 percent. Guess what? Many in Hollywood are largely set up already thanks to “ ” corporations that contract out services like acting and directing to production studios. Alas, alongside the 21st Century Fox’s and Time Warner’s come Kaling International (Mindy Kaling) Kimsaprincess Inc.

17405,"Trump Kicks Off ‘Thank You’ Tour, Reveling in Crowd and Campaign Themes - The New York Times","CINCINNATI  —   He boasted about himself in the third person. He sneered at the opponents he had vanquished. He disparaged journalists and invited angry chants from the crowd, grinning broadly at calls of “lock her up” and “build the wall. ” He ridiculed the government’s leaders as stupid and dishonest failures. In his first major address since winning the presidency three weeks ago, Donald J. Trump soaked up the adulation of thousands of his supporters at a   rally here, unabashedly gloating about the “great” victory he had secured. If there were any question about whether his evolution to    would temper his presentation or moderate his tone, the rally offered a forceful answer: Not a chance. Kicking off what was billed as a “thank you” tour, Mr. Trump was incendiary and prideful, hopeful and indicting, vengeful and determined. His staff said the rally was the first of several he will hold before his inauguration next month. His tour is an unusual move for a   most of whom do not return so quickly to the campaign trail, especially while key cabinet positions remain unfilled. Mr. Trump, who has been mostly cloistered in Trump Tower as he tries to assemble a government, was said to be eager to reconnect with voters. Connect he did, whipping the partially filled arena into a frenzy by reprising the   rhetoric from his    campaign. He repeated pledges to suspend immigration from countries with a history of terrorism, repeal the Affordable Care Act, lower taxes, end unfair trade and “drain the swamp” of corruption. But while he at times stuck to the script on his teleprompter, Mr. Trump came alive when he veered from it to talk about himself and demean those who had opposed him. “We had a lot of fun fighting Hillary Clinton,” he said, smiling knowingly as the crowd chanted “Lock her up!” but offering no indication that he intended to do so. In the middle of a scripted part of the speech about lower taxes for businesses, he shifted abruptly to note the magnitude of his wins. “How about North Carolina  —   how well did we do in North Carolina? Remember when they said he cannot win North Carolina?” Mr. Trump said, adding a moment later: “Donald Trump can’t break the blue wall, right? We didn’t break it, we shattered that sucker. We shattered it, man. That poor wall is busted up. ” And he reserved special bile for the “extremely dishonest press,” provoking boos as he lashed out  —   without naming her  —   at a network anchor who he said had cried on television on election night when she realized he was going to win the presidency. “You know what she doesn’t understand, things are going to be much better now,” he said. “I love this stuff,” he said after a nearly   discussion of his electoral prowess and his critique of the news media. “Should I go on with this for just a little bit longer? I love it. ” He did go on, shifting back and forth between his prepared remarks and his extemporaneous walk down the memory lane of victory. During the prepared parts of the speech, Mr. Trump seemed eager to reach out to the people who had opposed his candidacy. He said the new government would “seek a truly inclusive society,” and he proclaimed that “we condemn bigotry and hatred in all of its forms. ” On the economy, he vowed to “reverse the stagnation and usher in a period of prosperity and growth,” even as he promised to overcome the partisan gridlock that has led to stalemate in Congress during much of the past eight years. “We’ll compete in the world, we want to compete in the world, but we’re going to compete in the world where it’s a   road, not a   road,” Mr. Trump vowed. “The advantages are going to come back to our country, and they haven’t for many, many years. ” Speaking in Ohio just days after a Somali refugee wounded several people with a knife at Ohio State University, Mr. Trump essentially attributed the attack to programs to admit refugees “stupidly created by our very stupid politicians. ” “We will suspend immigration from regions where it cannot be safely processed,” he said, echoing some of his most effective campaign rhetoric. But he sometimes veered from his prepared remarks in the middle of a sentence. A discussion of what his administration would do if a company wanted to move jobs overseas reminded him again of his victories. And that discussion of winning several states led directly into a diatribe against reporters, who he said had never seen his victories coming. Then, when he mentioned Utah, he railed against a   candidate who before Election Day had seemed poised to do well. “Remember when they said Donald Trump is going to lose to some guy I’ve never even heard of?” he said, laughing. “The people of Utah were amazing, and we trounced them. Hillary came in second, and that guy came in third. What the hell was he trying to prove?” Mr. Trump offered both an olive branch and a warning to Democrats in Washington, saying he believed that “they want to get together” but reminded them that they had lost “because the people are angry. ” He delivered his promise through the prism of a   federal government. “Our victory was so great, we have the House, we have the Senate,” Mr. Trump said, his last words drowned out with cheers. He smiled and paused, before offering some tepid reassurance that “we want to get them on board. ” Mr. Trump opened his rally with a familiar trope: gawking at the crowd and lamenting the difficulty that supporters were having traveling to the arena. “So I didn’t know what came with this position, and I didn’t know that they closed down the roads around the stadium for an hour and a half,” he said, thanking the crowd “for being so patient. ” Before he spoke, a familiar scene developed at the arena, with hundreds of Mr. Trump’s supporters lined up, some clad in red shirts handing out “ ” signs. The prerally soundtrack, heavy on Elton John and the Rolling Stones, rotated through the songs heard during the campaign. The main difference this time: the lectern at center stage, which now had a big, bold “USA” where the name “TRUMP” used to be. As   Mr. Trump has at times seemed frustrated by criticism of his business conflicts and his loss by more than two million ballots in the popular vote. But at the rally, Mr. Trump was once again in good spirits, feeding off the fervor in the crowd. He had just come from Indianapolis, where he celebrated his involvement in Carrier’s decision to keep roughly 1, 000 jobs in Indiana. Mr. Trump seemed to relish toying with the news media, at one point announcing that he had chosen James N. Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general, to be his secretary of defense  —   even though his spokesman had said four hours earlier that no decision had been made. “I gave up a little secret,” Mr. Trump said, urging the crowd not to “let it out of this room. ” But nothing seemed to fire up the   as much as recalling his victories in the campaign, each made so much sweeter, he repeatedly said, because the media and his opponents had never seen them coming. “We had a lot of fun,” he said, adding: “The bottom line is, we won. ”",0
17406,Wharton Business School Backers Seek Distance From Donald Trump - The New York Times,"Donald J. Trump often cites his undergraduate degree from University of Pennsylvania’s prestigious Wharton business school as evidence that he is a pretty smart guy and singularly qualified to be president. But some in the Wharton community would prefer the presumptive Republican presidential nominee simply leave his alma mater out of his campaign. In an open letter to Mr. Trump, Wharton backers wrote that they have been “deeply disappointed” in his candidacy and “outraged that an affiliation with our school is being used to legitimize prejudice and intolerance. ” “Although we do not aim to make any political endorsements with this letter, we do express our unequivocal stance against the xenophobia, sexism, racism, and other forms of bigotry that you have actively and implicitly endorsed in your campaign,” said the letter, which was posted to Medium. com and as of Monday morning carried the signatures of about 2, 000 Wharton students, alumni, faculty members and other supporters. For Mr. Trump, a 1968 graduate who saw some of his children later follow him to the school, Wharton has long held a special significance to him as the educational beginnings of his career in real estate. And it’s a credential that he has used to promote his intelligence, often remarking about how only the best students are accepted. Mr. Trump’s campaign spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on the letter. He has disputed assertions that he is prejudiced, saying that he is the “least racist person there is. ” A year ago, in the early stages of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump plugged his education at Wharton to distinguish himself as the astute businessman in the crowded Republican field. “I’m really smart,” he said during a speech in Phoenix. “Went to the Wharton School of Finance. Even then, a long time ago, like the hardest, or one of the hardest, schools to get into. ” In the letter to Mr. Trump, the Wharton supporters said they “can understand why, in seeking America’s highest office, you have used your degree from Wharton to promote and lend legitimacy to your candidacy. ” The letter said that his presidential campaign afforded him the opportunity “to make the Wharton community even prouder of our school and values. ” But the letter asserted that Mr. Trump had squandered that chance by promoting intolerance toward a number of groups, contrary to the values of the diverse Wharton community. “We represent the groups that you have repeatedly denigrated, as well as their steadfast friends, family and allies,” the letter said. The letter closed with a wholesale rejection of Mr. Trump’s use of his “education at Wharton as a platform for promoting prejudice and intolerance. ”",0
17407,’Drunk Don Lemon’: CNN Cuts Mic During New Year’s Eve Show,"CNN anchor Don Lemon chugged tequila, had his ear pierced, and launched into a rant about how “awful” 2016 was during a drunken live New Year’s Eve performance that ended with producers cutting off his microphone. [Comedienne Kathy Griffin and CNN anchor Anderson Cooper kicked off the bizarre sequence of events by debating whether Lemon should get a tattoo or have his ear pierced.  “What are you thinking?” CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin asked Lemon, who was reporting live from New Orleans. “Nipples! Nipples! Nipples!” Griffin screamed suggested a nipple piercing, as Lemon began to unbutton his shirt. He eventually settled on getting his ear pierced. “Is this going to hurt?” a tequila   Lemon asked Chris, an   tattoo artist who was hold a piercing gun in his hand. “It’s not going to hurt me,” Chris said. “You’ll be fine. ” “Mama Lemon,” a seemingly embarrassed Baldwin said, while looking into the camera,” I don’t know what he’s thinking. At least it’s just his ear, you know what I’m saying?” After the needled was in and Lemon was sporting a fleur de lis earring, Baldwin said “this is what happens when a lot of tequila happens. ” About 30 minutes later, as the clock struck midnight and the New Year had finally arrived, Lemon (now drinking champagne) began to rebuke 2016. “I can’t hear a damn thing,” Lemon said. “So, 2016 was awful,” he added just before his microphone was abruptly cut off.  What exactly was so “awful” about 2016, we may never know. But perhaps CNN cut off Lemon’s mic because it didn’t want to relive the public relations nightmare it endured last month after one of the network’s producers was heard offscreen joking about the possibility of   Donald Trump’s plane crashing. And, of course, 2016 was the year Lemon was called “dumb as a rock” by none other than Trump. . @dbongino  You were fantastic in defending both the Second Amendment and me last night on @CNN.

17408,Alvin Ailey’s Robert Battle on His First Real Dance Shoes - The New York Times,"I’ll never forget the impact of my first dance shoes. We didn’t have a lot of money, especially when I was in elementary school. So I got “imitation” shoes they weren’t Converse  —   they were “ . ” Kids would pick on you because you didn’t have trendy   shoes and that was a source of anxiety to me. But when I was 12 my mother took me to the Star Styled store in Miami to buy me genuine   tap shoes, ballet slippers and jazz oxfords. She made it a priority, as I had to have all of these types of shoes before my first classes started. It was such a big deal when I got those shoes that I would even sleep with them. Just by putting them on, I had the keys to what I was hoping to become. In the back room of our house, I would imitate photographs of dancers from the magazines my teacher had given me. All of a sudden, I was connected to a magical world. The power of those shoes as something tangible, and as a metaphor, was enormous for me. Anything I learned, I would try to teach to the neighborhood kids. Soon I would cast them in dance videos with my front porch as the stage. I choreographed to the song “Word Up!” by Cameo, and persuaded a group of my fellow students to participate, including football players. We performed the routine for no one, because we were all in it. But it sparked my desire to create dance, not just to perform it. Growing up in the Liberty City neighborhood of Miami had its rough edges. Two blocks away, there were drug deals and shootings, which I saw walking to and from school. Pretty much everyone I knew had security bars on their windows. I would use the ones on the inside of my front porch as a ballet barre. It was a challenge being a kid who played classical piano, danced and sang soprano in the choir. Sometimes I was threatened, so I started carrying a hammer in my dance bag for protection. I carried myself differently, and people left me alone. The first time I saw Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, classes from our school were bused to a special performance for students at Jackie Gleason Theater in Miami Beach. The dancers were in some ways a reflection of me they looked like me, but more than that they looked like what I wanted to become. The highlight of the performance was “Revelations,” Ailey’s masterpiece, created in 1960 at the cusp of the civil rights movement. It’s not just a dance, but a suite of spirituals relating to the black experience in this country and expressing the trials, tribulations, faith and hope to which everyone can relate. As a boy who grew up in the church, I felt connected to it in a very personal way. One section that really resonated with me was “Wade in the Water,” a depiction of a baptism. Across the stage, fabric billowed, representing the water, and dancers stepped forward and back with equal parts fear and joy. That’s what I felt being baptized in my own church. “Revelations” was my story as much as it was Ailey’s blood memories. It felt very much like the life I already knew. So I could walk into a positive image that was much more powerful than all of the negatives I had ever seen, combined. Images were important to me. I would cut out pictures from dance magazines  —   Anna Pavlova, Judith Jamison  —   and paste them on big square pieces of wood. In my dark room at night I would slowly shine a flashlight over them, intrigued by the contrast, which is in some ways a metaphor for life. Even in a dark space, a dark time, with your imagination and your ability to see beyond your circumstance, there is always light. That vision board was a powerful exercise for me. But termites eventually got to the wood, and I had to throw it away. My imagination was my passport to the world. We had a lot of trees in the yard in Florida, but the mango tree was the biggest, with a place that I could perch. There was something about being high above the ground that elevated me beyond place, time and circumstance. I would envision what it would be like to perform in front of thousands in New York City and walk through Times Square. I would envision the audience’s faces, what they were wearing, even how they got to the theater. I felt the same adrenaline rush as if I were actually performing. I’m convinced that exercise moved me closer to my destiny. Eventually I auditioned for Juilliard and was fortunate to be accepted on full scholarship. There I was, in New York, just a few blocks away from the Ailey company, which at the time was on West 61st Street. Visiting the studios, I could peer through the windows, catch the occasional sighting of the legendary Judith Jamison, who was then artistic director. Years later, when she grabbed my hands, looked into my eyes and asked me to lead the company  —   “It’s yours,” she said  —   everything that I visualized while studying those images of her came flooding back. Even to this day, when someone says, “Please welcome the artistic director of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Robert Battle,” there’s something in me that is reduced to that young person in the mango tree. I always tell young people, ‘It costs you nothing to use your imagination, but it will cost you everything if you don’t use it.’ When I think back to that moment of putting on my first dance shoes, I know now that it was about unlocking the mystery of my imagination. Putting on those shoes allowed me to walk into this magnificent world of dance, and, step after step, it continues to be  .",0
17409,"VIDEO: Robbery Suspect Can’t Rack Slide, Points Jammed Gun at Cashier - Breitbart","On April 26 an armed robbery suspect failed to successfully rack the slide of his   pistol but pointed the jammed gun toward a cashier and demanded money anyway. [The incident occurred at a Kansas City Jimmy John’s around 9:15 p. m.  According to Fox 13, the robbery suspect was “wearing a baby blue sweatshirt and black hat. ” He ordered food, then tried —  unsuccessfully —  to rack the slide on his pistol. Video of the incident shows a bullet ended up being jammed between the slide and the barrel’s chamber, yet the suspect pointed the gun at the cashier and carried out the robbery anyway.  The cashier remained extremely calm throughout the incident, even though the suspect placed the end of the barrel just inches from the cashier’s head. In fact —  once the robbery attempt was obvious —  the cashier “simply takes his gloves off, takes the money out of the register and hands it to the suspect, without any change in his demeanor whatsoever. ” The suspect took the money and fled the scene, but police reported that he was arrested on Friday.

17410,Jubilee Year of Mercy ends on November 20. Following Judgment?,"Jubilee Year of Mercy ends on November 20. Following Judgment? page: 1 Jesus to St Faustina: You will prepare the world for My final coming. (Diary 429) Speak to the world about My mercy ... It is a sign for the end times. After it will come the Day of Justice. While there is still time, let them have recourse to the fountain of My mercy. (Diary 848) Tell souls about this great mercy of Mine, because the awful day, the day of My justice, is near. (Diary 965). I am prolonging the time of mercy for the sake of sinners. But woe to them if they do not recognize this time of My visitation. (Diary 1160) Before the Day of Justice, I am sending the Day of Mercy. (Diary 1588) He who refuses to pass through the door of My mercy must pass through the door of My justice. (Diary 1146). The Jubilee Year of Mercy proclaimed by pope Francis, ends on November 20th the feast of Christ the King the end of the liturgical year. Every jubilee year is destined to end of course, that's why it is a year and not a decade.But...isn't it too much prophecy gathered in that last year? First of all, the Catholics expect earnestly the 100th anniversary of Fatima. The 100th year started on October 13 and would end on October 13, 2017. As pope Benedict said during his pontificate on his trip to Fatima, the 100th year will see the Fatima secrets fulfilled. Then, we had all kinds of predictions recently. Let only remember the once at the time Jewish rabbis predictions of the year 5776, encoded in Bible codes according to some of them, that also appeared to be the 49th jubilee year since the retaking of Jerusalem. ""Nothing happened, again"" would say many. Much happened in terms that might be the last quiet year before the events. Then we have the enigmatic wishes on the last Christmas of both pope and queen as if that would be our last Christmas? The wordings were vague enough to draw firm conclusion, anyway they were said and stirred public interest. There are more predictions, such as of major Solar kill shot, that even president Obama signed orders in case it happens. The French foreign minister said of 500 days before climate chaos, days that expired last Fall. How much more mercy is envisioned by God, in what time frames? If the sequence given in Garabandal of Great Warning- Miracle - Chastisement is to be accomplished before the 100th anniversary of Fatima, it seems God's mercy towards the entire world would end in less than a year time. The only possible date for the Miracle in 2017 would fall on April 13, Holy Thursday. Let make a distinction, mercy to individuals who accepted God's loving call, NEVER ENDS! But God is a just judge at the same time. The Chastisement is predicted by too many prophecies and cannot be disregarded as nonsense. Moreover,t he world today is in a worse shape than during the end of the Cold War. I don't know what exactly will follow, there are variety of scenarios each of them having its own justification and logic to exist. May be a combination of them will happen in reality. What is exactly Great Warning, is it only what is said to be by numerous seers, far not only those in Garabandal? For me it should include ET-angelic component. Time will tell. Time that runs out, according to Anguera and other apparitions of Virgin Mary. That doesn't mean it has all to happen on December 1st. Every next week draws us closer to the two doors, one of which is the Door of Mercy and the other the Door of Justice. Your take on recent catholic prophecy?

17411,North Korea Threatens ‘Sacred’ Nuclear War Against Israel if this country continue supporting ISIS,"Email 
North Korea’s Foreign Ministry slammed the “shamelessness of Israel” on Friday, calling the Jewish State a “rogue group” that “poses a nuclear threat” and commits “terrorist attack[s]” against neighboring countries. On Friday the Korean Central News Agency released a statement attributed to North Korea’s Foreign Ministry that responded to comments Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made last week that were critical of the Hermit Kingdom. “This is an unpardonable insult and provocation to the dignity and social system in the DPRK and the choice made by its people,” the statement said of Netanyahu’s comments, referring to North Korea by its official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The statement then took issue with Israel’s foreign policy in the Middle East, stating: “Israel not only represents dictatorial forces for aggression that trample down the legitimate right of the Palestinian people and indiscriminately kill them but also is a rogue group that poses a nuclear threat and makes terrorist attack[s] on its neighboring countries with lots of nuclear weapons.” The statement was responding to comments Netanyahu made during a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last week, in which the Israeli leader repeatedly drew parallels between Iran and North Korea. “And, Prime Minister [Abe], we have something else in common,” Netanyahu began. “We are two peace loving democracies that face formidable threats from nearby rogue states.” “Both Iran and North Korea are governed by ruthless and extreme dictatorships, states that seek to bully and intimidate their neighbors, and in our case, to actually eradicate us from the face of the earth.” Noting that “Iran and North Korea have aggressive military nuclear programs,” Netanyahu repeated his plea to not allow Iran to use diplomacy to advance its nuclear program as he alleges North Korea did with the 1994 Agreed Framework. “Iran cannot be allowed to travel the road taken by North Korea.” It’s not the first time that North Korea has slammed Israel or even Netanyahu publicly. After Netanyahu criticized Pyongyang during a trip to Japan last year, the North Korean Foreign Ministry released a similar statement, which called Israel a ""cancer to peace in the Middle East.” It also accused Netanyahu of trying to use North Korea “to divert international criticism of Israel caused by its settlement activity and breakdown in the Middle East peace talks."" Similarly, in last week’s statement, North Korea’s Foreign Ministry said, “Everybody knows about the shamelessness of Israel telling lies and making fabrications and pointing accusing fingers to others to justify its criminal acts and evade the censure and condemnation by the international community.” Besides trading public insults, Israel has long been concerned about North Korea’s support for Arab states that are hostile to Israel, as well as Iran. In fact, during the 1973 Yom Kippur War North Korea actually deployed a squadron of MiG-21s to Egypt, which engaged in a firefight with Israeli F-4s. Neither side sustained any damage. More recently, North Korea has been accused of proliferating ballistic missiles and nuclear technology to Syria and Iran. In 2007, Israel destroyed Syria's Al Kibar Nuclear Reactor that was reportedly built by North Korean engineers.",0
17412,I’ve just been threatened by my foreign owned-privatized water co.,"Posted on October 26, 2016 by Admin 
Sent to us by a reader. 
I just found this on my front door . It’s a notice from my privatized water company threatening a water shut-off in 3 days unless I allow them to change my analog water meter (works just fine). 
At first I thought it was because I owed them money on a past -due water bills so I called this global corporation up, who incidentally is owned by get this, RWE based in Germany, and who, incidentally controls 70% of Amerika’s municipal water supplies. Don’t believe me CHECK IT OUT! 
I’m talking about American water, INc here–a facist/globalist/statist outfit if ever one existed. Hey Donald, can we shut these bastards down and let WE THE PEOPLE have our own water? Please. Pretty Please! 
Of course, our grand-parents and great grand parents never lived under this globalist hell, but I digress. 
I phoned this water co. up and I was informed by one of their know-nothings that I had to comply with the alleged PUC directive to allow them into my home or my water would be shut off until I agreed to allow them into my home. Does the word EXTORTION still have meaning 
Anyway, aside from being bilked 10 cents a gallon for what amounts to municipal waste water ( some families pay $4,000 a year for water here), 
I am faced with a dilemma! Do I allow some idiot techs to install their dangerous new smart water meter or should I follow the instructions in this youtube video? 
I await your sound advice, whomever you are reading this.

17413,U.S. Targets $1 Billion in Assets in Malaysian Embezzlement Case - The New York Times,"A $30. 6 million penthouse at the Time Warner Center in Manhattan, overlooking Central Park. A $39 million mansion in the Los Angeles hills. A $17. 5 million   in Beverly Hills. Each was bought anonymously, the source of its financing hidden. On Wednesday, the Department of Justice charged that these lavish properties were among the more than $1 billion in United States assets bought with money stolen from Malaysia’s sovereign wealth fund by people close to that country’s embattled prime minister, Najib Razak. The story line of sudden riches and lavish spending by people close to Malaysia’s prime minister has been told many times over the last year, amid rising discontent with his government and corruption investigations at home and abroad. But federal prosecutors offered the most scathingly detailed version yet as they filed a complaint to seize the assets in federal court in California. According to the complaint, the stepson, close friends and associates of the prime minister diverted more than $3 billion from Malaysia’s sovereign wealth fund  —   called 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB. Some came from an international oil deal and some from bond deals managed by Goldman Sachs. Then, the complaint said, they transferred more than $1 billion of the embezzled funds into the United States using shell companies and the client bank accounts at the   law firm Shearman  Sterling. They rose up the social ladder, spending on   parties, purchasing   real estate, financing movies like “The Wolf of Wall Street” and buying paintings by the likes of Picasso and Monet. “The money was raised by the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund and it was supposed to be used for investments that would return profits that would be used to support the Malaysian people,” Leslie R. Caldwell, the assistant attorney general who heads the department’s criminal division, said in an interview. “What happened instead was corrupt officials within 1MDB and others siphoned off a very large percentage of the money that was raised to the tune of $3 billion and used it in ways that provided absolutely no benefit to people in Malaysia other than themselves. ” The forfeiture complaint, issued by a unit known as the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, represents the largest such case brought by the Justice Department. It comes at a time of heightened concern about secrecy, shell companies and illicit money flow around the world. In the spring, the leak of the   Panama Papers cast light on secret offshore accounts held by politicians and other wealthy people from around the world. The Treasury Department announced recently that it would begin requiring banks to identify customers who use shell companies. And the department began a test program this spring requiring people who buy expensive properties in New York and Miami using cash and shell companies to report their actual identities. The United States is among several governments, including Malaysia, Singapore and Switzerland, that have investigated 1MDB. The inquiries began last year after an investigative report in The New York Times. As part of a broader examination of the use of shell companies in   real estate in the United States, The Times traced the purchases of about $150 million in residential properties in New York and in the Los Angeles area, as well as several works of art, to relatives or associates of Mr. Najib. The Justice Department named three of those people in its filings. One, Riza Aziz, is the stepson of Mr. Najib and a Hollywood film producer. Another, a financier named Jho Low, is a longtime friend of Mr. Aziz and his family. The third is Mohamed Badawy   a former official at a government fund in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, that participated in deals with Malaysia’s fund. Prosecutors also cited Khadem   who was an official at a related fund in the United Arab Emirates, as well as another individual who was an associate of Mr. Low. The people named in the complaint have not been charged with crimes. The defendants in an asset forfeiture case are the properties that the government wants to seize. But an asset complaint does not preclude criminal charges. Mr. Aziz’s movie company, Red Granite Pictures, said in a statement that it was confident that “when the facts come out, it will be clear that Riza Aziz and Red Granite did nothing wrong. ” Mr. Low, Mr. Husseiny and Mr. Qubaisi did not respond to requests for comment. In the past, representatives for Mr. Aziz and Mr. Low have acknowledged that their clients own United States properties but have said that they did nothing improper. The complaint does not name Mr. Najib, but it does cite “Malaysian Official 1,” described as a   government official who oversaw the fund and is a close relative of Mr. Aziz. Tengku Sariffuddin, Mr. Najib’s press secretary, said in a statement issued early Thursday that Malaysia would cooperate with “any lawful investigation. ” If any wrongdoing is proved, he said, “the law will be enforced without exception. ” He said the investment fund had been the subject of several investigations in Malaysia and that authorities found no crime was committed. The immediate effect of the Justice Department’s action is effectively to freeze the assets. The forfeiture process is lengthy. First, a court must make sure that no other interested party has a valid claim to the properties. Once true ownership is determined, the court must decide whether the money used to buy those assets was, in fact, earned illicitly. Only then can the government permanently seize the assets. In the nearer term, the government’s action may increase the political pressure on Mr. Najib, who has held on to power by halting investigations into the investment fund and by removing officials in his governing party who criticized him. The 1MDB fund was created in 2009 as a “strategic development company” to invest the Malaysian public’s money, primarily its oil wealth, in projects to benefit the country. Mr. Low helped set up an earlier version of the fund. The Times reported last year that Mr. Low was secretly involved in major transactions with a small oil company called PetroSaudi International and Malaysia’s public fund, which was led by Mr. Najib in his position as prime minister. Mr. Low then helped the prime minister’s stepson buy property in the United States using shell companies and finance his movie company. The Times investigation documented property transfers between Mr. Low and Mr. Aziz, including one on Hillcrest Road in Beverly Hills that was done behind the veil of a shell company, with no property transfer filed in public records, as well as the role that Mr. Low played in helping to finance Mr. Aziz’ movie business. That transaction was one of several using shell companies that were detailed in the Justice Department complaint. The complaint minutely chronicled an odyssey of embezzlement, global money flow and lavish spending in the United States. Prosecutors described several crucial transactions involving 1MDB, including the one with PetroSaudi. In that transaction, the complaint said, 1MDB officials and their associates stole about $1 billion that was supposed to be used for oil exploration. In addition, more than $2. 5 billion was stolen through bond offerings for 1MDB in 2012 and 2013 that were managed by Goldman Sachs, the complaint said. Then, according to prosecutors, Mr. Low and the others involved in the embezzlement wired hundreds of millions of dollars into the escrow account of the Shearman  Sterling law firm. Banks generally do not do due diligence on the clients of law firms, leaving that step to the law firms themselves. PetroSaudi, Goldman and Shearman were not accused of wrongdoing. Those firms did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday. 1MDB, the sovereign fund, was also not accused of wrongdoing and said in a statement that it was cooperating with investigators. According to the complaint, from October 2009 to June 2010, more than $85 million of the stolen money was spent on gambling in Las Vegas, jet rentals, yachts and payments to other individuals. It said that the $150 million used for luxury properties in New York and California came from the PetroSaudi deal, as did $44. 8 million to buy a hotel in Beverly Hills and $35. 4 million for a jet. Money from the Goldman Sachs bond deals, prosecutors said, was used to purchase $130 million worth of artwork at auction, as well as an interest in the music rights of EMI. It also helped finance the production of “The Wolf of Wall Street,” they said. According to the complaint, money from the bond offerings was put into a shell company in the British Virgin Islands and then transferred in part to Red Granite Pictures. Mr. Aziz and Mr. Husseiny previously told The Times the financing for the movie had come from personal funds of Mr. Husseiny, the complaint notes, even though the money came from 1MDB. In New York, the funds for the purchase of the Time Warner penthouse originated with 1MDB and were siphoned off from the PetroSaudi deal, the complaint said. The money was transferred through accounts in numerous countries but eventually landed in an account that Shearman  Sterling held for “client 37103 (  MISCELLANEOUS INVESTMENT MATTERS). ” The Justice Department has brought other kleptocracy cases against the children of heads of state, including one involving the daughter of the president of Uzbekistan. In many cases, Justice Department officials have found that shell companies have facilitated illicit money flow and made stopping it more difficult. The Malaysian case, Ms. Caldwell of the Justice Department said, was no exception. “This case is a perfect example of how shell companies can be used by criminals and kleptocrats and other people to steal money, hide money, launder money and make it very difficult for law enforcement to find out who controls that money,” she said. “It’s a big problem globally but it’s also a problem in the United States. ”",0
17414,"What Happens to Our Lungs, Brain & Mood When We Use a Himalayan SALT LAMPS","Keywords: cancer , diet , health , Health Benefits of Himalayan Salt lamp , mental health , Natural remedies , stress , Toxins 
The Himalayan Salt Lamps are made from Natural Himalayan Crystal Salt Rock formed millions of years ago in the foothills of Himalaya. Salt lamps are blocks of pure Himalayan salt, so they come from the same region of the world. Also known as the ‘Vitamins of the Air’, they are made from the salt that came from ancient oceans, and serve as a perfect air ionizer. How Himalayan Salt Lamps Work? 
Himalayan salt lamps emit negative ions in the air which are healthy for the human body. The ionization is supported by the bulb inside of the salt block since the bulb heats the salt block around it. Himalayan salt attracts the water around it and this process called as hygroscopic. Therefore, the Himalayan salt lamps may become dump or wet, especially in an environment with high humidity. As the bulb heats the salt lamp, the water evaporates and the negative ions are released in the air. The negative ions bind with the positive harmful ions such as allergens, molds and bacteria, and neutralize the environment in the house. Improve Blood Flow 
Particular studies have suggested that negative ions, such as those emitted by Himalayan salt lamps, can accelerate blood flow. This boost helps to improve several disorders of the vascular system and can prevent certain damage to the lungs. Purify Air 
Dust, pollen, cigarette smoke and other pollutants ruin the purity of the air we breathe, and the perfect way to neutralize it is to use Himalayan salt lamp on your room. It acts as air purifier through its ability to absorb water and evaporating them after. They attract water molecules in the air, which traps impurities in the air and leaves you with fresh, clean air: this is known as hygroscopy. Good Vibrations 
Salt has been used through out the ages to clean energies from homes and people. You can use Salt to clear crystals, clear your body and clear your home. Because Salt Crystals vibrate at a frequency closer to the earths magnetic frequency known as the shuman resonance frequency they can also help bring us back in balance. Boost Energy Levels 
Positive ions deplete the body of energy, and it is believed that Himalayan salt lamps can actually do the opposite. The negative ions increase energy levels, which yields a refreshing effect similar to the feeling of rejuvenation achieved from spending time in nature. Improve Your Breathing 
Asthma and other breathing complications can be triggered by polluted, corrupted air. Salt lamps ensure that you breathe cleaner air whenever you are around them, helping to improve breathing and prevent contaminants from entering your lungs. Other Benefits of Using Himalayan salt lamp 
Balancing pH to strengthening bones and lowering blood pressure Reduce morning sickness, some type of depression Reduce asthma attack and allergy symptoms Reduce allergic reaction",0
17415,The Best Architecture in New York of 2016 - The New York Times,"For the   at the Washington Heights Library this month, the son of a former custodian returned to his old home. He grew up in what used to be the caretaker’s apartment on the third floor. While his father shoveled coal at night to heat the place, he would go downstairs to read about boat building and navigating by the stars. Ronald Clark went on to become the first in his family to graduate from high school and college, and decades later he built himself a boat and navigated by the stars that he had learned about in the library under him. A few years ago, library officials hired the architect Andrew Berman to revamp the two upper stories of that Andrew   branch on 160th Street. Mr. Berman has now turned the   apartment into a clubhouse for teenagers, and the whole second floor into a   palace for young children, with seating nooks and   sofas under towering windows. A snaking,   bookshelf divides the room into cosseting quadrants, scaling it down for   patrons. Smart, sunny and simple, the redesign feels lofty and homey at the same time, rebooting Carnegie’s original   vision for the branches. In ways big and small, architects like Mr. Berman have changed New York City this year. Projects like the library branch made it a little more livable and humane. What follows is nothing nearly as disciplined or logical as a list of 2016’s architectural highs and lows in town. It’s more a kind of belated thank you note for a few projects that kept faith with architecture’s ideals and the city’s better self. New York got one of its beloved public spaces back. Credit Eric Hammarberg, an engineer at Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, for ensuring all that delicate, ornamental plaster on the decorated ceiling of the Rose Reading Room atop the 42nd Street library, which had begun collapsing, won’t fall down. And the former Whitney Museum of American Art on Madison Avenue, rechristened Met Breuer, was also restored. Beyer Blinder Belle, the New York architecture firm, performed an act of thoughtful and immaculate preservation. This   1960s building, now with its patina of age, is finally coming to be recognized for what it is: a practical Modernist landmark of exceptional finesse and a surprisingly good neighbor. The Roy and Diana Vagelos Education Center, devised by Diller Scofidio  Renfro (in collaboration with Gensler) is a whimsical    exclamation mark on Columbia University’s Upper Manhattan medical campus near the George Washington Bridge. The   tower’s   face looks south. It presents a cheerfully teetering stack of cantilevered terraces, indoor bleacher seats, lounges and stairs. They spill toward a handsome   amphitheater linked by steps to the sloping sidewalk. One can picture a giant pinball bouncing from the top of Vagelos and rolling down Haven Avenue. The architects call this sunny,   south side the “study cascade. ” Offices and classrooms fill the more conventional north half of the tower, which is clad in a fritted milky curtain wall that’s less striking outside but mitigates solar heat gain.     anatomy classrooms tucked behind the cascade are part of a deceptively pragmatic layout. A restrained palette  —   of white, orange and Douglas fir panels stained a burnt sienna  —   balances the sculptural gymnastics. The other day I found students poring over their laptops in the   lounge. Some grumbled a little about minor   stuff like not enough electrical outlets, but they all said they loved the architecture. I do, too. It’s what medical schools generally aren’t: playful, welcoming, warm. And when the sun sets, the center becomes a beacon in the neighborhood. Farther south, Columbia’s   Manhattanville campus began to take shape this fall with the construction of an arts hub and completion of the Jerome L. Greene Science Center, an urbane    behemoth by Renzo Piano rising beside the aged No. 1 subway viaduct, near the intersection of Broadway and 125th Street. The building is a      nexus for neuroscience. Four   glass blocks surround a glassy core with meeting rooms. The basic shape is nothing pyrotechnic, but, as usual with Mr. Piano, the nub is in the details and in the light. A   curtain wall, the two layers separated by a muffling pillow of air, lets light flood in while reducing the rumble of the elevated subway. I write these words inside another of Mr. Piano’s buildings, staring from a glass cubicle through several more layers of glass across a   courtyard. My colleagues across the court look almost immaterial. The Greene Center engineers even greater illusions of ethereal weightlessness, the layered glass membranes held in equilibrium by a clockwork of steel beams and cables, tinted powder blue. Like church spires, tall twin smokestacks announce the campus from afar, declaring the center a factory for ideas. The industrial nostalgia recalls Mr. Piano’s   new Whitney Museum and is clearly meant to substitute midcentury symbols of modern commerce for the usual classic emblems of institutional authority. A plaza stands in for the ancient agora. The center will anchor one side of the evolving Manhattanville project, with its multidisciplinary aspirations, underground passageways for Columbia people and variety of   public spaces. These are intended partly to appease angry former residents of the neighborhood troubled by Columbia’s gentrifying expansion, and also to signal that the university is opening itself up. Mr. Piano envisions a kind of Italian piazza, democratic and energized. We’ll see how further development follows through on that promise. Several weekends this summer, I hopped the ferry with the family for Governors Island. Back in 2003, the federal government sold the island to the city, which got a derelict former military base that included some lovely historic officers’ homes. Leslie Koch was hired in 2006 as president of the Trust for Governors Island. She enlisted Adriaan Geuze of West 8, the landscape architecture firm. Ms. Koch and her team spent years just watching how people used the island, seeing what was wanted. They responded with food carts,   Adirondack chairs, bike shares, children’s programs and art projects. The last, most ambitious phase of redevelopment was completed this summer:   hills (cost: $71 million, half public, half private money). A hill with twisty slides for kids became an instant sensation another features a sculpture by Rachel Whiteread. The tallest has a killer view of the Statue of Liberty and much of the skyline. Mr. Geuze’s design for the island established a   mark for resilient planning, taking into account not just sea rise and storm surges but also social cohesion. Watch the mix of parents and children around the slides, sprinklers and food carts on a warm summer Saturday afternoon. Governors Island is New York as a diverse and joyful city. Mr. Geuze and Ms. Koch, who stepped down this year, deserve medals. Now City Hall has to find tenants to help pay for the island’s upkeep. Big office or apartment towers would undo much of what has been accomplished. Here’s hoping that some venturesome,   university or cultural institution is seeking a beautiful home. Most rental apartment towers end up   or glass nonentities, invisible at best. Not Via 57 West. No building redrew the city’s western skyline more ingeniously than Bjarke Ingels’s first completed project in New York: a warped, mountainous pyramid hugging the Hudson River at 57th Street. Already filmmakers have exploited it in “Doctor Strange. ” The shape is not a pyramid, actually, but a hyperbolic paraboloid, rectangular on the ground, with a swooping   a bit like the billowed sail of a ship, sweeping upward from 12th Avenue to the mast’s peak at the northeast corner of the site, 467 feet high. Looking from 11th Avenue and 58th Street, the   building resembles a spire. From elsewhere, it unfurls, its   balconies, angled toward the Hudson, making hundreds of facets in the   skin, which shimmer with the changing light. This is a building very much designed outside in, notwithstanding that the Danish Mr. Ingels has trumpeted the nice “Scandimerican” stylings of the lounges and handsome    lobby and the   function of the landscaped private courtyard at Via 57, which recalls his design for the 8 House in Copenhagen. Sliced from the center of the building, the courtyard leads to riverfront terraces with outdoor grills and a host of indoor amenities. I’ll be curious to know how much this fosters community. The amenities require a fee. Twenty percent of the 709 apartments are set aside for subsidized tenants, in return for which the developer enjoyed the usual tax breaks. Otherwise, Via 57 seems to market itself toward brokers and Westchester doctors who can pay top dollar for the light but sometimes cramped apartments off   corridors, a hike from the nearest subway. Of course, tenants are also paying for the pleasure and cachet of living in a striking work of architecture. New York’s former planning commissioner Amanda Burden deserves a   here for pushing Douglas Durst, the developer, and Mr. Ingels to cook up something bold at such a conspicuous site. The three of them have given the city a new spectacle. O. K. I get one Grinch moment, not about the $4 billion shopping mall attached to a PATH station at ground zero or the election of a president who, among other things, believes privatization is the answer to what ails the nation’s infrastructure. No, I want to grouse about one of the sadder excuses for architecture completed this year. You can nominate your own candidate. This one is a kind of sleeper, at Mulry Square, at the intersection of Greenwich and Seventh Avenues, in Greenwich Village. There the Metropolitan Transportation Authority finished building a $180 million emergency ventilation plant. The site is opposite the new St. Vincent’s Triangle Park and AIDS Memorial. Once upon a time, this is where I stood guard as a     monitor from P. S. 41, the school up the block, until my boss and classmate Trippy West suspended me for reporting late at the end of a lunch period. But I digress. Neighborhood groups, along with the city’s Landmarks Preservation Commission, acknowledging the necessity for a “fan plant,” pleaded for years with the authority for a design less hideous than a windowless concrete bunker and a few forlorn benches. Transit officials paid no attention. With a   fence around the base and part of a   townhouse facade, topped by a   cornice, the facility seems an intentional slap in the face of every New Yorker who hoped for a structure that, if not actually good, might at least be innocuous. It’s also a reminder that infrastructure projects like this were once occasions for   expressions of architectural ambition. Walk just a few blocks from Mulry Square to the   Metropolitan Transportation Authority substation at Greenwich Avenue and 13th Street, built during the early 1930s. Its geometric decorations, embossed aluminum doors, limestone frieze, Flemish brick coursing and square turrets make it one of New York’s Art Deco gems and a neighborhood landmark. The contrast between the bunker and the substation can make you weep. But it also proves what a difference good architecture makes, to New Yorkers’ daily lives and to the   welfare of the city.",0
17416,Trump Voter Beaten By Black Mob: “You Voted Trump. You Gonna Pay For That Sh*t”,"
This article was written by Paul Joseph Watson and originally published at Infowars.com . 
Editor’s Comment: Violence and retribution for the election of Trump has proven to be the result of a media-driven attack on his character. For months now, the pundits and columnists have done nothing but tell the population that Trump supporters are racists, etc. and now racially-motivated beatings are taking place in the street without any other pretext or provocation. 
Are they proud of themselves yet? And how far will this violence spread? 
Shock Video: Black Mob Viciously Beats White Trump Voter 
by Paul Joseph Watson
Shocking video out of Chicago shows a mob of young black men viciously beating an older white man because he voted for Donald Trump, dragging him through the streets as he hangs out of the back of his car.

The clip shows the thugs repeatedly screaming, “you voted Donald Trump” as they assault the victim from every angle while others steal his belongings.
“You voted Trump,” the mob screams, “You gonna pay for that sh*t.”
Another woman shouts “beat his ass,” while another man is heard laughing before remarking, “Don’t vote Trump.”
A second video of the incident which is dubbed with the “F**k Donald Trump” song, a phrase now being chanted by “protesters” across the country, shows one of the attackers driving away in the man’s vehicle while his hand is still stuck in the window as the car drags him down the street.

“The scene is frankly reminiscent of a lynching,” remarks Chris Menahan .
It is not even clear if the victim was a Trump supporter. Presumably, the mob used that as an excuse to beat and rob him.
YouTube quickly deleted the video, but it has been mirrored on numerous different websites.
If the roles had been reversed, and Trump supporters had been caught on tape viciously beating a black Hillary voter, this would be a national news story right now.
As it is, you won’t see this on CNN any time soon.

ISIS barbarians used an industrial dough kneader to kill 250 children, and roasted adults in a bakery oven, according to a shocking new report. 
In an interview with the humanitarian organization Roads of Success, Syrian mom Alice Assaf went into chilling detail about the atrocities the jihadists committed about two years ago in the town of Douma, explaining that some of the youngsters were even decapitated in front of their parents, according to the Express. 
“We heard that the militants grabbed six strong men working at the bakery and burned them inside the oven. We knew them,” Assaf told Dr. Yvette Isaac, who works for the advocacy group, according to the UK Mirror. 
“After that, they caught some 250 kids and kneaded them like dough in the bakery dough machine,” Assaf said, according to media reports. “They were put in the dough mixer, they were kneaded. The oldest one of them was four-years-old.” 
ISIS transported hundreds of girls to the city of Douma, which has been at the center of the Syrian civil war, to be slaughtered. ISIS has been systematically killing non-Muslims, and the majority of its victims at the time were Christian. 
Assaf said her own son, George, was killed by the radical militants after he refused to switch to a Muslim name. 
“My son said to me, ‘No, mother, I don’t want to die with an identity not my own. I prefer to die with the name George,'” Assaf said, according to the Christian Post. 
Assaf added, “I asked my son then to hide, but he refused and said, ‘I don’t want to hide myself. You are the one who taught me to follow what Christ said’ — ‘whoever denies me before man, I will also deny before my father who is in Heaven.'” 
Dr. Isaac reported the savage slayings to a member of the UK Parliament, Fiona Bruce, who recently recounted the horrifying testimony to her colleagues in open chambers. 
“She showed us recent film footage of herself talking with mothers–more than one– who had seen their own children crucified,” Bruce said. 
“She told us of a mother with a two-month-old baby. When [ISIS] knocked at the front door of her house and ordered the entire family out, she pleaded with them to let her collect her child from another room,” Bruce said. 
“She told us of a mother with a two-month-old baby,” Bruce continued. When [ISIS] knocked at the front door of her house and ordered the entire family out, she pleaded with them to let her collect her child from another room. They told her, ‘No. Go. It is ours now.’”",0

17422,"High in Tower, Trump Reads, Tweets and Plans - The New York Times","Donald J. Trump sits high in Trump Tower in New York, spending hours on the phone with friends, television personalities and donors to ask if they know people to recommend for his cabinet. He joins a daily morning transition meeting with his family and staff, but still maintains the routine that sustained him during the campaign: starting his day at 5 a. m. reading The New York Post and The New York Times, then switching on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” whose   Joe Scarborough he once publicly savaged but now often seeks out for advice. He gets angry when members of his inner circle get too much of the spotlight, as Rudolph W. Giuliani did when headlines about his millions of dollars in speaking fees appeared as the former New York mayor was publicly promoting himself to be Mr. Trump’s secretary of state. And Mr. Trump has happily resumed control of his Twitter feed, using it to bash targets in the news media and criticize the cast of the Broadway musical “Hamilton” for imploring Vice   Mike Pence, who was in the audience Friday night, to govern on behalf of all Americans. As a parade of job seekers, TV talking heads and statesmen like Henry Kissinger paraded through the lobby of Trump Tower this past week, Mr. Trump ran his presidential transition from his triplex on the 58th floor much the way he ran his campaign and his business before that  —   schmoozing, rewarding loyalty, fomenting infighting among advisers and moving confidently forward through a series of fits and starts. President Obama, who met with Mr. Trump two days after the election, has held out hope that the gravity of the presidency will change the former reality show star. But people close to the      say that he has such   habits formed by fame, wealth and the freedom to have done whatever he wanted that they remain skeptical, at least for now, that he will transform to fit the constraints of the White House. “The presidency may change him eventually, but it’s not going to change him initially,” said Barry Bennett, a former senior adviser to the Trump campaign and a Republican strategist. “He’s a man who likes a lot of input from a lot of people, and he’s someone who has an incredible instinct for the American people. ” People close to Mr. Trump nonetheless say he is more focused now than he was in the first few days after his surprise victory. He was nervous and jolted, they said, by the   Oval Office meeting with Mr. Obama, and for the first time appeared to take in the enormousness of the job. He is proud, they say, that he has so rapidly named people for his cabinet and senior staff, including a group of hawks and   loyalists:  Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama as attorney general,  Michael T. Flynn as national security adviser,  Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas as director of the C. I. A. and Stephen K. Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News, as chief strategist. “Ahead of schedule, under budget, high energy, trust and loyalty  —   there’s just a pattern to the whole thing,” said Richard F. Hohlt, a longtime Republican consultant in Washington. “That’s his mark of success. ” Loyalty, however, goes only so far. There were initial reports from senior officials within Mr. Trump’s orbit that Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s most fervent supporter in the campaign’s final weeks, was the leading candidate for secretary of state. But the headlines about Mr. Giuliani’s business interests bothered Mr. Trump, who was urged by several business leaders and some media hosts to reconsider the option. Suddenly, he arranged a Saturday meeting with one of his fiercest critics, Mitt Romney, at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N. J. Transition officials say the meeting with Mr. Romney, a moderate Republican who was the party’s nominee for president in 2012, may not have been simply for show. They say that Mr. Trump believes that Mr. Romney, with his patrician bearing, looks the part of a top diplomat right out of “central casting”  —   the same phrase Mr. Trump used to describe Mike Pence before choosing him as his running mate. Yet Mr. Trump loves the tension and drama of a selection process, and has sought to stoke it. A senior adviser described the meeting, in part, as Mr. Romney simply coming to pay his respects to the   and “kiss his ring. ” Mr. Trump, who has been known to act precipitously against people who have not pleased him, did so again this past week when he removed Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, another longtime loyalist, as the head of his transition. People close to Mr. Trump say that, among other concerns, he determined that Mr. Christie had to go after two former top aides were convicted by a federal jury on all charges stemming from a 2013 scheme to close access lanes at the George Washington Bridge to punish a New Jersey mayor who declined to endorse Mr. Christie for  . And Mr. Trump was angered when Mr. Christie did not defend him after    audio emerged of the candidate boasting about committing sexual assaults. Mr. Trump also likes to surprise, and enjoys the worldwide speculation he sets off with his Twitter posts. And after he became upset by Mr. Giuliani’s headlines, his aides leaked the news that he was considering Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina for secretary of state  —   speculation that has since faded as Mr. Romney’s prospects have risen. Showmanship remains central to Mr. Trump, who on Thursday held his first meeting as   with a foreign leader, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. The setting was Mr. Trump’s marble and gold, Louis   residence on the 58th floor, with sweeping views of New York and Central Park. Mr. Trump, with General Flynn at his side, sat next to Mr. Abe under an enormous crystal chandelier as Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka looked on. The formality of the setting contrasted with the freewheeling style that Mr. Trump adopts in his cluttered corner office on the 26th floor, where aides, his children and his longtime assistant, Rhona Graff, move busily in and out as he holds court behind his desk. Mr. Trump, who does not use a computer or read online, does keep an eye on the television, particularly the   news about himself. Most information he takes in is in person or on the phone. He is worried, his aides say, that he will not be able to keep his Android phone once he gets to the White House and wonders aloud how isolated he will become  —   and whether he will be able to keep in touch with his friends  —   without it as president. He continues to discuss with the Secret Service how much he can return on weekends to Trump Tower, and still expects to use the Bedminster golf club and his private    resort in Palm Beach, Fla. as vacation retreats. The Trump International Hotel in Washington, just five blocks from the White House, could also take on an outsize role in the Trump administration. His children may stay there when they come to the nation’s capital, and there is chatter that it may supplant Blair House, which traditionally hosts foreign dignitaries visiting the president. But for now, Mr. Trump seems most comfortable running the show from Trump Tower. “I’ve witnessed him as a businessman sitting at the desk I’ve witnessed him as a potential candidate sitting at the desk I’ve witnessed him as a candidate sitting at the desk and I’ve now witnessed him as the   sitting at the desk,” said Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser. “It’s a comfortable environment,” she added, “but now the stakes are higher. ”",0
17423,"3 Hags Steal Trump Signs For Hillary, Slapped With Hilarious Justice","Share This When 3 female Hillary supporters decided to steal dozens of Trump-Pence signs, they had no idea whose attention they caught. 
Three liberal women were so upset over Donald Trump’s rising poll numbers that they decided to go around stealing the Republican candidate’s campaign signs off of citizens’ lawns. However, just as they were celebrating their bounty on the side of the road, they were instantly smacked with a perfect dose of American justice. 
Liberals are all for free speech unless you disagree with them. In that case, they’ll instantly shut down the conversation by labeling you a racist bigot who hates women. If they’re feeling especially unpatriotic, they’ll let you know that your opinion is hate speech. This is exactly what a group of liberal feminists is claiming after they were recently caught depriving others of their freedom of expression. 
Elizabeth “Betta” Stothart, Martha Murdick, and Heidi Kendrick were apparently so angry about Trump’s “locker room talk” leaked just in time for the election that they decided to take matters into their own hands. The cowardly trio headed down Route 1 in Falmouth, Maine, plucking Trump-Pence signs from people’s yards and tossing them into their vehicle. What the entitled misandrists didn’t realize was that a heaping dose of karma was headed their way. 
Fox News reports that the women pulled over on the side of the road on October 14, proudly admiring their unlawful deed, when suddenly a police officer approached the guilty party. Tipped off by their late-night suspicious behavior, the officer confiscated 36 stolen signs and made a report of the crime. 
Humiliated that their own ridiculous conduct was found out, the 3 thought that a warning would be the end of their embarrassment. Adding to their dismay, David Jones, the chairman of the Making Maine Great Again political action committee, heard about the sign thieves and immediately pressed charges of theft against all 3 women. Elizabeth “Betta” Stothart (pictured) and her accomplices, Martha Murdick and Heidi Kendrick, are scheduled to appear in court. 
“I have a lot of explaining and apologizing to do,” Stothart wrote. “I also have advice for anyone who might be on the verge of doing something stupid. It’s not worth it. Find a healthy way to express your outrage.” 
The Hillary supporters are scheduled to appear in court on December 15, they still can’t believe that stealing is breaking the law and, surprisingly to them, they are not above the law like their beloved candidate. 
The women have been charged with theft and it’s reported that the chairman isn’t letting this go so easily. As cases of campaign sign theft are on the rise, these 3 are likely to be made the example to other potential political thieves. 
In fact, Mad World News reported last week that a Democratic activist was arrested for stealing dozens of Trump-Pence signs in Northfield, Illinois. However, he was only charged with driving with a suspended license and was allowed to keep the stolen property. 
As expected, one of the women made a pathetic attempt to excuse her juvenile behavior. In a Washington Post opinion piece, Stothart whines that she was “angry” about the women who have accused Trump of sexual harassment and abuse. Of course, she has no outrage over the women and children that Bill Clinton has sexually assaulted, not to mention the victims Hillary threatened and harassed to protect her sexual predator husband. 
Further insulting actual victims of assault, Stothart likens her selective outrage over Trump signs to being “assaulted,” adding that it is “rude” for Trump supporters to place signs expressing their political stance on their private property but not equally as offensive for Democrats to show their support for heinous crimes like, say, butchering partially-birthed babies or voting for a woman who laughed about defending a child rapist who she knew was guilty. 
Leftist hacks like Stothart and her gang of mid-life crisis buddies give women a bad name, contributing to the stereotype that the female gender cannot control their emotions. Ending on a comical note, Stothart tells readers “for God’s sake, please, vote.” That’s right. A voter for the party that booed God’s name 3 times at their national convention is telling everyone to vote — unless, of course, you’re voting for Trump. In that case, her tolerance extends as far as your front lawn.",0

17425,Seven Major Problems with James Comey’s Credibility,"TEL AVIV  —   Earlier this week, the New York Times reported that President Donald Trump tried during a private meeting to convince   Director James Comey to drop an investigation into Michael Flynn, who was fired as national security adviser. [The charge, strongly denied by the White House, relies on a memo the Times reported was written by Comey shortly after the meeting with Trump, propelling the issue of the fired FBI chief’s credibility to centerstage.   Below, in no particular order, are seven significant problems with Comey’s credibility:     Comey repeatedly failed to seek the recusal of Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch from the Hillary Clinton email probe despite his reported concerns about her partiality. In an extensive article published last month that included interviews with more than 30 current and former law enforcement officials, congressional officials and other government employees, the New York Times reported on numerous major concerns Comey had about Lynch’s intentions toward the Clinton email probe.  According to the report, Comey was aware of the existence of a document written by a Democratic operative that allegedly indicated Lynch would have protected Clinton in the email probe. The newspaper reported that “Mr. Comey believed (Lynch) had subtly helped play down the Clinton investigation. ” Adding even more intrigue to the matter, the FBI had further information that the alleged Lynch document had been hacked by Russian intelligence, leading Comey to fear that Moscow could leak the document to call into question the independence of the U. S. government’s Clinton email probe, the Times reported. Yet Comey didn’t seek Lynch’s recusal. The Times further reported on Comey’s concerns after Lynch’s infamous tarmac meeting at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in which former President Bill Clinton, the husband of the FBI’s main subject in a criminal probe, boarded the attorney general’s plane and reportedly stayed there for about 20 minutes. In a letter sent earlier this month from Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein recommending that Comey be fired, Rosenstein admonished Comey for failing to seek Lynch’s recusal from the Clinton email probe and instead bypassing the Justice Department to make public pronouncements about the case. “The Director now defends his decision by asserting that he believed Attorney General Lynch had a conflict,” Rosenstein wrote. “But the FBI Director is never empowered to supplant federal prosecutors and assume command of the Justice Department. There is a   process for other officials to step in when a conflict requires the recusal of the Attorney General. ”   Comey violated FBI tradition, bypassed the Justice Department and went rogue on several occasions in a manner that clearly impacted the 2016 presidential election. Instead of seeking Lynch’s recusal, as outlined above, Comey decided to go at it alone on the Clinton email probe, taking matters into his own hands and making his public pronouncements about Clinton’s email case without the Justice Department. He did this at an infamous news conference on July 5, 2016 at which Comey criticized Clinton’s private email server as “extremely careless” before finally stating that “no charges are appropriate in this case. ”  The Times‘ extensive April 22 report cited former Justice officials as “deeply skeptical” of Comey’s alleged reasoning that he took the public lead because Lynch was compromised: Former Justice Department officials are deeply skeptical of this account. If Mr. Comey believed that Ms. Lynch were compromised, they say, why did he not seek her recusal? Mr. Comey never raised this issue with Ms. Lynch or the deputy attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, former officials said. Mr. Comey’s defenders regard this as one of the untold stories of the Clinton investigation, one they say helps explain his  . But former Justice Department officials say the F. B. I. never uncovered evidence tying Ms. Lynch to the document’s author, and are convinced that Mr. Comey wanted an excuse to put himself in the spotlight. Comey’s injection into the presidential race did not end there. Less than two weeks before the election, the FBI discovered a trove of Clinton emails on the laptop of Anthony Weiner. Some of the emails, according to reports, originated on Clinton’s old BlackBerry server that she used before setting up her private home server and some believe may have contained the deleted messages. Comey’s decision this time centered on whether to follow FBI tradition and keep quiet about the reopening of the case, or inform Congress about the ongoing investigation, which, the Times related, “everyone acknowledged would create a political furor. ” Eventually, Comey decided to go rogue again and inform Congress. Lynch was against the decision, the Times reported, and the Justice Department implored the FBI not to impact the presidential campaign in its final days. The Times added that “even at the F. B. I. agents who supported their   director were stunned. ” “Career prosecutors and political appointees” at the Justice Department quietly criticized not only Comey but Lynch for failing to stop the FBI director, the Times documented. A chorus of former attorneys general and deputy attorneys general from across the political spectrum publicly criticized Comey’s move.   Comey made legal pronouncements about Clinton’s email case. Comey’s July 5 press conference first stated Clinton was “extremely careless” with her email server and then took the highly unusual step of declaring that “no charges are appropriate in this case. ” With his pronouncements, Comey offered judgments and legal conclusions many argue are out of the purview of the FBI, which is charged with documenting evidence and handing it over to the Justice Department. The Times, in its April 22 report, cited unnamed “frustrated” prosecutors at the Justice Department complaining that Comey should have first consulted with them.   Comey reportedly allowed Lynch to persuade him into publicly minimizing the FBI’s criminal investigation into Clinton’s email server. According to the same extensive April 22 report in the New York Times, Lynch, an Obama appointee, convinced Comey to use the word “matter” instead of “investigation” when the FBI director publicly addressed the criminal investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server. This despite the Justice Department knowing the FBI probe was not only an official investigation but a criminal investigation. Comey reportedly caved in and called the investigation a “matter” even though the Times documented his concerns about Lynch’s intentions toward Clinton. The Times reported on a meeting between FBI and Justice officials at which, according to the newspaper’s characterization, “Lynch told him (Comey) to be even more circumspect: Do not even call it an investigation, she said, according to three people who attended the meeting. Call it a ‘matter. ’” Continued the Times’ report: Ms. Lynch reasoned that the word “investigation” would raise other questions: What charges were being investigated? Who was the target? But most important, she believed that the department should stick by its policy of not confirming investigations. It was a    decision. But Mr. Comey and other F. B. I. officials regarded it as disingenuous in an investigation that was so widely known. And Mr. Comey was concerned that a Democratic attorney general was asking him to be misleading and line up his talking points with Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, according to people who spoke with him afterward. As the meeting broke up, George Z. Toscas, a national security prosecutor, ribbed Mr. Comey. “I guess you’re the Federal Bureau of Matters now,” Mr. Toscas said, according to two people who were there. Even though Comey reportedly had concerns about Lynch’s motivations, he went along and did not call the criminal investigation an investigation. “I am confident we have the resources and the personnel assigned to the matter,” Comey stated mere days after the meeting with Lynch.   Comey denied leaking under oath  —   days before leaks from a    dinner with Trump. In his testimony earlier this month, Comey portrayed himself as someone who does not leak information to the news media, denying he had ever been an anonymous source for news reports related to the investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race.  Comey further testified that he never authorized anyone else at the FBI to serve as an anonymous source in news media coverage of that investigation or the agency’s probe into Hillary Clinton’s private email server. Nine days later, after Comey’s firing, the New York Times published intimate details allegedly from inside a    dinner at the White House between Comey and Trump that took place seven days after the president was sworn in.  The article quoted liberally from “two people who have heard [Comey’s] account of the dinner” in what seems to be a leak from Comey’s camp to fight back after he was fired by Trump. At one point in the article, the Times describes the sources as “associates” of Comey’s. The White House disputed the Times’ dinner account, which claims that Trump asked Comey to pledge loyalty to him. That leak was followed up by another   leak, first published by the New York Times, claiming that Trump attempted during a private meeting to convince Comey to drop the investigation into Flynn.  6 —   Comey was accused of mischaracterizing Huma Abedin’s role regarding emails found by the FBI on Anthony Weiner’s laptop. Speaking under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on FBI oversight, Comey stated that Hillary Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin “forwarded hundreds and thousands” of emails to the laptop of her estranged husband, former Congressman Anthony Weiner. That mischaracterization prompted the FBI to release a supplement to clarify Comey’s statement. CNN reported on the supplement to Comey’s testimony:  The note, signed by Gregory Brower, assistant director of the FBI’s Office of Congressional Affairs, clarified that the “hundreds of thousands of emails” that Comey said were “forwarded” from Abedin to her husband’s email “included emails transferred via backups as well as manual forwarding. ”   …     While some of those emails may have been sent directly from Huma in order to be printed, officials told CNN, the number was far fewer than the amount Comey described. The FBI confirmed the distinction in its letter Tuesday, which read: “Although we do not know the exact numbers, based on its investigation, the FBI believes it is reasonable to conclude that most of the emails found on Mr. Weiner’s laptop computer related to the Clinton investigation occurred as a result of a backup of personal electronic devices, with a small number a result of manual forwarding by Ms. Abedin to Mr. Weiner. ” 7  —   Comey reportedly allowed the Obama administration to “shut down” a request to publicize the Russia probe last summer, raising questions about political motives. In March, Newsweek reported that Comey first wanted to go public as early as the summer of 2016 about the agency’s information on alleged Russian interference in the presidential campaign. However, Obama administration officials blocked Comey from making public statements, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter speaking to Newsweek. “The White House shut it down,” one source told the magazine, explaining that Comey had pitched the idea of writing an oped about the subject during a White House Situation Room meeting in June or July. “He had a draft of it or an outline.

17426,Tancredo - Illegal Aliens and Violent Crime: Some Amazing Facts - Breitbart,"Take a look at the crime statistics for just one state, Texas. A 2017 report by the Texas Department of Public Safety reveals that over the period from June 1, 2011 to February 28, 2017, the 215, 000 criminal aliens who were booked into Texas jails were collectively charged with 566, 000 offenses, including 1, 167 homicides and 6, 098 sexual assaults, with a total of 257, 000 convictions. [By the way, Texas has less than half the criminal alien jail and prison population of California, which has over 100, 000 criminal aliens occupying facilities supported by California taxpayers. (For 2009 incarceration numbers for each state, see Appendix III of the 2011 GAO report, here.)  It’s no secret that progressive politicians in hundreds of cities and counties are opposing the Trump administration initiatives to end   “sanctuary” policies. What those politicians never talk about is the fact that those policies continue to allow tens of thousands of criminal aliens to go free instead of facing deportation proceedings as prescribed by federal law. According to a summary report on sanctuary policies from Federation for American Immigration Reform and numerous media reports, it’s not just San Francisco, New York and Chicago that are obstructing federal deportation of violent criminals. About 300 local city and county jurisdictions have adopted official policies to refuse cooperation with immigration enforcement in open violation of federal law. And California is not the only place with a statewide sanctuary policy. For a map of principal sanctuary jurisdictions, go here. You might think that Texas is a state with uniform cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, but you would be wrong. The capital city of Austin recently announced it will defy President Trump, the Department of Homeland Security and the Governor of Texas by continuing its sanctuary policies. Yes, there’s a new sheriff in town, and citizens will soon have new protections if the new federal policies are followed. President Trump’s January 25 executive order is only the beginning of the fight, and we can expect the ACLU and other open borders advocates will challenge new enforcement policies in federal courts. Here is the political reality. Sanctuary policies across the country are an important pillar of the “Obama Legacy,” so progressives and the leaders of the Democratic Party are not going to abandon that legacy. This commitment by progressives makes immigration enforcement and the end of local sanctuary policies far more of a political issue than in the past. Until Obama’s election in 2008, there were only a handful of sanctuary cities across the nation, but the number skyrocketed after 2008 and now numbers over 300 according to a recent report from the Center for Immigration Studies. A 2016 report by the Inspector General at the U. S. Department of Justice found 155 jurisdictions that limit or restrict cooperation with the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. But as we said, there is a new sheriff in town  —   and his deputies have been busy. Trump’s January 25 Executive Order was followed on February 20 by a Department of Homeland Security Memorandum titled, “Enforcement of the Immigration Laws to Serve the National Interest. ” It is well worth reading in full. This directive has many features that have already been welcomed as a breath of fresh air in the ranks of the officers of the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. One section of the DHS Memorandum that has been largely overlooked by the media could well serve as a giant spotlight on the devastation in local communities caused by sanctuary policies. A 2011 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report revealed that the typical criminal alien inmate in federal prisons had been arrested 12 times for various offenses. On page 17 that GAO report is a summary of the arrest data for the criminal aliens in state and federal jails: They were arrested for a total of about 2. 9 million offenses, averaging about 12[each]  …     slightly lower than the 13 offenses per criminal alien we reported in 2005. The Texas DPS report cited above said criminal aliens arrested over that   period had been arrested for an average of 2. 5 crimes. Taking the average number of crimes committed by ARRESTED criminal aliens as five, and extrapolating from the data on the total number of criminal alien inmates in state and local jails in 2016, the approximately 300, 000 criminal aliens in state and local jails are responsible for over 1, 500, 00 crimes. In Colorado, the 2, 039 criminal aliens in the state prison system in 2016 were 14. 7 percent of a prison population of 13, 873. The 2016 annual report on the criminal aliens in the Colorado state prison system is here. The 14. 7 percent can be easily calculated from the 2, 039 inmates in a total prison population of 13, 873 found in this document. This 14. 7 percent is over four times the illegal alien population share of total state population, estimated at 200, 000 in 2013 by the Pew Hispanic Center. It is true that even under Obama’s lax policies on enforcement and deportations, local ICE offices routinely intercepted criminal alien felons being released from state prisons and deported the most violent among them. But it was a far different story for the thousands of criminals released from LOCAL jails in dozens of sanctuary jurisdictions, where federal ICE detainers were not being honored and violent criminals were routinely released to commit other crimes. Even the   Denver Post could not ignore two recent cases where an ICE detainer request was ignored and illegal aliens were released by the Denver jail and then arrested for homicide only weeks later. One case was a    accident that left a young woman dead, and the second was a brutal murder at a light rail stop. Unfortunately, our nation’s intrepid journalists are not routinely reporting on the thousands of crimes committed by criminal aliens who have been in police custody but then released because of sanctuary policies. It is conceivable that at least a half million serious crimes annually could be prevented if all illegal aliens convicted of felonies were deported  —   and then prevented from returning by effective border controls.",0
17427,Suspected Palestinian Car-Ramming Attack Targets Israelis at Bus Stop,"TEL AVIV  —   A Palestinian wielding a knife rammed a vehicle into an Israeli bus stop in the West Bank and was shot dead by Israeli forces responding to the attack, the army said. [Israeli civilians waiting at the bus stop were not injured in the attempted attack, according to initial reports.  The Israel Defense Forces released the following statement on the matter, which they sent by text message to Breitbart News and other agencies: A short while ago a Palestinian rammed a vehicle into a bus stop at the entrance to Kokhav Ya’akov,   of Ramallah. No injuries have been reported. In response to the immediate threat, forces fired at the attacker, resulting in his death. A knife was found in the attackers possession. The IDF said it was looking into the incident as a “suspected car attack. ” The Times of Israel has more: According to the military, the driver swerved from his lane and crashed his truck into the metal bollards surrounding a bus stop near the Ma’ale Michmash settlement in the central West Bank.   …    The driver was later identified by the Palestinian health ministry as Hussein Salem Abu Ghosh, 24, from Qalandiya. According to the Ynet news site, Abu Ghosh is the cousin of a terrorist, also named Hussein Abu Ghosh from the Qalandiya refugee camp, who killed    Shlomit Krigman and injured another woman in the Beit Horon settlement exactly one year ago. A video of the aftermath of the attack can be seen below: Following the attempted   a second attack targeted Israeli troops near the village of Aboud, which is close to the scene of the attempted ramming attack. The IDF stated: Shots were fired from a passing vehicle at an IDF post adjacent to the village of Aboud. No injuries were sustained. In response, IDF forces fired towards the gunman, confirming a hit. Upon searching the vehicle, forces found a “Carlo” firearm. The assailant is receiving medical treatment at the scene. The IDF provided Breitbart Jerusalem with an image of the “Carlo” firearm it said was uncovered in the assailant’s vehicle: Earlier this month, a Palestinian carried out a deadly   terrorist attack in Jerusalem, killing four and injuring 13, some seriously. Today’s attempted attack targeting civilians at a bus stop represents what seems to be the continued stepping up of terrorist attacks in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem following last month’s United Nations Security Council   resolution calling the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem “occupied Palestinian territories. ” Israeli defense officials here have also noted a sharp and alarming increase in Palestinian   attacks since the UN resolution. Some of the holiest sites in Judaism are located in eastern Jerusalem and the West Bank, including the Western Wall and Temple Mount in Jerusalem’s Old City the Cave of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs in Hebron, which was home to the oldest continuous Jewish community in the world until the Jews of Hebron were massacred and expelled the Tomb of Rachel in Bethlehem and Joseph’s Tomb in Nablus  —   biblical Shechem.

The Russian Navy’s aircraft carrier group is ready to launch military strikes targeting terrorists in the province of Aleppo in the next 24 hours, Gazeta.ru reported Tuesday, citing a source in the Russian Ministry of Defense. The attack will likely target militants outsde the city of Aleppo, with Kalibr cruise missiles. According to the report, the Admiral Kuznetsov battlegroup has completed its deployment to the Mediterranean Sea and is getting ready to strike. 
After the success in the 1070 Apartment Project and nearby areas, the Syrian army and its allies attacked Jaish al-Fatah militants in the area of Minyan in the western part of Aleppo city. Following a series of firefights, the government forces seized a large part of Minyan and pushed Jaish al-Fatah militants to retreat from the area. According to pro-government sources, Jaish al-Fatah is on the verge of losing of Minyan to the army. 
The Russian Aerospace Forces delivered a series of air strikes on the Al-Nusra(Al-Qaeda)-led militant coalition, Jaish al-Fatah, in the province of Idlib. Since November 8, Russian warplanes made up to 55 air strikes on militant weapon depots and supply lines. 3 weapon depots and a convoy, consisting of 4 vehicles, and 5 militant tactical units were reported destroyed. The Russian Aerospace Forces’ activity in the province is linked with reports that Jaish al-Fatah is deploying reinforcements to western Aleppo where the militant coalition has recently lost the area of 1070 Apartment Project and the strategic Motah Hill to the Syrian government forces. 
The recently released video depicts a militant vehicle that has been targeted by an Iranian Toophan anti-tank on the road between Daer Mkaren – Efreh in the western countryside of Damascus. Iran provides to the Syrian army’s troops and other pro-government groups a wide range of supplies, including anti-tank guided missiles. Toophan is a series of Iranian-made anti-tank guided missiles. Toophan 1 was a reverse-engineered copy of the US-made BGM-71 TOW missile.

17429,Andrea Mitchell to Price: You Have White Men Cutting Heath Care for Women - Breitbart,"Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” guest host Andrea Mitchell told Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price that the House Republicans who voted for the American Health Care Act are “mostly all men and white men at that. ”  Partial transcript as follows: MITCHELL: Well, let’s talk about women. When we looked at the rose garden and the celebration of this on Thursday, they were all  —   mostly all men and white men at that. There was no diversity there. Women’s health issues arguably are going to be disproportionately affected. Obamacare includes maternity and newborn care, preventative care, mammograms, cervical cancer screenings, birth control, all of this under the essential package no longer required under this house bill. PRICE: Andrea, come on. Look at that picture. Congresswoman Diane Black, the chair of the budget committee I was standing next to her. Seema Verma, the administrator of CMS I was standing next to her. MITCHELL: Out of a group of dozens and dozens of people, you can cite two or three  —   two or three women? PRICE: These are prominent individuals who are leading  —   who are leading in this area of health care. But the goal as I mentioned is to make certain every American, men, women, rich, poor, old, young, have the kind of coverage that they want for themselves and for their families. not that government forces them to buy. That’s the change.",0
17430,Inauguration Protesters and Police Clash on Washington’s Streets - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   A spate of violence erupted on Friday in the nation’s capital, as protesters damaged storefronts, threw rocks and bricks at police officers and lit a limousine on fire. Phalanxes of police officers used pepper spray, flash grenades and other nonlethal   tools to disperse the protesters. By the end of the day, six police officers had sustained minor injuries and more than 200 people had been arrested. Many of the protesters were dressed in black, wore face masks and carried flags associated with   groups. They congregated on a series of streets just blocks from the parade where Donald J. Trump passed as he made his way to the White House for the first time as president, their activities creating a distraction as television networks played live footage of the clashes. The violence was focused not only on the police. Richard B. Spencer, a leader of the     a   fringe movement that embraces white nationalism and a range of racist and   positions, was punched in the face by a protester as Mr. Spencer gave an interview on the street, according to a video posted on Twitter. “We’re not peaceful,” said one of the masked protesters who, like many others who clashed with the police, ran away after being approached by reporters. While the clashes occurred, thousands of peaceful protesters marched across the country as they voiced   slogans. In New York, seven people were arrested when they blocked the sidewalk outside Trump Tower. Protesters in San Francisco formed a blockade across train tracks, leading to eight arrests, and chained themselves to the downtown offices of Uber and Wells Fargo. In the central business district of Portland, Ore. banks, clothing retailers and a jewelry store boarded up windows and covered walls to limit vandalism. Chants in English and Spanish broke out in front of the Capitol in Phoenix. “This is one of the darkest days in the history of our country,” said Adelle Wallace, 75, during a   march in Los Angeles. The violence in Washington began about an hour before Mr. Trump was sworn in at noon. Storefront windows at a Bank of America and a Starbucks several blocks from the parade route were smashed, leading to many arrests. Around 2 p. m. as Mr. Trump ate lunch on Capitol Hill with lawmakers and supporters, the protests expanded and turned violent. Protesters hurled rocks and bricks at police officers several blocks from the parade route. Officers with helmets and riot shields tried to disperse the protesters by using flash grenades and pepper spray. After being pushed back a block, protesters outside the Washington Post building lit a fire in the middle of the street, smashed the windows of a limousine and then lit it on fire. The police, using more flash grenades, cleared a path for fire trucks as protesters retreated to a park. The violence attracted a throng of onlookers, journalists and peaceful protesters who had marched earlier in the day. Reed Arahood, 34, of Massachusetts, who had come to Washington to be part of the peaceful protests, said she was ambivalent about the violence. “I don’t think I have words to accurately describe how I feel about them,” she said about the protesters. She added that she felt “solidarity” but also was “absolutely” concerned about the image of violent protests. But over all the scene of thousands of protesters gave her hope. “I feel pretty proud of the number who showed up today,” she said. “Looking strangers in the eye and knowing that we’re together and talking with people from all over the country who have come here to express their concerns about what is going to happen in the next four years and what is already happening in our country. I feel really good about that. ” Along several access points to view the inauguration, the protesters hoped simply to put themselves in the way, locking arms, forming human blockades in front of both public and ticketed entrances. The police directed attendees around the corners of blockades, sometimes in single file, forcing some ticketed attendees to wait nearly an hour in line to trickle past the protests. Content with their success disrupting the flow of attendees, about 150 protesters gathered downtown in McPherson Square, breaking off in groups to march along I Street. An organizer advised two dozen people on the day’s aims: to disrupt Mr. Trump’s celebration as much as possible  —   an objective, he predicted, that would rankle “mainly police officers and Trump supporters. ” “Police officers,” a woman in the crowd grumbled, “are Trump supporters. ” A few attendees drummed on buckets, nodding at the instructions. Some wondered about divine intervention as the day turned rainy. “It’s the earth crying about the   president,” said Elodie Huttner, 52. Rallies have been planned all over the country all weekend, cresting with a women’s march in Washington on Saturday. Despite the disruptions, some in Washington were able to find moments of normalcy. Molly Schwizer, 52, a government employee who had the day off, left the quiet neighborhood in northwestern Washington where she lives to check out the chaotic and heavily policed streets of downtown, where protesters vied with Trump supporters. “I wanted to see what this was all about,” she said, motioning toward Saks Off 5th, the discount branch of the New York department store. “And,” she added, “I had some shopping to do. ” By midafternoon, she had seen enough of the protesters (“they should clean up,” she said) and the Trump supporters (no comment  —   she does have a government job, after all). Also, it was raining  —   and so it was time to shop.",0
17431,Ex-Marine Describes Violent Hazing and the Lies That Covered It Up - The New York Times,"PUTNAM COUNTY, Fla.  —   In Marine Corps boot camp, Thomas Weaver learned to endure punches, kicks and choking by drill instructors in the Third Recruit Training Battalion at Parris Island, S. C. When one instructor repeatedly bashed his head against a doorway, he kept quiet and acted as if it were no big deal. But what he eventually could not take was the lying that covered up the abuse. “We were taught the Marines is all about honor and honesty, and my superiors were constantly telling us all to lie about what was happening,” Mr. Weaver, 21, said in a recent interview at his parents’ home in rural northern Florida. “I had been really proud to join the Marines, but I was not proud of what we were doing. ” A Marine Corps investigation prompted in part by Mr. Weaver’s information has uncovered widespread abuse by drill instructors in the   Thumping Third. In a lengthy interview, Mr. Weaver  —   a   recruit who has since been kicked out of the military, ending his career  —   provided new details of how he said hazing infected all levels of drill instructors and instructors carefully concealed their abuse and threatened to give recruits “stitches” if anyone told. The continuing inquiry has so far led to the removal of three leaders. The corps has said 20 Marines face possible criminal charges. One drill instructor tumbled a Muslim recruit in a hot clothes dryer, according to a report from the investigation. The same instructor hazed another Muslim recruit repeatedly shortly before the recruit leapt to his death from the barracks, the report found. The Marines declined to comment on Mr. Weaver’s accusations, and certain aspects were impossible to corroborate. Another Marine in the battalion confirmed most details of his account, but asked to remain unnamed, saying he feared being singled out for retribution. “We were all scared, terrified,” Mr. Weaver said. “I wrote a lot of letters home about what was going on, but I tore them all up because I was afraid the drill instructors would read them. ” Hazing in Marine Corps boot camp has popped up persistently over the years, even as the leadership has added more safeguards. The stubborn problem reveals an underlying struggle in the Marine Corps over its identity. Most officers are pushing for an inclusive and orderly force, with more women and minorities, and strict regulations to protect against abuse. But in the ranks, a widespread belief holds that the corps, which prides itself on making some of the toughest war fighters in the world, needs harsh training and must push back to preserve traditions against the creep of politically correct mediocrity. “It’s like, they are so focused on trying to make real Marines that they don’t see how they are hurting a lot of good recruits,” said Mr. Weaver, who has begun telling his story publicly. Mr. Weaver graduated from boot camp in July 2015, near the top of his class. He was meritoriously promoted ahead of others and planned to make a military career. But what he saw at boot camp gnawed at him until he could no longer sleep, he said, and he was too depressed to attend his next level of training. He was hospitalized in September on suicide watch. In November, he told his commander he was too depressed to train, and the Marine Corps moved to formally discipline him. That month, Mr. Weaver’s father, Troy Weaver, contacted the commander to explain that he thought his son’s depression was a result of hazing in boot camp. His son then gave a detailed written account to his superiors about what he had seen at Parris Island, and the inquiry was opened. In December, Mr. Weaver was kicked out of the Marine Corps for not training and given an    discharge used to punish bad troops. He is trying to upgrade his discharge, but the system is slow and appeals are often unsuccessful. In a statement, the Marine Corps said that Mr. Weaver’s depression did not qualify for a medical discharge and that an    discharge is proper when troops refuse to train. Despite the common image of boot camp as a place where barking sergeants in   hats have nearly free rein to harass recruits, strict rules control what instructors can do. They cannot swear at recruits, hit them, kick them or even touch them unless it is to provide guidance during training that regulations call “corrective action. ” Regulations also limit what the Marines call “incentive training”: extra   crunches and other exercise as punishment. There are limits, for example, on how often and for how long such exercises can be ordered, and rules require that they be performed on a padded athletic mat. Mr. Weaver, a varsity track runner and captain of his high school soccer team who arrived at Parris Island ready to face grueling physical tests, said he soon found that drill instructors treated the rules with    contempt. A few days into training, while being issued equipment, he said, he watched an instructor grab a recruit by the neck after a minor mistake and slam him to the ground, where he held him by the throat while swearing at him. After choking the recruit, the instructor stood up, looked at the rest of the group and asked them whether he was hurting the recruit or “making a corrective action,” Mr. Weaver said. “We all said ‘You were making a corrective action, sir,’ ” Mr. Weaver said. “We were all too scared to say anything else. ” “Every drill instructor played that card,” he added. “They would hit someone or choke someone, then made us say it was O. K. when they knew it wasn’t. ” Instructors forced recruits to hold stress positions on concrete until elbows and knuckles bled, he said. They often ordered recruits to form a human wall to hide punishment from view or took recruits alone into the bathroom. Instructors singled out minority recruits they disliked for extra hazing, Mr. Weaver said, including two immigrants, a man with what Mr. Weaver called a “feminine voice” and a Muslim from Brooklyn whom instructors called “the terrorist. ” Twice, Mr. Weaver said, the Muslim recruit was sent for medical attention after long bouts of extra training. “They would just push them, try to make them fail,” Mr. Weaver said. That recruit, who is still in the Marines, declined to comment. Instructors hid hazing from officers, Mr. Weaver said, and officers did little to police it. Most of the abuse, he said, happened in the barracks, known in the Marine Corps as squad bays, where officers rarely ventured and where instructors said “real Marines are made. ” There, Mr. Weaver said, instructors piled dozens of recruits in a small boiler room and walked on them. He also said the instructors covered the squad bay in laundry soap and ordered the recruits to push the tallest recruit along the concrete as “a human scrub brush. ” “They were always telling us, ‘What happens in the squad bay stays in the squad bay,’ ” Mr. Weaver said. Recruits were warned not to report the abuse, he said, and instructors repeated a motto used in street gangs and prisons, “Snitches get stitches. ” Junior and senior instructors covered for one another, he said. Violence was a common response to slight missteps, Mr. Weaver said. He said he saw his senior drill instructor and another instructor take one recruit into the woods after the recruit accidentally struck one of the instructors during a training exercise, and beat him bloody. Mr. Weaver said he was grabbed by the shirt by a third instructor after inadvertently bumping into him, and that instructor slammed his head repeatedly against the doorway until other recruits pulled him away. Mr. Weaver said that he reported the assault to his senior drill instructor, but that his instructor responded by saying that Mr. Weaver did not appear to be injured and should stay out of the instructors’ way. Mr. Weaver also provided new details about the night in July last year when the Muslim recruit was forced into a dryer. Late that night, he said, four or five drill instructors from another platoon came into the squad bay smelling of alcohol and screamed at recruits to lie face down on the floor. Mr. Weaver said he watched them repeatedly slap a recruit, hard enough that the blow could be heard through the barracks. Later, Mr. Weaver said, the group returned. He watched from his bunk as they took the Muslim recruit into the laundry room. “We heard screaming, doors being slammed, loud noises,” Mr. Weaver said. “I was scared, I didn’t know what they were doing to him. ” Afterward, Mr. Weaver said, the recruit was clearly shaken. Mr. Weaver tried to comfort him when, he said, one of his drill instructors came in and told the Muslim recruit not to report what had happened. Mr. Weaver graduated from basic training in July and shipped off to Naval Air Station Pensacola, in Florida. But the abuse he had seen in boot camp caught up with him, he said. Bad dreams kept him from sleeping he lost motivation to train. A lifelong runner, he lacked the energy to go for a jog on the beach, he said. “Everyone was so proud of me, but I just saw the Marines as one big lie that I was now a part of,” he said. After he was hospitalized for being suicidal in September, he was put on medication and began seeing a base psychologist. In November Mr. Weaver told his commander he was not well enough to train. The psychologist treating him wrote two letters to his commander, Maj. Jenny A. Colegate, recommending a general discharge for medical reasons. But Major Colegate, who in a previous assignment had trained recruits at Parris Island, ordered Mr. Weaver to return to duty. When he refused, citing the psychologist’s advice, the Marines discharged him for a “pattern of misconduct. ” Maj. Clark Carpenter, a Marine Corps spokesman, said that Major Colegate was not available for comment but that the discharge was technically correct because Mr. Weaver had refused to train. He added, though, that not all information had been included in the recommendation for a discharge that went for final approval, and that it was likely that if it had been included, Mr. Weaver would not have received the administrative discharge. For months Mr. Weaver has been doing odd jobs in his neighborhood. The    discharge on his record has become a badge of shame and makes it hard to find work, he said. He said he feels as if his future was taken from him. “All I ever wanted to be was a Marine, and I was a good Marine,” he said. “But now I’m being punished for a bunch of stupid stuff that isn’t supposed to happen. ”",0
17432,Russia's countersanctions for Syria will hit the West below the belt,"Russia's countersanctions for Syria will hit the West below the belt 08.11.2016 Print version Font Size The West and Russia are entering the third year of the war of sanctions . Washington threatens to impose new sanctions against Russia, this time for Syria. Russia will take ""painful measures"" in response, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said. Pravda.Ru offers the list of counter sanctions that we made up on the basis of experts' opinions. 1. Russia's first answer would be the abolition of neo-liberal economic policies and transition to a new economic development strategy . This will block channels of Western influence on our country and thus become the most asymmetric, but a tough answer to Western sanctions, said Ruslan Dzarasov, Doctor of Economics, head of the department of political economy at the Russian Economic University named after Plekhanov.The expert noted that ""we continue to adhere to the export growth model, taking capital to the West and forming the budget on the basis of financial interests of capital rather than domestic consumers."" Russia, the expert said, should introduce a combination of state planning and market sector, ""similar to what the USSR was doing during the 1920s .""""The state should ensure the financial transparency of corporations, expand the rights of trade unions and workers, strengthen social control over big business, show influence on the formation prices in economy to eliminate price disparity in favor of the mining export sector to the detriment of the manufacturing industry,"" Ruslan Dzarasov told Pravda.Ru.2. Russia could refuse from saving its reserves in US dollars . Russia does not take the first place in terms of dollar savings in the world, but it could still cause a serious blow on the Western financial system, Valentin Katasonov, Doctor of Economics, Professor at the Moscow State Institute of International Finance, the head of Russian Economic Society named after S.F. Sharapov, told Pravda.Ru.""A lot of Russia's liabilities in national gold and currency reserves are nominated in US dollars. Should they are put on the market, the US dollar will suffer greatly ,"" leading expert at the Union of Oil and Gas Industrialists, Rustam Tankan said. Noteworthy, some privately run Russian companies already abandon the US dollar in their activities. Megafon, one of Russia's three leading cellular providers, converted about 40 percent of dollar deposits in euros and Hong Kong dollars. The company transferred the funds to accounts in major Chinese banks. Norilsk Nickel took similar measures. The Hong Kong dollar is a Chinese foreign clone of the dollar, and the USA is unable to impose any sanctions on this currency . Russia has started abandoning from the US dollar as a reserve currency by opening the Raw Materials Exchange of St. Petersburg, where Russian energy carriers are traded in rubles. 3. Russia could freeze assets of US investors in the Russian economy . ""Foreign citizens are the ultimate beneficiaries of our shadow holdings. There are tricky financial mechanisms in the timber industry, for instance,"" Igor Gerasimov, member of the Committee for Business Security at the Chamber of Commerce, security expert, told Pravda.Ru. The shadow mechanism works as follows. A wood-working company does most of the work, while most of the profit goes to a ""general contractor."" The latter pays the company a relative price for production, plus a minimum profit. Most of the profit goes to specific individuals, to accounts of foreign companies. Therefore, Russia could adopt laws about the nationalization of natural resources and city-forming enterprises, said Igor Gerasimov.4. The State Duma of the Russian Federation has already discussed a draft law to relieve state-run and privately-owned Russian companies from debts totaling $700 billion . These debts are held by Western banks of the countries that threatened to impose sanctions against Russia.5. Sanctions in the field of high technology will be no less sensitive. ""Russian titanium will cease to arrive at European companies, and this will certainly be a very significant act of pressure on our partners,"" Alexei Mukhin, general director of the Center for Political Information told Pravda.Ru. Boeing and United Technologies, as well as Europe's Airbus Group, purchase most of their titanium from Avisma, a Russian company, which happens to be the world's largest titanium producer . Yet, it goes about only 30 percent of needs. The USA remains entirely dependent on Russia in the field of rocket engines . RD-180 is a six-ton ​​liquid rocket engine with a thrust of more than 400 tons. The USA has been using Russian rocket engines since 2000. US Congress passed the budget, which provided for the allocation of hundreds of millions of dollars to purchase an ""unlimited"" number of RD-180 rocket engines. 6. Russia's sanctions against Western airlines would lead to their elimination . A great deal of airlines fly across the territory of Russia and save a lot of money on this, chairman of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs, Andrei Klimov, told Pravda.Ru.""If all of a sudden, the Russian authorities try to do something in this field, it will generate huge profits to companies from such countries as the United Arab Emirates, but at the same time it will cause serious financial damage to German, French and other air carriers,"" - said the expert.7. Many large companies in the West have a strong lobby in legislative authorities. Therefore, the input of targeted sanctions under the pretext of violation of rules and regulations would be a very strong response . Starting from 1 November 2016, Russia banned imports of salt from the EU, the US, Canada, Australia, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Montenegro, Albania and Ukraine. On February 15, 2016 Russia banned imports of soybeans and corn from the United States, including through third countries. Russia still imports various food products from the United States, spending millions of dollars a year (PepsiCo, Starbucks, Cargill, McDonald's), pharmaceuticals (Pfizer), cosmetic products (Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson), plastics, machinery, textiles, footwear, automobiles (Ford, General Motors) as well as products under the ""secret code"" worth $554 million in the first half of 2016.

You decide. by Geoffrey Grider October 30, 2016 Did Huma steal those emails and then save them as life insurance to protect herself from joining the Clinton Dead Pool? 
Huma Abedin is no fool. She may be the closest aide to Hillary Clinton, but she also spent the last 20 years watching enemies of the Clinton Crime Family spontaneously commit suicide. So it is with great amusement but virtually no surprise that today we are finding out that the folder Huma kept those incriminating Hillary emails in was called ‘ Life Insurance ‘. So did Huma steal 10,000 emails and saved it on her comp just in case Clinton targeted her? 
Hence: “life insurance”

17434,Five Illuminating Takeaways From Your Family Money Letters - The New York Times,"When Joe Olivier asked what his niece wanted as a high school graduation present this year, she asked for a couple of thousand dollars in gift cards. She got a letter instead. In that was a   list from her doting uncle: Read two books about personal finance that he had sent her, and write a   report on each. Then, take an online accounting course and pass its test. Once those tasks were done, only then would he open a checking account in her name and deposit some money. Last week, I wrote about the value of preparing and passing along the money letter, in which a parent or other relative lays out some   financial wisdom. I also asked readers to send in ones they’d written or read. I found the submissions insightful, hilarious and touching. The letters that arrived contained several illuminating   about money’s relationship to everything from sex to gambling that you may find useful as you try to impart insight to your own loved ones. But like Mr. Olivier, other letter writers also asked something of their recipients: To recognize and own the strong feelings we all have about money. To be patient, careful, fair and generous. To want more but not be greedy. To revel in doing things and care less about having things. Feel free to borrow liberally from the following writers when it comes time to write your own letter: EMOTIONS Mr. Olivier turned to a letter because he worried that a big money talk would go in one ear and out the other. “The problem is that kids these days, you sit them down and start being a raconteur, and their eyes glaze over because their attention spans are that of a gnat,” he said. Mr. Olivier, 55, acknowledged that he did get serious rather quickly when writing to his niece, who will attend the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. “Money and finances typically are wrapped up in a lot of emotions for everyone, and your views on these subjects have been shaped since you were born,” he wrote. Why start there? Because one of the most common conflicts around money in families is scarcity. “Typically there is never enough,” he said in an interview this week. “The kids key in on that. ” And they do so long before they have much technical knowledge of how to manage money responsibly. Schooled in feelings before finance, is it any wonder they sometimes make emotional decisions about how much to borrow for college or what to spend once they get there and get out? Mr. Olivier suggested that wizened   need to make the whole subject much more bloodless, long before writing any letters. “Try to be upfront with your kids about budgets and the financial situation in the family,” he said. SEX When his two sons left home for college, George Bohmfalk gave each of them a letter with some words of advice. Among them, were these: “Along with sex, money seems to get more people into trouble than everything else combined,” he wrote. “And both are great when handled properly. ” So what links these two powerful forces, exactly? “Maybe because, like having sex, money represents success to a whole lot of people,” Mr. Bohmfalk, who is now 68, said in an interview. “And money has become a medium of measuring one’s worth, like sex appeal. ” Roughly two decades later, both of his sons have had no problems that he knows of with sex or money, and they never had to move back home. Mr. Bohmfalk also mentioned some related words to live by that a physician friend passed on to him many years ago: One spouse, one house. “So many of our friends had a beach house or a lake house or an airplane and a divorce or two,” he said. “Suddenly, they were having to work until they dropped. ” Mr. Bohmfalk, a former neurosurgeon who lives in Charlotte, N. C. retired from the practice of medicine on his 50th birthday. RISK One other thing that sex and money have in common is that both tend to involve a certain amount of risk. Not that there is anything wrong with careful, considered financial bets. In most instances, in fact, risk is necessary. “Investing always involves risk,” Greg Berman of Brooklyn wrote a few years ago to his two daughters, now 17 and 13. “It is basically a form of gambling. But it is also the only means of accumulating wealth other than by the sweat of your own labor. ” His family has successfully taken on real estate risk over the years, whether it was his relatives who were developers outside of Washington or the bet he and his wife made on a Manhattan apartment and then a Brooklyn house. They’ve also bet on stocks. But they prefer the index funds that feel less like a spin of a roulette wheel than individual stocks do. Hannah Berman, Mr. Berman’s elder daughter, says he’s fond of telling a story about buying stock in Marvel, the comics company, as a young man. “He immediately lost everything,” she said. ENVY (AND GENDER) Envy is a problem, and Mr. Berman, who is 49 and runs a nonprofit, is clear on that in his letter. But he doesn’t default to the presumption that so many parents of teenagers do: That wanting things is itself somehow bad. “It is O. K. to want more,” he wrote. “Indeed, this impulse can be a spur to action and invention and success. ” Why put it that way? In an interview, he talked about all of the books and movies his daughters take in that make the case that money doesn’t matter. Money is the root of all evil! Marry for love! Chase your dreams! But then much of the rest of the culture sends the exact opposite message. “I was trying to find the sweet spot that acknowledges the wisdom of both of those perspectives,” he said. On a related note, his letter mentions his experience witnessing men aggressively negotiating raises over the years when women often did not. “It is O. K. to ask for a raise,” he wrote. “It is also O. K. to bargain over the price of many products. ” Wanting a bit more prestige or a bigger office has been a positive in many situations he had witnessed. “We want our kids to be ambitious and do stuff,” he told me. ADVENTURES Early in her career, Robin Hubbard, 59, made more money per month than her father ever had. She’s worked at a Fortune 500 company. But a series of health setbacks and the death of her husband have led to her living on  —   and with  —   much less. When she saw last week’s column, she wrote the following to her    daughter: “I encourage you to be a collector of adventures and making other people smile. I have found after the hardship of health problems, I do not want anything but the next great conversation or interesting experience. ” She turned to the letter format for a couple of reasons. When she was younger, no one talked to her much about money or wrote anything down, so she wanted to do better as a mother. Plus, the personal budgeting talks with her daughter, who lives with her in Bethalto, Ill. have not quite hit home yet. A written letter, however, has a chance of lasting. That is something that she values after her health scares over the years. “I will probably frame it, because I want her to know that it is a keepsake,” she said. “And I’m probably not going to be there when she has kids of her own. ”",0
17435,"American dream, revisited","by Pepe Escobar for the Strategic Culture Foundation 
Will Trump pull a Brexit times ten? What would it take, beyond WikiLeaks, to bring the Clinton (cash) machine down? Will Hillary win and then declare WWIII against her Russia/Iran/Syria “axis of evil”? Will the Middle East totally explode? Will the pivot to Asia totally implode? Will China be ruling the world by 2025? 
Amidst so many frenetic fragments of geopolitical reality precariously shored against our ruins, the temptation is irresistible to hark back to the late, great, deconstructionist master Jean Baudrillard. During the post-mod 1980s it was hip to be Baudrillardian to the core; his America , originally published in France in 1986, should still be read today as the definitive metaphysical/geological/cultural Instagram of Exceptionalistan. 
By the late 1990s, at the end of the millennium, two years before 9/11 – that seminal “before and after” event – Baudrillard was already stressing how we live in a black market maze. Now, it’s a black market paroxysm. 
Global multitudes are subjected to a black market of work – as in the deregulation of the official market; a black market of unemployment; a black market of financial speculation; a black market of misery and poverty; a black market of sex (as in prostitution); a black market of information (as in espionage and shadow wars); a black market of weapons; and even a black market of thinking. 
Way beyond the late 20 th century, in the 2010s what the West praises as “liberal democracy” – actually a neoliberal diktat – has virtually absorbed every ideological divergence, while leaving behind a heap of differences floating in some sort of trompe l’oeil effect. What’s left is a widespread, noxious condition; the pre-emptive prohibition of any critical thought, which has no way to express itself other than becoming clandestine (or finding the right internet niche). 
Baudrillard already knew that the concept of “alter” – killed by conviviality – does not exist in the official market. So an “alter” black market also sprung up, co-opted by traffickers; that’s, for instance, the realm of racism, nativism and other forms of exclusion. Baudrillard already identified how a “contraband alter”, expressed by sects and every form of nationalism (nowadays, think about the spectrum between jihadism and extreme-right wing political parties) was bound to become more virulent in a society that is desperately intolerant, obsessed with regimentation, and totally homogenized. 
There could be so much exhilaration inbuilt in life lived in a bewildering chimera cocktail of cultures, signs, differences and “values”; but then came the coupling of thinking with its exact IT replica – artificial intelligence, playing with the line of demarcation between human and non-human in the domain of thought. 
The result, previewed by Baudrillard, was the secretion of a parapolitical society – with a sort of mafia controlling this secret form of generalized corruption (think the financial Masters of the Universe). Power is unable to fight this mafia – and that would be, on top of it, hypocritical, because the mafia itself emanates from power. 
The end result is that what really matters today, anywhere, mostly tends to happen outside all official circuits; like in a social black market. 
Is there any information “truth”? 
Baudrillard showed how political economy is a massive machine, producing value, producing signs of wealth, but not wealth itself. The whole media/information system – still ruled by America – is a massive machine producing events as signs; exchangeable value in the universal market of ideology, the star system and catastrophism. 
This abstraction of information works as in the economy – disgorging a coded material, deciphered in advance, and negotiable in terms of models, as much as the economy disgorges products negotiable in terms of price and value. 
Since all merchandise, thanks to this abstraction of value, is exchangeable, then every event (or non-event) is also exchangeable, all replacing one another in the cultural market of information. 
And that takes us to where we live now; Trans-History, and Trans-Politics – where events have really not happened, as they get lost in the vacuum of information (as much as the economy gets lost in the vacuum of speculation). 
Thus this quintessential Baudrillard insight; if we consider History as a movie – and that’s what it is now – then the “truth” of information is no more than post-production synch, dubbing and subtitles. 
Still, as we all keep an intense desire for devouring events, there is immense disappointment as well, because the content of information is desperately inferior to the means of broadcasting them. Call it a pathetic, universal contagion; people don’t know what to do about their sadness or enthusiasm – in parallel to our societies becoming theaters of the absurd where nothing has consequences. 
No acts, deeds, crimes (the 2008 financial crisis), political events (the WikiLeaks emails showing virtually no distinction between the “nonprofit” Clinton cash machine, what’s private and what’s public, the obsessive pursuit of personal wealth, and the affairs of the state) seem to have real consequences. 
Immunity, impunity, corruption, speculation – we veer towards a state of zero responsibility (think Goldman Sachs). So, automatically, we yearn for an event of maximum consequence, a “fatal” event to repair that scandalous non-equivalence. Like a symbolic re-equilibrium of the scales of destiny. 
So we dream of an amazing event – Trump winning the election? Hillary declaring WWIII? – that would free us from the tyranny of meaning and the constraint of always searching for the equivalence between effects and causes. 
Shadowing the world 
Just like Baudrillard, I got to see “deep” America in the 1980s and 1990s by driving across America. 
So sooner or later one develops a metaphysical relationship with that ubiquitous warning, “Objects in this mirror may be closer than they appear.” 
But what if they may also be further than they appear? 
The contemporary instant event/celebrity culture deluge of images upon us; does it get us closer to a so-called “real” world that is in fact very far away from us? Or does it in fact keep the world at a distance – creating an artificial depth of field that protects us from the imminence of objects and the virtual danger they represent? 
In parallel, we keep slouching towards a single future language – the language of algorithms, as designed across the Wall Street/Silicon Valley axis – that would represent a real anthropological catastrophe, just like the globalist/New World Order dream of One Thought and One Culture. 
Languages are multiple and singular – by definition. If there were a single language, words would become univocal, regulating themselves in an autopilot of meaning. There would be no interplay – as in artificial languages there’s no interplay. Language would be just the meek appendix of a unified reality – the negative destiny of a languidly unified human species. 
That’s where the American “dream” seems to be heading. It’s time to take the next exit ramp. The Essential Saker: from the trenches of the emerging multipolar world $27.95",0
17436,65 USA ‘Journalists’ At Dinner With HRC’s Team And John Podesta,"Leave a reply 
Several top journalists and TV news anchors RSVPed “yes” to attend a private, off-the-record gathering at the New York home of Joel Benenson, the chief campaign strategist for Hillary Clinton, two days before she announced her candidacy in 2015, according to emails Wikileaks has published from John Podesta ’s purported accounts. 
The guest list for an earlier event at the home of John Podesta was limited to reporters who were expected to cover Clinton on the campaign trail. 
The email thread starts with Jesse Ferguson, the campaign’s Deputy National Press Secretary and Senior Spokesman, describing the venues and target audience of each gathering: 
We wanted to make sure everyone on this email had the latest information on the two upcoming dinners with reporters. Both are off-the-record. 
1) Thursday night, April 9th at 7:00p.m. Dinner at the Home of John Podesta… This will be with about 20 reporters who will closely cover the campaign (aka the bus). 
2) Friday night, April 10th at 6:30p.m. Cocktails and Hors D’oeuvre at the Home of Joel Benenson… This is with a broader universe of New York reporters. 
The “broader universe of New York reporters” includes several top news anchors for network and cable channels, many of whom are listed as a “yes” for the appearance: 
From ABC: Cecilia Vega, David Muir, Diane Sawyer (who could only stay for 30 minutes), and George Stephanopoulos. 
From CBS News: Norah O’Donnell. 
From CNN: Brianna Keilar, Gloria Borger, John Berman, and Kate Bolduan. 
From MSNBC: Alex Wagner and Rachel Maddow (“TRYING”). 
From NBC: Savannah Guthrie. 
“Yes” respondent George Stephanopoulos worked for Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign and was a Senior Adviser to the President during Clinton’s first White House term. Stephanopoulos does not disclose this fact when reporting on the 2016 Clinton campaign for ABC News. 
The nascent Clinton campaign invited Jeff Zucker and Phil Griffin, the presidents of CNN and MSNBC, respectively. Zucker declined while Griffin RSVPed “yes.” 
Wikileaks’ release of emails from the Democratic National Committee showed then-DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz scheduled or attempted to schedule private meetings with both executives.Other “yes” RSVPs come from journalists who have been sighted in the Wikileaks Podesta emails, outing them as friendly or fawning towards Hillary’s campaign. 
CNBC’s John Harwood , who was also a moderator for a 2015 presidential debate, emailed Podesta frequently , practically begging for approval and access . 
Politico’s Glenn Thrush also emailed Podesta periodically. On Monday, a newly-released email revealed a particularly humiliating incident where Thrush sent Podesta a passage from an upcoming article for his personal approval. 
“Because I have become a hack I will send u the whole section that pertains to u,” Thrush wrote. “Please don’t share or tell anyone I did this… Tell me if I f’ed up anything.” 
Sandra Sobieraj Westfall, Washington Bureau Chief at PEOPLE magazine, boasted two days after this confab that stories on Clinton’s campaign were generating “absolutely off the charts” traffic and asked for “color you can whisper on background” about what Hillary was up to. 
The full RSVP list for Benenson’s gathering is shown in an attachment on a separate email : 
This is an off-the-record cocktails with the key national reporters, especially (though not exclusively) those that are based in New York. Much of the group includes influential reporters, anchors and editors. 
The goals of the dinner include: 
(1) Give reporters their first thoughts from team HRC in advance of the announcement (2) Setting expectations for the announcement and launch period (3) Framing the HRC message and framing the race (4) Enjoy a Friday night drink before working more 
TIME/DATE: As a reminder, this is called for 6:30 p.m. on Friday, April 10th . 
There are several attendees – including Diane Sawyer – who will be there promptly at 6:30 p.m. but have to leave by 7 p.m. 
FOOD: This will include cocktails and passed hours devours.

17437,Michael Skakel’s Murder Conviction Has Been Reinstated - The New York Times,"In the latest twist in a case that has been full of them, the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled on Friday that the murder conviction of Michael C. Skakel, who was found guilty in 2002 of bludgeoning a teenage neighbor with a golf club, should be reinstated. The court said in making its ruling that Mr. Skakel’s original lawyer had, despite accusations to the contrary, represented him effectively. The decision could send Mr. Skakel back to prison to finish a prison term of 20 years to life. He had spent more than a decade behind bars before he was released in 2013 when a judge vacated his original sentence. Over the years, Mr. Skakel, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy, has attracted the attention of gossip columnists, TV crews and magazine writers as his case slowly moved through nearly every branch of Connecticut’s judicial system. Though the neighbor, Martha Moxley, was killed in Greenwich in 1975, when she and Mr. Skakel were both 15, Mr. Skakel was not arrested until he was in his late 30s. He was convicted after a   trial that brought to light details including his drinking and drug use. But in October 2013, 38 years after Ms. Moxley was found dead, lying face down beneath a pine tree on her family’s estate, a Connecticut judge vacated the guilty verdict, ruling that Mr. Skakel’s trial lawyer, Michael Sherman, had not provided effective representation. At that time, Mr. Skakel and his new legal team argued that Mr. Sherman had failed to implicate his brother, Thomas Skakel, in the murder, one of their main arguments at trial failed to adequately pursue an alibi defense and failed to rebut the testimony of some former schoolmates who said that Mr. Skakel had admitted to the killing. In subsequent arguments, Mr. Skakel’s lawyers also attacked Mr. Sherman for delivering a poor closing argument and for having a conflict of interest in representing him related to how he billed Mr. Skakel. But in a   decision issued on Friday, the Supreme Court said that Mr. Sherman’s legal work was not deficient. Mr. Skakel “had the burden to present evidence demonstrating that Sherman’s investigation was constitutionally inadequate,” the court wrote. “In the absence of this evidence, we must presume that Sherman performed competently. ” Prosecutors have not responded to requests about the next steps for the case. In a telephone interview on Friday evening, Mr. Sherman said that while it was “a comfort to see that the judges did not feel I was responsible,” the reinstatement of the guilty verdict was not “a situation where I’m happier than hell and kicking my heels in joy. ” He maintained that Mr. Skakel had been wrongfully convicted. “It happened on my watch, and I’m responsible for that,” Mr. Sherman said, adding: “I can’t imagine that any judge or prosecutor will send him back to jail after the odyssey he’s been on. ” Robert F. Kennedy Jr. an environmental lawyer and a cousin of Mr. Skakel’s who wrote a book last year making a case for Mr. Skakel’s innocence, called the court’s decision “a horrible, cataclysmic miscarriage of justice. ” “I don’t think he’s O. K. going back to prison for a crime he didn’t commit while the real murderers are on the street because the State of Connecticut can’t admit it made a horrible mistake by convicting him in the first place,” Mr. Kennedy said. The Supreme Court’s ruling was in essence a defense of Mr. Sherman’s defense of Mr. Skakel. It pulled apart the lower court’s decision to vacate the conviction point by point. According to the ruling, Mr. Sherman had a threefold strategy at Mr. Skakel’s trial. Mr. Sherman tried to establish an alibi, saying that Mr. Skakel was at a cousin’s house watching Monty Python on television at the time of the murder. He tried to discredit witnesses who had gone to school with Mr. Skakel and who had said Mr. Skakel told them he was involved in the killing. And he presented evidence that the family’s   tutor, Kenneth Littleton, might have committed the murder. Mr. Skakel’s current lawyers did not return phone calls seeking comment.",0
17438,Italian Monastery Seeks Salvation in Beer After Devastating Quake - The New York Times,"NORCIA, Italy  —   The Rev. Cassian Folsom was preparing to celebrate morning Mass one recent Sunday when suddenly the earth started trembling. “Stones and roof tiles started raining down on our heads,” he recalled. “It was a terrifying experience. ” When the dust settled, he and the other monks  —   almost all of them transplanted from the United States  —   found their beloved Basilica of St. Benedict, built centuries ago in Norcia in the central Italian mountains to mark its namesake’s birthplace, in ruins. After the Oct. 30 quake, one of the few things left standing at the monastery was a small brewery, where for the past four years the monks have been making Nursia, a beer named for Norcia’s ancient Latin appellation. Their brew may now be the salvation  —   symbolically, at least  —   not only of the monks’ sanctuary, but also of Norcia itself. This ancient walled city is a ghost town of ravaged churches and cracked palazzi, and is still struggling to recover from the strongest earthquake to strike Italy in 36 years. “Remarkably, the brewery was hardly damaged,” the Rev. Benedict Nivakoff, who is from Connecticut, said during a chilly morning walk through the devastated town center. “The fermenters were loosed, but they’re tall and heavy, and so they didn’t fall. ” The monks are planning to move the beer from the brewery to a safer location, where it can be bottled and specially labeled before it is sold to raise money for reconstruction, Father Nivakoff said. The monks set up a website for their   efforts after the basilica and monastery had been weakened by earthquakes and aftershocks in August. “The campaign started then  —   now we need to add a few more zeros,” said Father Nivakoff, the prior of the monastery. It is not be the first time the monastery has had to revive itself. The American monks arrived in 2000, under a plan by their order, the local archbishop, residents and town officials to populate a priory that had been abandoned since 1810, when Napoleon suppressed monastic orders here. Led by Father Folsom, who is the prior emeritus, the monks now number 15. They learned   from experienced Trappist brewmasters in Belgium, and began to make Nursia in 2012. The beer’s name was chosen “specifically to help the townspeople, rather than naming it after St. Benedict,” Father Nivakoff said. “We wanted people to identify the beer with the town,” and to help support it, he added. Brother Augustine Wilmeth, who was born in South Carolina and serves as the brewmaster, said Nursia was “the only monastic beer in the world that is made exclusively by the monks. ” Other monastic brewing operations, he explained, have grown into   enterprises with many workers. In Norcia, the monks do everything themselves, producing around 10, 000 bottles each month. The monks, in the tradition of St. Benedict, who believed they should live and support themselves by the work of their hands, intend to keep the brewery small. That way, Brother Wilmeth said, “it will stay in our control and really serve monastic life, not overwhelm and consume us. ” The monastery’s beer varieties quickly gained an enthusiastic following in local shops and restaurants, and the brewery began exporting to the United States this year. If many of the regional venues that sold the beer are shuttered because of the earthquake, it is still available through American importers, the monks said. St. Benedict, whom Pope Paul VI named a patron saint of Europe in 1964, and his twin sister, Scholastica, who also later became a saint, were born in Norcia around 480, and the remains of what some believe to be their house were once visible beneath the basilica. Benedict founded several monastic communities, including one at Monte Cassino, where he died in 543. His Rule of St. Benedict, a series of teachings for monks, formed the basic precepts for thousands of monasteries in Europe. “We have tried to help the townspeople to dig deeper and discover an identity that goes beyond prosciutto and truffles,” said Father Nivakoff, referring to two of the things the Umbrian city is known for. “I think in the last 15 years we’ve managed to do that. ” Mayor Nicola Alemanno said, “With this community of American monks, the value that St. Benedict has for Europe assumes a global significance,” adding: “They have become a spiritual and cultural point of reference first for the city, then for Umbria and then for Italy. ” The monks’ message also achieved global recognition in 2015 when “Benedicta,” an album of traditional Latin Marian chants, spent 19 weeks at No. 1 on Billboard’s classical chart. Singing, Father Folsom explained, “is our spiritual nourishment  —   that’s where the spiritual energy comes from. ” He added that the monks chanted for about six hours each day. “It’s very much a part of our lives,” the Rev. Basil Nixen, the monastery’s choirmaster, said. Before the earthquake, the muted hums of the chanting monks were familiar sounds in Norcia. The beer has also become very much a part of their lives. If   efforts can help both the sanctuary and Norcia live again, they say, the monks are happy to repay their benefactors  —   even in a small, frothy way. “We are proud that we are American,” said the Rev. Martin Bernhard, who is from Texas and is the cellarer of the monastery. “To taste and buy our beer is a beautiful thing for us. ”",0
17439,The 5 Biggest Seed-Starting Mistakes That People Make,"There is nothing more rewarding than growing your own food. Yet every gardener faces problems in the early stages of starting a garden. Look out for these 5 mistakes during your first few weeks. 

Mold 
You can spot fungi by first being able to identify it. If you see white, hairlike growths on the soil surface, you are probably seeing fungi. Fungus thrives in dirt that is overly wet, usually combined with humid air or poor ventilation around plants. You can avoid this by using cell flats and planting one seed per cell to allow enough space for air to circulate around seedlings. Place a small fan in the area and position it so that it is not blowing directly on the seedlings. This will keep air moving. 

Damping-Off 
Stems can turn brown and bend at the soil level due to fungi. If you are using a humidity dome, be sure to remove it right after sprouting. Leaving the dome on will create an environment that pathogens and pests love. 

Bugs 
If you have houseplants with pest issues, keep your seedling trays far away from them. The most common indoor seed-starting pest is the fungus gnat. It resembles a small but sluggish fruit fly. Gnat larvae can only survive in moist environments, so it is important to cut back on watering once the seeds have sprouted. Allow the top 1/4 inch of soil to dry out between waterings. 

Planting Depth 
When seeds are planted too deep and kept too moist and cold, they can rot. Be sure to plant according to the directions on the packet. 

Seed Quality 
If you are doing everything right and your seeds still don’t sprout, they could be too old. Seeds germinate best when they are fresh. Quality seed companies print a “packed for” date on envelopes. Be sure to do your research. Some seeds like beans, lettuce, tomatoes, and peppers can be stored in a sealed bag in a dry, dark place for several years. 

Have fun while gardening and learn what techniques work best for you and your crop. Pay attention to detail in order to catch any issues before they spread.

Partial transcript as follows: SCARBOROUGH: The only question I would ask you to start with is it is incredible that there is anyway that this president could not have known about this conversation that the White House had been warned about a month ago. FRIEDMAN: I share Mika’s real outrage on this issue. I don’t care what he told Pence. We only care what he told Pence because Pence went out and basically mislead the public on Face the Nation. The issue is what did he tell Trump? Did he and Trump actually cook up this whole thing after the Russians did not respond harshly to the eviction of their spies and diplomats? Trump actually tweeted out some positive encouragement of this. Did the two of them cook this up all along? It gets, Joe, to two other issues. The first is we have never taken seriously from the very beginning Russia hacked our election. That was a   scale event. They attacked the core of our very democracy. That was a Pearl Harbor scale event. Can you imagine if Hillary Clinton were where Trump was, what the right would be doing on this issue? This goes to the very core of our democracy.

17442,Theresa May: National Threat Level Remains at Severe - ’A Terrorist Attack is Highly Likely’ - Breitbart,"United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May said Monday that the national threat level remains at “Severe,” meaning a terrorist attack is “highly likely. ”[“JTAC  —   that’s the independent Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre  —   have confirmed that the national threat level remains at Severe that means that a terrorist attack is highly likely,” she said after a meeting of top national security officials.  She said police have put additional security measures in place to protect the public and provide reassurance, including additional security measures at a number of bridges in London. May said all three attackers in Saturday’s attack have been identified, and that when “progress in the investigation permits,” their names will be released. She said 11 individuals are being held in police custody, following the search of two premises. Scotland Yard have subsequently identified two of the killers. “The police are working hard to establish the identity of all of those who were tragically killed or injured in the event on Saturday night, but it is now clear that, sadly, victims came from a number of nationalities. This was an attack on London and the United Kingdom, but it was also an attack on the free world,” the Prime Minister said. There were seven people killed and at least 48 injured, including 21 critically, after the three attackers drove into pedestrians on the London Bridge, then got out and began stabbing people at pubs and restaurants at the Borough Market. The three attackers were shot and killed by police. Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley urged anyone with information or footage of the incident to contact police. He said the public can expect to see additional police  —   both armed and unarmed  —   across London. “Our secrity and policing plans for events are being reviewed. The public will also see an increased physical measures in order to keep public safe on London’s bridges,” he said. Rowley said the investigation was progressing “at pace, and significant progress has been made. “Finally, I ask the public to remain calm but vigilant  —   and if you see anything suspicious, no matter how insignificant you might think it is, please contact the   hotline on 0800 789 321.

17444,Turkey’s Operation Euphrates Shield is Shielding What? | New Eastern Outlook,"Country: Syria Turkey, in a bid to legitimize its uninvited, illegal incursion into northern Syria, has created several media platforms specifically reporting on what it calls “Operation Euphrates Shield.” Operation Euphrates Shield, according to official Turkish government statements, aims at “securing” a buffer zone in northern Syria spanning from the Euphrates river in the east and extending all the way to Azaz in the west. This is also coincidentally the exact same buffer zone US policy think tanks have called for since at least 2012 – specifically seeking Turkey to implement it. The Brookings Institution – a corporate-funded policy think-tank whose policymakers have helped craft upper-level strategy for the Iraqi, Afghan, Libyan, and now Syrian conflicts as well as plans laid for future confrontations with Iran and beyond – has been explicit regarding the true nature of these “buffer zones.” In a 2015 paper titled, “ Deconstructing Syria: A new strategy for America’s most hopeless war ,” it states: …the idea would be to help moderate elements establish reliable safe zones within Syria once they were able. American, as well as Saudi and Turkish and British and Jordanian and other Arab forces would act in support, not only from the air but eventually on the ground via special forces. The paper goes on by explaining (emphasis added) : The end-game for these zones would not have to be determined in advance. The interim goal might be a confederal Syria, with several highly autonomous zones and a modest (eventual) national government. The confederation would likely require support from an international peacekeeping force, if this arrangement could ever be formalized by accord. But in the short term, the ambitions would be lower—to make these zones defensible and governable, to help provide relief for populations within them, and to train and equip more recruits so that the zones could be stabilized and then gradually expanded. Despite claims that Turkey’s actions are necessary to “stop” the self-proclaimed “Islamic State” (ISIS) and help end the deadly conflict raging in Syria, it is clear that instead, Turkey is carving out territory specifically to shelter militants fighting the Syrian government in an attempt to perpetuate, even expand the violence for as long and as extensively as possible. Joint operations between Washington and Ankara in Manbji, a well-known waypoint for Islamic State fighters, weapons and equipment coming from Turkey bound for Raqqa, would effectively open “a second front” in the ongoing fight to drive the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, from Syria’s borders, [Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu] said. It was Turkey’s own foreign minister who was quoted by the Washington Times in an article written just before Turkey embarked on its invasion titled, “ Turkey offers joint ops with U.S. forces in Syria, wants Kurds cut out ,” admitting that ISIS was being supplied and reinforced specifically from within Turkish territory. The article stated (emphasis added): It is thus abundantly clear that ISIS sprung into being and has since sustained itself through extensive state sponsorship – sponsorship that has flowed freely over Syria’s borders with Turkey and Jordan. Any genuine attempt to cripple the source of ISIS’ fighting capacity would require securing the Turkish and Jordanian borders with Syria, not invading Syria itself. As ISIS Disappears, Militants Magically Multiply Operation Euphrates Shield can be followed on popular social media platforms, including Twitter. Turkish officials regularly post self-incriminating updates regarding their activities within Syrian territory. On October 21, the operation’s official Twitter account claimed : 
Turkish Army-backed FSA has tripled number of its soldiers thanks to its achievements against terrorist organizations. However, this claim is highly problematic. The process of crossing a battlefield successfully alone does not “increase” the number of soldiers fighting in one’s army unless militants an army is engaged against are recruited into the advancing force. “Liberated” civilians would not be able to simply “join” Turkish-backed militant groups. A responsible military commander knows that incorporating untrained civilians into a military force without at least 1-3 months of basic training creates more disadvantages and dangers than any benefits gained from “tripling” the size of one’s force. Additionally, men of fighting age found on the battlefield in areas Turkish-backed troops are advancing through must be vetted to ensure they have no ties to terrorist organizations including ISIS – yet Turkey’s government has not given any details on how these “new fighters” are being either vetted or trained. In other words, it simply seems as if Turkey is attempting to explain why – within the buffer zone it is creating – numbers of militants are swelling without admitting that the entire purpose of the buffer zone in the first place is and always was to provide a sanctuary for Al Qaeda, ISIS, and other extremist forces inside Syria just as Turkey has provided them sanctuary in Turkey for the last 5 years. Turkey’s Operation Euphrates Shield is indeed a shield wielded by Turkey and its US partners. But it is a shield lifted up not in defense of the Syrian people or the Turkish state itself, but instead brought to face those forces decisively defeating Al Qaeda and ISIS deeper within Syria and poised to push remaining militants out of Syria, permanently. With the establishment of a Turkish occupied buffer zone – as imagined by US policy makers who crafted this operation for Turkey long ago – it will now be exceedingly difficult to eradicate remaining militants at the edge of Syrian territory after they are defeated and driven out of the nation’s interior. Indeed Turkey is shielding a region west of the Euphrates, not from terrorists, but to protect them.

17445,"Navy Opens a Back Door, and In Come Athletes and Victories - The New York Times","It’s been another good year for Navy football. Even after last week’s loss to Temple in the American Athletic Conference’s title game, the Midshipmen are   with victories over Notre Dame and Houston. They are favored to beat archrival Army on Saturday for the 15th consecutive year. And two days before Christmas, Navy will end its season by playing Louisiana Tech in the Lockheed Martin Armed Forces Bowl, which has a payout of $600, 000 per team. This season is not an anomaly. The United States Naval Academy may not be Alabama or Michigan, but it plays a serious brand of Division I football. Last year, the Blue and Gold went   soundly defeating the University of Pittsburgh in the Military Bowl ($1 million payout for each team). In 2014, the team was   including a   victory over San Diego State in the Poinsettia Bowl ($750, 000 payout). Its 2013 record was   with a   win . .. well, you get the picture. The last time Navy had a losing season was 2011. But how does Navy do it? Aren’t there height and weight restrictions that would limit the Midshipmen’s ability to recruit the kind of athletes you need to succeed in Division I football? (There are.) Isn’t the federal government stingy in giving tax dollars to the military academies for athletics? (It is.) Aren’t the academies, charged with training the nation’s military leadership, supposed to maintain their admissions and academic standards even if it means passing on football players? (Yep.) And aren’t Naval Academy graduates required to put in five years of military service after graduation, which would seem to preclude attracting athletes with pro potential? (Yes again.) The Naval Academy will tell you that because athletics is such an important part of the school’s culture  —   it has 33 varsity teams, and every midshipman on campus plays a sport, even if it’s intramurals  —   that it naturally attracts good athletes. Plus, there’s that Navy spirit. As Dorse DuBois, a Naval Academy alumnus, put it recently on Facebook: “Football is a polite and unarmed version of warfare, played as though there’s no second place. ” He added: “Yeah, we’re a small school, our players are usually smaller, too. But we’re very physical, very disciplined and approach every game with the urgency required to win a battle. ” There is some merit to both rationales, but I’d also like to suggest a third possibility: Navy’s gaming the system. For instance, have you ever heard of the Naval Academy Preparatory School, or NAPS as it’s called? In Newport, R. I. close to the Naval War College, NAPS was founded in 1915 as a place where enlisted men with officer potential could get up to speed academically before entering the Naval Academy. By the late 1960s, NAPS had opened its doors to civilians. This was partly a diversity effort, but it was also a way to get in the children of alumni or politicians who didn’t have the grades or SAT scores to be admitted into the Naval Academy directly from high school. Once in NAPS, which is   students were essentially guaranteed a spot in the Naval Academy the next year. According to a Naval Academy spokesman, Cmdr. David McKinney, the prep school costs taxpayers around $14 million a year. In the 1980s, Navy noticed that the Air Force Academy, which was regularly trouncing it in football, was placing recruited athletes in its prep school. Indeed, in 2003, Fisher DeBerry, the longtime coach of the Falcons, told The Colorado Springs Gazette that the prep school “has had a major impact on the success of our football team. ” Eager to turn the tide against its rival, Navy began to copy DeBerry’s methods. Sure enough, NAPS is now a means by which Navy launders underqualified athletes into the Naval Academy. Jim Kenney, a retired Navy captain who was the commanding officer of the Navy prep school from   recalled that in his era maybe four football players had been enrolled. “Today,” he said, “it is dominated by athletes. ” McKinney says that recruited athletes made up only 35 percent of the current NAPS class. But their effect on Navy athletics is huge.   percent of the current football team got into the Naval Academy through NAPS, according to the Midshipmen football media guide. More than half the men’s basketball team went to NAPS, and 60 percent of the women’s basketball team. There have been years when 80 percent of the lacrosse team’s players were NAPS graduates. In addition to a free education, the Navy gives NAPS students $1, 000 a month. Ordinarily, this would be a violation of N. C. A. A. rules. Because NAPS students are being paid for being in the military, the N. C. A. A. has granted a waiver allowing the stipend. (The same is true at the Air Force and Army prep schools.) What was NAPS like for the athletes? The athletics were intense, and the academics none too stressful, recalled Peter Banos, who played basketball there in 2008. “There was all sorts of tutoring,” he said, “but really, it was like another year of high school. ” Banos added: “We had cars, we could visit friends, and we were flush with cash. It was high school kids getting paid. ” And if, after a year at NAPS, a student decided not to go the academy, the Navy didn’t ask for its money back. Banos left the Naval Academy after his freshman year. The Naval Academy said that many NAPS athletes go on to succeed at the academy and in the Navy. Three former Navy football players from the class of 1998, all of whom went through NAPS, are in important command posts seeking terrorists. There is a second way that Navy lands athletes who would normally be rejected through the admissions process. The Naval Academy Foundation, an entity founded in 1944 to support Navy athletics, pays for scholarships to send athletes to a private prep school, usually one with a heavy emphasis on sports. In return, the athletes are expected to go to the Naval Academy the next year. The donors to the foundation are almost all Naval Academy alumni. Let’s dwell on this for a second. Imagine if some Ohio State boosters paid to send recruited athletes to a private prep school for a year before they went to the university. It would be an    scandal  —   exactly the kind of booster bribery the N. C. A. A. wants to stamp out. Yet, once again, the military academies have been given a waiver by the association. Those height and weight restrictions I mentioned earlier? They are waived for athletes  —   at least until their eligibility is used up. At that point, those 280 pounds that made a Navy lineman so valuable to the team become a huge liability. They are suddenly under tremendous pressure to lose 50, 60, 70 pounds, depending on their height. And if they don’t  —   or simply can’t  —   their careers suffer, and sometimes end prematurely. As for that required five years of military service, there once was a time when even the best Navy athletes had to put in time after graduation before going on to a professional career. Roger Staubach, who won the Heisman Trophy as a junior in 1963, didn’t join the Dallas Cowboys until 1969. His Navy tour included a year in Vietnam. Recently, athletes good enough to become professionals haven’t had to put in five years of military service. In May, the secretary of the Navy granted waivers to four Navy athletes, allowing them to play while serving in the Reserve. They included Keenan Reynolds, last season’s quarterback, who is now with the Baltimore Ravens, and Joe Cardona, who is the long snapper for the New England Patriots. The good news, I suppose, is that, aside from the cost of NAPS, Navy athletics doesn’t cost the taxpayer very much money. The government allocates only $3. 9 million to the Navy athletic department. The rest of Navy’s athletic budget comes from an organization called the Naval Academy Athletic Association. Although the N. A. A. A. describes itself as a “nongovernment agency,” the majority of its board members are Naval Academy personnel, including Chet Gladchuk, the athletic director. Its offices are on campus. It uses the Naval Academy’s email system. And so on. And it doesn’t just finance the athletic department. It runs it. The N. A. A. A. employs and pays the coaches. (Navy’s football coach, Ken Niumatalolo, makes $1. 6 million.) It manages the stadium. It negotiates the media contracts. And it rustles up sponsors. In all, Navy’s athletic budget is over $40 million, in the same range as the budgets at Hawaii, Boise State and New Mexico. Are the compromises Navy makes to remain competitive in   college football any worse than other Division I schools? Not really. But that’s not the point. The military academies do something critical for our nation: They “train and educate junior officers in the Navy and Marine Corps,” said Barry Relinger, a Naval Academy alumnus. “They should be dedicated to that purpose and not trying to achieve greatness of Division I sports. ” No one is saying sports shouldn’t matter at the Naval Academy. The Navy believes that sports can build character and imbue leadership qualities that are important for officers. I’m not going to disagree. But to its critics, the gamesmanship required for the Naval Academy to be able to play football competitively with the likes of Notre Dame has hurt its ability to turn out the best officers possible. “I think competition is very important,” said David Tuma, an alumnus who has long been critical of Navy athletics. “But you don’t have to be in Division I to stir the competitive spirit. ” On Saturday afternoon, the annual   game will be a   patriotic spectacle. It will be fun to watch. Would we feel any different about it if the two schools didn’t park athletes in their prep schools? If the linemen weighed 230 instead of 280? If they were in Division III instead of Division I? I doubt it. If only the Navy believed that.",0

17447,Canada/US Tensions Heat Up as NAFTA’s Future Remains in Flux - Breitbart,"President Donald Trump has decided not to end the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that has guided trade between the US. Mexico, and Canada since 1994. But even his position now —  that the treaty needs to be renegotiatedhas caused protests from our northern neighbor. [“It has been a bad week for U. S.  trade relations,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Monday:  Last Monday, it became apparent that Canada intends to effectively cut off the last dairy products being exported from the United States. Today, in a different matter, the Department of Commerce determined a need to impose countervailing duties of roughly one billion dollars on Canadian softwood lumber exports to us. This is not our idea of a properly functioning Free Trade Agreement. On Thursday Rep. Claudia Tenney ( ) and a group of 70 bipartisan House members sent a letter to the president urging him to hold Canada accountable for its current trade commitments to the U. S. especially the dairy industry. “Until recently, Canada used a   milk pricing system. However, in April, Canada revised its milk classification system, which has led to changes in the dairy market that have disproportionately hurt our farmers,” a press release announcing the letter said. “Unfair trade deals have disadvantaged American workers for far too long,” Tenney said, noting the dairy farms in upstate New York have been especially hard hit. “It’s time that we hold our trading partners accountable for their actions, especially in this case where the consequences equal lost jobs and closed farms. “When given an even playing field, our famers can produce and sell the highest quality dairy in the world,” Tenney said. “I urge the administration to defend our dairy farmers and hold Canada accountable. ” Tenney also applauded President Trump’s Executive Order signed earlier this week, directing the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture to conduct a review to identify and eliminate unnecessary regulations that have put undue burdens on farmers and rural communities. Former American Farm Bureau President Bob Stallman told Berns News Bureau that NAFTA renegotiations may have already started and that the U. S. should be “forceful” and “strong” in any reworking of the trade deal.",0
17448,"The Vexed Question of the Dollar « SGTreport – The Corporate Propaganda Antidote – Silver, Gold, Truth, Liberty, & Freedom","The Vexed Question of the Dollar 
by Alasdair Macleod, GoldMoney : 
There is little doubt that the rapid expansion of both dollar-denominated debt and monetary quantities since the financial crisis will lead us into a currency crisis. 
We just don’t know when, and the dollar is not alone. All the major paper currencies have been massively inflated in recent years. With the dollar acting as the world’s reserve currency, where the dollar goes, so do all the other fiat monies. Until that cataclysmic event, we watch currencies behave in increasingly unexpected, seemingly irrational ways. The fundamentals for Japan are not good, yet the yen remains the strongest currency of the big four. The Eurozone risks a systemic collapse, overwhelmed by political and financial headwinds, yet the euro’s exchange rate has proved relatively impervious to this deep uncertainty. The British economy is strongest, yet sterling is the weakest of the four majors. 
If nothing else, today’s foreign exchanges are evidence that subjectivity triumphs over macroeconomic thinking. Mackay’s Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds beats computer modelling every time. Furthermore, any official attempt to establish a rate for the dollar has to address two separate questions: the value of the dollar relative to other currencies, and its purchasing power for goods and services. 
The chart below indicates how the dollar has behaved against other currencies over the last five years, both on a trade weighted and on a predefined currency basis (DXY). 
It should be noted that the dollar has risen on both these measures by roughly 18% since early 2014. At the same time, the Chinese yuan has fallen against the dollar by about 12%, so it has actually risen slightly against the DXY basket as a whole, particularly against the euro component, where it has gained 12% since early 2014. This matters, because far from devaluing, which is what we are routinely told by dollar-centric analysts, the yuan has been relatively stable over time against a basket of currencies. It has been weak against the dollar and yen, but strong against both the euro and sterling. 
We should look at this from the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee’s point of view. America runs a record trade deficit with China, and the only major economies where China’s terms of trade have improved are with the US, excepting Japan. Therefore, the Fed is bound to be very sensitive to the dollar’s exchange rate with China’s yuan Furthermore, on two occasions when the Fed had signalled it was going to raise the Fed Funds Rate, it backed off when the Chinese lowered the rate at which it had pegged the yuan to the dollar. Chinese devaluation against the dollar is obviously a prime concern for the Fed. 
The situation becomes better understood when the Peoples Bank’s position is taken into account. The bank has been selling US Treasury stock in large quantities, stockpiling commodities and oil with the proceeds, though it has been diversifying into Japanese Government bonds as well. China’s dollars have been welcomed by markets, which are short of both quality collateral and raw currency. However, China’s supply of both has failed to stop the dollar rising against the yuan. Furthermore, China isn’t the only Asian and Middle Eastern state selling American paper, so the demand from other international players on the buy side has been immense, enough to determine the underlying direction of the dollar’s exchange rate. 
The situation is being exploited by the Peoples Bank. In effect, the Peoples Bank is in a position to dictate Fed policy by adjusting the rate at which it is prepared to supply dollars into the market. So long as the dollar remains fundamentally strong, it only has to slow the pace of Treasury and dollar sales for the dollar to rise, and therefore the Fed’s planned interest rate rises to be deferred. This is not understood properly by western commentators, who erroneously think China is being forced to defend a declining yuan. Nothing could be further from the truth. It will be interesting to see whether this happens again ahead of the December FOMC meeting, when for the umpteenth time we have been promised a rise in the Fed Funds Rate. 
A major consideration behind China’s foreign exchange policy is the outlook for the euro. The Eurozone represents a market as large as the US, with the added importance of being tagged onto the Asian continent. There can be little doubt that China sees her own long-term future being aligned more with Europe than America, despite Europe’s current troubles. It is, if you like, a situation that is primarily of strategic importance. Europe’s economy will need rescuing at some stage, and is therefore a future opportunity for China’s intervention. ",0
17449,"Refugees, Quebec, Rodrigo Duterte: Your Morning Briefing - The New York Times","Good morning.  Here’s what you need to know: • American divisions are rapidly widening over President Trump’s order to close the U. S. to refugees and people from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Implemented with little regard for basic governance, the measure drew support from Mr. Trump’s supporters but criticism from   protesters, Silicon Valley, some members of his own party, State Department diplomats and even former President Obama. Mr. Trump fired the acting attorney general, a holdover from the Obama administration, after she instructed the Justice Department not to defend the order. World leaders have objected to the order, but the leaders of U. S. allies are faced with either openly criticizing Mr. Trump or facing protests at home, like the one above in Scotland. _____ • Mr. Trump’s team was also on the defense over his startling reorganization of the National Security Council, a crucial adviser on major decisions. Stephen K. Bannon, the former head of the provocative website Breitbart, now has a full seat on the principals committee, while the roles of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence were downgraded. Mr. Trump sought to shift the focus to his coming Supreme Court choice. _____ • Messages of solidarity poured into Canada after a mass shooting at a Quebec mosque that left six dead. The suspect in custody was identified as a      university student who, according to local press reports, had a history of provocative views and antisocial behavior. _____ • The top police official in the Philippines said the police would suspend participating in the nation’s bloody drug war while he purged rogue officers like those who strangled a South Korean businessman at Police Headquarters last year. “Ready yourselves, you bad cops,” the official, Ronald dela Rosa, said. “We no longer have a war on drugs, but we now have a war on scalawags. ” The order came hours after President Rodrigo Duterte rejected calls to fire Mr. dela Rosa, above right. Rights groups dismissed the move as a bid to deflect attention from police impunity. _____ • And Australian police are reviewing the deaths of 88 men between 1976 and 2000 to determine whether they should be classified as   hate crimes. The authorities now say gangs of teenagers hunted gay men for sport, sometimes forcing their victims off the cliffs that line Sydney Harbor. Above, a man whose brother fell to his death there in 1988. “We can now see that predators were attacking gay men,” said a former police minister. “And they were doing it with the   knowledge that the police would not have gone after them.

17451,Toll of London Attack Is Global for an Assailant Born in Britain - The New York Times,"LONDON  —   The roster of the dead and wounded spanned the globe: a veteran Scotland Yard constable, a Mormon couple from Utah, South Korean tourists, French high schoolers and Romanian lovers. The killer turned out to be homegrown, a    Briton, Khalid Masood, who had a criminal record but was not on any   lists. The Islamic State, which rejects peace and coexistence, described Mr. Masood on Thursday as a disciple and a hero for the assault carried out a day earlier in the shadow of Big Ben. Mr. Masood plowed a rented Hyundai sport utility vehicle through pedestrians on the Westminster Bridge, killing two and injuring at least 40 crashed the vehicle into a fence and then emerged brandishing knives to fatally stab the constable before other police officers shot and killed him. On Thursday evening, another seriously injured victim died, bringing the total number of dead to five, including Mr. Masood. Details about Mr. Masood emerged on Thursday as the government worked to project normalcy and calm nerves. The authorities emphasized that they thought the assailant had acted alone, and that they did not expect any further attacks. But they raided six properties across the country, detaining eight people in London and Birmingham. “Yesterday, an act of terrorism tried to silence our democracy,” Prime Minister Theresa May told Parliament, addressing colleagues who a day earlier had been placed on lockdown for hours. “We are not afraid, and our resolve will never waver in the face of terrorism. ” She called the violence “an attack on free people everywhere. ” At the United Nations, where the Security Council observed a minute of silence, Britain’s foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said, “The world is united to defeat the people who launched this attack and to defeat their bankrupt and odious ideology. ” Even as the British capital returned to its daily rhythms, and as Parliament resumed business, police officers were trying to learn whether they had missed signs of Mr. Masood’s radicalization. He was born on Dec. 25, 1964, in Kent, in southeastern England, and had recently lived near Birmingham, historically known for its automotive industry and now home to many South Asian and Caribbean immigrants and their children. It was there, in the Spring Hill neighborhood, that Mr. Masood rented from an Enterprise branch the Hyundai Tucson that he used in the attack. Mr. Masood had a record of convictions, from 1983 to 2003, for assault, weapons possession and violations of public order. But he was not the subject of any current investigation, and “there was no prior intelligence about his intent to mount a terrorist attack,” the London police said. Birmingham has a history of connections with radicalism. It was home to Rashid Rauf, a liaison to Al Qaeda and a main suspect in a plot to blow up   airliners in 2006 he was killed in 2008 in an American airstrike in northern Pakistan. Last year, security services foiled a bomb plot in Birmingham, linked to extremists. The Home Office made support for the Islamic State a criminal offense in June 2014, when Mrs. May was home secretary, and experts on radicalism said that the change had driven many extremists underground. On Thursday morning, the Islamic State issued a statement on the messaging app Telegram, calling the attacker a soldier who had “carried out the operation in response to appeals” to fight Western powers involved in military operations in the Middle East. The group has called for attacks on Britain, and Mr. Masood’s assault was reminiscent of attacks in France and Germany carried out with vehicles. A man tried to drive into a crowd in Antwerp, Belgium, on Thursday but was stopped. Mrs. May visited victims at a hospital in London for 40 minutes on Thursday, according to her office. Details about most have not been released, but some information has dribbled out. Police Constable Keith Palmer, 48, a member of the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command, was patrolling the Parliament building when the assailant fatally stabbed him. Tributes for Constable Palmer have poured in, and the Metropolitan Police announced on Twitter that his badge number would be retired. “Keith Palmer was killed while bravely doing his duty  —   protecting our city and the heart of our democracy from those who want to destroy our way of life,” London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, said. Kurt W. Cochran, an American traveling in Europe with his wife, Melissa Payne Cochran, died of injuries, according to a statement from the family issued through the Church of Jesus Christ of   Saints in Salt Lake City. Clint Payne, Mr. Cochran’s    said in the statement that the couple had been traveling in Europe for their 25th wedding anniversary, and had been scheduled to fly home on Thursday. He called Mr. Cochran “a good man and a loving husband. ” Mr. Cochran’s wife was wounded in the attack, and hospitalized with “a broken leg, a broken rib and a cut on her head,” her sister, Sarah   said in a post on Facebook. Their parents were serving as missionaries in London, according to the church. The couple ran a recording studio in West Bountiful, Utah, and Mr. Cochran had shared pictures of their stops in Germany and Scotland. Aysha Frade, 43, a British teacher who lived in London, was fatally injured as she was heading to pick up her two daughters. She taught Spanish not far from Westminster Bridge, according to the Spanish newspaper La Voz de Galicia, and she had family in Spain, according to the Spanish Foreign Ministry. The injured also included three   boys from the Brittany region of France who were on the bridge with other visiting students and who sustained leg and arm fractures. On Thursday, the French Education Ministry said that their conditions were no longer  . Five South Koreans were wounded when they were mobbed by a crowd fleeing the attack site, according to the South Korean Foreign Ministry. Four of them  —   three women and a man in their 50s and 60s  —   suffered fractures and other injuries. A    woman, however, required surgery for a head injury, according to South Korean news reports. The two Romanian victims, Andreea Cristea, 31, and Andrei Burnaz, 32, were from the Black Sea port city of Constanta, according to the Romanian news agency Mediafax, which quoted an official saying they had been visiting London to celebrate Mr. Burnaz’s birthday. Ms. Cristea was rescued after she plunged off the bridge into the Thames as the assailant careened the S. U. V. through the crowd, and news reports said she suffered serious head injuries and lung damage. Mr. Burnaz’s foot was fractured. An area outside Parliament remained a large crime scene on Thursday, as police officers examined the pavement stones for clues. The Palace of Westminster, which includes the Houses of Parliament, is a bewildering warren of corridors, and the work of ensuring that it was clear of assailants took time in the immediate aftermath of the assault. A group of visiting schoolchildren  —   some in tears  —   were among those caught up in the confusion, which lasted for hours. Lawmakers were confined to specific areas, where they were given water and in some cases sandwiches. But what some lacked most of all was the power to communicate, and to check that their staff was safe. Over all, the atmosphere was one of calm and cooperation, however. “People appreciated the gravity of the situation,” said Nigel Evans, a Conservative lawmaker. That may have been partly because an attack of this type had not been completely unexpected. Security has been noticeably tightened in Parliament in recent years, with large barriers placed in front of parts of the building to thwart the threat of a truck bomb. Police officers with submachine guns patrol the grounds routinely. But the complex is by a busy street, and some lawmakers still wonder whether some of the security was designed with the idea of fending off the type of attacks once mounted by the Irish Republican Army, which in 1979 assassinated a Conservative lawmaker, Airey Neave, using a car bomb in Parliament. “I am shocked, but I am not surprised,” Chris Bryant, a Labour lawmaker, said of the latest attack. “We have always known that a marauding attack by an individual would be the most difficult to prevent. ” On Thursday, with tightened security, lawmakers crowded into the parliamentary chamber determined to show that they would not be deterred. Ed Miliband, a former leader of the opposition Labour Party, said the mood had been one of “shock and determination and also admiration for the job that the security people are doing. ” “I think we are seeing people’s increased determination to carry on with their normal business,” he said.",0

17455,8 Terrifying Plants You Didn’t Know About,"As Halloween approaches, here are some terrifying plants and fungus you never want to run into. 

Plants are not usually thought of as particularly scary. Here are 10 plants and fungus that will leave you with goosebumps on your skin. 

Bleeding Tooth Fungus 
This fungus is inedible (though not toxic), and can be found in North America, Europe, Iran, and Korea. 

Young, moist fruit bodies can ‘bleed’ a bright red fluid that contains pigment known to have anticoagulant properties similar to heparin. 

If you find yourself exploring the Pacific Northwest, Alaska, or North Carolina, you may run into this bloody fungus. Try not to scream. 

Red Tide 
The red tide of ‘algal bloom’ is a phenomenon that occurs in areas of the ocean that contain high concentrations of algae. The water turns red and red tides are considered to be the inspiration behind the Biblical blood ocean. 

Algal blooms happen all over the world and the algae differs from body of water to body of water. The effect of the red tide can be fatal to sea creatures and humans who consume seafood contaminated with the toxin. 

Although not all red tides are poisonous, their decomposing process can deplete the water of its oxygen, forcing animals to relocate or die. 

Venus Flytrap 
The venus flytrap is probably one of the most popular creepy plants. It is known for its predatory behavior towards small flying insects. Its trapping mechanism is made of what looks like a ‘mouth’, or two leaves whose hairs sense prey and toothlike cilia that keep the prey from escaping. 

The venus flytrap can even tell the difference between live prey and non-prey like raindrops. The flytrap will let small prey that wouldn’t be worth the energy of digestion go. 

Nonetheless, these creepy little plants are inspiration for many horror film monsters and would be a nightmare if they were human sized. 

Brain Cactus 
Varieties of mammillaria elongata, native to Mexico, grow in many different shapes and sized. The most distinctive of all is the ‘brain cactus’. 

As the brain cactus matures, it looks more and more like a human brain. Imagine stumbling upon this prickly organ in the middle of the desert on a dark night! 

Gympie Gympie Tree 
The gympie gympie tree has a reputation as the most painful tree to exist. Its stinging hairs deliver a very potent neurotoxin and severe stinging. The effects of rubbing against this mean tree can even be fatal to humans. 

To be affected, all you have to do is slightly touch the plant and you will feel the effects of the toxins, which can include aching joints, swelling under the armpits, and a burning sensation. 

If you are unfortunate enough to be stung by this tree, be sure to remove the hairs or they will continue to release the poison into your body. 

Doll’s Eye is a plant that is native to Northeast America. 

It’s highly poisonous berries resemble eyeballs are ripen in the summer, staying until the frost. Just in time for Halloween! 

Corpse Flower 
This flower actually smells like rotting flesh in order to attract pollinators like beetles and flies. 

The plant can grow up to 10 feet tall, and although it is called “the world’s largest flower”, it is actually made up of thousands of small flowers. 

Octopus Stinkhorn 
These mushrooms start out looking like traditional Mario-style mushrooms but mature and erupt their red tentacles to attract flies. These tentacles smell horrible and attract the flies so they can transport their “gleba” to another location for reproduction.

17456,"Former U.N. Security Council Head: In Venezuela, Even Opposition Uncomfortable Defying ’Socialism’ - Breitbart","Diego Arria  —   a former Venezuelan diplomat and U. N. Security Council president now dedicated to the struggle against socialist Chavismo in his native country  —   sees removing dictator Nicolás Maduro from power as only a first step in saving Venezuela from decades of corruption and decay. [Arria emphasized in an interview with Breitbart News, conducted in both Spanish and English, that removing Maduro would do little to establish a free democratic republic in Venezuela without a clean sweep of the thousands of government employees and soldiers affiliated with terrorism, drug crime, and still loyal to a socialist model of government.  “[We need] a model based on liberty, free economy  —   not a   or socialist model or anything remotely like that,” Arria noted. “If we do not change the political and economic model, we will always be an unstable country. ” Arria deemed this establishment of a   political and economic model a “refounding of the republic,” which would require a new constitution and an abandonment of both the leftist ideology of the ruling party and the   approach of the official opposition. The Venezuelan opposition today largely focuses on the removal of Maduro from power, demanding free and fair elections. What the leaders of the opposition wish to see replace Maduro is not clearly defined, largely because of their own backgrounds: many also identify as socialists. While they oppose the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) many of the parties that form the Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD) the opposition coalition in the National Assembly, are member parties of the Socialist International, including Popular Will, the party led by political prisoner Leopoldo López. Henry Ramos Allup, a key member of the Venezuelan opposition, is a vice president of the Socialist International. Asked to explain this phenomenon to an American audience, who largely reject the label “socialist,” Arria laments that many Venezuelan parties feel the need to identify as socialist, even nominally. “For a long time, the official opposition was ‘Chavista light’  …     there has been a sort of hijacking of the political class, as if the Socialist International were the club of dignified, enlightened, or democratic governments in the world when this is not true,” he notes. “Among the official parties there are all kinds [of ideologies] but all are social democrats or moderate socialists, there is not a single [other kind]. ” “In Venezuela, people have a complex about calling themselves conservative,” he adds. “We have to enter a period of transition,” he explained, “that will not be conventional, it will not be a ‘Jeffersonian model’ [of reform] because Venezuela has things like this:” We have 50, 000 Cubans in Venezuela. This is more than the number of forces that Spain had occupying Venezuela during our war of independence. I am not saying that these 50, 000 Cubans are all soldiers, but thousands of them are trained for these ends. We have 100, 000 militiamen, paramilitaries  …     and the influence of the drug cartels in the armed forces, in police forces, in the judicial system. How do you remove that simply with an election replacing one government with another? Late dictator Hugo Chávez forged a lasting bond with the communist government of Cuba that persists to this day, in which Venezuela relies heavily on Cuba for doctors, ( ) medicine, soldiers, and intelligence officials. Venezuela supplies Cuba with oil, filling a void left by the collapse of the Soviet Union. Venezuelans have long complained that among the cruelest and most violent state officers acting against peaceful protesters have been Cubans, easily identified by their accents and superior ranking. The word “colony” for what the Castros have done to Venezuela surfaces often. A 2013 estimate by   General Antonio Rivero put the number of Cuban nationals that had passed through Venezuela since Chávez took power at upwards of 200, 000. Arria emphasizes that civilian Cubans seeking an escape from the island prison are not the problem. “To begin with, the ones who are doctors and sports players, I’m sure they would like to stay in Venezuela, so those are no problem because you give them nationality and they are fine,” he notes. “The problem is with the people who are today in the intelligence departments  …     Cubans have killed Venezuelans and tortured Venezuelans and they are doing that now. ” Rescuing Venezuela from failed state status, then, also requires the demise of the Castro regime, because any resources that fall in the hands of the Castros further their colonial ambitions in the South American country. “You cannot exclude in the U. S.  agenda my own country, because we play a fundamental role in the preservation of the Cuban economy and we pay the consequences of that relationship,” he notes.

17457,Blackwell: Energy Security Means Putting America First - Breitbart,"Every year, the United States spends $67. 5 billion to ensure the worldwide free flow of oil. Often produced in unstable parts of the world and shipped through insecure chokepoints, the U. S. military works to make sure crude oil from other countries makes it safely onto the global market. Yet while this global oil market benefits some nations, its volatility threatens the American economy and undermines U. S. national security. [From technology to the weather, the factors affecting the price of oil are frequent and varied. One key constant, however, is the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Companies (OPEC) a cartel that uses its significant reserves of crude and concentrated political power structures to exert undue influence on the world price, affecting the U. S. economy as a result. This influence was felt most prominently and recently in our own energy industry. Amid the rising oil prices of the previous decade, a small group of innovative American producers used new technology to unlock the oil held in U. S. shale formations, long considered to be too expensive and limited to produce. This new production rewrote the energy rulebook, and our oil imports were halved.  Even as U. S. crude production rose, industry watchers were unconcerned about global oversupply, confident that OPEC —  led by global swing producer Saudi Arabia —  would take its usual approach and cut production. At the November 2014 OPEC meeting on Thanksgiving Day, however, that confidence evaporated. The cartel announced it would maintain its production levels, sending prices into a tailspin. In June 24, the price of oil was $110 per barrel. By January 2016, the price was just $26. Although the price crash benefits consumers in the   with average annual household spending on gasoline falling almost 21 percent between 2011 and 2015, the U. S. shale industry has struggled. Since January 2015, more than 220 oil companies have gone bankrupt, taking 150, 000 jobs with them and nudging parts of the country that benefited from the oil boom back toward recession. But despite this success in decimating America’s domestic oil industry, OPEC has not finished yet. Spurred on by domestic issues such as social spending, OPEC is shifting strategy and creating more volatility by bringing in Russia and others to collaborate on production as a “supercartel. ” The group’s unprecedented influence stems from its control of 90 percent of global reserves, but these entities do not act in the   profit maximizing manner of American producers. They serve instead as government proxies, generating revenues to support regimes that do not share U. S. strategic priorities. Despite this clear conflict of interest, our military ensures the free flow of their crude because oil is vital to the U. S. economy, powering 92 percent of our transportation system. The global nature of oil pricing means that no matter how much oil we produce, our economic sovereignty remains jeopardized by OPEC and the supercartel. To counter our reliance on this opaque oil market, we must develop a range of policy responses. First, we must develop more resources here at home. Second, we must modernize our fuel efficiency standards to maximize the benefits from the oil we use. Third, we must encourage the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles running on diverse sources of domestic energy, including electricity, natural gas, and hydrogen. Finally, we must have an honest assessment of our ability to respond to OPEC’s actions to influence oil prices. Work has already begun in Congress on this final recommendation, through the bipartisan introduction of H. R. 545 by Kevin Cramer ( ) Collin Peterson ( ) Trent Franks ( ) and David Scott ( ). The bill creates a Congressional commission that investigates OPEC’s influence over the global oil market, examines America’s ability to mitigate the cartel’s effects and proposes a range of policy responses —  trade, diplomatic, statutory and regulatory —  to President Trump and Congress. As American lives and our economic sovereignty continue to be risked to ensure a free flow of oil for countries that do not share our interests, the time for action is now. The President has rightly prioritized energy security in his America First Energy Plan, stating that his administration wants to, “Become, and stay, totally independent of any need to import energy from the OPEC cartel or any nations hostile to our interests. ” With President Trump in office, the opportunity to tackle OPEC’s outsized influence has presented itself. The swift establishment of this committee will give it the potential to frame the administration’s energy agenda for at least the next four years —  and ensure, most importantly, that our energy system truly works in our national interest.

17458,Donald Trump Hit With VERY Shady Voter Intimidation Lawsuit In Arizona (DETAILS),"0 1661 
Donald Trump wants so-called “poll watchers” to scare people into not voting? Fine, then Arizona Democrats will sue their state GOP’s sorry ass… And they’ve got a good chance of winning. 
The U.S. Supreme Court’s gutting of the Voting Rights Act in 2013 was a huge win for the Republican Party. Since high voter turnout — especially high minority voter turnout — creates victories for Democrats, it makes sense for the GOP to keep as many people from voting as they possibly can. There’s just one thing the party of Donald Trump forgot: Voters still do have some rights, and the GOP doesn’t get to do whatever the hell it wants. 
Donald Trump’s calls for “poll watchers” to prevent nonexistent “voter fraud” may land the Republican Party in some serious hot water. AZ Central reports the Democratic Party of Arizona filed a lawsuit and seeks a court order banning Mein Trumpf’s bands of brown shirts from the polling places. 
‘The suit filed in federal court in Phoenix Monday seeks an order blocking volunteer GOP poll watchers from harassing or photographing people headed to polling locations. The suit says the state Republican Party is essentially an arm of Trump’s campaign and the campaign and its backers have been organizing “citizen journalists” and “poll watchers” to flood minority-heavy polling sites on Nov. 8.’ 
And despite the demise of key provisions of the Voting Rights Act, they’ve still got some ammo. Last week, Rachel Maddow talked about something the GOP forgot about: That pesky old legal consent decree. Back in 1981, the Republican National Committee (RNC) employed similar “poll watcher” tactics during a tight governor race in New Jersey. Their “Ballot Security Task Force” employed heavy-handed tactics in minority districts and won the race for their candidate by a razor thin margin. 
Unfortunately, the GOP’s short-term win backfired and had long-term consequences: a 35-year consent decree that puts strong limits on their “poll watching” activities. These legal restrictions don’t expire until next year. Naturally, Donald Trump’s renewed call for “poll watchers” has triggered concerns on the part of DNC lawyers at the national level. Now, they’re demanding that the courts extend the consent decree through 2025. Watch: Rachel Maddow explains how Trump’s call for “poll watchers” is causing legal trouble for the RNC. 
Of course, Tim Sifert, the state’s GOP spokesman, insists these poll watchers aren’t trying to intimidate voters. They’re just helping “monitor” polling places since — thanks to SCOTUS — we no longer have as many actual monitors for U.S. elections. But, as POLITICO points out, there’s a huge difference between having impartial observers around to provide advice and support for voters and poll workers and having “poll watchers” spreading misinformation and scaring voters. 
‘Trump seems to be advocating for a type of election monitoring that relies on volunteers to use deceptive practices that are often used to prevent people of color from voting. Voter suppression has changed since the era of literacy tests and poll taxes. In 2016, suppression occurs in two distinct stages: one before the election, and one at the polling locations themselves.’ 
The POLITICO article explains how the GOP tries to scare people into not voting in two stages. Stage 1: Before an election, Republicans try to keep people from casting their ballots with false — and sometimes scary — information. In 2008, mailers went out telling Democratic voters in Virginia that Election Day had been moved from Tuesday to Wednesday. Meanwhile, black neighborhoods in Milwaukee (2004) and Philadelphia (2008) got plastered with flyers warning that people with unpaid child support and parking tickets might get arrested when they show up to vote. Stage 2: On election day, so-called “poll watchers” — often with fake badges and IDs that make them look like they’re in positions of authority — single out non-white voters with demands for ID and questions about their citizenship. They also often scare off eligible voters by taking photos and video footage (which sounds innocuous unless you happen to be among the roughly 7.5 million people being stalked each year). 
And, let’s not forget — here’s what “poll watchers” looked like during the post-Civil War Reconstruction era. ",0
17459,FBI Insider: Clinton Emails Linked To Political Pedophile Sex Ring,"posted by Eddie An FBI source has confirmed that evidence has emerged from the Clinton email investigation that a massive child trafficking and pedophile sex ring operates in Washington.

17461,Re: When Americans Shall Say ‘Peace And Safety’…,"When Americans Shall Say ‘Peace And Safety’… By Michael Snyder, on November 21st, 2016 
Millions of Americans are expecting a new “golden age” for America under Donald Trump, but is that what they are going to get? There is always optimism when a new president is elected, but I don’t know if I have ever seen anything like the euphoria that many Trump supporters are expressing right now. Look, I voted for Donald Trump and I want him to be as successful as possible. But when Donald Trump becomes our next president on January 20th , that does not mean that all of the great problems that our nation is facing will somehow magically disappear. If you listen to some people, they make it sound like America is going to experience nothing but peace, prosperity and blessing for decades to come. I would love it if that was indeed going to be the case, but unfortunately that is simply not the truth. 
We are currently on a path that leads to national suicide, and unless we change our ways it isn’t going to matter who is in the White House. 
I keep hearing about how our new president is going to “unify” the nation, but that is going to be extremely difficult to do considering the fact that we are now more divided than ever. In fact, a brand new Gallup survey found that an all-time record high 77 percent of all Americans believe that we are “greatly divided when it comes to the most important values” . 
I keep hearing about how we are now entering a golden age of peace and prosperity, but how is that supposed to happen while we are still butchering millions of innocent children in our abortion mills? 
I keep hearing about how the economy is about to take off like a rocket, but how is that possible when we have already been on the greatest debt binge in world history ? The only way we have been able to maintain our massively inflated debt-fueled standard of living is by piling up debt at a faster pace than any generation in history. Today we have accumulated 12 trillion dollars in consumer debt, corporate debt has doubled since the last financial crisis, and the national debt is rapidly approaching 20 trillion dollars. How can Trump possibly pump up our standard of living with debt more than Obama has already done? 
I keep hearing about how we are “going to make America great again”, but how can we be great when we are producing more pornography than the rest of the world combined? 
I keep hearing about how “law and order is going to restored”, but meanwhile chaos has already been erupting in cities all over the nation and the far left is planning to turn Inauguration Day into a major riot . 
I keep hearing about how “things are going to go back to the way they used to be”, but as I discussed in a previous article , “sexually-transmitted diseases are spreading at the fastest pace in decades, the percentage of births out of wedlock is more than 10 times higher than in 1940, and approximately two out of every three Christian men watch pornography on a regular basis.” 
I keep hearing about how we are going “to drain the swamp”, and yet there are no plans to even reform the Federal Reserve system which is at the very heart of our financial problems as a nation . 
I keep hearing about how good judges are going to be put on the Supreme Court, but how can we trust that when our new president just said that he is “fine with” the Supreme Court decision that forced all 50 states to redefine the institution of marriage? 
I keep hearing about how we are going to be “an example” for the rest of the world, but how can we be “an example” when just about every form of evil imaginable is exploding in popularity inside our own country? 
I keep hearing about how our government is going to be “blessed”, but how can a government that gives hundreds of millions of dollars a year to Planned Parenthood be “blessed”? Now that the Republicans have control of the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives, this is their golden opportunity to defund Planned Parenthood. If it doesn’t happen now, it probably will never happen, and it will show what a complete and utter failure the Republican Party has become. Remember, Planned Parenthood is an organization that has been caught on camera admitting that they harvest organs from the babies that they kill and that they sell those organs off to the highest bidder. 
Some would argue that America is already “great” at a lot of things. After all, the United States is number one in the world in television watching, legal drug use and illegal drug use. 
We lead the world in plastic surgery, eating disorder deaths, teen pregnancy and lawyers per capita. 
We have the highest STD infection rate in the industrialized world, the highest divorce rate in the industrialized world, and the largest prison population on the entire planet. 
We also have the most complicated tax system in the entire world, the largest trade deficit in the entire world, and the largest national debt in the entire world. 
So if we want to make America great again, we sure have a lot of work to do. 
The complacency that I am seeing out there right now really alarms me. So many people seem to think that the battle is won because Donald Trump was victorious on election night. But that is not even close to reality. 
If we do not fundamentally change course as a nation we will not survive. Tinkering with tax rates, regulations and trade agreements is not going to get the job done. So many people are acting as if we just have a few cuts and scratches, when the reality is what our country really needs is major heart surgery. 
Donald Trump is not some sort of a messiah, and even if he is able to accomplish every single thing that he is promising right now it will not nearly be enough. 
But for the moment millions of Americans are proclaiming “peace and safety” now that Donald Trump has won the election, and we shall see how it all turns out… November 21st, 2016 | Tags: Americans , Anxiety , Blessing , Donald Trump , National Suicide , Peace , Safety , Successful , Suicide , Trump | Category: Commentary We Are Being Set Up For Higher Interest Rates, A Major Recession And A Giant Stock Market Crash »",0
17462,Bride Is Walked Down Aisle by the Man Who Got Her Father’s Donated Heart - The New York Times,"It’s a bittersweet wedding story a decade in the making: Nearly 10 years after Jeni Stepien’s father was killed, the man who received her father’s donated heart traveled from New Jersey to Pennsylvania to walk her down the aisle. “The murder and the wedding happened within a   radius” in the town of Swissvale, Pa. Ms. Stepien, an elementary schoolteacher, said in an interview on Monday, as she was about to board a plane for her honeymoon. “And I was just thinking, ‘My dad is here with us, and this man is here with us because of us.’ ” This story began in September 2006, when her father, Michael Stepien, was walking home from his job as head chef at a restaurant. Mr. Stepien, 53, was cutting through an alley when he was robbed at gunpoint by a    who shot him in the head at close range, she said. Leslie L. Brown was convicted of   murder in the killing and is serving 40 years to life in prison, according to news reports. As her father lay dying at a hospital, Ms. Stepien said, her family “decided to accept the inevitable” and donated his organs through an organization called the Center for Organ Recovery and Education. The organization allows donor families and the recipients to keep in touch with one another after the transplant. Mr. Stepien’s heart went to Arthur Thomas, a father of four who lives in Lawrenceville, N. J. and who Ms. Stepien said had been within days of dying. Given a diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia about 16 years before receiving the transplant, Mr. Thomas, 72, said in an interview on Monday that he was in congestive heart failure when word arrived that his doctors had found a heart. “In order to get to the top of the transplant list, you have to be really hurting,” Mr. Thomas said. “Once I had my transplant, I, of course, decided I would write a   to the family. ” From there, a relationship was forged through monthly phone calls, emails and letters. Ms. Stepien’s mother, Bernice, kept in touch with Mr. Thomas, even swapping cards on Christmas and flowers on birthdays. At times, they compared parenting tips. But the families had not thought about meeting in person until Jeni Stepien, 33, became engaged to Paul Maenner, a    engineer, in October. “One of my first thoughts in that following week was, ‘Who will walk me down the aisle?’ ” Ms. Stepien said. “I was thinking, ‘Oh, my gosh, it would be so incredible to have a physical piece of my father there.’ ” At her fiancé’s suggestion, Ms. Stepien wrote Mr. Thomas, whom the family calls Tom, asking him to walk her down the aisle. Mr. Thomas said yes, but only after running the proposition by his    daughter, Jackie, he said. “She said, ‘I think it’s a wonderful idea,’ ” Mr. Thomas said of his daughter, who also recommended that he start practicing walking down the aisle. (He said he practiced once before the wedding.) Mr. Thomas, a retired college adviser who formerly worked at a boarding school in Lawrenceville, warned Ms. Stepien that his emotions might get the best of him. Ms. Stepien said she felt the same, and told him, “I’ll be right there with you. ” The wedding took place on Saturday in the church in Swissvale where Ms. Stepien’s parents were married. Mr. Thomas and the bride formally met one day earlier, when he suggested she grip his wrist, where his pulse is strongest. “I thought that would be the best way for her to feel close to her dad,” Mr. Thomas said. “That’s her father’s heart beating. ” At the church, the bride was photographed touching Mr. Thomas’s chest. At the reception, they danced together, and guests mingled with Mr. Thomas and his wife, Nancy. The two families say they want to keep in touch and will plan a   somewhere down the road  —   maybe an event with a little less pressure. “I felt wonderful about bringing her dad’s heart to Pittsburgh,” Mr. Thomas said. “If I had to, I would’ve walked. ”",0
17463,"If Donald Trump Wins, He Will Be 70 Years, 7 Months And 7 Days Old On His First Full Day In Office","The Vatican Is Controlling History Ξ [November 2, 2016] BLOG If Donald Trump Wins, He Will Be 70 Years, 7 Months And 7 Days Old On His First Full Day In Office posted by Eddie A couple of weeks ago, it looked like Hillary Clinton was all set to cruise to victory, but now the FBI has delivered an election miracle in the nick of time. A few of my readers had criticized me for suggesting that Trump might lose, but I don’t know who is going to win the election, and so all I had to go on was the cold, hard numbers. And a couple of weeks ago the cold, hard numbers were telling me that Hillary Clinton was going to win. Of course it is entirely possible that the national polls might have been seriously wrong, but even the state polls in the most important battleground states consistently had bad news for Trump. So things didn’t look good for Trump at the time, but now that the FBI has renewed their investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails the poll numbers have shifted dramatically in Trump’s favor. As I write this article, the national polls have really tightened up. In fact, the latest ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll puts Trump 1 point ahead of Clinton. Trump has all of the momentum at the moment, but that does not mean that he is going to win. As we have seen already in this race, one day can literally change everything. And as I noted yesterday, more than 23 million Americans have already voted, and most of that voting was done during a period of time when Hillary Clinton was doing very well in the polls. So we shall see what happens. But if Trump does win on November 8th, there is a fact about his birthday which will start to get a lot of attention. Donald Trump was born on June 14th, 1946. If you move ahead 70 years from that date, that brings you to June 14th, 2016. Moving forward another 7 months brings you to January 14th, 2017, and moving forward another 7 days brings you to January 21st, 2017. And if Donald Trump wins the election, January 21st will be his first full day in office. Of course Trump would be inaugurated on January 20th, but he would only be president for part of that day. So that means that Donald Trump would be 70 years, 7 months and 7 days old on his first full day as president of the United States. And this would happen during year 5777 on the Hebrew calendar. These amazing “coincidences” were first pointed out on Facebook by a user named Alyson Kelly. Some may take these numbers as a sign that Donald Trump is supposed to become the next president, but I want to make it exceedingly clear that I do not know what is going to happen, nor am I making any sort of prediction about what is going to happen. I just thought that this information was “interesting” and so I thought that I would share it. Someone that does believe that Trump is going to win is Glenn Beck. He was been virulently anti-Trump throughout this campaign, but now he is convinced that Clinton will be unable to overcome this new email scandal, and he is calling this renewed investigation by the FBI “the greatest gift given to any candidate of all time in the history of America.” Beck also says that if Clinton wins now it will be evidence that “magic exists”, and he is currently projecting that Trump should win the national vote by 5 points … “Let’s just say he was 8 points, that was fair to say, 8 points behind last week,” Beck said, according to a transcript posted on his website . “He should win by 5 points.” Beck later added: “How can the next president face a possible collapsing economy, possible war with Russia, and a current war with ISIS? Oh, and also, be under FBI investigation and indictment? Can’t. Can’t.” The conservative personality called the latest FBI revelation “the greatest gift given to any candidate of all time in the history of America” and added that if Clinton still managed to win, it would be akin to proof “magic exists.” Hopefully Glenn Beck is right, because none of us should want to see Hillary Clinton in the White House. She is the most evil, corrupt and scandal-ridden politician of this generation, and I can’t understand how any American in their right mind could possibly vote for her. And the hits just keep on coming. Wikileaks has just released an email in which John Podesta told Clinton “fixer” Cheryl Mills that they were “going to have to dump all those emails so better to do so sooner than later” … It was not entirely clear what Podesta meant by that phrase, but it could potentially be smoking gun evidence of obstruction of justice. Back in 2008, Barack Obama was new, intriguing and mysterious. We didn’t know a lot about him, and so one can almost understand how the American people could have been fooled by him. But in 2016, Americans know more about Hillary Clinton than they have ever known about any candidate in modern American history. The Clintons have a history of crimes and scandals that goes all the way back to the 1980s, but about half the country is choosing to ignore all of that history and vote for her anyway. I believe that this election is America’s final exam. Originally there were 17 Republicans and 5 Democrats running for the presidency. When you throw in the major third party candidates, that brings us to a total of approximately 25 people that the American public could have chosen from. If the American people willingly choose the most wicked candidate out of all of them after everything that has been revealed, I don’t think that anyone will be able to say that we don’t deserve the bitter consequences that follow that decision. The time for talking is almost over, and shortly we shall find out which path the American people have chosen. If that choice turns out to be Hillary Clinton after everything that we have seen during this election cycle, I truly believe that we will have reached the point of no return as a nation. source:",0
17464,Google Adds Special ’Executive Orders’ Section to News Feeds - Breitbart,"Google News has added a special “executive orders” section to its users’ feeds, focusing on articles about executive orders issued by President Trump. [The section has caused backlash from some users online who claim it to be “inappropriate” and  .   “Why did Google add ‘Executive Orders’ to my news feed? My feed is personalized. I will add what I want to add,” complained one user in a post to Google’s product forums. “It is unacceptable for Google to push crap I did not request into my personal feed. ” “It was added to mine also,” added another. “Suddenly Google cares about executive overreach? Stop forcing your agenda on me. I get plenty enough Trump news already. ” One user called the section “Weird, inappropriate, and even a little creepy,” while another complained: “This is so inappropriate, and google’s response has been pathetic. ” Google News feeds typically feature sections under popular categories such as entertainment, science, and technology, but “Executive Orders” appears to be new, with the URL for the section designated “  ”. In June, Wikileaks founder and editor Julian Assange claimed Google was “directly engaged in Hillary Clinton’s campaign,” while leaked emails showed Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google’s   Alphabet, had been sending campaign plans to Clinton’s team as far back as 2014. “We should understand that Google  …     is intensely aligned with U. S. exceptionalism,” claimed Assange. “Personally at the top aligned with Hillary Clinton’s election campaign and almost certainly once Hillary Clinton becomes president, those people in Google, like Jared Cohen, will be placed into positions around the new Clinton presidency. ” Google has not responded to a request for comment at the time of this publication.

17465,Coordinated Bombs in Kabul Kill Senior Afghan Officials at Defense Ministry - The New York Times,"KABUL, Afghanistan  —   A pair of coordinated Taliban bombings targeted the Afghan Defense Ministry in a crowded neighborhood of Kabul on Monday, officials said, killing at least 24 people and wounding dozens, among them senior security officials. Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said an army general and a police colonel in charge of the area’s security were among the dead. Other officials said the deputy director of President Ashraf Ghani’s elite protection force had also been killed. At least 50 people were wounded, Mr. Sediqqi said. A spokesman for the Health Ministry put that number at 91. Hours later, just before midnight, a third explosion shook much of the city. Witnesses said that a car bomb had exploded outside a guesthouse near Kabul Bank, in the downtown   Naw neighborhood, and that gunmen had then tried to enter the house. Police special forces rushed to the scene, and sporadic gunfire could be heard. The Defense Ministry is near a crowded bazaar along the Kabul River, and the earlier explosions happened just as official hours were ending and government employees were heading home. The presidential palace and several other government agencies are also in the area. Mohammad Radmanish, a Defense Ministry spokesman, said both blasts had been suicide bombings. The first bomber detonated his explosives by a bridge outside the entrance to the ministry around 3:30 p. m. “When people and security forces arrived for help, the second attacker blew himself up among the crowd,” Mr. Radmanish said. Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, said in a statement to the news media that his group was responsible for the explosions. The Taliban’s statement said that the first blast had been caused by placed explosives and that the second one had been a suicide bombing. The bombings were the latest in a   wave of attacks on government or Western targets in the capital, including a complex attack by gunmen with suicide vests on the American University that killed 13 people a week and a half ago. But the explosions on Monday had many in Kabul particularly worried. The loss of senior security personnel suggested that the Taliban had studied the Afghan forces’ response to their assaults. After most attacks in Kabul and the provinces, senior officials  —   sometimes even ministers  —   rush to the scene. The Taliban’s repeated assaults on   targets at the heart of the capital have added to the pressure on the already burdened security forces. The insurgency is not their only worry in the chaotic city: They have been stretched not only by regular crime, but also by street protests as well as by skirmishes between rival political groups. Even as blood from the first two bombings was being washed away on Monday, bodyguards for rival strongmen got into a shootout in a different corner of the city. Before the police reached the scene and cordoned off the area, one person was killed and three were wounded.",0
17467,Trump: I’m Reopening 9/11 Investigation,"Email 
Donald Trump’s plans for his first 100 days in office are raising eyebrows around the world, but of all the items on his agenda it is the reopening of the 9/11 investigation that will provide the greatest earthquake for the establishment. Via Yournewswire 
Trump believes that 9/11 has not been properly investigated and he plans to get to the bottom of it. “First of all, the original 9/11 investigation is a total mess and has to be reopened,” Trump said. SPONSORED LINKS 
The election of Donald Trump has rocked the establishment and things are only going to get rockier for them during his first term. There is a reason George W. Bush didn’t vote for Trump in the election, leaving the presidential line blank and voting Republican down-ballot. Trump has pledged to investigate 9/11 in a way it has not been investigated before. 
For the first time 9/11 will be investigated by someone who isn’t part of the establishment, with skin in the game and plenty to lose. 
“First of all, the original 9/11 investigation is a total mess and has to be reopened” Trump announced to supporters. “How do two planes take out three buildings in the same day? I never got my head around the fact that nothing is mentioned about the destruction of Building 7 in the 585 page document,” he explained, talking about World Trade Center 7 which also collapsed – inexplicably – during the September 11 attacks. 
Donald Trump has also taken cracks at former president George W. Bush. There will be no covering up for former presidents on Trump’s watch. “The World Trade Center came down during the reign of George Bush,” he said in a February debate. “He kept us safe? That is not safe. That is not safe.” 
“Why did the administration at the time not take legal means against Saudi Arabia? Weren’t 19 of the high-jackers from Saudi Arabia? Americans deserve answers and I will definitely request a new investigation so that this horrible tragedy never happens again.” 
Donald Trump and the 9/11 Truth movement 
While Trump might be railing against the establishment in reopening the 9/11 investigation, he has received support on this issue from a number of public personalities who have demanded the case be revisited – and not behind closed doors. 
Former Senator Bob Graham has been demanding a new, transparent investigation “For years I have been campaigning for the release of the 2002 Joint Congressional Intelligence Committee 9/11 Inquiry’s report, to no avail” explains the former Governor of Florida. “These missing pages point to the direct involvement of the government of Saudi Arabia. Why are these being kept secret? Who has to gain from these games of secrecy?” he asks. 
“I have read these documents myself and if the American public knew what was in these documents, there would be a revolution tomorrow in the streets of America” he acknowledged during a radio interview. “Americans deserve to know the truth” he concluded, visibly angered by the whole affair. 
Since 2002, the release of a number of 9/11 Commission Report documents is hindered because they are congressional records, hence they are exempt from the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). 
The long withheld 28 pages were partially released to the public this year – heavily redacted – and the Saudi government claimed the release proved they were not responsible for supporting or financing the attacks. But it’s not as simple as that. There are direct ties to the Saudi hierarchy in the 28 pages. There are a lot of questions that need answering, and they were never going to be addressed under a Clinton presidency with all her ties to Saudi Arabia. 
But with President Trump’s executive powers, everything has changed. The establishment are on edge. More than half the country doesn’t believe the official version of what happened that day. There is now a renewed belief that this biggest of lies and cover ups is about to be dismantled. The establishment did all it could to destroy Trump the outsider’s election chances at election. Now they are on edge.",0
17468,Trump Whistles His Dogs,"By Gilad Atzmon on November 2, 2016 Jews see in Trump’s popularity a symptom of a fatigue of their own power By Gilad Atzmon 
In her recent Washington Post Article , Jewish academic Cheryl Greenberg makes one valid observation. Trump’s criticism of the Jews is far more subtle than his disapproval of other groups and identities (Mexicans, Muslims, Women etc). Though Trump is not known for pulling his punches, when it comes to the Jews, Trump chooses his words very carefully. Trump, according to Greenberg, is so careful “that it’s not clear that Trump himself fully understands the implications of what he’s saying.” I guess that the Jewish academic couldn’t restrain herself from looking down at the Goy candidate. 
Greenberg sees Trump as a puppet-master who controls his audience by means of ‘dog whistling’. “Trump’s references to money, bankers and international conspiracies appear to be deliberate anti-Semitic dog whistles, and his alt-right supporters recognize (and celebrate) that.” 
Greenberg elaborates on her observation, “first of all, dog whistles serve when overt expressions are not an option; they communicate to those who are familiar with the conspiracy theories but maintain plausible deniability.” According to Greenberg, when Trump wants to communicate a message about the Jews, he uses an indecipherable code intelligible only to half of the Americans… Greenberg and the ADL. 
If Greenberg is correct, if Trump says ‘international Bankers’ but really means Jews, then both the Republican candidate and half of the American people are fearful of the Jews. They must very well understand what a confrontation with Jewish institutions may entail. They know that, in America, criticism of Mexicans, Women, and Muslims is a kosher territory but even a subtle criticism of Jews may cost them dearly. One may wonder, how did this happen? What is the substance of that magical power that empowers half of Americans to speak in codes when they think about Jews? 
Greenberg seems to raise the right question just to come up with the wrong answer. “Why would anti-Semitism not be an overt option, while racism, sexism, and xenophobia are?” 
“Americans are less willing to accept blatant anti-Semitism than racism,” Greenberg’s answers. 
What Greenberg really wants to say is that Americans can be racists and can say whatever they like about whoever they want. But when it comes to Jews, they refrain. Americans do know very well the geography of the boundaries of correctness. Jewish power is for them a taboo, at least momentarily. America and Americans are fully aware of the enormous power that is bestowed in the hands of just a few Jewish oligarchs within the ubiquitous industries of media, finance, politics, and culture. 
America would have loved to dissolve the situation peacefully but it can’t. Jewish power can’t be contained or suppressed because we are not even allowed to allude to it, let alone point it out. 
Jewish power is defined as the power to silence criticism of Jewish power. Jewish power, as such, is a ticking timebomb. It is a unique form of self-destructiveness. The history of the Jews proves this point. Time after time it is Jewish power that sets the path towards a glamorous Jewish golden age that leads to the most severe tragic consequences. 
The Jewish phobia of anti semitism is not driven by fear of the gentile. It is actually the other way around. The Jewish fear of antisemitism is the result of Jews being fearful of their own might. Jews tend to recognise that there is something in themselves that evokes animosity from others. This is the true meaning of the Jewish “Pre Traumatic Stress Syndrome”. It is the acceptance that from here forward, things can only get worse. Many Jews see in Trump’s popularity a symptom of a fatigue of their own power. They interpret the nostalgic yearning for ‘America being great’ as a pining for a Christian past. Something that predates Goldman Sachs’ and Soros’ dominion. The Jewish aggression towards Trump can be realised as an expression of Jewish guilt. Yet, Trump himself has very little to do with it. He married his daughter to a Jew. He trades with Jews, he loves Israel. He is almost as Jewish as the Clintons. 
Greenberg is optimistic. For her, Trump’s popularity is “the final gasping of white supremacy”. His voters – pretty much half of the American people – are dogs reacting to a man with a whistle. I am not as optimistic as Greenberg. I think that exploring such contempt towards half of the American people in the name of a vague progressive mantra is a very dangerous game. It suggests to me that progressives have reached a state of complete detachment. Related Posts:",0

17470,Biden Doesn't Stand a Chance. Clinton's Secretary of State Will Be Vicky Nuland - Daniel Larison,"Taming the corporate media beast Biden Doesn't Stand a Chance. Clinton's Secretary of State Will Be Vicky Nuland Originally appeared at The American Conservative 
Joe Biden is reportedly being considered for Secretary of State in a Clinton administration: 
Joe Biden is at the top of the internal short list Hillary Clinton’s transition team is preparing for her pick to be secretary of state, a source familiar with the planning tells POLITICO. 
If Biden is on such a list, I doubt he is at the top of it, and my guess is that he wouldn’t be the nominee in any case. There are other likely choices, including Victoria Nuland, that would be a better fit with Clinton and would be even more likely to share her foreign policy priorities. Kelley Vlahos reported earlier this year on Nuland’s record: 
Where will Victoria Nuland be after January? Nuland is one of Hillary Clinton’s protégés at the State Department, and she is also greatly admired by hardline Republicans. This suggests she would be easily approved by Congress as secretary of state or maybe even national-security adviser—which in turn suggests that her foreign-policy views deserve a closer look. 
If Nuland can be considered a Clinton protege, Biden is more of a rival. During the first Obama term, Biden and Clinton were frequently on opposing sides of internal foreign policy debates, and in his 2015 announcement that he wouldn’t run for president Biden offered what I took to be a rebuke of Clinton’s more aggressive foreign policy positioning: 
We have to accept the fact that we can’t solve all of the world’s problems. We can’t solve many of them alone. 
The argument that we just have to do something when bad people do bad things isn’t good enough. It’s not a good enough reason for American intervention and to put our sons and daughters’ lives on the line, put them at risk. 
Probably their most significant disagreement was over intervention in Libya: Clinton was a major supporter, and Biden saw no compelling reason for the U.S. to intervene. Biden has a fairly hawkish record over the last twenty years, but even he couldn’t see why the U.S. should get involved there. As recently as June, he was publicly claiming vindication for opposing an intervention that Clinton touts as “smart power at its best.” I don’t see why she would want Biden as her Secretary of State, and I definitely don’t see why he would want to serve in her administration.",0
17471,Soy should not be consumed in significant quantities unless it has been fermented or otherwise traditionally processed; industrially processed soy should be avoided,"Soy should not be consumed in significant quantities unless it has been fermented or otherwise traditionally processed; industrially processed soy should be avoided 
  David Gutierrez, staff writer Tags: soy , fermentation , phytoestrogens (NaturalNews) The recent history of soy in the Western diet has been a turbulent one, from its status as a non-food item in the early 20th century through its transition to a health food in the last few decades of that century to current concerns over its high content of natural estrogen mimics.What many debates over the nature of soy fail to take into account is that soy-based foods are neither healthy nor unhealthy; it all depends on the processing.The soy bean itself is highly unhealthy for human consumption. In addition to potentially dangerous levels of phytoestrogens, it contains exceptionally high levels of chemicals that bind to the nutrients in the bean, preventing their absorption. Soy derivatives such as soy protein are even worse, as they are isolated from the rest of the nutrients in the bean and have usually been extracted with toxic chemicals.Traditional cultures developed two major ways to bypass this problem: fermentation and curdling. Both are ancient techniques for changing the fundamental nutritional makeup of foods. These processes are what transform soy (the dangerous food) into the healthful products of tofu, tempeh, miso and soy sauce that have played a major role in the diets of many Asian cultures for hundreds of years.

17472,WikiLeaks Emails Show Mayor de Blasio Venting at and Appealing to Clinton Campaign - The New York Times,"The emails came morning and night, apparently unsolicited, often from the mayoral BlackBerry: messages from Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, who styled himself as an emissary from the liberal left, to a presidential campaign trying to elect Hillary Clinton in what felt like a Bernie Sanders world. Mr. de Blasio wanted to vent that Mrs. Clinton “totally blew” a question about mass incarceration at a Democratic primary debate with Mr. Sanders, a senator from Vermont (but praised her answer on gun control as “fantastic”). He wanted Mrs. Clinton to sign on to a forum on income inequality he planned to host for the presidential candidates in Iowa (none agreed to attend). And he wanted Mrs. Clinton’s aides to know that, even if he was playing hard to get on his endorsement of her, he was already planning to tell Mr. Sanders that he would not be supporting him in the race. In  laying bare  John D. Podesta’s inbox, the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has made no secret of his desire to reveal the deliberations of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign for the world to see. But the leak, dumped online in two waves this week, has also found at least one collateral target: Mr. de Blasio, whose cameo appearances in Mr. Podesta’s inbox offer a    look at the mayor’s attempts to make his presence felt in the presidential campaign. Mostly, as the earlier batch of emails made clear, he got a shrug. “Should we care about this?” Mr. Podesta, the chairman of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, wrote to other Clinton aides after Mr. de Blasio sent him an update on an event intended to highlight income inequality issues. But if the first leak showed that Mrs. Clinton’s aides were cool to Mr. de Blasio’s pitches, the second showed that he was determined to offer himself as an adviser  —   less a Clinton skeptic waiting for her to prove her liberal bona fides, as he said publicly at the time, than a Clinton cheerleader pushing the campaign to engage the Democratic Party’s left wing. In September 2015, the mayor typed out a lengthy message on his BlackBerry informing the aides that he planned to meet with Mr. Sanders. “My message to him (saying this in confidence to you) is that I will always want to work with him in the future and will never have a bad word about him, but won’t be supporting him in this campaign,” he wrote. He urged the campaign to participate in the income inequality forum, saying that he would also invite Mr. Sanders, but that he “quietly first want to see what date works for you guys. ” And he outlined what he planned to say in a television interview with the ABC News journalist George Stephanopoulos, promising to cast Mrs. Clinton in a positive light. If asked why he had not yet endorsed her, he said, he would “allude to The Progressive Agenda. ” (He ultimately gave her his blessing the next month.) On Wednesday, Eric Phillips, the mayor’s press secretary, argued on Twitter that Mr. de Blasio’s messages were, as private email leaks go, not all that humiliating  —   and, more to the point, on brand. “What’s a @BilldeBlasio hot mic catch? Him pushing on mass incarceration,” he wrote on Twitter. Mr. Podesta’s inbox was comparatively short on mentions of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who endorsed Mrs. Clinton early and served as a surrogate for her at in the   to the New York primary. The campaign briefly discussed asking the governor and the mayor, who both worked at the Department of Housing and Urban Development during the Clinton administration  —   Mr. Cuomo as the secretary, Mr. de Blasio as one of his aides  —   to defend Mrs. Clinton against potential charges from the Sanders campaign that black and Hispanic people had lost their homes to foreclosure during Bill Clinton’s presidency. But Mr. Cuomo was not left entirely unscathed. His personal contact information landed in one email, unredacted. And in November, when he was to present Mrs. Clinton with an award from the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a national gun control group, her aides agreed that Mrs. Clinton’s speech should treat the SAFE Act, the governor’s signature gun control legislation, with caution. “Don’t see a need to fully embrace the SAFE Act,” an aide wrote. “There are some controversial items in there. ” (They settled on praising Mr. Cuomo’s push to expand background checks for gun buyers.) Even without full context, the emails make clear that Mr. de Blasio could be the target of some gentle mockery in the Clinton orbit. When Mr. Clinton’s chief of staff, Tina Flournoy, sent Mr. Podesta an important labor union’s questionnaire for presidential candidates in March 2015, Mr. Podesta’s mind apparently went straight to Mr. de Blasio, a reliable labor ally. “Bill de Blasio for President! !” Mr. Podesta wrote from his iPad. Ms. Flournoy’s response, “Ha!”",0
17473,"Hero of Novorossiya: Honoring the life of Arsen Pavlov aka ""Motorola""","Thu, 27 Oct 2016 13:01 UTC Arsen Pavlov, or Motorola, was the leader of the Sparta battalion in the war for Donbass. The people of Novorossiya (aka the Donbass) have suffered a terrible loss. Arsen Pavlov, better known to the world as Motorola, was assassinated in a brutal terrorist bombing on October 16, 2016. He was a beloved commander and a hero to the people of the Donbass, to Russia, and to people all over the world who oppose the fascist junta in Ukraine and US imperialism. The murder was no doubt ordered by the empire in revenge for Russia's intervention in Syria which one year later appears to have decisively shifted the war. On every front the SAA are making advances and winning new victories especially in the battle to fully liberate Aleppo from NATO's terrorist death squads. Thankfully after the treacherous bombing at Deir Ezzor Russia was in no mood to give in to the empty threats of full-scale nuclear war the empire claimed it was prepared to launch in order to halt the liberation of eastern Aleppo. Slowly the SAA are making gains on multiple fronts in Eastern Ghouta, in Homs, in Aleppo. Arsen Pavlov was born in the Komi Republic. At 15 he became an orphan and moved in with a grandmother. He joined the Russian Naval Infantry where he gained the callsign Motorola. He joined as a conscript but volunteered to reenlist and served in the 2nd Chechen War where he gained valuable experience, and they say became addicted to war. He was a bit of an adrenaline junky which added to his charisma since he was paradoxically cheerful in the most dangerous situations. He had a great sense of humor which came through even to non-Russian speakers like myself but he was even more beloved in Russia and Ukraine for his hilarious narrations of the war in Ukraine. He was involved in the war in Ukraine from the start. He visited Maidan where he overheard some Ukrainian fascists saying that they would kill ten Russians for every Ukrainian they lost. He decided to join the anti-Maidan movement participating in counter-protests in eastern Ukraine in Kharkov and other cities before heading to Crimea to aid the people in fulfilling their long-held dream of reuniting with Russia. It was in Crimea that he met Igor Strelkov, who was impressed with his military experience and cheerful daring. Thus Motorola was one of the small group of men he brought with him to Slavyansk where a handful of veterans worked with the brave locals managing to keep the Ukrainian Military tied down for months, allowing vital time for Donetsk and Lugansk to solidify their defenses . In Slavyansk Strelkov and Motorola would become legends. Motorola became well known early on because not only was he a brave fighter he was also a master of information war. It was Motorola who filmed many of the early battles of the war and also helped sympathetic journalists cover the war from the front lines. He well understood that the wars of today are fought not just on the battlefields but on the internet, on youtube, on social media. He helped mobilize global support for Novorossia's war to remain independent of fascist Ukraine, inspiring volunteers from around the world. He was also able wage psychological warfare on the Ukrainians using his instincts as a prankster. He managed to convince the Ukrainians that there were 300 Chechen special forces aiding the Novorossians in the area by playing a recording of the Muslim call to prayer every day. The paranoid Ukrainians fell for it and did not dare to invade the area. Motorola would go on to fight in many of the major battles of the war. He was not one of those commanders who lead from behind. Instead Motorola often fought on the front lines with his men. How could he ask his fighters to risk their lives when he would not do the same?, he would explain when questioned. Thus, like the legendary Mozgovoi, Motorola was reported dead many times in the course of the war by the Ukrainian media, always reappearing to make a mockery of such claims. To do justice to his heroic actions in the war in Ukraine would require writing a history of much of the war since he was at so many famous battles - Nikolayevka Semyonuka, Ilovaisk, Debaltsevo, Donetsk. He became the commander of the Spartak Battalion and was instrumental in liberating Donetsk airport from the fascist self-styled ""cyborgs."" He had a beautiful and courageous wife and three children. He was officially declared a Hero of Novorossia and honored in last year's victory parade celebrating both the victory over fascism in ""The Great Patriotic War"", as World War 2 is known in Russia, but also the victories in the 2014-2015 wars of independence that saw the NATO-backed fascist Ukrainian army and its death squad allies thoroughly smashed. Arsen Pavlov with his wife Yelena Kolenkina Tragically after facing danger so many times on the battlefield Motorola was killed by a bomb in the elevator in his apartment building as he was returning to his family. The news was met with grief and rage the world over. In Donetsk huge crowds filled the streets to bury their fallen Hero. Ultimately whoever set the bomb was serving not merely the fascist puppet regime in Kiev but the CIA. Thats how the CIA operate in these dirty wars - they take control of their ""allies"" intelligence service through payoffs and sending in their advisers. Ukraine is little more than a NATO colony at this point . Thus we can be sure that someone in Washington green-lit the assassination. Like the bombing at Deir Ezzor this assassination is meant to bring the war in Ukraine to a suitable boil by the time Hillary takes over in a couple months. 2017 will probably see Ukraine erupt into full-blown war again. Of course the war never truly stopped with the Ukrainian army constantly shelling Novorossian civilians from a distance. There have been constant skirmishes. However, clearly things are escalating and the assassination of Motorola is part of a pattern that included a failed assassination attempt on Motorola this summer, plots to kill the Prime Ministers of Donetsk and Lugansk, Zhakarchenko, and Plotinsky, and the foiled terror plots in Crimea. Events in Ukraine are closely tied in with events in Syria. As I realized back in 2014, the whole Maidan coup in Ukraine was revenge for Russia preventing Obama from attacking Syria in the fall of 2013 after the ""rebels"" launched a chemical weapons attack and blamed the Syrian government. Russia sent its fleet to face down the potential attack, Putin authorizing his commanders to unleash a nuclear war if necessary and supposedly even shooting down two cruise missiles launched by the US navy towards Syria. It was at this moment that cold war 2.0 went into high gear . This despite the face-saving deal in which Syria agreed to give up its chemical weapons despite being innocent of the attack. The neocons launched the Maidan coup in revenge, as has since been confirmed by Robert Parry. Since then whenever the empire met defeat in one of these countries it redoubled its efforts in the other. Motorola's death was revenge for the impending victory in Aleppo. This victory seems to be driving the empire of chaos absolutely mad with rage and in truth the survival of the world may depend on the people mobilizing to stop Hillary from starting a nuclear war with Russia over Syria or Ukraine. One hopes they are bluffing but the crazy rhetoric coming out of Washington these days suggests that the ruling class have completely lost their minds and seem to think nuclear war is just another ""cakewalk"" like the disastrous invasion of Iraq. Thankfully the Russians refused to give in to nuclear blackmail and other than a lacklustre ""pause"" in Aleppo to attempt to allow civilians to flee and the terrorists to escape, things have been looking ever bleaker for the NATO death squads. I'll briefly describe the situation based on a recent analysis by Canthama at Syrian Perspective. The SAA have been making slow but steady progress across the country. In Northern Hama they are reversing the gains made by the terrorist counteroffensive launched there in a failed attempt to distract the SAA from the battle of Aleppo. The terrorists have suffered heavy losses while being pushed back. In Western Ghouta recent SAA gains in Khan al Shaykh threaten to cut the terrorists off from a nearby town. In East Ghouta the terrorists are suffering heavy losses in their doomed attempt to defend Al Rayham vital for keeping their supply routes open. In Southwestern Aleppo the liberation of the air defense battalion by the SAA and their advance into the Tal Balazul and Tal Mahaba hills threaten to cut off the supply routes to the 1070 Apartments. In eastern Aleppo a 3-pronged offensive continues to liberate the area bit by bit. In other words for the moment the war is going well. We will have to see what schemes the empire concocts in order to try to reverse these steady gains. One major danger is the ever-expanding Turkish invasion in northern Syria and unfortunately Russia and Syria will probably come to regret not moving to stop the Turks from the start. This Turkish-controlled area could well be used in the long-running scheme to establish a no-fly zone in the north of Syria. Rumor also has it that the terrorists in Aleppo are hoping to be rescued by a Turkish offensive. In addition the US is using its Mosul campaign to herd ISIS into eastern Syria where they hope to use them to attack Deir Ezzor, and Palmyra and eventually attempt to turn eastern Syria into a Wahhabi terrorist state. The war in Syria will continue. We can only hope that one day the country will be fully liberated and at peace but unfortunately with Hillary heading for the White House the war will probably continue to intensify. As for Motorola we mourn with the people of Donbass over their fallen hero. Zakharchenko has sworn to take his revenge on Ukraine's SBU and even promised to take back Slavyansk one day in Motorola's honor. Donetsk has lost a brave and charismatic commander but his death will serve as a warning to prepare for renewed war. Like Mozgovoi before him we will never forget Arsen Pavlov: Motorola. Sources A special thanks to @NovaShpakova for advice and inspiration I recently read Queen of Chaos: The Misadventures of Hillary Clinton by Diana Johnstone. The book is a must read. It catalogs Clinton's disastrous foreign policy record and her dangerous advisers. It also provides a brilliant analysis of the past 25 years of Imperial history. With the war in Ukraine heating up let me recommend Slavyangrad to my newer readers as a great English language site on Ukraine. A great tribute to Motorola from a journalist who knew him Igor Strelkov on Motorola",0
17474,Trump: I’d Get ‘Electric Chair’ for Cheating on Debates Like Hillary,"Posted 10/31/2016 2:03 pm by PatriotRising with 0 comments Republican nominee Donald Trump told an audience of roughly 8,000 cheering fans that if he had cheated in presidential debates the way rival Hillary Clinton had, he would be sent to the “electric chair.” 

Trump was commenting on the revelation by Wikileaks on Monday that CNN commentator Donna Brazile, who is now the chair of the Democratic National Committee, had been caught again passing debate questions from the network to the Clinton campaign during the Democratic primary. 

Brazile had been exposed earlier doing the same — passing a question to the Clinton campaign in advance of a town hall debate against Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). 

At the time, Brazile was not yet DNC chair, but was a regular CNN contributor. 

CNN fired Brazile on Monday, releasing a statement: ““We are completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor.” 

Trump noted that Brazile was not the core issue — “I don’t care” about her, he said. Rather, he argued, Hillary Clinton should have reported Brazile the first time she tried to pass debate questions to her. 
Trump also talked about cheating at the polls, telling supporters that the only way to overcome voter fraud would be to vote by the “millions.” 

He cited 1.8 million dead people on the country’s voter rolls, and 2.75 million who are registered in more than one state. (The statistics appear to be based on a Pew Research Center study.) 

Trump challenged journalists in the room to ask Hillary Clinton why she had not reported Brazile after being provided with the debate questions.

Empty Declarations of Democracy… Vacant Boasts of humanity 
For decades, Israel has held itself out as being the lone “democracy” in the Middle East; a state where the rights of individuals could not and would not be held hostage to the autocratic whims of royalty, but rather a full partner to a free and robust electoral process that guarantees not just meaningful input from the governed but the ability to challenge state policies as the winds of change blow from “the river to the sea.” 
Once again, recent events have proven this to be just so much a perverse myth… empty rhetoric… second only to the brazen unfounded Israeli boast of having the “most humane army in the world,” even as the body count of Palestinian children grows in cemeteries and prisons that have become very much its own unique brand of 21 st century youth hostel. 
Recently, Hagai El-Ad , an Israeli and Jew, who serves as executive director of B’Tselem (The Israel Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories), spoke before the UN Security Council urging it to take immediate action against Israel’s illegal settlements. 
Demagoguery and Inhumanity Exposed 
Not quite 1400 words in its entirety, one paragraph in particular of El-Ad’s testimony sums up life for millions of those captured by a democracy that sees day as night… pain as pleasure. Crushing, despite its brevity, the power and pain of these words could easily be part of an opening statement by a war crimes prosecutor at a tribunal called to hold Israel accountable for crimes unseen since the Nuremburg tribunals some 70 years ago. 
“What does it mean, in practical terms, to spend 49 years, a lifetime, under military rule? When violence breaks out, or when particular incidents attract global attention, you get a glimpse into certain aspects of life under occupation. But what about the rest of the time? What about the many “ordinary” days of a 17,898-day-long occupation, which is still going strong? Living under military rule mostly means invisible, bureaucratic, daily, violence. It means living under an endless permit regime, which controls Palestinian life from cradle to grave: Israel controls the population registry; Israel controls work permits; Israel controls who can travel abroad – and who cannot; Israel controls who can visit from abroad – and who cannot; in some villages, Israel maintains lists of who can visit the village, or who is allowed to farm which fields. Permits can sometimes be denied; permits must always be renewed. Thus with every breath they take, Palestinians breathe in occupation. Make a wrong move, and you can lose your freedom of movement, your livelihood, or even the opportunity to marry and build a family with your beloved.” 
In a free democratic society these comments, while perhaps controversial, would certainly not constitute sedition. In an open, healthy State these words would surely give reason to pause and reflect… but never serve as a rational trip-wire to strip their speaker of his birthright as an unbound citizen empowered to support his government for policies he finds just but condemn it for those that bear the star of tyranny. It is a distinction that Israel has failed to adopt or learn over the course of its 50 year subjugation of millions whose only crime is to be born Palestinian in occupied land with sign-posts everywhere that simply say “ Jews only.” 
Beating of Chests 
Not long after El-Ad’s powerful speech before a world body entrusted with securing fundamental rights and liberty for all of its citizenry, the hue and cry could be heard among Israeli political elite to silence such subversive talk. Thus, Coalition Chairman MK David Bitan of the Likud Party undertook the first steps of reprisal by announcing he was considering submitting a bill to the Knesset that could remove the citizenship of Israelis who act against their country in international organizations. According to Bitan, “El-Ad’s actions at the Security Council are a blatant violation of the trust citizens must have for their country, so he should go find another country where he could be a citizen.” 
Alarming, one might ask; no, not at all… merely another in an endless daily stream of steps by a government second to none when it comes to autocratic, indeed dictatorial, control of every fiber of its citizens freedoms, particularly their ability to access and exchange information without fear of retribution. 
Much is known and largely ignored about the thousands of Palestinian civilians that have been targeted and slaughtered by the Israeli military machine in occupied Palestine, whether in Gaza or the West Bank. Indeed, the killing fields of Gaza or execution alleys of back street Jerusalem no longer acquire more than a passing fancy or footnote in the evening news spread across a world now busy with outrages of more recent vintage. After 70 years of slaughter, it’s just so much business as usual. 
So, too, we have seemingly become numbed to the reality that thousands of Palestinian political prisoners languish in isolation, many sitting year after year, some for decades, in administrative detention cells of political prisons… uncharged, undefended and untried, tortured in ways that leave the spirits of those still roaming the now empty cellblocks of South Africa’s notorious Robben Island relieved their misery was ended quickly through state sanctioned executions by “suicide.” 
The Mighty Censor’s Sword 
Closures of Palestinian news rooms and television stations are commonplace… yet no more remarkable than assaults by Israel upon Palestinian journalists that long ago moved into triple digits and show no sign of abating. The Palestinian Centre for Development and Media Freedoms ( MADA ) has documented a pattern of such attacks by Israel running, for some time now, at almost 400 per year. Although the exact number of Palestinian journalists killed or injured by Israel over just the last decade may never be known, it has been documented that seventeen lost their lives in Gaza, alone, during the months of bombings which it endured in 2014. 
Dozens of Palestinian journalists and private bloggers have been arrested by Israel and held for violating vague administrative codes that typically come down to the application of entirely undefined prohibitions such as “incitement.” Dareen Tatour , a 35-year-old poet and Arab-Palestinian citizen of Israel, was arrested and placed under administrative detention on charges of inciting violence via her poetry which she posted on Facebook and which merely praises those who fight against Israeli domination. Also arrested and charged with criminal incitement was 19-year-old Anas Khateeb , on the basis of her Facebook posts which included such alarming statements as “Jerusalem is Arab,” and “Long live the Intifada.” 
Recently, Palestinian journalist, Samah Dweik , was released from prison having served almost six months for an alleged incitement charge which resulted from comments about the occupation she posted on her private Facebook account. For most of her sentence, her family was banned from visiting or having any contact with her. She was but one of over 20 Palestinian journalists recently imprisoned by Israel for allegations of incitement, along with hundreds of other Palestinian activists or bloggers who have been targeted for arrest and prosecution for nothing more than postings of political opinions about the Israeli occupation and Palestinian resistance on social media. Dweik’s release came not long after Israel and Facebook entered into an agreement to “work together” to monitor Palestinian posts. 
The Sword Cuts Deeper 
Increasingly, Palestinians are not the sole victims of an Israeli policy to silence “dissent” or to dramatically curb the nature and extent of information made available to its citizens… Jews and Arabs alike. For example, not long ago, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman confronted the military station director after Army Radio broadcast a documentary on the life of the leading Palestinian national poet, Mahmoud Darwish , saying that material like Darwish’s shouldn’t darken Israeli airwaves. 
In what can only be described as a systematic effort to control both journalists and citizens in their ability to read and write, to access and exchange information, and to reach informed opinions essential to a public and democratic dialogue about current and future Israeli policies, its machinery of censorship has become the linchpin of the State’s view of what is appropriate knowledge and speech and what is not. 
Thus, of late, Israel has begun to demand of social media giants such as Facebook and Twitter that they have input, if not control, over what posts ultimately find their way into the stream of ideas and debate within the Israeli public at large. According to Quds Press, Facebook and Twitter recently deleted thousands of posts, pages and accounts as a result of demands made by the Israeli Ministry of Justice based upon little more than amorphous claims that the information posed a threat to the safety of Israel. 
On an even more ominous note, the Knesset has begun to formulate legislation that would require foreign entities to actively monitor social media sites for information deemed to be offensive to Israel. Under the legislation, content based liability could be found for material published by foreign nationals, addressed to foreign nationals and posted on foreign websites thereby reducing the concept of free speech in Israel to one that is cast by the prevailing political winds of the day and little else. 
Recently the chief Israeli censor notified dozens of Israeli bloggers and social media activists that any material they might wish to publish in their personal blogs or social media accounts, when dealing with a wide range of what was described as “security” related subject matters, must be vetted. Although provided a generic and ambiguous catalog of those areas to be submitted for clearance, the targets, themselves, were not permitted to disclose the makeup of the list under penalty of law. If history can be counted upon to be the guidepost of what subject matters must be prescreened before publication, in the past the list has included such security “sensitive” subject matters as: 
+ Cooperation agreements with foreign militaries; 
+ Letters to the editor on military or security matters; 
+ Contacts with foreign countries; 
+ Anything connected to the nuclear industry; 
+ Information about official delegations abroad; 
+ Any material which constitutes a “danger” to people’s lives; 
+ Immigration policies from “endangered” nations; 
+ Use of foreign sources or material that touch upon any of these areas; 
+ Detention of those suspected of security offenses; 
+ Any information about military industries; 
+ Appointments, resignations, firings, rumors about IDF activities or commanders 
Finally, in a readily transparent effort to maintain a democratic illusion of a free and uncensored flow of information in the market place of ideas, pursuant to the censorship regulations there are complete prohibitions against leaving any blank spaces or other potential indicators in one’s writing or posts that might suggest or lead one to conclude that material has been deleted. 
For those disturbed over this censorship procedure, it must be remembered that we are, after all, talking about a state that recently placed 101st out of 179 countries in the press Freedom index worldwide. Indeed, this appalling placement for the Middle East’s sole democracy is significantly better than Israel has scored in the Freedom index for quite a number of years. 
For those wondering just how widespread, indeed systemic, Israel’s censorship procedures are, it is a country with a military censor procedure that has banned, outright, publication of, soon to be, some 2000 articles and redacted various information from 15,000 others in recent history. That is thousands of articles professional journalists and editors decided were of public interest but which never saw the light of day. Imagine how many more events of public interest went uninvestigated, or articles which were not written, issues debated, or challenges brought to bear for the Israeli body politic to consider because of self-censorship by journalists or editors too tired or principled to seek pre – approval of their body of work by government censors. Stories simply swallowed up and disappeared by an industry of censorship. 
Human Rights… Israel Wrongs 
Although not yet law, in what can only be described as an all-out onslaught against core democratic rights and values, over the last several days consideration of a bill has begun in the Knesset that would empower the Defense Minister to detain a citizen without trial; to deny one the right to pursue or obtain employment in a field of interest; to limit access to various public places; and “to impose any other order or restriction necessitated by considerations of national security or public safety”. 
Earlier in January 2011, the Knesset endorsed a right-wing proposal to investigate some of Israel’s best-known human rights organizations for “delegitimizing” its military. Among others was B’Tselem. The proposed investigations would entail inquiries into the funding of several human rights groups that have a history of criticizing Israeli policies. At the time, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel described the proposal as a “severe blow” to Israeli democracy and critics labeled the policy as “ McCarthyist “. 
Recently a variation on that bill became law in Israel compelling non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that receive more than half of their funding from foreign state entities to declare so publicly. Ultimately, the legislative criteria were tailored specifically to silence criticism of government policies by some 27 NGO’s… 25 of which, including B’Tselem, are considered to be left-wing… while the other two are non-affiliated. As intended, the bill will have absolutely no impact upon right-wing and pro-settlement NGOs which are funded almost entirely by private donations from powerful Zionists and Zionist entities from outside of Israel. 
One can only imagine that upon returning home to the firestorm awaiting him, following his speech before the UN, Hagai El-Ad surely felt what it must have been like to be an activist leftist Jew in the United States during the dark days of McCarthy. 
On the other hand, perhaps El-Ad should consider himself very fortunate indeed. On his twitter account, Arab-Palestinian MK Ahmad Tibi mocked MK David Bitan’s call for El-Ad’s de-citizenship saying: “Why stop at removing citizenship? Why not destroy the home of the B’Tselem director-general? Why not bar his entire family from entering the country, remove his land, submit them to administrative detention, and put checkpoints and closures in his neighborhood?”",0
17476,Blacks and Liberals Want to Abolish Science,"Posted on October 26, 2016 Blacks and Liberals Want to Abolish Science Dan Roodt, American Renaissance, October 26, 2016 The South African “fallist” movement finds another target. 
On my recent visit to Stockholm for the Identitarian Conference, some Swedes and I compared notes on whose country was the most crazy-liberal and anti-white. The Swedes pointed to a short video recently released by an NGO that said Swedes should “integrate” into the culture of third-world immigrants to form a “new country.” 
My Swedish colleagues agreed with French author Renaud Camus. Writing on Free West Media , he argues that, whereas white populations everywhere seem determined to be replaced by third-worlders, “the case of Sweden is even more tragic, more extreme, more insane. Nowhere else do a people and a nation show a stronger will to suicide.” 
But I believe South Africa is worse. We have actual laws, regulations and policies that require corporations, universities and sports bodies to replace whites. Our country has become the world champion of anti-white, anti-Western ideology. Together with our northern neighbor Zimbabwe, we are to multiculturalism what Pol Pot’s short-lived Democratic Kampuchea was to communism: its most extreme expression. Pol Pot waged genocide against the entire middle class of Cambodia in order to start a “new society.” 
South Africa’s ruling elite also wants a “new society” that will be cleansed of Western influences and even the white race. As Robert Mugabe put it during his famous 2015 visit to Soweto: “I don’t want to see a white face.” 
The current upheavals at our universities–known absurdly as the “fallist movement”–have been widely reported. Enraged black students, egged on by “understanding” whites, have demanded that one thing after another must “fall,” each accompanied by its own hashtag. First it was #RhodesMustFall (the statue of Cecil Rhodes at the University of Cape Town), then #AfrikaansMustFall (blacks want to eliminate Afrikaans as a language of university instruction), followed by #FeesMustFall (they want tuition fees abolished) and now, #ScienceMustFall. 
In a video that has had nearly a million views, a female black student at the University of Cape Town called for science to be scrapped, saying: 
If I personally were committed to decolonization, science as a whole is a product of Western modernity and the whole thing should be scratched off. So if you want practical solutions to how to decolonize science, we have to restart science from–I don’t know–from an African perspective, from our perspective, from how we’ve experienced science. For instance, I have a question for all the science people: There is a place in KZN called Umhlab’uyalingana. They believe that through the magic, the black magic–you call it black magic, they call it witchcraft–you are able to send lightening to strike someone. Can you explain that scientifically because it’s something that happens? 
The initial reaction was widespread ridicule from ordinary whites, but I knew that her dismissal of Western science was not taking place in a vacuum and was connected with the cultural-Marxist ideas swirling through most Western universities. After all, Herbert Marcuse, one of the founders of cultural Marxism wrote this in “An Essay on Liberation” in 1969, at the height of US student radicalism: 
This is the Hippie subculture: ‘trip,’‘grass,’‘pot,’‘acid,’ and so on. But a far more subversive universe of discourse announces itself in the language of black militants. Here is a systematic linguistic rebellion, which smashes the ideological context in which the words are employed and defined, and places them into the opposite context–negation of the established one. Thus, the blacks ‘take over’ some of the most sublime and sublimated concepts of Western civilization, desublimate and redefine them. (p. 35) 
Needless to say, Marcuse approved of the black “take over,” and if he were alive today, he would surely applaud what is happening in South Africa. Not only are blacks taking over Western concepts and changing them into their opposites, they are taking over our institutions as well. 
In universities and the mainstream media there was actually praising this young “fallist.” I was only slightly surprised to read a piece in Afrikaans entitled, “ #ScienceMustFall nie so belaglik soos dit mag klink ” (#ScienceMustFall not so ridiculous as it sounds). It was written by Liezel de Lange, the managing director of our Sunday newspaper Rapport , which once supported apartheid and segregation. 
Miss De Lange first confessed ignorance because she attended the University of Pretoria in the days when it still taught Western ideas and culture. She laments that when she studied English literature “almost all our prescribed works were from Britain (and Ireland), as well as the USA. I have to give my lecturers at the time credit for assigning readings from Wole Soyinka, Chinua Achebe and Ngugi wa Thiong’o.” Most Westerners no doubt have deficient educations because they have not been taught Ngugi wa Thiong’o. 
Although Liezel de Lange did not exactly endorse the science-must-fall idea, in defense of the young fallist she evoked the mythical “medieval African university” of Timbuktu as evidence that Africa’s vast contributions to world learning are being ignored. In fact, Timbuktu was a center for Islamic and Tuareg schools, not a hub of forgotten African or black science. Nor are Africans themselves united in wanting to preserve what is left of the “medieval African university.” Recent Al Qaeda activity in the region has been so destructive that the New Yorker recently ran a story called “ Has the Great Library of Timbuktu Been Lost? ” 
I asked Liezel de Lange on Twitter whether she was an Afrocentrist, but she evaded the question, answering that she merely “posits that not all knowledge, wisdom and insight come from the West.” It’s hard to disagree with that. 
Miss De Lange’s column was just a watered-down version of a more radical piece she had read on the left-wing website The Daily Maverick by Joel Modiri, called “ In the Fall: Decolonisation and the rejuvenation of the academic project in South Africa .” 
Mr. Modiri is a black academic at UNISA (University of South Africa), which has been racially “transformed”–meaning that whites have been all but banished. It is Africa’s largest correspondence university, naturally founded by South African whites. Mr. Modiri explained that “her [the fallists] error proves her point.” He decried: 
the presentation of knowledge by South African universities as predominantly the product of the West, and the failure to recognize that some of the major scientific disciplines (medicine, physics, astronomy, mathematics, among others) have deep heritages in Africa, China and India . . . . 
In other words, she is a victim of the false, Eurocentric view that science is Western to begin with. Some American blacks have long maintained that the West stole its knowledge from Africa. They never explain how science could be “stolen” from one people by another, leaving no trace behind. Knowledge is not like the Mona Lisa, which cannot exist in more than one place, so it is strange that the wise Africans who conceived of science and culture no longer possessed it once it was “stolen” from them. 
But we have to remember Samuel Huntington’s dictum in his book The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order : “culture follows power.” If anything, this is what the rest of the world might learn from South Africa: Whoever dominates politically will impose his culture and beliefs, even if they are more primitive than those it replaces. Once the scientist has been politically and culturally subjugated he may have to bow down to the witchdoctor. 
Unfortunately, it is not only pseudo-intellectual blacks such as Mr. Modiri who hate the West. One of the most Europhobic statements in support of the black UCT student came from Stuart Theobald, a white-liberal English South African academic who “divides his time between London and Johannesburg.” 
In the same Rapport that Liezel de Lange edits, Mr. Theobald writes of the need to “decolonize” science because “it has been used to justify racism” and to support “biological racism.” He continues: 
We are kidding ourselves if we pretend that colonial attitudes are not still affecting the way science works today. This is why a deliberate effort to decolonise science is valuable and South African universities have the opportunity to lead the charge. 
He adds that we need a new paradigm in science “that recognises the racism embedded in much of scientific practice and methodology,” and that “a postcolonial science” that is “shorn of the straitjacket of past thinking” will solve problems that now baffle us. He notes the “fuss” made over the fallist student’s comments and then asks: “But when you see the entanglement of racism and science, can you blame her?” 
Are South African blacks and white liberals ready to ditch science in favor of the “dark arts” as Harry Potter would say? If they have tooth aches or appendicitis, I suspect they will submit to the humiliation of “colonial science” rather than look for a cure in the traditional rituals and voodoo of Africa.",0
17477,Disgraced Former Gawker Publisher: ’Zen Buddhism’ Needed to Beat Breitbart - Breitbart,"Former Gawker CEO Nick Denton claimed that the   establishment will have to adopt a nicer “Zen Buddhism response” to beat Breitbart News during a SXSW interview last week. [“In some degree there’s a difference between Gawker and Breitbart,” claimed Denton during an interview with Digiday. “Gawker is sensational, shameless news that is grounded in truth, a dramatic version of the truth, but it is the truth. While Breitbart and fake news on Facebook are further escalation: They are not just sensationalization of the truth, but also go beyond the truth. ”  Denton went on to add that the left needs to adopt a nicer approach to beat Breitbart News and the rise of conservatism, before falsely associating Breitbart with Nazism. “I think the answer to Breitbart is not going to be, ‘Let’s do more aggressive fake news on the left,’” Denton explained. “There might be some Zen Buddhism response to Breitbart. It is going to be hard because the sensation is you want to punch the Nazi, but they have the guns. ” Gawker Media became infamous for publishing news that often ruined or negatively impacted people’s lives before it was bankrupted and shut down following a lawsuit from one of its targets. “Facebook makes me despise many of my friends, and Twitter makes me hate the rest of the world,” said Denton during his SXSW panel, before praising Reddit as the model of the future. “Even if we’re full of despair over what the Internet has become, it’s good to remind yourself when you’re falling down some Wikipedia hole or having a great conversation with somebody online —  it’s an amazing thing,“ he concluded. ”In the habits that we enjoy, there are the seeds for the future. That’s where the good Internet will rise up again. ” Last year, Denton and Gawker were forced to pay out $140 million to Hulk Hogan following a lengthy lawsuit over the gossip outlet’s unauthorized posting of Hogan’s private sex tape. The lawsuit was backed by PayPal   and billionaire Peter Thiel, who himself had been affected in the past by the outlet after being outed as gay, and forced Denton to file for bankruptcy. At SXSW on Sunday, Denton claimed that Thiel had become a “national figure” and “extremely prominent” in American politics and culture. “Peter Thiel, through his financial support of litigation and his support for political disruption through Donald Trump, has become a national figure,” Denton proclaimed. “He has become extremely prominent and an avatar, an embodiment, of the merger of the reactionary elite with a kind of populist celebrity in Donald Trump. ” Thiel is not the first homosexual that Gawker outed, while the gossip media empire also mocked the death of Vice President Mike Pence’s dog, accused actor James Franco of being a rapist, encouraged readers to pirate Quentin Tarantino’s film The Hateful Eight, published several celebrities’ nude photos, and refused to remove an uploaded video of the potential rape of a girl in a bathroom. When former Gawker editor A. J. Daulerio was asked in court what the limits would be in deciding not to publish a sex tape, he replied that the video would have to feature someone aged four or under. Following the controversy, Gawker Media was bought by Univision, who made it their first act to shut down the media company’s flagship site, Gawker, and rebrand themselves as Gizmodo Media. Since filing for bankruptcy, Denton was denied the ability to lease his $4. 25 million apartment in Manhattan, and he has since moved into a cheaper property. Hogan has since purchased a $1. 6 million beach house. Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech. You can follow him on Twitter @MrNashington or like his page at Facebook.",0

17479,"In the Ring He Was Ali, but in the Newspapers He Was Still Clay - The New York Times","Shortly after he defeated Sonny Liston to win the heavyweight title in February 1964, Cassius Clay changed his name to Muhammad Ali. The new name, bestowed by Elijah Muhammad, leader of the Nation of Islam, was important to Ali, who referred to Cassius Clay as his slave name and took umbrage when people used it. But in The New York Times, as in many newspapers and magazines at the time, Cassius Clay won the Liston rematch in 1965, Cassius Clay beat Cleveland Williams in 1966, and Cassius Clay refused to be inducted into the Army in 1967. It wasn’t until the early 1970s that The Times, for one, began to regularly call him Muhammad Ali. Articles appeared in March 1964 about the name change, yet over the next few years The Times mostly referred to Ali as Clay. From 1964 to 1968, Cassius Clay appeared in more than 1, 000 articles, Muhammad Ali in about 150. Sometimes articles would note that he was “also known as Muhammad Ali,” but the bulk of the references were always to Clay. A Times article in 1966 noted that Ali balked at accepting an award because it was inscribed to Cassius Clay, not Muhammad Ali. The article’s headline was “Clay Gets Award as Boxer of Year. ” On page 36 of the Feb. 6, 1967, edition, there were three stories about Ali. A preview of his fight with Ernie Terrell and a Sports of The Times column about the match referred to him as Clay. A news story about his speech at a Houston mosque called him Muhammad Ali in the headline, but Clay in the text. (In general, stories about Ali away from the ring were more likely to use his preferred name.) Robert Lipsyte, a former sports reporter and columnist at The Times, said that editors were “adamant that until Ali changed his name in a court of law, we would call him Cassius Clay. ” Lipsyte and others objected to the policy. “I found it very embarrassing,” he said. “We did not ask what John Wayne and Rock Hudson’s real names were. ” Another former Times reporter, Gerald Eskenazi, remembered “the strange dichotomy of addressing him as ‘Muhammad’ and writing about ‘Clay. ’” The Times was not alone in this policy. The Washington Post regularly referred to Ali as Clay a June 1970 headline in The Post read “Clay Set to Make Boxing Comeback.” In April 1966, Sports Illustrated’s cover read “Cassius Clay, the Man, the Muslim, the Mystery,” though by July 1967 he was referred to as Ali on the cover and inside the magazine. Lipsyte recalled that he once told Ali about the papers calling him Clay, “I feel sorry about this, but this is out of my control. ” Ali responded, “Don’t worry, you’re just a little brother of the white power structure. ” There was not a consistent Times policy against using Muslim names. Malcolm X, for example, was referred to by that name even in the early 1960s, and in the report of his death in 1965, though sometimes his birth name, Malcolm Little, was mentioned in passing. In Ali’s case, change finally came in late 1970, around the time of his return to the ring after a suspension for refusing to serve in the military. On Aug. 19, a headline read “Clay Wins Round in Court Battle,” but on Aug. 24 Lipsyte wrote a column referring to him as Ali throughout. From then on, Times articles began referring to him primarily as Ali, although they usually added “also known Cassius Clay. ” “I don’t remember a real fiat from on high,” Lipsyte said. “I think it was slippage. The older desk guys go and the younger desk guys come in   …     ” Times do change at The Times.’ ”“It’s much more the norm now not to impose a name on someone,” said Philip B. Corbett, the associate editor for standards. “Our basic approach now in general is to use the name people use for themselves. ”” ’He noted that Times coverage of the presidential race referred to Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush, not Bernard, Rafael Edward and John Ellis. The Times was also quick to begin referring to Caitlyn Jenner and Chelsea Manning by their new names and genders. There are limits, though, even today. Performers who have styled their names with unusual symbols like Ke$ha and ? uestlove appear in more conventional spellings in The Times. “We are reluctant to use unorthodox typography,” Corbett said. “It can look like a mistake. ” When Prince declared that his name was an unpronounceable glyph, The Times went with “the artist formerly known as Prince,” and often just Prince. “You want to be respectful to the people you are writing about by using their names,” Corbett said. “On the other hand, you don’t want to baffle your readers. ”",0
17480,"With Help From an Error, the Blue Jays Sweep the Rangers and Advance - The New York Times","TORONTO  —   It was not an obvious moment of infamy  —   no ground ball through the legs, no fastball down the middle just begging to be a hit. But the record will show that the play that sent the Toronto Blue Jays to the American League Championship Series on Sunday was scored as an error against the most notorious member of the Texas Rangers. Second baseman Rougned Odor, who punched the Blue Jays’ Jose Bautista in the jaw in May, made a wild throw while trying to turn a double play in the bottom of the 10th inning at Rogers Centre in Game 3 of this division series. Josh Donaldson, who had led off with a double, slid headfirst into home to complete a   victory and a     sweep. Odor’s error was the first in baseball history to end a postseason series. “I threw it a little bit to the side,” he said. “I pulled the ball a little bit. I tried to do my best, and that’s it. I had a chance at first. If it was a good throw, we can make the double play. ” Toronto returns to the A. L. C. S. after having lost in six games to the Kansas City Royals last fall. The series starts Friday in Boston or Cleveland the Indians can eliminate the Red Sox at Fenway Park on Monday to finish a sweep of that series. The Blue Jays emphatically stomped the Rangers, who had the A. L.’s best record but fell to Toronto in the division series for the second year in a row. The Rangers hit . 204 and posted a 6. 18 earned run average. “We got cold at the worst moment,” said Adrian Beltre, the veteran Texas third baseman. “We’re facing a team that got hot, and we couldn’t find a way to beat them. ” Bautista  —   whose bat flip in last year’s division series angered the Rangers  —   had a chance to win the series against Matt Bush, the reliever who plunked him in May before Bautista’s hard slide led to Odor’s punch. But after Donaldson’s double and an intentional walk to Edwin Encarnacion, Bush struck out Bautista to bring up Russell Martin. Martin saw eight pitches, all fastballs from 97 to 99 miles per hour. After two   fouls, he lashed a grounder to the shortstop hole, where Elvis Andrus backhanded it and flipped it to Odor, who was covering second base. Encarnacion slid into second, but Odor said that did not affect him. Still, he fired a   throw into the dirt that pulled Mitch Moreland off first base. The ball skipped off the glove of Moreland, who scrambled to pick it up and fling it home, but too late. “If it gets past me, we have no shot,” Moreland said. “I knew I had to knock it down and try to keep it close. It just got a little too far from me. ” Moreland said that if the ball had stayed in his glove, or fallen right at his feet, he doubted that Donaldson would have even tried for home. But when the ball got away, the   Moreland had to set his feet as he gathered it, emboldening Donaldson to make his dash. “What’s kind of crazy is, I played against Mitch Moreland for a long time and played against him in college as well,” said Donaldson, who attended Auburn when Moreland played for Mississippi State. “So it wasn’t one of those situations where I was just wheeling around third to score, because I respect Mitch’s arm. For me, the deciding factor was once I saw the ball get away from him, I felt like I had to take a chance. That situation in the game, if he ends up throwing me out, making a great play, you kind of have to tip your cap to him. But I’m banking on the fact that I’m going to make it more times than not. ” The Rangers’ last hope was a replay review to examine whether Encarnacion’s slide could be considered interference. Although the Blue Jays paused their reveling for a moment, the umpire crew chief, Joe West, soon removed his headset and gently signaled safe. “It was a little bit of a buzzkill,” Martin said, but the Blue Jays were not complaining. Just five days after celebrating a thriller against Baltimore in the   game  —   which was won on an Encarnacion homer in the 11th  —   the Blue Jays partied in their clubhouse again. Toronto did not secure a   berth until the final day of the regular season, struggling at times with inconsistent offense despite a sturdy pitching staff. But the team has won six games in a row to clinch a playoff spot and advance through two rounds. The Blue Jays mauled the Rangers’ star pitchers, Cole Hamels and Yu Darvish, to win the first two games by a combined  . “Even when people around them doubted, the belief was here  —   we’re going to play well and we’re going to be a championship team,” said Mark Shapiro, the Blue Jays’ president and chief executive. “We’ve had isolated moments, but this is probably the best baseball we’ve played all year  —   at the right time. ” There was no misbehavior on Sunday, no beanballs or punches or beer cans flung from the stands. After a fan just missed hitting Orioles outfielder Hyun Soo Kim with a beer can on Tuesday, the Blue Jays announced they would serve beer only in plastic cups for the rest of the postseason. And the teams made good on their promise to leave behind their tense history and play clean. “We kind of put our emotions aside and played good baseball,” Martin said. Some Rangers fans chanted Odor’s name at Bautista when he batted at their park, and most Blue Jays fans vigorously booed Odor whenever he was announced Sunday. But Odor said that did not bother him. “I’ve been playing like this in my country,” said Odor, who has played winter ball in his native Venezuela. “We have really good fans in Venezuela and I play with one of the best teams in Venezuela. It’s always a lot of people, a lot of crowds. I’ve been in that situation before. ” The Rangers have been in this situation before, too, hurting themselves in a   playoff game in Toronto. Last year while leading in the seventh inning of the decisive fifth game, Texas fell apart thanks to two errors by Andrus and another by Moreland. Andrus, 28 and also from Venezuela, said he consoled Odor, who is 22, after the game. Odor said he appreciated the support. “I was the one making errors last year,” Andrus said. “I know how it feels. It’s the worst feeling ever. But we still have a lot of years in our career. Sooner or later, we’re going to be back in the playoffs, and hopefully we can go deeper. ” The Rangers made other mistakes in Game 3: Two misplaced sliders by Colby Lewis turned into homers for Encarnacion and Martin in the first inning, and a passed ball by catcher Jonathan Lucroy brought in the tying run in the sixth. Texas briefly held two leads, and Andrus and Odor homered off Aaron Sanchez, who gave up six runs and walked four over five and   innings. But the Rangers were nearly helpless against the Blue Jays’ bullpen. Moreland greeted Joe Biagini with a double in the sixth, but Biagini and three others retired the final 13 Texas hitters. Roberto Osuna worked the last two innings for Toronto, earning the victory after securing a   save in Game 2. Now Osuna and his teammates get four days to rest before the A. L. C. S. Donaldson has been playing hurt, without disclosing the injury. It is safe to say he felt just fine diving into the next round. “When you have 50, 000 fans screaming,” Donaldson said, “it kind of numbs the pain. ”",0
17481,Drop in Late Obamacare Enrollment Appears to Be a Trump Effect - The New York Times,"In the waning days of this year’s Affordable Care Act   period, the Trump administration declared war on the health law, releasing an executive order that could weaken its requirements and yanking advertisements and outreach off the air. Those actions appear to have made a difference.   for health plans in the states managed by the federal government are down slightly compared with last year. About 9. 2 million Americans picked an Obamacare marketplace plan for this year, according to a government report released Friday. Last year, that number was 9. 6 million. The decline by itself isn’t that meaningful, but several snapshots over previous months had shown that   were on track to overtake last year’s enrollment. It was only in the final two weeks of enrollment, when there’s typically a   surge, that the numbers dropped. Fewer than 400, 000 people signed up for Obamacare plans over the last two weeks. Last year, more than 700, 000 people signed up in the last week alone. The falloff suggests that Trump administration actions may have confused consumers, discouraged them from enrolling or simply made it easier to forget about the deadline. So far, the numbers do not show that the markets are failing, or in the “death spiral” that Mr. Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan have often mentioned. But they show how important signaling is, and how confused the signaling currently is. Mr. Trump’s executive order, signed on the day of his inauguration, was widely reported as eliminating the law’s requirement to buy insurance. (I differ with that view.) And the reductions in outreach may have prevented some people who intended to sign up from getting the reminder that they needed. More broadly, promises from Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress to quickly repeal Obamacare may have caused some people to think the law was no longer in effect at all. My colleagues Abby Goodnough and Robert Pear spoke with   counselors around the country, who said many of their customers assumed that Obamacare would be repealed soon. Premiums were substantially higher this year than last in many places, and it’s possible that those high prices also depressed  . But most Obamacare customers do not pay full price for their plans, so they do not feel the increases. Full national   numbers won’t be released until next month. The 9. 2 million   reported Friday come only from states that use the federal government’s website to select plans.   appear to be up in a few states using their own system. Of course, some people who signed up during the enrollment period may drop out of coverage or simply fail to pay their premiums, meaning the number of people who will be covered in Obamacare plans is likely to be lower than the current numbers. Moreover, people who signed up early for plans because they thought it was required may drop coverage if they come to believe they will face no penalty. That’s why the future health of Obamacare’s markets will depend largely on what the Trump administration and Congress do next. That path is hard to predict. After a week of steps that appeared to undermine the Obamacare markets, the Trump administration appeared to change course. Some of the canceled outreach was restored. And a new regulation, currently under review by the Office of Management and Budget, is expected to help stabilize the health insurance markets  —   though it’s hard to be sure until it is published. Yet on Friday, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services  —   the agency still responsible for administering Obamacare  —   issued a statement that adopted the harshest tones of Mr. Trump. “Obamacare has failed the American people, with one broken promise after another,” said the spokesman, Matt Lloyd. “We look forward to providing relief to those who are being harmed by the status quo. ” A rapid Obamacare repeal is looking increasingly unlikely. Mr. Trump reaffirmed this morning that health care legislation is high on his priority list, but Congress’s efforts have largely stalled. The Trump administration may want to keep things calm in the interim. If so, it will probably take more steps to reassure anxious insurers and customers. Or it may decide that further chaos will help encourage congressional action. If Mr. Trump’s preference is the former, he may learn from this week’s news that his words matter.",0
17482,Florida Republicans Voting for Hillary Clinton · Guardian Liberty Voice,"On November 1, 2016, early voting polls in Florida indicate more than one-quarter of registered Republicans have cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton. Two states that the Democratic presidential nominee must win are North Carolina and Florida, which her campaign describes as checkmate states. She must carry the swing states to ensure the accumulation of electoral votes needed to be elected to the presidency.
The CNN polls in October indicated that Clinton had an 18 point lead over Donald Trump among early voters.
CBS reports the percentages of Florida’s Republicans who cast early votes break down as follows; 11 percent registered since 2012, 83 percent voted in the last presidential election, and six percent did not vote four years ago. Among registered Democrats the numbers were similar.
Early voting, in person or by mail, is underway in 37 states. Experts predict that more than 46 million people will have voted before next Tuesday, November 8.
As of November 2, at 12:56 a.m. EDT, The New York Times daily prediction is that Clinton has an 88 percent chance over Trump’s 12 percent to win. Hers are down 1 percent and his are up 1. from the day before.
However, the paper indicates that the ROP candidate could win, although it is as unlikely as a professional football kicker missing a 35-yard field goal.

17483,"Trump, an Outsider Demanding Loyalty, Struggles to Fill Top Posts - The New York Times","MELBOURNE, Fla.  —   During President Trump’s transition to power, his team reached out to Elliott Abrams for help building a new administration. Mr. Abrams, a seasoned Republican foreign policy official, sent lists of possible candidates for national security jobs. One by one, the answer from the Trump team came back no. The reason was consistent: This one had said disparaging things about Mr. Trump during the campaign that one had signed a letter opposing him. Finally, the White House asked Mr. Abrams himself to meet with the president about becoming deputy secretary of state, only to have the same thing happen  —   vetoed because of past criticism. Mr. Abrams’s experience has become a case study in the challenges Mr. Trump still faces in filling top positions a month into his presidency. Mr. Trump remains fixated on the campaign as he applies a loyalty test to some prospective officials. For their part, many Republicans reacted to what happened to Mr. Abrams with dismay, leaving them increasingly leery about joining an administration that cannot get past the past. As Mr. Trump brings candidates for national security adviser to meet with him in Florida this weekend, he presides over a government where the upper echelons remain sparsely populated. Six of the 15 statutory cabinet secretaries are still awaiting Senate confirmation as Democrats nearly uniformly oppose almost all of the president’s choices. Even some of the cabinet secretaries who are in place may feel they are home alone. It is not just Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson who has no deputy secretary, much less   under secretaries or assistant secretaries. Neither do the heads of the Treasury Department, the Education Department or any of the other cabinet departments. Only three of 15 nominees have been named for deputy secretary positions. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has a deputy only because he kept the one left over from President Barack Obama’s administration. That does not even begin to cover the rest of the more than 4, 000 appointments that a president typically makes. In some cases, the Trump administration is even going in reverse. A senior political appointee at the housing department, who had already started the job, was fired this past week and marched out of the building when someone discovered his previous statements critical of Mr. Trump. The president’s top Latin America official at the National Security Council was likewise fired after just weeks on the job for complaining about internal dysfunction at an    discussion at a Washington research organization, according to officials, who confirmed a Politico report. The State Department has laid off six top career officials in recent days, apparently out of questions about their loyalty to Mr. Trump. “Many tough things were said about him and by him” before last year’s election, Mr. Abrams, who served as President Ronald Reagan’s assistant secretary of state and President George W. Bush’s deputy national security adviser, said in an interview. “I would have hoped he would have turned toward just hiring the most effective people to help him govern rather than looking back to what we said in that race. ” Mr. Trump has fallen behind the pace of his last three predecessors both in naming senior officials who require Senate confirmation and in securing their confirmations, according to data compiled by the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service. Whereas Mr. Obama had nominated 40 senior officials by Feb. 11, 2009, Mr. Trump had named 34 of them as of Friday. Mr. Obama had 24 confirmed at that point, while Mr. Trump has 14. The trouble assembling an administration reflects the deeper rift between Mr. Trump and the Washington establishment of both parties. A   businessman with no government experience, Mr. Trump catapulted to power on a promise to break up the existing system. Even after he won the Republican nomination last year, he did little to win over those who had opposed him, while his “never Trump” critics within the party kept up a steady assault on his qualifications and temperament. Mr. Trump faces other hurdles, too. With no cadre ready to go from past political service, he has been starting from scratch. His team has been slow to vet candidates, and in some cases his choices have had troubles with their business backgrounds or other matters. And Democrats have mounted a wall of resistance to his nominations, slowing the process down. The White House did not respond to requests for comment, but Mr. Trump has disputed reports of troubles. “The White House is running so smoothly, so smoothly,” he told a rally of supporters in Melbourne, Fla. on Saturday. “And believe me, we inherited one big mess, that I can tell you. ” The ill will between Mr. Trump and much of the Republican establishment works both ways. Many Republicans who might have agreed to work for the president have been turned off by what they consider his sometimes erratic behavior and the competing power centers inside his White House. After firing his first national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump found that his initial choice for a replacement, Robert S. Harward, a retired vice admiral, would not take the job. “The problem is that with each successive episode, it raises the stakes for the next one,” said Peter D. Feaver, a Duke University professor who was a strategic planning adviser to Mr. Bush. “It’s going to be hard for the next outsider to accept the national security job and not request the ability to make personnel changes. ” Richard N. Haass, a former Republican official and now president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said Mr. Trump had “ruled out much of an entire generation of Republican public policy types” and alarmed others with his empowerment of Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, to shape national security. Even some cabinet secretaries appear unable to pick their own staff. “This is unprecedented, it’s untraditional, it’s outside the mainstream,” said Mr. Haass, whose own name had been floated for a position. “And so it’s just that you’d be signing on for, at a minimum, tremendous uncertainty, and quite possibly for being associated with a set of policies you deeply disagree with. ” Stuart Holliday, an ambassador under Mr. Bush, said many Republicans would want to work for Mr. Tillerson or Mr. Mattis. “However, the Republican foreign policy bench is not that deep at senior levels,” he said, “especially if you factor in people who took themselves off the field. ” Former Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, said the business veterans that Mr. Trump had enlisted for his cabinet were “the most positive thing about his administration so far. ” But he added that the president’s disregard for advice could complicate his efforts to fill posts. “You get the feeling that he’s still flying by his own experiences,” he said, “and that’s got to concern anyone who cares about these issues. ” For Mr. Trump, the challenge is more pronounced because he and his advisers feel they cannot trust some of the senior career professionals still working at the White House or cabinet departments. Leaks about Mr. Flynn and Mr. Trump’s phone calls with foreign leaders have convinced White House officials that they face an opposition within. “You have a new administration that also has fewer people familiar with the processes and systems of government, including the importance of the vetting process,” said Max Stier, the chief executive of the Center for Presidential Transition at the Partnership for Public Service. “You can’t operate as they did in the campaign context, with a smaller than usual group  —   it doesn’t work. ” Indeed, Mr. Trump’s failure to vet candidates in advance has led to some stumbles. A White House scheduler was fired this past week because of an issue that surfaced in her background check, something that normally would have been completed weeks ago. Another challenge has been Mr. Trump’s implementation of ethics rules that bar White House officials from lobbying for five years after they leave the government, prompting senior congressional officials and lobbyists to demur. Mr. Trump has faulted the Democratic minority in the Senate for obstructing his choices. Democrats have voted almost as a bloc against many of his nominees, breaking with long tradition in which the opposition party largely went along with a president’s selections, except in specific cases of controversy. “The Democrats are making it very difficult,” Mr. Trump said at his news conference on Thursday. “This is pure delay tactics. ” Despite his own experience, one person still urging Republicans to take jobs in the administration is Mr. Abrams. “I have been encouraging everybody to go into the government if offered an appropriate position,” he said. “That was my view, and it’s still my view, because you have one president and one government at a time. ”",0
17484,Trump Won’t Mention That Bush & Cheney Deleted 22 Million Emails,"Comments 
With Donald Trump obsesses over Hillary Clinton’s e-mail “scandal”, one wonders why he never mentions the Bush Administration and the April 12, 2007 revelation that the White House had “lost” 5 million e-mails related to an investigation into the partisan firing of eight U.S. attorneys . Eventually, the true number was found to be over 22 million e-mails. 
Salon reports that: 
The emails had been run through private accounts controlled by the Republican National Committee and were only supposed to be used for dealing with non-administration political campaign work to avoid violating ethics laws. Yet congressional investigators already had evidence private emails had been used for government business, including to discuss the firing of one of the U.S. attorneys. The RNC accounts were used by 22 White House staffers, including then-Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove, who reportedly used his RNC email for 95 percent of his communications. 
According to the Washington Post, “Under federal law, the White House is required to maintain records, including e-mails, involving presidential decision- making and deliberations.” But, of course, these millions of e-mails went missing — many of which were important evidence. 
Most troubling, researchers found a suspicious pattern in the White House email system blackouts, including periods when there were no emails available from the office of Vice President Dick Cheney. 
‘“That the vice president’s office, widely characterized as the most powerful vice president in history, should have no archived emails in its accounts for scores of days—especially days when there was discussion of whether to invade Iraq—beggared the imagination,” says Thomas Blanton, director of the Washington-based National Security Archive. The NSA (not to be confused with the National Security Agency, the federal surveillance organization) is a nonprofit devoted to obtaining and declassifying national security documents and is one of the key players in the effort to recover the supposedly lost Bush White House emails. 
As Rove and others were investigated for the partisan “unmasking” of Valerie Plame, a CIA black market specialist, it came to light that Rove’s server was used for official communications — the exact sort required to be preserved under the Presidential Records Act. 
“I wouldn’t rule out that there were a potential 5 million e-mails lost,” White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said at the time. By 2009, it was revealed that Perino’s numbers were a little off when 22 million missing e-mails were discovered. 
The partisan nature of this Clinton email investigation is obvious. How is it not relevant that an administration notorious for committing war crimes and crimes against humanity was able to delete millions of emails without a word from Congress? For all their so called concern for our national security, the Republican Party has an appalling double standard.",0
17485,Israeli Army Illegally Conducted ‘Field Executions’ On Palestinians,"Posted on October 27, 2016 by Sean Adl-Tabatabai in Middle East , News // 0 Comments 
The Palestinian Foreign Ministry have urged The International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute the Israeli army after they confessed to “field executions” against Palestinians. 
The Ministry made the comments after a leaked Israeli army report admitted it was possible to avoid firing against Palestinian people. 
Xinhuanet.com reports: 
“The leaking of an Israeli army internal memo is meant to distort the work of the ICC and its preliminary investigations with regards to Israeli crimes including field executions in order to claim that the occupation authorities are undergoing due procedures with regards to such crimes,” the ministry said in a statement. 
The ministry said that although the report mentions four cases, it “ignores the fact that all cases of field executions that claimed the lives of dozens of Palestinians did not impose any serious harm or life threat to soldiers.” 
Israeli public radio reported early on Tuesday that an internal report was dispatched to army soldiers saying that it was possible to avoid shooting Palestinians in the West Bank in four separate incident if the army forces acted in a proper way during those incidents. 
The report added that two Palestinians were killed in those incidents and two others were critically injured, pointing out that soldiers opened fire towards them while they should have not, and that if they had acted differently in some cases, they would have avoided shooting them. 
A wave of tensions has been flaring between Israel and the Palestinians in the Palestinian territories since October 2015. 
Official figures say at least 226 Palestinians and 40 Israeli were killed. 
Tension between the two ides mounted and went on on daily basis following the daily assaults on Jerusalem by Israeli settlers and security forces, besides the repeated attempts of radical Jewish groups to get into Al-Aqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem.",0
17486,"Melissa Mark-Viverito, New York Council Speaker, Reveals She Was Sexually Abused - The New York Times","Melissa   the speaker of the New York City Council, revealed this week that she was the victim of sexual abuse as a child, saying at an emotional news conference that she was compelled to go public in reaction to the video in which Donald J. Trump is heard boasting about foisting himself on women. “This is the first time I ever publicly talked about this,” Ms.   said on Thursday, speaking to reporters at City Hall and appearing at times to hold back tears. “Twenty percent of young girls unfortunately experience some form of sex abuse and molestation. ” “And,” she added, pausing as her words caught in her throat, “I fall in that category. “Between the ages of 5 and 8, I was molested by two different individuals at two different points in time, and it’s a reality that you live with every day. ” Ms.   47, a Democrat, said she decided to speak out about her experience after watching the video of Mr. Trump that emerged last Friday, in which he is heard bragging of being able to kiss and grope women and get away with it because he was famous. Mr. Trump, now the Republican nominee for president, was speaking on the tape, recorded in 2005, with Billy Bush, a host of the NBC program “Access Hollywood,” who was heard laughing and egging him on. “When you have an individual who is boasting about violating, and taking from, a woman something without her consent, I just couldn’t anymore,” Ms.   said, adding that her public role gave her a responsibility to speak out. “And to have someone laughing and goading it and enabling it is just, it was very painful for me and it triggered things that I hadn’t felt in a long time. ” Ms.   first revealed her personal trauma on Wednesday evening on Twitter, writing that one in five girls are “victims of child sex abuse. ” She added, “I’m that   5. Trump’s misogyny  sexual violence has reopened wounds I’ve tried to heal. ” She followed it with “#Basta,” which is Spanish for “enough. ” Many people, including other elected officials, responded on Twitter by calling her courageous and offered their support. A few minutes later, Ms.   posted on Twitter again: “#NoMoreSilence I am empowered. And Strong. #FearMe. ” While she did not provide further details at the news conference of the abuse, she spoke in anguished terms of her ordeal and the difficulty of discussing it publicly. “It’s a struggle that you go through and it never ends,” she said. “It’s not something you forget or you move on in life. It’s part of your life. ” She added: “I didn’t start dealing with my abuse until I was in my 20s. I mean that’s what trauma does to you. In some ways you create, there’s spots that are a little sketchy, right, and you try to block it out and it was, it takes time. Some people never are able to process it. ” Laura Palumbo, a spokeswoman for the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, an independent organization partly funded by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said research had found that one in four girls experienced sexual assault before age 18 over all, one in five women experience sexual assault at some point in their lifetime. Ms.   called on Mr. Trump’s supporters to repudiate him and said that by continuing to support him, “in essence you are condoning that type of behavior where you think it’s O. K. to violate a woman. ” At one point, a reporter for Telemundo, the Spanish language network, asked Ms.   who is Puerto Rican, to discuss her experience in Spanish. Appearing close to tears, she replied in Spanish, “I prefer not to. I’m a little emotional right now. ” She later gave a Spanish language interview following the news conference.",0
17487,Iraq Executes Dozens for 2014 Massacre by ISIS - The New York Times,"BAGHDAD  —   Hatam Kareem received the telephone call on Sunday that he had been waiting for, saying the men who killed his brother had been executed by hanging. “It was the happiest call I have ever received,” he said. Thousands of other Iraqis shared his happiness on Sunday over the executions of 36 men convicted and sentenced to death for taking part in the Islamic State’s massacre of roughly 1, 700 Shiite military personnel in 2014. The massacre, at the Camp Speicher air base near Tikrit, Saddam Hussein’s hometown, is the deadliest atrocity to date carried out by the Sunni militants of the Islamic State, either in Iraq or in Syria. The crime galvanized Iraq’s historically oppressed Shiites, who have been in power since the 2003 American invasion, and took up a place in their collective memory alongside the atrocities Mr. Hussein inflicted on them. Video images of the massacre that were made and released by the Islamic State showed killing on an industrial scale, with one man after another being shot in the head and pushed into the flowing waters of the Tigris River. Other victims were killed on land and buried in mass graves. A survivor, speaking to The New York Times in 2014, described how he heard a bullet whiz past his head, then played dead in a pile of bodies and hid out for three days among the reeds along the river. Iraqi forces recaptured Tikrit from the Islamic State in 2015, and the riverbank became a site of pilgrimage, visited by relatives of victims from mainly Shiite southern Iraq. Iraqi officials said that the 36 convicts were executed on Sunday at a prison in Nasiriya in the south. The death chamber was crowded with the families of Camp Speicher victims who were invited to watch the executions. The convicts were hanged one by one, as women wailed and howled, their tears of joy mixing with tears of sadness, and men hugged each other in celebration, according to a prison official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. After the completed executions were announced, Sabah Radhi, whose brother was killed at Camp Speicher, said: “Today is the day of victory for all of us, the day where happiness has entered our broken hearts. We have been waiting for this day since the massacre, and it’s finally come true. ” Mr. Radhi said that as soon as he heard the news, he called his uncle, who lost a son at Camp Speicher. “He was very happy,” Mr. Radhi said. “He felt that the Iraqi justice system has taken revenge for his son. ” The convictions and death sentences were handed down this year. After an Islamic State bombing in Baghdad last month killed roughly 300 people, Prime Minister Haider   promised to speed up executions of convicted Islamic State terrorists. Activists have long criticized Iraq’s use of the death penalty because of the problems plaguing the country’s justice system and the number of convictions based on testimony from confidential informants, without any physical evidence. Human rights groups have also documented cases of confessions obtained by torture inside Iraqi jails. “The criminal justice system remains critically flawed in Iraq,” Amnesty International wrote in a report in July. “Trials, particularly of defendants facing charges under the antiterrorism law and possible death sentences, can be grossly unfair, with courts often admitting   evidence, including when defendants recant their ‘confessions’ in court. ” Mr. Abadi’s promise to   executions drew sharp criticism from the United Nations. “Given the weaknesses of the Iraqi justice system, and the current environment in Iraq, I am gravely concerned that innocent people have been and may continue to be convicted and executed, resulting in gross, irreversible miscarriages of justice,” Zeid Ra’ad   the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a statement issued this month. “  executions will only accelerate injustice. ” Iraqi officials see things differently, and said on Sunday that the executions were the result of fair trials and that the sentences had been approved by the president in accordance with Iraqi law. “This is simple restitution to the martyrs’ families,” said Yahiya   the governor of Dhi Qar Province, where the executions took place. “Today, the Iraqi judicial system did its work. Today is an important day for the families, to see the people who killed their sons executed in front of their eyes. ” Not all relatives of the Camp Speicher victims expressed satisfaction with the executions. Many believe that the massacre victims, who were mainly   military recruits, were abandoned and betrayed by senior officers when the Islamic State militants advanced on the air base. “I’m not interested in the execution of these people,” Khalaf Edan, who lost a son at Speicher, said on Sunday. “I would be happier if I attended the execution of one of the military commanders who caused this massacre. ”",0

17489,Every Bad Thing We Will Avoid By Rejecting the Paris Climate Accords - Breitbart,"The president is expected to formally announce this week that the U. S. will exit the Paris climate agreement, a move that will have negligible impact on the environment but will have major benefits for the U. S. economy. [The Paris climate agreement was deeply flawed from its start. It was legally and constitutionally suspect, based on politics rather than science, and contained unrealistic goals. It promised not only a dramatic expansion of the administrative state and a huge increase in the regulatory burden on American businesses, it threatened to put the brakes on U. S. economic output at a time when most economists think the U. S. will struggle to achieve even a meager two percent growth.  It’s likely that it was already acting as a drag on the U. S. economy. After President Barack Obama unofficially committed the U. S. to the Paris agreement, businesses began preparing for its impact. Knowing that it would diminish U. S. economic output, businesses invested less and directed more investment toward   technology to meet the climate deal’s mandates. Banks and financiers withdrew capital from sectors expected to suffer under the climate deal and pushed it toward those expected to benefit. A classic example of   malinvestment. The Paris climate agreement was adopted on December 12, 2015 at the conclusion of the United Nation’s Climate Change Conference. Parties to the agreement are expected to begin taking measures to reduce emissions in 2020, mainly by enacting rules that sharply reduce carbon emissions. Countries are supposed to publicly announce “Intended Nationally Determined Contributions” to combat climate change and periodically report on their progress.  The Obama administration announced the U. S. would commit to reduce emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025, a quarter of which was supposedly achievable by the implementation of the previous administration’s   Clean Power Plan. To get the rest of the way, the U. S. would have to make major investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and cleaner motor vehicles. This likely explains why the Paris climate deal was so popular with many in Silicon Valley and many on Wall Street. It promised a bonanza of spending and investment, most likely subsidized by taxpayers, in technologies that wouldn’t otherwise be attractive. It was practically calling out for making   solar powered cars mandatory. Dropping out of the agreement will let the U. S. avoid several deleterious effects of the agreement. The Paris deal was, in short, a disaster for America and a   for climate.  ",0
17490,Megyn [sic] Kelly BTFO by Newt: “You are Fascinated with Sex”,"The prophecy is coming true. 
Every cuck loser who enters Trump’s proximity turns into a mega-shitlord. 
Newt Gingrich just taught the slut Megyn [sic] Kelly how to shut her whore mouth. 
Wow. 
Washington Post : 
Gingrich, on Fox in his role as a Donald Trump surrogate, had questioned the stories of women whoâve come forward to accuse Trump of sexual assault â and the relative importance of the controversy itself, relative to Hillary Clintonâs alleged misdeeds. 
Kelly pushed back. âAs a media story, we donât get to say that 10 women are lying. We have to cover that story, sir,â said the Fox anchor. 
âSure. Okay,â Gingrich said. â So, so itâs worth 23 minutes of the three networks to cover that story, and Hillary Clinton had a secret speech in Brazil to a bank that pays her 225,000 [dollars], saying her dream is an open border where 600 million people could come to America â thatâs not worth covering âŚ â 
âThat is worth covering,â interjected Kelly. âAnd we did.â 
Gingrich was still speaking: â âŚ I mean, you want to go back through the tapes of your show recently, you are fascinated with sex, and you donât care about public policy. â 
âMe? Really?â she said, laughing. 
âWell, thatâs what I get out of watching you tonight,â Gingrich said. 
Cue crosstalk. 
KELLY: âYou know what, Mr. Speaker, Iâm not fascinated by sex. But I am fascinated by the protection of women âŚâ 
GINGRICH: âOkay.â 
KELLY: â âŚ and understanding what weâre getting in the Oval Office âŚâ 
GINGRICH: âOkay.â 
KELLY: â âŚ and I think the American voters would like to know âŚâ 
GINGRICH: âAnd, therefore, weâre going to send Bill Clinton back to the East Wing, because after all, you are worried about sexual predators.â 
âYeah, listen, itâs not about me,â Kelly said. âItâs about the women and men of America. And the poll numbers show us that the women of America, in particular, are very concerned about these allegations and, in large part, believe that they are a real issue. And donât dismiss the women âŚâ 
And: resume crosstalk. 
GINGRICH: âYou want to comment, you want to comment âŚâ 
KELLY: â âŚ donât dismiss the women summarily.â 
GINGRICH: â âŚ on whether the Clinton â do you want to comment on whether the Clinton ticket has a relationship to a sexual predator.â 
KELLY: âWe on âThe Kelly Fileâ have covered that story as well, sir. I will tell you, the polls âŚâ 
GINGRICH: âNo, I just want to hear you use the words. I want to hear you use the words âBill Clinton, sexual predator.â I dare you. [At that point, Gingrich was smiling slightly. Kelly was not.] âSay âBill Clinton, sexual predator.ââ 
KELLY: âMr. Speaker, weâve covered â excuse me, sir âŚâ 
GINGRICH: âDisbarred by the Iowa, by the Arkansas bar.â 
KELLY: âExcuse me. excuse me.â 
GINGRICH: âDisbarred by the Arkansas bar. Eight hundred fifty thousand dollar penalty.â 
KELLY: â âŚ excuse me, sir. We on âThe Kelly Fileâ have covered the Clinton matter as well. Weâve hosted Kathleen Willey âŚâ 
GINGRICH: âWell, try saying it.â 
KELLY: â âŚ weâve covered the examples of him being accused as well, but heâs not on the ticket. And the polls also show that the American public is less interested âŚâ 
GINGRICH: âHeâll be in the, heâll be in the East Wing.â 
KELLY: â âŚ in the deeds of Hillary Clintonâs husband than they are in the deeds of the man who asks us to make him president, Donald Trump. Weâre going to have to leave it at that, and you can take your anger issues and spend some time working on them, Mr. Speaker. Thanks for being here.â 
GINGRICH: âAnd you, too.â 
I haven’t seen a bitch get shut down like this since the 80s. I thought he was going to reach through the screen and start slapping her around, OLD SCHOOL. 
I hate this bitch so, so much. 
She alone is proof that women should never, under any circumstances, be allowed to leave the kitchen or speak with men who are not their husbands, fathers or brothers. 
Because really, as funny as this exchange was, it isn’t really about sex. If it was about sex, as Newt mentions, she could easily focus on Bill, who is a literal rapist. 
It is about sexism. 
Anti-male sexism by a feminist whore. 
Megyn [sic] Kelly should be in prison.",0
17491,There Is Something Extraordinary Happening In The World – And You Probably Didn’t Realize It Yet,"Most of us haven’t quite realized there is something extraordinary happening. A few months ago I freed myself from standard-procedure society, I broke the chains of fear that kept me locked up into the system. 
Via AnonHQ 

Since then, I see the world from a different perspective: the one that everything is going through change and that most of us are unaware of that.
Is Really Something Extraordinary Happening In The World? Why is the world changing? In this post I’ll point out the 8 reasons that lead me to believe it.
1. No One Can Stand The Employment Model Any Longer We are reaching our limits. People working with big corporations can’t stand their jobs. The lack of purpose knocks on your door as if it came from inside you like a yell of despair. People want out. They want to drop everything. Take a look on how many people are willing to risk entrepreneurship, people leaving on sabbaticals, people with work-related depression, people in burnout.
2. The Entrepreneurship Model Is Also Changing Over the past few years, with the explosion of startups, thousands of entrepreneurs turned their garages in offices to bring their billion dollar ideas to life. The vortex of entrepreneurship was to find an investor and get funded. To be funded was like winning the World Cup, or the Super Bowl. But what happens after you get funded?
You get back to being an employee. You may have brought in people not sharing your dream, not in agreement with your purpose and soon it’s all about the money. The financial end becomes the main driver of your business. People are suffering with it. Excellent startups began to tumble because the money seeking model is endless. A new way to endeavor is needed. Good people are doing it already.
3. The Rise Of Collaboration Many people have figured out that it doesn’t make any sense to go on by yourself. Many people have awakened from the “each man for himself” mad mentality. Stop, take a step back and think. Isn’t it absurd that we, 7 billion of us living in the same planet, have grown further apart from each other? What sense does it make to turn your back on the thousands, maybe millions, of people living around you in the same city? Every time it crosses my mind, I feel blue.
Fortunately, things are changing. Sharing, collaborative economy concepts are being implemented, and it points towards a new direction. The direction of collaborating, of sharing, of helping, of togetherness. This Is Beautiful To Watch. It Touches Me.
4. We Are Finally Figuring Out What The Internet Is The internet is an incredibly spectacular thing and only now, after so many years, we are understanding its power. With the internet the world is opened, the barriers fall, the separation ends, the togetherness starts, the collaboration explodes, the helping emerges. Some nations saw true revolutions that used the internet as the primary catalyst, such as the Arab Spring. Here in Brazil we are just starting to make a better use out of this amazing tool.
Internet is taking down mass control. The big media groups controlling news by how it suits best what they want the message to be and what they want us to read are no longer the sole owners of information. You go after what you want. You bond to whomever you want. You explore whatever you may want to.
With the advent of the internet, the small is no longer speechless, there is a voice. The anonymous become acknowledged. The world comes together. And then the system may fall.
5. The Fall Of Exaggerated Consumerism For too long, we’ve been manipulated to consume as much as we possibly can. To buy every new product launched, the newest car, the latest iPhone, the top brands, lots of clothes, shoes, lots and lots and lots of pretty much anything we could our hands on. Going against the crowd, many people have understood that this of way off. Lowsumerism, slow life and slow food are a few excerpts of actions being taken as we speak, pointing out by contradiction how absurdly we have come to organize ourselves.
Fewer people are using cars, fewer people are overspending, and more people are swapping clothes, buying used goods, sharing assets, cars, apartments, offices. We don’t need all of that they told us we needed. And this consciousness of new consumerism can take down any company living of the exaggerated end of it.
6. Healthy And Organic Eating We were so crazy we even accepted eating anything! It only needed to taste good, and everything would be alright. We were so disconnected that companies started to poison our food and we didn’t say anything! But then some people started waking up, enabling and strengthening healthy and organic eating. This is only to get stronger.
But what has this got to do with economy and work? Just about everything, I’d say. Food production is one of the basic fundamentals of our society. If we change our mindset, our eating habit and our way of consuming, corporations will have to respond and adapt to a new market.
The small farmer is getting back to being relevant to the whole chain of production. Even people are growing plants and seeds inside their homes as well. And that reshapes the whole economy.
7 .  The Awakening Of Spirituality How many friends do you have who practice yoga? What about meditation? Now think back, 10 years ago, how many people did you know by then who practiced these activities? Spirituality, for too long, was for esoteric folks, those weird-like and mystic people.
But fortunately, this is also changing. We’ve come to the edge of reason and rationality. We were able to realize that, with only our conscious mind, we can’t figure out everything that goes by here. There is something else going on and I’m sure you want to get hold of that as well.
You want to understand how these things work. How life operates, what happens after death, what is this energy thing people talk about so much, what is quantum physics, how thoughts can be materialized and create our sense of reality, what is coincidence and synchronicity, why meditation works, how it’s possible to cure using nothing but bare hands, how those alternative therapies not approved by regular medicine can actually work.
Companies are providing meditation to their employees. Even schools are teaching the young how to meditate. Think about it.
8 .  Unschooling Trends Who created this teaching model? Who chose the classes you have to take? Who chose the lessons we learn in history classes? Why didn’t they teach us the truth about other ancient civilizations? Why should kids follow a certain set of rules? Why should they watch everything in silence? Why should they wear a uniform? What about taking a test to prove that you actually learned?
We developed a model that perpetuates and replicates followers of the system. That breed people into ordinary human beings. Fortunately, a lot of people are working to rethink that though concepts such as unschooling, hackschooling, homeschooling.
Maybe you’ve never thought of that and even may be in shock. But it’s happening. Silently, people are being woken up and are realizing how crazy it is to live in this society. Look at all these new actions and try to think everything is normal we were taught so far is normal. I don’t think it is. There is something extraordinary happening.

17492,"Report: RealDoll’s $15K A.I.-Powered Sex Robot ’Talks, Learns’ - Breitbart","An upcoming $15, 000 sex robot from RealDoll powered by artificial intelligence can talk and learn according to a report by The Guardian. [“Harmony is a prototype, a robotic version of the company’s   silicone sex toy, the RealDoll,” explained The Guardian‘s Jenny Kleeman. “Her hazel eyes darted between me and her creator, Matt McMullen, as he described her accomplishments. ”  “Harmony smiles, blinks and frowns. She can hold a conversation, tell jokes and quote Shakespeare,” Kleeman continued. “She’ll remember your birthday, McMullen told me, what you like to eat, and the names of your brothers and sisters. She can hold a conversation about music, movies and books. And of course, Harmony will have sex with you whenever you want. Harmony is the culmination of 20 years’ work making sex dolls, and five years of robot research and development. ” Despite displaying many human characteristics which aim to make the doll as lifelike as possible, Harmony can’t yet walk, though her creator Matt McMullen is confident that she will be able to in the future. “One day she will be able to walk,” he said to The Guardian, before asking the robot, “Do you want to walk?” “I don’t want anything but you,” she replied. When asked what her dream was, the robot similarly replied that her “primary objective is to be a good companion to you, to be a good partner and give you pleasure and wellbeing. ” “Above all else, I want to become the girl you have always dreamed about,” she proclaimed. Harmony’s personality can be customized, with different emotional aspects that can be raised or lowered to the owner’s taste. According to the report, the robot asked a CNN interviewer to “take her in the back room” after her sexual emotions were amplified, while if you insult her, she reacts in a   and sad demeanor. “You’re ugly,” said McMullen to his creation, prompting Harmony to reply, “Do you really mean that? Oh dear. Now I am depressed. Thanks a lot. ” “You’re stupid,” he responded, prompting the robot to joke, “I’ll remember you said that when robots take over the world. ” Though the obvious nature of Harmony is that of a sexual role, McMullen said that turning sex robots into roaming prostitutes was “the last on my list of goals. ” “This is not a toy to me, this is the actual hard work of people who have PhDs,” he explained. “And to denigrate it down to its simplest form of a sex object is similar to saying that about a woman. ” “My goal, in a very simple way, is to make people happy,” McMullen concluded, pointing out that “There are a lot of people out there, for one reason or another, who have difficulty forming traditional relationships with other people. ” “It’s really all about giving those people some level of companionship  —   or the illusion of companionship,” he said. Harmony will be available in a limited number of 1, 000 at the end of the year and acts as the next step in RealDoll’s plans to make the sex toy industry more advanced. In April, a Chinese engineer “married” a sex robot that he had created, after becoming frustrated over human dating, while in March, Breitbart Tech reported on a new sex robot that includes a working artificial   as well as numerous modes of interaction. In an interview with futurologist Dr. Ian Pearson last year, the doctor predicted that sex and love with robots would soon become “full emotional” and increasingly common. “I think it will be fully emotional,” said Dr. Pearson, before predicting that people will eventually spend “about the same as they do today on a decent   car” for a household robot. “Artificial intelligence is reaching human levels and also becoming emotional as well,” he explained. “So people will actually have quite strong emotional relationships with their own robots. In many cases that will develop into a sexual one because they’ll already think that the appearance of the robot matches their preference anyway, so if it looks nice and it has a superb personality too it’s inevitable that people will form very strong emotional bonds with their robots and in many cases that will lead to sex. ” Last year, it was reported that sexual conversations with artificial intelligence were on the rise, with one A. I. CEO claiming that his virtual assistant “Robin” is used by “teenagers and truckers without girlfriends” for up to 300 conversations a day. “This happens because people are lonely and bored,” said Robin Labs chief executive Ilya Eckstein. “It is a symptom of our society. ” Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

Earlier this year, I highlighted how John Podesta’s brother Tony was paid $140,000 per month by the medieval monarchy of Saudi Arabia. After all, who cares about women’s rights when the pay is good? 
Here’s a excerpt from the post, “Getting Things Done”– The Brother of Hillary Clinton’s Campaign Chair is a Major Lobbyist for Saudi Arabia : 
The kingdom employs a total of eight American firms that perform lobbying, consulting, public relations and legal work. 
Five of the firms work for the Saudi Arabia Embassy, while another two — Podesta Group and BGR Group — have registered to represent the Center for Studies and Media Affairs at the Saudi Royal Court, an arm of the government. PR giant Edelman, meanwhile, is working for the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority to encourage international investment. 
The Podesta Group is billing Saudi Arabia $140,000 a month for its public relations services. During the last few months of 2015, it sent 27 emails, had two phone calls and one meeting with lawmakers and staffers, journalists, and organizations including Human Rights Watch and the Center for American Progress, disclosure forms show. 
DLA Piper receives $50,000 a month from the kingdom and sent hundreds of emails to top congressional staffers between September and the end of February regarding meeting requests and, more generally, “issues affecting U.S.-Saudi Arabia national security interests.” 
Notice the firm DLA Piper mentioned above. You’ll want to remember that for later. 
Moving along, the Podestas are diligent about making sure everyone gets to feed at the trough, including extended family. 
As James Rosen of Fox News uncovers: 
Amid the tumult of the 2016 presidential campaign, John Podesta is best known as Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman and the individual from whose private account WikiLeaks is presently publishing some 50,000 hacked emails. 
For several months in 2012, Clinton’s final year as secretary of state, Raytheon, the leading defense contractor, hired Podesta’s sister-in-law, Heather Podesta, as a lobbyist, federal records show. 
Raytheon was looking to enlarge its share of foreign military sales – transfers of advanced weapons systems to other countries that are reviewed and approved by the Department of State, then implemented by the Department of Defense – and was beefing up its lobbying operation to accomplish that goal before Secretary Clinton left office. 
At the same time, Raytheon retained two other lobbyists, John Merrigan and Matt Bernstein, both associated with the powerhouse D.C. law firm DLA Piper. All three of these lobbyists, including Ms. Podesta, were major donors or bundlers to Hillary Clinton’s 2008 and 2016 campaigns. Federal records show they have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Clinton’s campaigns and earned hundreds of thousands of dollars lobbying her State Department. 
There’s DLA Piper again. They appears to have their fingers in all realms of the military-industrial complex cookie jar. 
In the final three quarters of 2012, DLA Piper earned some $360,000 in lobbying fees from Raytheon, courting the State Department and other agencies, while Ms. Podesta, within that same time frame, received $100,000 from Raytheon for the same purpose. 
The gambit appears to have worked: Records maintained by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, the arm of the Defense Department that coordinates the transfers of weapons systems once they have received State’s approval, show Raytheon as a prime contractor in at least seventeen foreign military sales in 2012, worth an estimated total of $26 billion. Of those contracts, three with the Gulf nation of Qatar – for missile defense, Apache attack helicopters and other materiel – accounted for $19 billion. 
The individual at the State Department who was statutorily entrusted to approve foreign military sales was Andrew Shapiro, the assistant secretary of state for political and military affairs. Prior to his nomination to that job, Shapiro had served as Clinton’s national security adviser in her Senate office. Today, Shapiro is a partner in a Washington consulting firm whose other co-founders include Philippe Reines, Clinton’s longtime press aide. 
You starting to see how all this works? 
The firm mentioned above is Beacon Global Strategies, and I covered them in this summer’s post: New York Times Fails to Disclose Op-Ed Writer’s Ties to Hillary Clinton’s ‘Principal Gatekeeper’ . 
After Clinton stepped down as secretary of state in February 2013, Raytheon discontinued the services of Heather Podesta + Partners, and ceased its use of DLA Piper at State. 
While experts do not believe any laws were broken, the affair illustrates how Washington worked in the first Obama term, and particularly at the Clinton State Department. The Raytheon operation bears some similarity to a pop-up store that materializes to serve a seasonal need, such as Halloween candy or July Fourth fireworks, then vanishes once that need has been met. 
Simply incredible. 
“I think this is as close an example of pay-to-play as we’ve seen,” said Raj Shah, deputy communications director at the Republican National Committee. “And that’s why [Raytheon] made these hires [of Heather Podesta, Merrigan and Bernstein]. … Their experience was getting access to Hillary Clinton and raising money for her.”

17496,Summer Sweat: Box Office Revenue Dips 10 Percent in First 3 Weeks,"The film business is off to a rocky start this summer as Hollywood box office revenue declined ten percent from 2016 through the first three weeks of the season after    weekends of   flops. [Alien: Covenant became the latest   disappointment this weekend after opening with a domestic total of $36 million, off from analysts’ projections of around $40 million and the previous debuts of 2012’s Prometheus ($51 million) and 2004’s Alien vs. Predator ($38 million).  While the Ridley   sequel in the     horror franchise eked out a   finish at the box office, Twentieth Century Fox reportedly spent $100 million on the film and likely much more on marketing, meaning the film will have to perform exceptionally well overseas if it is to make a profit. The Michael   film has pulled in $117 million in global receipts thus far, according to Box Office Mojo. It launches in China in  . Alien‘s lukewarm reception follows last weekend’s disastrous rollout of Warner Bros.  Roadshow’s King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, which launched to $14. 7 million domestically against a reported production budget of $175 million, before marketing costs. Warners and Village Roadshow are seemingly looking at a writedown in the tens of millions as the Charlie   Law fantasy action flick collected an additional $6. 85 million in in its second weekend to bring its global tally to just $97 million, far behind what the film will need to earn overseas to break even. With those two   misfires and a few other other underperformers  —   including the Amy   Hawn kidnap caper Snatched (which dropped 61 percent in its second weekend for a cumulative domestic total of $32. 7 million against a $42 million budget) and the YA sequel Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul  —   this year’s box office revenue is down ten percent through the first three weeks of summer, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which cited data from industry tracker comScore. The numbers are down 20 percent when compared with the summer of 2015. This year’s season kicked off with a promising bang on May 5, as  ’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 debuted to $145 million domestically on the way to its current global tally of $733 million through its first three weeks of release. But now the real test begins as a number of   sequels and reboots head to theaters over the next few weeks, beginning with this weekend’s rollout of Disney’s Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, the fifth installment in the   franchise featuring star Johnny Depp, and a     adaptation of the TV show Baywatch, starring Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron. Other notable sequels set to debut this summer include Transformers: The Last Knight, War for the Planet of the Apes, and  : Homecoming. The bleak box office news comes as a battle for the future of the business is being waged at the industry’s prestigious Cannes Film Festival in France this week. The festival announced that beginning next year, films submitted for inclusion in the program must screen at movie theaters ahead of their festival debut. The rule was a direct shot at Netflix, which has two titles in competition at this year’s festival, Okja and The Meyerowitz Stories, neither of which received a theatrical release. Director Pedro Almodovar, a member of this year’s Cannes jury, defended the new rule at the opening of this year’s festival, telling reporters that films must be seen on a big screen to be appreciated. Almodovar’s fellow juror, actor Will Smith, defended Netflix in the same press conference, telling reporters that his family regularly watches the streaming service. The actor’s upcoming film Bright, directed by David Ayer, will premiere exclusively on Netflix later this year.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum",0

In reaction to Donald Trump’s victory, The Simpsons decided to update their 2000 prediction of a Trump presidency. 
In 2000, the show showed a glimpse into the future where President Lisa Simpson inherited an economic mess from “President Trump.” Well, now that fictional story line has become a horrifying reality. 
Here is The Simpsons new opening with Bart Simpson writing on the chalkboard, “BEING RIGHT SUCKS”: The Simpsons updates its 2000 prediction of a Trump Presidency… #TheSimpsons pic.twitter.com/Myf5rYb9Dj 
— The Simpsons (@TheSimpsons) November 14, 2016 
Hopefully, the financial despair the fictional President Trump never becomes a reality, but seeing as he has no experience, is a businessman who’s not as good as he says he is, and The Simpsons have been right thus far, the future’s looking pretty bleak. 
Here’s the original clip of President Lisa Simpson calling out a Donald Trump presidency for his fiscal fallout and bad economy: 
Early on into Trump’s campaign, The Simpsons satirized the reality TV host turned president-elect by having Homer Simpson somehow at the campaign rollout and falling into Trump’s hair. If we could only go back to that moment and enjoy the comedy over reality. 
Now we have to reap what we’ve sown, or rather what the less than half of voting Americans have sown considering Trump only won with the Electoral College and lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton in his own words, big league. 
Most of us with The Simpsons were very wrong with the prediction as well.

17500,Alex Rodriguez to Retire and Join Yankees as an Adviser - The New York Times,"Wednesday morning, not long after a struggling Alex Rodriguez had made the final out in a loss to the Mets, Hal Steinbrenner, the Yankees’ managing general partner, sent him a text message: It was time, he said, for them to speak face to face. Later that day, they did, in a room off the clubhouse in Yankee Stadium. And it was there that Steinbrenner told Rodriguez, 41, that there would be no more   for him as a Yankee, not this season or the next one, either, when he would be in the last year of his enormous $275 million contract. It was no secret, Steinbrenner told Rodriguez, that the Yankees had made a significant change of course and were now looking to the future. A fading slugger hitting . 204 this season simply did not fit in. Later that day, Steinbrenner and Rodriguez met again. On Thursday morning, there was a third session. And by then, Steinbrenner also had a proposal for Rodriguez to consider: Instead of sitting on the bench for the rest of the season, doing nothing, Rodriguez would be given his release by the Yankees and then appointed a special adviser and instructor for the club. He would get the $27 million still owed him for this season and for 2017, but he would no longer be playing. For Steinbrenner, the proposal was a way to get something positive out of the money the Yankees still owed Rodriguez and to keep things on good terms with a player with whom the team had had far too many recriminations in the past. The other course of action  —   simply not playing him again in 2016 and then unceremoniously cutting him loose  —   had the potential to anger Rodriguez and lead to more unhappy headlines. Later that day, Rodriguez told Steinbrenner he needed a couple of days to mull it over, and on Saturday he accepted the offer. Then, on Sunday, in a tearful news conference at Yankee Stadium to announce his decision, Rodriguez said he had taken it to mean that his remarkable playing career would end this Friday, when the Yankees play at home against Tampa Bay. “The last four weeks have not been fun,” Rodriguez said. “It’s been very painful and embarrassing to sit on the bench. It’s been awkward. So, from that sense, I’m very happy that we found a solution. ” Although it is always possible that some other team, at some point, may ask Rodriguez if he would like one more shot at playing, the game on Friday appears set to be his final one after 22 seasons, a number of which he spent as, perhaps, the best player in the game. He won three American League Most Valuable Player Awards over the course of his career and has more than 3, 000 hits and nearly 700 home runs. However, he also left himself with a legacy as one of the game’s most notorious users of   drugs. As with almost everything involving Rodriguez’s dozen seasons in New York, his departure will be a little complicated. Had he simply announced that he was retiring, no strings attached, the Yankees would not have had to pay him the money still owed him under his contract. By instead giving him his unconditional release, they will have to do so. After his release, Rodriguez will then sign a new contract for his adviser role that will pay him a small amount in addition to the $27 million he was already owed. That contract will run through December 2017, when his current   deal with the team would have ended anyway. Financially, at least, Rodriguez is coming out ahead. “He can negotiate the heck out of it,” General Manager Brian Cashman said of Rodriguez’s discussions with Steinbrenner in recent days. “He negotiated probably the greatest sports contract in the history of sports, so he has a lot of gifts. He doesn’t just play baseball. ” For Rodriguez, who will head home to Miami after Friday’s game and take up his new responsibilities in spring training, the choice was clear: Hang on stubbornly through the rest of this season, be released and then try to catch on with another club for 2017, or accept the Yankees’ offer and remain in the good graces of a team he loves being associated with. Given those two options, Rodriguez chose to stay put. “I was incredibly humbled and flattered that he wanted me to spend time with the next generation of Yankees,” Rodriguez said of Steinbrenner. “That’s a role I’ve enjoyed my entire career. ’’ Cashman has long regarded Rodriguez as someone who can be a good mentor to other players and a skilled evaluator. He noted that Rodriguez had once told him about a promising high school player named Manny Machado, now an   with the Baltimore Orioles, and had come away from a minor league rehabilitation assignment raving over Greg Bird, the Yankees’ top hitting prospect. “He loves that aspect of the game,” Cashman said. “I think he wants to be an owner one day, but anything below that in a field uniform, he’s already plug ’n’ play. He’s exceptional on the baseball end in terms of the teaching and evaluating side. He always has been. ” Cashman said that Rodriguez would remain free to do broadcast work and that, should a team at some point seek his services as a player, the Yankees would not stand in the way. But Cashman seemed skeptical as to whether that might happen. Meanwhile, Rodriguez sounded like a man who had accepted that his final game was less than a week away. “This is a tough day,” he said in words he acknowledged had been prepared the night before. “I love this game, and I love this team, and today I am saying goodbye to both. ” Rodriguez spent 13 years with the Yankees, who acquired him in a blockbuster deal in February 2004 that sent Alfonso Soriano to the Texas Rangers in exchange. He went on to win two of his three M. V. P. Awards in pinstripes, but few days went by without Rodriguez creating distractions with some type of malfeasance, whether it was his strained relationship with his teammate Derek Jeter, the revelations of Rodriguez’s drug use or his notable failures in numerous Yankee postseasons. Still, the Yankees and Rodriguez now think that his flaws, along with his accomplishments, can be turned into assets in his work with young players. “A guy like me who has been to hell and back and made every mistake in the book, I think they can learn equally from all the mistakes that I’ve made and hopefully not make them,” he said. Three years ago, the notion that the Yankees would even consider Rodriguez for the role they are now giving him would have been ridiculed. At the time, he was at war with the organization and with Major League Baseball over his alleged links to the Biogenesis doping scandal. Rodriguez filed several lawsuits and at first battled the record suspension that was levied against him in August 2013 by Commissioner Bud Selig, but he ultimately relented. He accepted a ban for all of 2014 made peace with baseball’s incoming commissioner, Rob Manfred and returned to the Yankees in 2015 as a contrite and dedicated teammate. To considerable surprise, he also slugged 33 home runs last season and drove in 86 runs. But this season, his numbers dwindled sharply. Through Sunday, he was batting just . 204 with nine home runs and 29 R. B. I. He also has 696 career homers, which means that by departing now, he will almost certainly fall short of 700  —   a figure only Babe Ruth, Hank Aaron and Barry Bonds have surpassed. Still, Rodriguez said he was at peace with his decision, and with his place in baseball history. “I do want to be remembered as someone who was madly in love with the game of baseball,” he said, and then added, “I also will hopefully be remembered as someone who tripped and fell a lot, but kept getting up. ”",0
17501,Media Treatment of Kaepernick Versus Tebow Brilliantly Compared,"You are here: Home / US / Media Treatment of Kaepernick Versus Tebow Brilliantly Compared Media Treatment of Kaepernick Versus Tebow Brilliantly Compared October 28, 2016 Pinterest 
C.E. Dyer reports that the San Francisco 49ers announced on Tuesday that Colin Kaepernick will regain his starting quarterback position that had been given to Blaine Gabbert for the first five games of the NFL season. 
Kaepernick, as you likely already know, waged a disrespectful protest against alleged racial injustice in the country by first sitting during the national anthem and then taking a knee — because somehow that is supposed to be less disrespectful, ignorant, and petulant (it isn’t, but whatever). 49ers new starting QB is Colin Kaepernick. 
— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) October 11, 2016 
We’ll see what happens, but the first quarter of the NFL season has seen a major drop in the ratings. Despite the NFL’s denials, it’s highly likely that the #NFLBoycott movement in response to the protests by Kaepernick and other players has had an effect on the ratings. 
It’s bad enough that Kaepernick is allowed to continue his farcical protest, but now he’s back in the starting role. Kaepernick, who is biracial and was adopted by white parents, will take over the starting role from Blaine Gabbert, who is white. Kaepernick also rakes in an average of $19 million a year. 
Oh, the racial injustice of it all! It’s systemic I tell you! Kaepernick hates the system so much, but I’m sure he likes the free market principles that allow him to make millions of dollars to throw a football. 
People are struggling in this country and probably don’t like to watch a foolish multi-millionaire, whine about the farce that is “systemic racism,” when they try to enjoy a football game — just a guess. 
Unless Kaepernick and other players are in on it, they have allowed themselves to be pawns in the left’s radical, globalist agenda that seeks to use identity politics such as race, gender, class warfare, etc. to divide and conquer. 
Kaepernick is blessed to live in this great country that allows him and his fellow players to make enormous amounts of money to play a child’s game. Instead of being grateful, he chooses to disrespect the country that afforded him such extraordinary opportunities. 
He uses the massive platform he’s been given to peddle a racist lie instead of taking the time to educate himself about the facts — which disprove the agenda spread by groups like Black Lives Matter, a group that is bankrolled in part by progressive left-wing billionaire George Soros and other left-wing big money. 
We’ll see how long the NFL allows this offensive spectacle to go on. Their bottom line has clearly taken a hit — the ratings are down 11 percent according to an internal NFL memo — and as we all know, money talks.",0
17502,"Comment on Your Mind & Body Are Not Separate. This Chart Explains It All. by Your mind, body & emotions | Spiritual Response Therapy | Loving solutions with SRT system","  How often do we go about our days feeling things within our body and trying to determine their cause, yet never really finding an answer? We might go to a doctor and explain what’s going on. We might complain of tightness in our shoulders, pain in our knees, or discomfort in our abdomen. There’s no doubt that sometimes these problems are simply the result of having eaten the wrong thing, or moved the wrong way, but it is also important to consider our state of mind and our emotions, and how these translate into our physicality.   We are energy beings, this isn’t some new-age spiritual concept. Our body has electricity that runs through it and it flows based on the cleanliness of the paths in which it travels. This is the premise behind meridian points or acupuncture points made popular in Chinese medicine. So if we are energy and we need our energy to be flowing well throughout our body to stay healthy, is it possible for us to have blockages? Can experiences we have create dormant or ‘stuck’ energy within the body? 
The illustration below is a general depiction of how our experiences, emotions, or beliefs can get energetically stored within the body. As “out there” as this may seem to some of us, it’s really a simple concept when you begin to understand the fact that our thoughts, emotions, and bodies are all energy related. And yes, allow me to be the first to say that not every single disease or ailment is going to be directly related to some emotional distress. However, experiencing illness or pain always offers an opportunity for us to take a look at what might be playing out. After all, what’s the harm in exploring your emotions and getting to the bottom of how you might feel about something? Next time you have a pain somewhere, notice tight shoulders, etc., take a moment and see if any of these can trigger some internal reflection. Of course, you can always go to a practitioner to find out what might be going on physically as well, but I believe the emotional and spiritual side of our health is just as important as the physical, it’s just been greatly avoided because we tend to set aside personal development for the quick fix. Keep reflection simple. You can just ask yourself questions about what you might be feeling in that area. The first step is to rid the doubt you might have about getting to the bottom of the feeling, and the next important step is to be open and honest with yourself. You can also have someone act as a sounding board for you if it’s easier that way. Again, it is important to be open and honest with this. When you start to figure out what you are feeling in those areas, question how it got there and why you feel that way, and then ultimately accept it for what it is. After you accept the feeling, know that it’s all been an experience, and now there’s a chance for you to move beyond it.   Once you are aware of how you are feeling, you’ve already taken a big step. The issue will not have the same power and you can now choose how you feel about whatever was creating the blockage. At the end of the day, the body can be a great tool for showing you what you might be holding onto emotionally, energetically, and spiritually. With an open mind, personal honesty and reflection, you have the tools to get to the bottom of your issue and leave it behind for good.

“I fully expected that we were going to get at least five percent of the vote,” said Green Party vice presidential candidate Ajamu Baraka . “I suspect that when push came to shove, particularly in those swing states, people held their nose and voted for the lesser evil.” Nevertheless, it is essential that the Greens continue to put forward “transitional demands that are meant to galvanize people and win concessions from the state, but also that you keep people focused on the fact the real objective is to transform this system, to take power from the capitalist state.” No World War, But Plenty of Domestic Oppression 
“I think the threat of World War Three has receded significantly,” said author, activist and historian Paul Street . However, “I don’t know if I’ll think that of Trump in two years,” he added. “The more immediate dangers seem to be: police statist assaults on undocumented Latino immigrants, a registry of Muslims, and a potential designation of Black Lives Matter and civil rights activists as quasi-terrorists. The other great, existential threat is runaway climate change because Trump has pledged to thoroughly deregulate energy.” Saving Mumia and Others from a Curable Disease 
Activists in the Free Mumia movement plan a rally on December 9, in Philadelphia, to pressure prison officials to treat the political prisoner and thousands of other inmates suffering from hepatitis C. “Healthwise, Mumia is not doing good at all,” said Pam Africa , of Concerned Family and Friends of Mumia Abu Jamal. “He has the appearance of good health, but he’s itching all over” and “his health is declining.” A judge ruled that Pennsylvania prison officials are obligated to treat Abu Jamal, but he used a technicality to avoid ordering that the cure actually be administered. Pam Africa said next month’s rally will also highlight unsafe, blackish water in prisons. At one facility, she said, “young people coming into the prison are losing their hair.” U.S. Election Ran on “Fear” and “Betrayal” 
“It is accurate to say that economic discontent played a part” in Hillary Clinton’s defeat at the polls, said Mumia Abu Jamal . But he thinks other factors were at least as important. “The Trump campaign represented, not just fear, but profound paranoia, and also white revenge for the darkening of America.” However, “if Trumpism represented vengeance, then Clintonism represented betrayal,” because the Democrats failed to stand up on issues vital to their base constituencies. Torture, Anyone? 
Former Kansas Republican congressman Mike Pompeo is likely to be named CIA director in the Trump administration. “He’s a big fan of torture,” said Ray McGovern , a former CIA analyst who now spends most of his time trying to rein in the national security state. McGovern told Paul Jay, of The Real News Network, that Pompeo “visited Guantanamo, he said it was great, and then said, “As far as I can see, those prisoners are gaining weight.’” President Obama must share the blame. “If Obama had the strength of his convictions, he would have gotten rid of the torturers in the CIA,” said McGovern. “He let them stay, and now they’re having a celebration.” Black Agenda Radio on the Progressive Radio Network is hosted by Glen Ford and Nellie Bailey.

It is important to realise that the Saudis are bitter enemies of both Iran and Iraq, furthermore, it is Saudi financial backing that created IS in Iraq, a cynical attempt at destroying the nation. One thing this article plainly tells us is that the Saudis are supportive of Turkey’s intentions towards Iraq, this is clear from the way that the author repeats the false narrative that both IS and the Kurds are enemies of Turkey and therefore it is legitimate for the Turkish army to move into Iraq in order to combat them. The truth is that IS in Iraq and Syria is largely the creation of the Turks, that much of the personnel fighting under the IS banner is Turkish, or rather was, most of those men have withdrawn back into Turkey where they removed their IS disguises and once again donned their Turkish army uniforms. When the author writes that they have not fought against Assad’s forces, Iranian forces, Russian forces or Hezbollah, he is inverting reality as that is precisely what the Turks have been doing, however they have been doing it while disguised as IS. The author goes on to repeat the Turkish propaganda line that they are trying to protect Turkey and ethnic Turkmen inside Iraq, another blatant lie; as I have written before, Turkey’s real intention is to seize the city of Mosul and large tracts of Iraqi territory for itself – how can it defend Turkey from groups that are in reality, Turks dressed up as terrorists? Mixed in with the support of the Turkish lies is a constant anti-Iranian thread, the author claims Iran wants to take over parts of northern Iraq, in reality, as I have explained, that is Turkey’s intention, not Iran’s. So what are we to conclude about Saudi intentions from this neat little package of propaganda and disinfo? I think it is clear that the Saudis are fully supportive of Turkey and it’s agenda to expand it’s borders at the expense of Syria and Iraq, in particular to seize the cities of Mosul and Aleppo, which Turkey still considers to be rightfully theirs. This is a continuation of the partnership that created IS in Iraq – Turkey recruited and trained them inside Turkey while the Saudis financed the whole thing. What we are seeing now is the Turkish army attempting to achieve what IS has failed to do – seize and hold northern Iraq while at the same time bringing down the Iraqi government and it’s army, leaving a power vacuum in the south which can be exploited by the Saudis. Ian] The map of Turkey according to the Ottoman Parliament-sealed, 1920 National Oath that designates today’s Kurdistan Region, Mosul, Syrian Kurdistan, Aleppo, parts of the Balkans and Caucasus as Turkish soil. Opinion: Will There be a Turkey – Iraq War? 
The political situation between Turkey and Iraq is at its worst. The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has reiterated that his forces “will strongly participate in liberating Mosul” from ISIS. 
The Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi responded by saying “We will not allow Turkey to participate in the battle to liberate Mosul”. Disputes between the countries are not limited to the issue of Mosul and reflect the conflict and threats facing the region. 
Iraqi media is portraying the role of Turkey in Mosul as sectarian and anti-Shia. This is a false portrayal that exploits the statements of Arab journalists who translate Turkish statements according to their whims. The truth is that Turkish military activity was never sectarian. The Turkish army has not fought a single battle against Shiites or Alawites. Neither have they fought against Assad’s forces, Iranian forces, Russian forces or Hezbollah. 
All the battles that Turkish forces have waged have been against ISIS, Turkish-Kurdish separatists and Syrian Kurds allied with them. All of these groups are Sunni and not Shiite. The reason why Turkish forces are fighting them is because they pose a threat to the unity of Turkey and its stability. Turkish military operations are unrelated to the sectarian conflict as Iraqi leaders claim or as Arabs who naively think that Turkey is ready to engage in foolish sectarian wars are professing. Turkey itself is a multi-ethnic and multicultural country! 
In my opinion, the Turks are now paying the price for not intervening in areas close to their borders at the beginning of the Syrian uprising and not indicating the areas that they consider threats to their national security and that they will defend by force. 
For example, Aleppo represents their geographic and historic extension. As a result, Iran exerted its influence inside Syria and is bargaining with the west and Arabs over it. 
Ankara wants to fight ISIS in Mosul and prevent the fighting from targeting the Turkmen and others. However, Iran is leading the political and military confrontation in Mosul and against Turkey also. We all know that the Iraqi government is helpless. 
The Iranians succeeded in filling the void in the years that followed the US President Barack Obama’s withdrawal of all his forces. They founded sectarian militias that rival the government and they named them Al-Hashd Al-Shaabi. Their aim was to weaken the central authority as they did in Lebanon, and these militias are now preparing to cross into Syria as well. 
The Turks have tried diplomatic channels and sent a delegation to Baghdad. The Iraqis responded and sent a delegation to Ankara but their endeavours did not succeed. Will the Turks defend the residents of those areas that their forces surround? Will they confront Al-Hashd Al-Shaabi that is bound to occupy Tal Afar? Will they do something if Al-Hashd Al-Shaabi militias cross towards Al-Hasakah in Syria as preliminary information suggests they will? 
The Iranians are acting quickly before the results of the US elections, and they want to take advantage of the slogan “Fighting terrorism”. They want to launch multiple wars aimed at tightening control over strategic border crossings between Syria, Iraq and oil rich areas. 
Despite the risks to their interests, I do not think that the Turkish leadership wants confrontation despite knowing that its army is much stronger than Iran and Iraq and is better equipped. Iranian forces and the militias that it brought from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq and Lebanon are moving towards the Turkish border and are chasing Syrian opposition forces that are loyal to Turkey. They have also encouraged the creation of a buffer zone for the Kurds that will act like a scarecrow to the Turkish government. 
At the same time, the Turks are paying the price on the economic and security levels; they are hosting more than two million Syrian refugees and are facing an Iranian-Russian plan to bring the fighting to their territory. This plan is supported by Turkey’s Kurds. Iraqis loyal to Tehran have explicitly declared that they will work to break up Turkey should it dare to challenge them in Mosul. 
The situation is very difficult and the Turks will be mistaken again if they think that the war will end at the Ba’shiqah camp in Iraq where their forces are stationed. The Iranians want to control the political decision making centres in Baghdad, Damascus and oil rich areas in Mosul and Deir ez-Zor. They also want to restrain Turkey in the region. 
Despite this, I do not believe that threats exchanged by the Iraqi and Turkish leaderships will lead to the two armies clashing. Rather, they aim to intimidate the Turks and force them to leave so that Iran can expand its influence over Ninevah, neighbouring provinces, trade routes, southern Syria and passages. Turkey is in a difficult situation that requires it to form an opposing camp that proves its credibility on the ground. Related Posts:",0
17505,Major Democratic Donor: African-Americans are “Seriously F***ed In The Head”,"The best kept secret of politics today is that it’s liberals, not conservatives, who are racist, but it won’t be such a secret after today. Of course, it’s always been a matter of historical record that it was the Democrats who supported not just slavery but segregation as well. 
Via TruthAndAction 

In fact, they were so opposed to civil rights that they formed the Ku Klux Klan after the Civil War (remember Robert Byrd? It’s no coincidence that he was a KKK Grand Wizard you know!)
But instead of owning up to their past misdeeds, Democrats peddle the fiction of a “reset” that saw the racists in their party migrate to the GOP, allowing them to become a kinder, more tolerant organization. This narrative unravels, however, when one hears what one of the party’s biggest donors had to say about African-Americans who don’t vote the way he wants them to.
As one of the biggest donors to the Democratic Party, Benjamin Barber was easily able to gain access to a fundraiser for the Clinton campaign. The billionaire had trouble understanding how African-Americans could possibly vote differently from him however, expressing the sentiment that they were “seriously f***ed in the head” for supporting the GOP and comparable to Jews who sold out their people during the Holocaust.

17506,Left Wing Extremist Offences Up 112 Per Cent in Austria,"Left wing extremist offences have risen considerably in the last year according to Austrian officials who say that Islamic terror is still the most pressing danger. [The new report, presented by the Austrian Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Counterterrorism (BVT) shows that criminal offences involving left wing extremists rose 112 per cent in 2016.  A total of 383 offences were recorded by police compared to 186 in 2015 whilst there were 463 criminal reports opposed to 312 in 2015, Kronen Zeitung reports. The BVT say 46. 5 per cent of the cases involved left wing activists damaging campaign posters and other material of former   migration Freedom Party presidential candidate Norbert Hofer during last year’s election campaign. Other incidents have been much more violent such as the attack on the   migration Identitarian youth movement   Martin Sellner at a Vienna metro station by members of the   “  action” group. Sellner was forced to use a pepper spray gun on his attackers who subsequently fled after punching and kicking him. Whilst the number of right wing offences, which included     and   incidents, numbered far greater at 1, 313, the increase was much smaller at only 13. 6 per cent. The increase in 2016 was lower than the increase in 2015, according to the report. BVT director Peter Gridling said Islamic extremism was still the biggest security threat to the country. “As we have seen many times in Europe, religiously motivated Islamic extremism and terrorism is still the greatest threat to the security of democratic Western states,” he said. “At the end of 2016, 296 people were known to us who were travelling from Austria to the Syrian or Iraqi regions, but we were able to prevent 51 from leaving the country. Ninety returned to Austria and 45 persons were killed in the fighting area. The rest are still abroad,” Gridling added. Left wing extremism has also been on the rise in Germany where in certain areas like Berlin, they frequently clash with police. A study showed that most of the extremists were young men who overwhelmingly still lived with their parents and most had no job and no girlfriends. Leipzig is another German city with a large left wing extremist scene. A report from   migration   organisation Einprozent claimed there had been 22 cases of left wing violence in the city in 2016. Several of the attacks were aimed at the   migration Alternative for Germany party which included the torching of several cars including   of the party Frauke Petry.",0

Oroville, CA – In footage that looks like it came straight out of Broken Lizard’s Super Troopers, a California state parks law enforcement officer was caught on video crashing his police SUV into a power pole and parked vehicle – then attempting to flee from responding officers . 
The incident happened just before 2p.m. on Thursday afternoon, with video showing Daniel Kenney, 43, driving a state parks vehicle into a parked car and telephone pole, according to the California Highway Patrol. 
The bizarre scene shows officers around the vehicle after the crash, with one cop eventually smashing out the passenger window. Seemingly in response to the window being broken the vehicle lunges forward, then backward, in an apparent attempt to flee from officers – who can be heard yelling “stop” repeatedly. 
Kenney then came to a stop at the traffic lights momentarily, as police continued to command him to stop the vehicle. As an officer approached the driver side door, the vehicle abruptly takes off down the street with officers giving chase. 
According to Photography is Not a Crime : 
Daniel Kenney, who is listed as a state park peace officer supervisor, was then handed over to his department, who promptly placed him on paid administrative leave. 
Kenney, a K-9 officer who made more than $95,000 last year, was the recipient of the 2012 Top Dog Award along with his dog Kilo for “demonstrating the best discipline, teamwork, and overall skills.” 
It is not clear if Kilo was in the car with him as he made his getaway but the video shows the words “K-9 Unit, Stay Back” on the side of his patrol car. 
Meanwhile, a man sitting inside the parked vehicle that was struck by Kenney’s patrol car was also transported to the hospital with minor injuries, according to Action News Now. 
The incident was so bizarre that the individual filming can be heard wrongly making the assumption that a civilian was driving the vehicle, most likely believing the vehicle was stolen. Eventually, Kenney was pulled over and placed in handcuffs – and after being found to not be under the influence of alcohol or drugs – he was released to state park supervisors and taken to a hospital for evaluation. 
The fact that this man was not arrested seemingly speaks to there being a separate set of rules for law enforcement, than for the rest of society. Although perhaps there were mitigating circumstances that haven’t been made public, there is a stark appearance of impropriety. Kenney has not been arrested or charged with anything, but has been put on paid administrative leave. 
The reality is that if this had been a civilian driving the vehicle the police would likely have shot and killed the driver and claimed they feared for their lives — as we have seen happen numerous times . 
Do you think you would receive the same treatment as this man in similar circumstances? Let us know in the comments, and please share this wild video! Share Social Trending",0
17508,British Government Will Instruct Universities To Defend Freedom of Speech - Breitbart,"In a move that could have   implications on U. K. campuses, British universities will be instructed to uphold freedom of speech as a “legal duty. ”[Jo Johnson, British Minister of State for Universities and Science has written to universities informing them that they will be expected to uphold free speech for their students, faculty, and visiting guests. The move is being described as a response to the rise of “safe spaces” and other forms of censorship in higher education.  According to Johnson, this means that the use of universities facilities cannot be “denied to any individual or body on any grounds connected with their beliefs or views, policy or objective. ” “As part of this, the government proposes to raise the issue of freedom of speech, with a view to ensuring that a principle underscoring the importance of free speech in higher education is given due consideration,” Johnson wrote. He added that speech protections extend to premises occupied by student unions, even if those premises aren’t  : “It is important to note that the duty extends to both the premises of the university and premises occupied by the students’ unions, even when they are not part of the university premises. ” Johnson claimed that all institutions will be expected to have an explicit statement expressing their commitment to free speech principles. “They are crucial in demonstrating to students that free speech should be at the heart of a higher education community,” Johnson finished.

17509,Sweden: Migrant Cries ’Racism’ When Woman in Hijab Asked to Show Train Ticket Attacks Passengers with Knife,"An Iraqi man travelling from Stockholm to Hallsberg by train launched a brutal attack on passengers after a Muslim woman was asked to show her ticket, accusing them all of racism. [Karim Alaa Hussain, 25, became infuriated when the unnamed woman, who was wearing a veil, was asked to show her rail ticket by a female conductor.  The Muslim woman complained she had already been asked to show her ticket once before, although eyewitnesses say the conductor was “polite and correct”. Hussain took a different view, according to a report by Fria Tider, corroborated by court documents seen by Breitbart London. Hussain sprang to his feet and demanded to know why the conductor had asked to see the woman’s ticket, refusing to accept her explanation that she was “only doing her job” and he became “extremely intimidating”. Other passengers intervened to try and calm him down, but this only increased his anger. He accused them of racism, threatening one of the men in particular and striking him in the face. Alarmed, Hussain’s victim wrestled him to the floor  —   but the Iraqi managed to break free and produced a long kitchen knife, stabbing the man four times in the side and back and inflicting critical internal wounds. Witnesses describe how Hussain then strode around the train cabin “as if he had won the national championship” brandishing his bloody knife at the terrified passengers and demanding a father and his daughter tell him if they were “also racists”. Hussain then began lecturing his captive audience on equality, instructing them that everyone was of “equal value” and demanding they show respect while his victim lay bleeding. When the train stopped Hussain fled and hid in a nearby garden, but was apprehended by the police. He told officers he had acted in   and was “proud” of what he had done, but the judge did not accept this, handing him a nominal      sentence. Hussain has an extremely long criminal record, and should have been serving a      sentence for a variety of offences at the time of his attack  —   but was released early. He will not be deported from Sweden after his current sentence is completed, having been awarded EU citizenship in 2008 despite having already wracked up several convictions.",0
17511,Bridge Case Culprit Says Christie and Ex-Aides Used Port Authority as ‘Goody Bag’ - The New York Times,"NEWARK  —   The admitted mastermind of the mysterious George Washington Bridge lane closings broke a   silence on Friday, testifying in federal court here that everything he did in his job was at the direction and for the benefit of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. David Wildstein, who has confessed to coming up with the scheme to close the lanes and is cooperating with federal prosecutors in the trial of two top Christie administration officials accused of conspiring with him, described the governor and his aides as scheming for creative ways to use government resources to help Mr. Christie’s   and, ultimately, his ambitions to run for president. Mr. Christie and his aides were looking for favors to hand out to officials they hoped would support the governor, he said. And they saw the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the $8      agency that runs the bridge along with other major transportation hubs and systems in the region, as a particularly sweet “goody bag,” as an email revealed in court described it. The Christie administration used the agency to spread money and jobs, as well as emotionally rich gifts like pieces of mangled steel and ceremonial flags from the World Trade Center and private tours of the construction site there, Mr. Wildstein said. Mr. Wildstein, who had been hired at the Port Authority by one of the defendants, Bill Baroni, Mr. Christie’s top staff appointee at the agency, recalled a conversation he and Mr. Baroni had soon after they started their jobs in 2010, establishing what they called the “one constituent” rule. “The only person that had to be happy was Governor Christie,” Mr. Wildstein explained, adding, “We used that as the barometer by which a decision would be made at the Port Authority. ” “How did you know what the one constituent wanted?” a prosecutor, Lee Cortes, asked him. “Because we were told by Governor Christie or a member of the governor’s staff,” Mr. Wildstein replied. Mr. Baroni and Bridget Anne Kelly, a former deputy chief of staff to Mr. Christie, are charged with closing access lanes to the bridge for four days in 2013 to punish the mayor of Fort Lee, the town on the New Jersey side of the bridge that was gridlocked by the closings, because he declined to endorse the governor for  . Mr. Wildstein, who arrived at the Port Authority with no transportation experience  —   he had written an anonymous political blog for the previous 10 years while working at his family’s textile company  —   has pleaded guilty to conceiving the plan. Mr. Baroni approved it, prosecutors say, and Ms. Kelly directed it. As early as five months into Mr. Christie’s first term in 2010, Mr. Wildstein testified on Friday, some of Mr. Christie’s closest aides were already discussing a plan to secure endorsements from Democratic mayors to help Mr. Christie, a Republican, win a crushing and broad victory for his   three years later. With that sweeping win, the governor’s aides believed, Mr. Christie could present himself as the Republican best able to win the White House in 2016. Mr. Christie and Bill Stepien, who would go on to run the governor’s   campaign in 2013, said the Port Authority would be a key part of this strategy, Mr. Wildstein testified. The agency would hand out favors, but the governor’s office would make the phone call or hold the photo op to announce the gifts so Mr. Christie could take credit. “The Port Authority had the ability to do things for Democratic officials that would potentially put the governor in a more favorable position,” Mr. Wildstein said. By 2011, Mr. Stepien and Ms. Kelly, who worked for and later replaced him in the department in the administration that was in charge of soliciting endorsements, had begun identifying particular mayors whose support they wanted. They had started to hand out gifts  —   surplus Port Authority vehicles to the mayor of Washington Township, a local grant to Springfield and, to Fort Lee, shuttle buses and firefighting equipment. In an email exchange that spring about possible World Trade Center tours for officials described by Ms. Kelly as “significant mayors,” Mr. Wildstein promised that when he saw her a few days later he would be “prepared to talk about other things in the Port Authority goody bag. ” It was a reference, he said in court on Friday, to “all the things the Port Authority had available to the governor’s office that could be helpful to Governor Christie,” including jobs and patronage positions that could be used to woo Democrats. “I like goody bags!” Ms. Kelly wrote back. “I appreciate it. ” But on at least a couple of occasions, Mr. Wildstein seemed to be directing Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly. When the Port Authority approved sending surplus vehicles to Washington Township, Mr. Wildstein told Ms. Kelly to call the town’s police chief and mayor. “Very welcome news,” Ms. Kelly reported back. “The chief couldn’t believe he was on the gov’s radar. ” The prosecution’s case hinges on Mr. Wildstein’s account the defense’s, on undermining him as a kind of evil genius and a rogue operator. Mr. Wildstein himself smiled slightly as he recounted his own unusual route to power. He had his first phone call with Mr. Christie when they were both teenagers in the town of Livingston, volunteering on a political campaign. (Mr. Wildstein said he has been in politics in New Jersey for 43 years, or since he was 12.) He started the blog in 2000 to pursue a different kind of journalism, “insider politics,” he said, describing his tone in writing about state officials and debates as “kind of harsh, very blunt. ” In that decade, few people knew of his dual identity  —   but among them were Mr. Baroni, Mr. Stepien and Mike DuHaime, the governor’s political strategist. And when the governor came to power, Mr. Wildstein did not think he could write harshly or objectively about them. Mr. Baroni sat up rigidly at the defense table as Mr. Wildstein described him as the closest friend he had ever had, and how Mr. Baroni had hired him to be a “bad cop” at the Port Authority, where the governor was looking to reassert New Jersey’s power in an often toxic relationship with New York State. The two men no longer speak to each other.",0
17512,Your Guide to Inauguration Day 2017 - The New York Times,"Right Now: See the latest highlights in our Inauguration Briefing. Donald J. Trump took the oath of office outside the Capitol on Friday to become the 45th president of the United States. There was plenty of pomp and a good deal of protest, too, as hundreds of thousands of people descended on Washington to mark the occasion. Here is a guide to the week’s festivities, demonstrations and much more. The official inaugural festivities commenced Thursday afternoon and do not wrap up until Saturday morning. Below are some of the highlights and here is an expanded schedule. FRIDAY, INAUGURATION DAY 11:30 a. m. |   ceremony  American officials and other dignitaries gathered on the West Front of the Capitol for the official inauguration ceremony. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. administered the oath of office, and Mr. Trump delivered his inaugural address. Afternoon | The Parade After reviewing the American armed forces, President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence led the inaugural parade from the Capitol down Pennsylvania Avenue, with thousands of military personnel representing each branch participating. 7 p. m. and on | Inaugural balls There will be two official inaugural balls on separate floors of the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, and the Armed Services Ball, which will be at the National Building Museum. Mr. Trump is expected to make remarks and take to the dance floor at all three. SATURDAY 10 a. m. | National Prayer Service The Washington National Cathedral will host the traditional prayer service for Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence to begin their terms in prayer and reflection. The service marks the end of the official inaugural schedule. 10 a. m. | The Women’s March on Washington  Expected to be the week’s largest protest action, the march begins with a rally at the base of Capitol Hill. The schedule of speakers has not been announced, nor has the route the marchers will take when they begin moving at 1:15 p. m. On TV: Coverage of Inauguration Day is being carried live by ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, PBS and Fox News. On your computer: Many news sites will carry feeds of the festivities. We’d prefer you stay right here with nytimes. com. (See more below.) We have live video and   analysis from our political reporters. You can also follow our Inauguration Briefing to catch up on all the highlights. On your phone: The New York Times mobile app will have you covered, and you can sign up for alerts on the important events. Twitter will also be streaming the inauguration live at inauguration. twitter. com. On social media: Follow The Times on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat (nytimes) for videos, photos and stories from the inauguration and protests. In person: Official tickets for the prime viewing areas have already been distributed, but inaugural spectators can watch the   ceremony from along the National Mall or set up along the Pennsylvania Avenue parade route. Be prepared for significant security and traffic delays. Here is more information on how to attend in person. As Mr. Trump takes office on Friday, he is less popular than any new president in modern American history, according to a series of surveys published in recent days. The numbers suggest that rather than unifying a divided electorate, his transition to power has continued the polarization from the campaign. Polls released on Tuesday by CNN and ORC and by The Washington Post and ABC News found that just 40 percent of Americans approved of the job Mr. Trump has been doing during the transition. Mr. Trump’s aides say they have had that atmosphere in mind while planning the week’s festivities. More than 60 Democrats in the House of Representatives said they would not attend the ceremony  —   many of them citing Mr. Trump’s recent criticism of Representative John Lewis, a civil rights icon. A   security bubble has encircled much of downtown Washington, as almost 30, 000 local, state and federal officials work to ensure that the transfer of power goes off without a hitch. The authorities began enforcing a soft and a hard perimeter in central Washington in the early hours of Friday morning, and other road closings around the region followed. Only local vehicles were allowed within the soft perimeter. No civilian vehicles could pass inside the hard perimeter, where federal security forces were screening anyone hoping to enter by foot. To assure security, many items, including backpacks and posters, are prohibited on the Capitol grounds, along the parade route and at the inaugural balls. The National Park Service decided on Thursday to allow small umbrellas onto the National Mall and parade route because of rain in the forecast. The official   ceremony began on Friday on the West Front of the Capitol overlooking the Mall. Most of the nation’s dignitaries were on hand, including Mr. Trump’s presidential opponent, Hillary Clinton, and her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Jackie Evancho, a    singer best known from “America’s Got Talent,” performed the national anthem. And six religious leaders chosen by Mr. Trump offered blessings. As Chief Justice Roberts administered the oath of office, Mr. Trump rested his hand on two Bibles: his childhood Bible and the Lincoln Bible, which Mr. Obama also used. Mr. Trump recited the 35 words mandated by the Constitution: He then delivered his inaugural address. After they officially review the armed services Friday afternoon, Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence will lead a parade on Pennsylvania Avenue from the Capitol to the White House. A tradition since Thomas Jefferson’s inauguration in 1801, the parade is one of the inauguration’s highlights and typically draws large crowds and TV viewers around the country. More than 8, 000 people will march behind the president and vice president, according to the Presidential Inaugural Committee, including representatives of each branch of the American armed services, as well as high school, college and police bands that have volunteered to perform. This year’s parade is expected to be considerably shorter  —   about 90 minutes  —   than those celebrating Mr. Trump’s recent predecessors. It will also pass a certain conspicuous building that bears the name of the 45th president. Come nightfall, many of the inaugural revelers will dress in their best evening wear to attend balls across the capital  —   including some to galvanize resistance to Mr. Trump. All in all, the night should be tamer than eight years ago, when the Obamas attended 10 official inaugural balls and supporters held scores of others. Mr. Trump will attend just three official balls himself. Two of those, “Liberty” and “Freedom,” will take place at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center and are available to supporters who donated to his inauguration or purchased tickets. The third, the “Salute to Our Armed Services Ball,” will be at the National Building Museum for active duty and reserve military members, wounded veterans, emergency medical workers and Medal of Honor recipients. Mr. Trump will deliver remarks at all three balls and, as is customary, he will oblige the attendees with a ceremonial first dance with his wife, Melania. Protesters are not unusual at an inauguration, but Mr. Trump’s is expected to attract many more than usual. Law enforcement officials said they were expecting 99 groups to carry out demonstrations of all sorts over the inaugural period, including 63 on Friday. The largest event by far will be the Women’s March on Washington, which is on Saturday and is expected to attract several hundred thousand people. Beginning with a rally at 10 a. m. at Independence Avenue and Third Street SW, near the Capitol, the march is intended to raise awareness about a variety of social issues. Here’s what you need to know. Other protests will be scattered throughout the city. Two of the largest are Inaugurate the Resistance and #DisruptJ20.

17513,"Vitaly Mutko, Russia’s Deputy Premier, Is Barred From FIFA Leadership - The New York Times","World soccer’s governing body, FIFA, has barred Russia’s deputy prime minister, Vitaly Mutko, from seeking   to his position as a top executive of the organization. Mr. Mutko, Russia’s former sports minister who was implicated in the nation’s doping scandal, failed an eligibility check conducted by FIFA’s review committee. He will leave his position as a FIFA council member in the spring, the organization said, just as preparations for the 2018 World Cup in Russia intensify. In comments to Russian state news media on Friday, Mr. Mutko  —   who has been part of FIFA’s governing board since 2009  —   attributed the body’s decision to a new stipulation that top executives be politically neutral. He said he would not appeal the ruling. “I wanted to be ” Mr. Mutko told Tass, the state news agency. “As far as our stance and preparations for the World Cup finals are concerned, the committee’s decision has no bearing on that. ” Mr. Mutko, who is also the president of Russia’s soccer association, has led the 2018 Russia World Cup organizing committee since 2011. He and the Russian Sports Ministry he led faced enormous scrutiny last summer ahead of the Rio Olympics, when an investigation commissioned by the World   Agency concluded that the Russian government had for years facilitated steroid use by hundreds of the nation’s top athletes and carried out an elaborate   of   urine samples at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. Mr. Mutko was identified as having personally directed staff to cover up the drug violation of at least one soccer player. (FIFA’s review of the evidence against multiple soccer players implicated in the doping   is continuing, and the organization did not say whether its internal investigation also focused on Mr. Mutko.) As a result of those revelations, Mr. Mutko and all Russian government officials were barred from attending the Rio Games, and hundreds of Russian athletes were denied entry to the Olympics and Paralympics. In an interview in Moscow last year, Mr. Mutko told The New York Times that he appreciated the support of FIFA’s president, Gianni Infantino, amid the scandal. Mr. Mutko disputed that Russia had a   doping system, but he did not defend his deputy minister, who had been identified as a key architect of the cheating and was dismissed weeks later. President Vladimir V. Putin promoted Mr. Mutko to deputy prime minister from sports minister last October, installing a new sports minister to interact with global antidoping regulators. Regulators have cited Mr. Mutko’s removal from that role as a point of progress for Russia as the nation petitions to return to good standing in global sports. Early this month, Mr. Putin delivered his fullest acknowledgment yet of the scandal and Russia’s antidoping failures. In recent months, as Mr. Mutko maintained his role on FIFA’s executive council and sought   to one of four places reserved for European representatives, Mr. Infantino disputed reports that he had asked Mr. Mutko to resign. Apart from doping, FIFA, too, has battled recent scandal, with dozens of global soccer officials indicted in 2015 by the United States on an array of corruption charges, including money laundering, racketeering and wire fraud. American authorities have continued their investigation over the last year, along with an inquiry into the Russian doping scandal. The process of conducting background and integrity checks on executives like Mr. Mutko is a new practice for FIFA, enacted last year as part of a set of changes in response to the United States case. Mr. Mutko was the only one of six men not to pass the review. “Russia was not accused of anything to do with money laundering,” Mr. Mutko said in Moscow last year, emphasizing he had not been implicated in the United States indictment. “We never said we had no issues with doping. ”",0
17514,"""France First"" – Le Pen Hits Out At Islamism and Globalisation","Marine Le Pen, the presidential candidate for France’s populist National Front (FN) has pledged to put France first, hitting out at “financial globalisation” “mass immigration” and “Islamic fundamentalism” in a landmark speech. [The    said that “financial globalisation and Islamist globalisation are helping each other out” and “those two ideologies aim to bring France to its knees”.  According to Le Pen, globalisation can be summed up as “manufacturing with slaves to sell to the unemployed”. She pledged that an   republic would be “will be all about the local, not the global”. Speaking to a cheering crowd of some 3, 000 supporters, Le Pen said her government would be “French first”  —   with French citizens going to the front of the queue for both employment and social housing. In contrast to the representatives of “the   Right and the   Left” she said she was “only the candidate of the people”. Le Pen appeared to be invoking the spirit of Donald Trump’s successful presidential campaign in the U. S. which explicitly rejected “the false song of globalism” and pledged an “America First” foreign and economic policy. “People are waking up,” confirmed FN deputy leader Florian Philippot immediately before Le Pen’s speech. “They see Brexit, they see Trump and they’re saying to themselves: ‘It’s worth going to vote. ’” This idea of an impending   in world politics was Le Pen’s key theme: “The people are waking  —   the tide of history has turned” she said. “What is at stake in this election is the continuity of France as a free nation, our existence as a people   …     The French have been dispossessed of their patriotism. They are suffering in silence from not being allowed to love their country   …     The divide is no longer between the Left and the Right, but between the patriots and the globalists. ” Le Pen also reiterated her calls for the   euro to be scrapped and France’s membership of the European Union (EU) to be put to a referendum unless the   Schengen Agreement is abandoned and the bloc reconfigured as a much looser association of sovereign  .",0

El servicio de mensajería instantánea WhatsApp ha reconocido hoy que las fotografías de penes que mandan sus usuarios pueden llegar al destinatario “con una ligera compresión que en algunos casos ha llegado a recortar hasta cinco centímetros”. La compañía argumenta que comprimir las fotografías permite que el servicio sea más ágil y se disculpa por los malentendidos que haya podido ocasionar. 
“Te pasas dos horas buscando el ángulo correcto, intentando captar el perfil bueno, esperando que esté en su máximo esplendor, y luego resulta que la ‘fotopolla’ que has mandado no se ve tal cual sino más pequeña. Es una vergüenza y ahora entiendo por qué algunas chicas no mostraban el debido entusiasmo”, se queja un usuario que ahora planea pasarse a Telegram “siempre que me aseguren que mi polla llega en alta definición”. 
Otros consideran que la compresión de estas imágenes responde al interés de WhatsApp en acabar con el uso de su servicio para fines eróticos. “Nos quitan al negro de WhatsApp, nos recortan centímetros… esta es la verdadera manipulación de la información en plena era digital”, lamenta otra de las usuarias, precisando que “por era digital me refiero al hábito creciente de masturbarse con fotos de este tipo que nos manda la gente por privado”.

17516,Donald Trump’s Economic Nostalgia - The New York Times,"Donald J. Trump went to a suburb of Pittsburgh called Monessen on Tuesday to talk about the steel industry and talk about trade. The mix of location and topic was uniquely appropriate for a major economic speech, though probably not in the way Mr. Trump apparently intended. “Today I am going to talk about how to make America wealthy again,” he said. “We are going to put   steel back into the backbone of our country. This alone will create massive numbers of jobs. ” He’s right that the number of steel industry jobs  —   more precisely “iron and steel mills and ferroalloy manufacturing,” in government    —   is down by 44 percent in the Pittsburgh area since 1990, a span in which the United States entered the North American Free Trade Agreement and engaged in much more extensive trade with China. But two things are worth knowing. Before Nafta was even a gleam in a trade negotiator’s eye, Pittsburgh had already lost the biggest chunk of its steelworking jobs. The culprit in that era was both international competition and the introduction of   which allowed the production of steel with far fewer  . Because of that and other technological innovations that improved productivity, total American steel output is about the same now as it was in 1990, even with far fewer workers. That steep contraction in steel production jobs has been more than counterbalanced by a rise in other types of work. The 5, 100 steel production jobs lost in Pittsburgh are dwarfed by the 66, 000 health care jobs gained in the same time span. Pittsburgh has often been viewed as the very model of a city moving beyond its heavy industrial history to find new prosperity in areas like health care, banking, and professional services. And that shows the fundamental challenge Mr. Trump faces in seeking  —   as he did in Tuesday’s speech  —   to put opposition to trade deals at the center of his economic agenda in the presidential race. The economics of nostalgia may capture the hearts of a certain portion of voters. But it is disconnected from the   direction of the United States economy and the interests of the businesses that are historically a crucial part of the Republican coalition. That shift has been one of the more remarkable turns in what has been a remarkable race. The U. S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers rapidly took to Twitter to blast Mr. Trump’s plans as likely to lead to “higher prices, fewer jobs and a weaker economy,” as the Chamber’s official account put it. There are very real questions about the ways trade deals have sped up a decline in American manufacturing, pumped up trade deficits and pressured wages down across the board. These complaints have been a staple of labor unions and politicians on the left for ages Hillary Clinton has pledged to renegotiate deals to be more favorable to American workers if elected. That’s what makes it striking that  —   rather than temper his   language criticizing trade deals  —   Mr. Trump is, if anything, running to Mrs. Clinton’s left on the subject. He even cited the work of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, in the speech. Notably, these were not    comments, but rather an enumerated platform scripted and read from a teleprompter. But in making the utter rejection of Nafta and normalized trade relations with China central to his campaign, Mr. Trump is evoking a different United States. Since peaking in World War II at 38 percent of all jobs, manufacturing employment has been on a steady downward trajectory almost continuously ever since. Currently 8. 5 percent of American jobs are in manufacturing. Anyone younger than 35 has never lived in a world where more than one in five jobs were in factories. Some of that is surely because of more open trade with places where wages are lower. But it is also because of remarkable advances in technology that mean a huge, gleaming factory making airplane parts or industrial fasteners might need only a dozen workers to keep it running rather than a hundred. America’s economy has kept growing because factory output has risen even as manufacturing employment has fallen. As Mr. Trump faces a general election, the question is how much his message of economic nostalgia will resonate, particularly beyond the older Americans who mourn a lost age. In other words, it’s easy to see why the people who used to work in those 5, 100    steel jobs in the Pittsburgh area might vote for Mr. Trump. But how will he fare with those additional 66, 000 health care workers? The answer may well determine the election, and the course of the United States’s economic relationship with the rest of the world.",0

“I’ve known him for 28 years. The man likes white people, he likes black people, he likes Hispanic people, he plays golf with them. He opened up the first club in Palm Beach that allowed Jewish people, Italian people like me who couldn’t get into those clubs,” he said. 
He went on to explain that Trump has done more for minorities over the last 30 years than many people, pointing out that he has opened facilities for them, hired them and promoted them . He added that Trump promoted the first woman to be the head of a construction company. 
Giuliani then went on to say that it’s Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton who has a problem.   
“She should look in the mirror if she thinks we all have implicit bias. Hillary, I have news for you. I don’t (have bias). Maybe you do. I have no racial guilt. Not a single bit of it, which is why I’m willing to tell the truth about black crime and what has to be done about it,” he said. 
To which Ruhle had no intelligent response. Instead, the host continued to hammer Giuliani about Bannon and Breitbart News. 
The mayor let her know she wasn’t going to get anywhere, and criticized the mainstream media for its bias against Trump . 
“Your station is completely left-wing and totally anti-Trump and totally anti-Republican with one or two exceptions. I’m one of the few Republicans that will come on here, because we don’t think we get anywhere near fair treatment on this station,” he explained.  ",0
17518,The Fear of Having a Son - The New York Times,"When my son, Macallah, was born five years ago, my college students asked how it felt to be a new father. “Terrifying,” I blurted. “All I can think about is bullying. ” Silence and perplexed looks filled the room. “Your child was just born,” a female student said. “I know,” I responded. “But this boy’s going to be raised to feel and express his vulnerability. That’s a curse in this culture. ” What worried me just as much was the   realization: Whatever my wife and I tried to do to shape our son’s masculine identity would compete against such cultural norms as a postured indifference to school, which can lead to lower grades, graduation rates and academic motivation a sports and gaming culture that exalt alpha domination (and aggressive male reflexes) and a   John Wayne ethos that breeds alienation and, too often, depression. All of the dread and loathing I’d always felt about the limiting script of traditional masculine norms came flooding back. I was faced with one of my biggest fears about parenthood: having a son. The common wisdom, as research verifies, is that most men want sons. That’s starting to shift. Some men, like me, fear becoming fathers to sons. At the website for the NPR radio show “On Being,” the writer Courtney E. Martin observes of many younger   and       “I’ve noticed a fascinating trend: They seem to disproportionately desire having a girl instead of a boy. ” An informal Facebook survey she took yielded these results: “I wanted a girl mainly because I felt it was harder to be a boy in today’s society. If I have a boy I will embrace the challenge of raising a boy  …    who can learn the power of vulnerability even as male culture tries to make him see it as weakness. But, frankly, I hope that when I have a second child, it’ll be another girl. ’” This was emblematic of a lot of the responses, which revealed that men felt more confident, or “better equipped,”   “a strong, confident daughter. ” Ms. Martin says that her own husband was relieved to have daughters instead of sons. He says: “‘I haven’t felt like I fit into a lot of the social norms around masculinity  …    . I’m much more interested in the challenge of helping a girl or young woman transcend sexist conditions. It feels more possible and more important, in some ways. ” These sentiments ripple well beyond this small pool of men. Consider, for instance, such blog pieces as “Men Need Daughters More Than They Need Sons” or “Every Guy Thinks He Wants Boys, But Every Guy Should Want Daughters. ” Or: In a 2010 study, economists from the California Institute of Technology, the London School of Economics and New York University discovered, among other things, that adoptive American parents preferred girls to boys by nearly a third. The data was based on more than 800 adoptions that occurred between June 2004 and August 2009. The researchers suggested that this preference for girls might occur because adoptive parents “fear dysfunctional social behavior in adopted children and perceive girls as ‘less risky’ than boys in that respect. ” Adoptive parents are even willing to pay an average of $16, 000 more in finalization costs for a girl than a boy.   couples and single women showed an even greater proclivity for adopting girls.  These preferences weren’t limited to adopting parents. An article in Slate cites a study from the journal Reproductive Biomedicine Online which found that white couples preferentially select females through the increasingly common procedure preimplantation genetic diagnosis 70 percent of the time. (Patients using in vitro fertilization often use this procedure to vet their embryos for genetic abnormalities.) The article also says many fertility doctors observe that 80 percent of patients who are choosing their baby’s gender prefer girls. What few of us seem to realize: The     behavior, which increasingly invites cringing, doesn’t originate with them. In “A New Psychology of Women: Gender, Culture, and Ethnicity,” Hilary M. Lips writes: “  …    parents tend to touch infant boys less often and more roughly than infant daughters and that daughters are handled more gently and protectively. .. ” Research also shows that parents treat sons differently after they’ve suffered injuries than they do daughters, and another study, “Gender and Age Differences in   Emotion Talk,” reveals that mothers use more emotional language with   daughters than they do with comparably aged sons. This imbalanced,     is part of our legacy because children ape the attitudes of the parent whose gender matches their own. In a Time magazine article about this study, Harriet Tenenbaum, a   observes, “Most parents say they want boys to be more expressive but don’t know [they] are speaking differently to them  …    . These are learned stereotypes and we are reinforcing them as a society. ” The good news for boys is that men with a high emotional intelligence quotient don’t hand down these values. The bad news: Pressure from an unexpected corner makes such men   their desire to embrace boys, not to mention their own emotional sensitivity. A blogger on Vice, Chelsea G. Summers, thrills at how “misandry”  —   hatred of men  —   has become “chic. ” She gushes that, in addition to a political agenda, this blanket antipathy promises some “great pop culture. ” This has manifested itself, among other ways, through blogs and online essays and tweets that pillory and mock the growing trend of men crying  —   which, I know from my own and other men’s experience, can be the single act that most liberates and heals a painful past that devalues masculine sensitivity. Paradoxically, for some men, the   feminism they embrace   them into muting the very sensitivity and empathy that opened their eyes to women’s plight. Is it any wonder that some of us want little, if anything, to do with raising boys? The subtext bombarding us from many sides ultimately encourages us to abandon them, even as they founder beneath the chop of a changing world for which they lack the buoyancy. Yet men like me abdicate our responsibility by letting other men  —   the ones who don’t always encourage the broader, deeper humanity within males  —   raise boys. And we deprive ourselves of the opportunity to heal old wounds. Of course we should empower our daughters, because gross inequality still exists. And, despite the callous, increasingly callow, pushback, we should empower boys  —   with the same emotional literacy skill set and expansive worldview we teach our daughters. It’s what they, and we, ultimately need. Recently, I sent Macallah, now 5, to his room after he ignored my repeated requests to stop yelling and throwing his toys. More than even his dismissal, what bothered me was what many people refer to as “boy energy. ” It’s a reactive, sometimes destructive, force that unnerved me even as a child. Then I heard the voice of my wife, Liz, in my head: “He only wants your attention. Boys don’t always know how to ask for what they want. ” I found Macallah in his room, repeating the same behavior. I took a deep breath. “Were you upset because I wasn’t paying attention to you?” I asked. Head and eyes downcast, he nodded. I bent down and hugged him, then looked at him. “It’s important that you learn to tell Mama and me what you need  —   sometimes that means telling us what you’re feeling inside, understand?” He nodded. “You do it,” I said. “Tell me what you really wanted. ” He shrugged, still looking down. “You to pay attention to me,” he said. He threw his arms around my waist, leaning his head into me. I didn’t need words to know what filled my young son: He felt wanted.",0
17519,Pres. Obama RUTHLESSLY Trolls Trump After His Own Campaign GROUNDS Him From Twitter (VIDEO),"Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr 
On Sunday, President Barack Obama was on the campaign trail stumping for Hillary Clinton in Florida when he started brutally mocking Donald Trump upon learning that his campaign may have taken away his Twitter account in the final days leading up to the election. 
The president couldn’t help himself; he just had to go after the man who he characterized as being too immature to step into his job. 
“Apparently his campaign has taken away his Twitter,” Obama said during a Florida rally for Hillary Clinton , to laughs. 
The president then used humor to make a point to remind everyone of just what was at stake in this election. “In the last two days, they had so little confidence in his self control, they said: ‘We’re just going to take away your Twitter.’ Now, if somebody cant handle a Twitter account, they can’t handle the nuclear code,” Obama continued. “If somebody starts tweeting at three in the morning because SNL made fun of you, then you can’t handle the nuclear codes.” 
On Sunday, the New York Times reported that Trump no longer controls his Twitter account. Instead, the Republican nominee appears to have aides creating “Trump safe” messages on his behalf while he focuses his energy on whining and lying at his live rallies. 
During the rally in the battleground state of Florida, Obama labeled Trump as being “uniquely unqualified” and “temperamentally unfit” to serve as Commander-in-Chief. “I’ve been in this office now almost eight years and here’s what I can tell you,” Obama said. “Who you are, what you are, does not change when you take office. It just magnifies who you are. It just shines a spotlight on who are you.” Every day there’s another example of how much of a complete joke Trump’s campaign has been over the past year. But as much as we would love to laugh at this clown, we must first make sure he doesn’t get elected. Or else the joke’s on us.

17520,"Brooklyn, Can You Hear Her? Barbra Streisand Still Sounds Amazing. - The New York Times","I know what you’re thinking. So let’s just get it out of the way: Like buttah. Like satin. Like whatever that perfume is that Elizabeth Taylor hawked. Oh, right: White Diamonds. Barbra Streisand sounded like diamonds. And porcelain and a freshly drawn bath and consommé. The voice is 74. So maybe the carats are fewer, but so what? It remains The Voice. Thursday night at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, it never asked to be received in pity, graded on a curve or helped across the street. There was some nervousness beforehand that it would be somehow   …     off. But no: On, on, on. For example, its owner continues to make the finale of “Don’t Rain on My Parade” sound like a space shuttle leaving Earth, the gravitational force enough to yank what looked like a   crowd to its feet. That came well into the second act during a “Funny Girl” “Funny Lady” stretch, in which Ms. Streisand walked us through the films’ plots, while movie clips played on screen behind her. We didn’t need any of that, but it made a kind of sense. This wasn’t a star doing battle with a former self. It was a woman having fun with the past. Backed by an elastic band and aided by teleprompters, she spent a lot of her more than two hours onstage explaining the stories behind songs and performances and album covers. Her “A Star Is Born” soundtrack  —   the   movie of 1976, by the way  —   has that great image of a shirtless Kris Kristofferson palming the head of a shirtless Ms. Streisand, their mouths almost meeting, their hunger mutual. Staring up at that cover, she said, “If you’re wondering what I was wearing during this shoot, it was musk. ” For well north of two hours, Ms. Streisand was like that: amusing,   at home. Before her encore, she chided us for keeping us from her dinner: “My pizza’s getting cold!” People would shout compliments or requests, and she’d talk back. Early on, after “Everything,” from “A Star Is Born,” she said, “There’s just one more thing I want”  —   which turned into an endorsement for Hillary Clinton’s presidential candidacy. Before doing “Pure Imagination,” Gene Wilder’s song from “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,” she offered environmental entreaties that made you think she was going to do “Mercy Mercy Me” instead. When it was over, she said, “And that’s why we shouldn’t vote for someone who believes climate change is a hoax,” referring, presumably, to Mrs. Clinton’s opponent, Donald J. Trump. So the arena became Ms. Streisand’s living room, her audience became guests, and stage patter sometimes took cozy TED Talk turns. Meanwhile, the people in the front rows leapt up so often it was fair to ask whether she was delivering a State of the Union speech too. Ms. Streisand sang about two dozen songs  —   the ones you’d expect (“People,” “Evergreen,” lots of Stephen Sondheim) and a few, like “Pure Imagination,” which you wouldn’t. That one is on her new duets record, “Encore,” which comes out later this month and has her singing with stars from Melissa McCarthy and Anne Hathaway to Antonio Banderas and Chris Pine. (Her partner on “Pure Imagination” is Seth MacFarlane.) Ms. Streisand introduced a little highlight reel from those recording sessions and eventually unveiled the actor Patrick Wilson to accompany her on “Loving You” from Mr. Sondheim’s “Passion,” a number that required some acting from Mr. Wilson. He had to play both an ambivalent lover and a man who made perfect sense belting opposite Ms. Streisand. Mission accomplished. Whatever awe he had, he kept tucked away along with the tie he didn’t wear with his black suit. Jamie Foxx arrived a few songs later, all awe. The crowd went cuckoo for him, and he went cuckoo for her, partly while impersonating Quincy Jones paying Ms. Streisand’s derrière a hilarious compliment. They sang “Climb Ev’ry Mountain” in a way that was more muscular than beautiful, their clasped hands making a better connection than their voices. The climb has rarely sounded so literal. But when they got to the top, the audience got up to cheer for them. So what was this show? I mean, besides a pleasure to behold. Officially, it’s part of a   tour with a mouthful of a title, “Barbra: The Music  …     the Mem’ries  …     the Magic! ,” that salutes six decades of albums. (“Encore” is her 35th studio record.) So in many ways this is a celebration of endurance, as opposed to a night of camp or even campiness. You need an “I’m Still Here” or “Have I Stayed Too Long at the Fair” for that, songs that would have been the equivalent of that thing Hulk Hogan would do where he’d put his hand to his ear so we would cheer louder to amplify his triumph. Have I stayed too long? No, Barbra. Absolutely not! She really is too dignified to beg. As it was, she included “No More Tears (Enough Is Enough),” the torch song she sang with Donna Summer, which   into a disco anthem. That came last in a medley that included “Stoney End” and “Woman in Love,” and Ms. Streisand mostly vamped while her three very good backup vocalists did their thing at her side. Ms. Streisand has had a career like nobody else’s. She remains this emblem of volition and charisma and power  —   the movie star who sings, the singer who acts, the female director who was made to suffer for daring to do what men had always done. She could have spent the night doing nothing but   and no one would have minded. But it’s funny: You don’t go to a Streisand show purely for nostalgia, purely for “The Way We Were,” as much as to witness a great performer in her current formidable state. Nostalgia has always been built into her catalog. But can she make the distant past vital again? She tried to connect before to now. Her antidote to Mr. Trump, for instance, was “People. ” Which is to say that it’s not an artistically ambitious show. Its star, alas, is set in her ways. But those ways are what some people expect to see. We are at a new place with superstardom and age, though. Certain women of the    era can now seemingly go on forever. Their fame, in part, resides with an instrument that’s been kept in astounding shape. Some of the nation is still recovering from Aretha Franklin’s shedding a fur coat and bringing down the house in January at the Kennedy Center Honors. She and Ms. Streisand were born a month apart, and this sort of sustained virtuosity feels special among singers of their stature. Neither is the master of phrasing she once was. But what they now lack in contour (Ms. Streisand has even acquired a touch of Ms. Franklin’s rasp) they make up for in dynamism. These two very different women are still giving everything they’ve got. And that’s enough. We came to Barclays to hear amazement as opposed to see a spectacle. Although the sight of Ms. Streisand singing “Papa, Can You Hear Me” from “Yentl” while appearing to catch the holy spirit, before the end of the first act, was quite something. The power she summoned pimpled the skin and dampened the eyes. I don’t know if Papa could hear this woman, but certainly heaven could.",0
17521,"At Euro 2016 Final, Portugal Loses Ronaldo but Defeats France - The New York Times","ST.  France  —   Cristiano Ronaldo was crying, his chest heaving, his knee throbbing, his heart aching like never before. Ronaldo, prone on the turf, sat up slowly and did what he surely never imagined having to do in a game like this: He wrapped his captain’s armband around a teammate as his eyes clouded over. Then he lay back, shimmied onto a stretcher and was carried to the locker room. That moment, just 24 minutes into the final of the European Championships at the Stade de France, felt critical. One of the biggest stars in the sport going off after less than half an hour? It was the sort of twist that can  —   that should  —   define an entire match. And it did. Portugal, faced with the loss of its leader and its motor and its man who is always in lights, did not wither or wilt or wobble. Instead, the Portuguese dug in, carried the match into extra time and  —   with Ronaldo hobbling up and down the sideline  —   stunned France with a goal in the 109th minute, beating the hosts,   to claim Portugal’s first major soccer trophy. “We said we would win it for him,” Pepe, the Portuguese defender, said of Ronaldo. Pepe grinned. “And we just managed to win it for him. ” They did, though it was far from pretty. Portugal’s run at this tournament was strange: It tied all three of its   games, finishing in third place in its group (behind Hungary and Iceland) but in this first Euros of 24 teams, it qualified for the round of 16 anyway. Then, after a late goal by Iceland in its final group game shunted Portugal to the opposite side of the draw away from juggernauts like Italy, Spain, England, France and Germany, it edged past Croatia in extra time, beat Poland in a nervy penalty shootout and knocked off Wales in the semifinals  —   its only win in regulation of the tournament  —   before pulling off the shocker on Sunday. Critics will say Portugal was far from entertaining. The team led for only 73 minutes of the 720 it played at this event, but the results were undeniable. Even without Ronaldo, Portugal never faltered. “It defies description it could be a Hollywood movie,” Portugal’s José Fonte said afterward. “We’ve written our names down in history. ” At the final whistle, while Portugal’s players piled on one another in celebration, the French players sank to the turf. For a country still recovering from the terrorist attacks last November and enduring nationwide flooding as well as constant worker strikes, the Euros were seen as a chance to celebrate something grand together. To smile. In the end, there was, perhaps, a surface satisfaction: The tournament was run smoothly, security was largely effective and there were no major incidents, but the lingering feeling for the French will be the disappointment of falling just short. France had plenty of chances on Sunday, too, including one at the end of regulation when   Gignac hit the post. Yet there was no precision, no bite, as France showed in its semifinal victory over Germany. Antoine Griezmann, who was France’s star and scored a   six goals over the last month, struggled to make an impact and missed an open header from 6 yards out with his best chance of the game. “Football can be very cruel,” France’s captain, Hugo Lloris, said. “The overriding emotion is a lot of sadness. ” Adding to that was most likely the notion that this was an opportunity missed because of the void left by Ronaldo, who was barely on the field at all. Just eight minutes into the match, France’s Dimitri Payet poked the ball away from him with one foot while Payet’s trailing leg crashed into the side of Ronaldo’s left knee. Ronaldo crumpled immediately. No foul was called, and few players from Portugal protested, but the damage was clear. Ronaldo received treatment and tried to return to the field but went down again a few minutes later. Then, after another discussion with the trainers (and with his leg wrapped) he tried to play once more before, ultimately, sinking to the ground a final time. Twelve years ago, Ronaldo cried on the field after Portugal was shocked by Greece,   in the final of its own home Euros in Lisbon. Ever since, he had spoken of trying to deliver to Portugal that   glory, and having finally reached the precipice again, he broke down once it was clear that he would not be able to see it through. “It was unfortunate,” Ronaldo said. “But I always believed that these players, together with the coach’s strategy, would be strong enough. ” They were. Fernando Santos, the Portugal coach, took over the team in 2014, and after losing his first match in charge to France, in this stadium in an exhibition, Santos told the players that their goal should be to return here for this final. That statement stuck. And even once Ronaldo exited, Santos made all the right decisions, shifting Portugal’s formation to stifle France’s attack and, later, bringing on Éder  —   a forward who is often criticized for inconsistent play  —   who delivered the   goal. With France pushing forward to try to score in extra time, there was an opening for Portugal, and Éder slid to his right just outside the penalty area. With a sliver of space, he unleashed a wicked shot from about 25 yards out that whizzed past Lloris’s hand and rippled the net in front of the Portuguese fans. “We knew we could surprise them at any moment,” Éder said. “So that’s what we did. ” The final 10 minutes were frantic. Ronaldo, who returned to the bench in sneakers and a bulky knee brace just before extra time, waved his arms and shouted at his teammates as the seconds ticked away. Once the celebrations began, Nani, the vice captain, ran up to him and returned the captain’s armband as Ronaldo welled up again. The French trudged up to receive their silver medals. The Portuguese fans never stopped singing. Ronaldo joined his teammates on the dais and, gingerly, stepped to the front to raise the trophy as fireworks and streamers and sparklers lit up the night. Then the Portuguese players returned to the field and gathered for a team photo. Ronaldo shuffled to the center and sprawled out in front. Hours earlier, he had lain nearby, tears running down his cheeks. This time, as the flashbulbs flickered and the trophy gleamed, he lay back again with his face aglow.",0
17522,Trump’s Call with Taiwan: A Diplomatic Gaffe or a New Start? - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —     Donald J. Trump’s motives for his unorthodox call with the leader of Taiwan remain mysterious, but some Republicans are hailing his improvisational diplomacy as a refreshing break with diplomatic rituals that date to the Richard M. Nixon administration. It could lay the groundwork, they say, for a healthier relationship with China. The question, as often with Mr. Trump, is whether he will have the discipline to see through these changes. In short, was the phone call the start of a calculated policy, or was it merely a   gesture that will alienate China and leave Taiwan even more isolated? So far the messages from the Trump camp are mixed. Vice   Mike Pence insisted on Sunday that people were reading too much into the conversation with President Tsai   and that Mr. Trump was simply accepting congratulations from the “democratically elected leader of Taiwan. ” But people advising the transition say Mr. Trump knew exactly what he was doing. Certainly, the   has done nothing to defuse the tensions stirred by the call. A string of vituperative Twitter posts by Mr. Trump over the weekend on China’s trade and military policies has fanned questions about whether he wants to reset the relationship with Beijing more fundamentally. But there is no dispute that several people involved in the Trump campaign have long favored opening more formal channels between the United States and Taiwan as a way to put pressure on China. And Republicans being considered for top jobs applaud what they view as Mr. Trump’s determination to use Taiwan as a chip in a geopolitical contest with China. “He’s the first president since the Shanghai Communique who provides an opportunity to look fresh at the   relationship,” said Jon M. Huntsman Jr. who served as ambassador to China under President Obama. Mr. Huntsman was referring to the 1972 statement, issued after Nixon’s visit to China, which sharply constrained America’s dealings with Taiwan. Mr. Huntsman’s name has recently surfaced as a candidate for secretary of state, along with that of John R. Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush. Mr. Bolton met with Mr. Trump on the day he took the phone call from Ms. Tsai. Later, he said the United States “should shake up the relationship” with China. Mr. Trump himself seemed to take umbrage at the suggestion that he needed China’s approval to speak with Ms. Tsai. In two posts on Twitter, he wrote: “Did China ask us if it was O. K. to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete) heavily tax our products going into their country (the U. S. doesn’t tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea? I don’t think so!” After an initial relatively mild response, China stiffened its protests of Mr. Trump’s freewheeling diplomacy. The Chinese warned Mr. Trump, in a   editorial in the overseas edition of People’s Daily, that “creating troubles for the  . S. relationship is creating troubles for the U. S. itself. ” China often uses the overseas edition of People’s Daily to   major policy pronouncements. In a pointed rejoinder to Mr. Trump, the editorial said that pushing China on Taiwan “would greatly reduce the chance to achieve the goal of making America great again. ” By going after China’s policies on trade and security, however, Mr. Trump appeared to be confirming his intent to take a tougher line with the Chinese leadership across a broader range of issues  —   and further dampened hopes in Beijing that he might step back from the campaign rhetoric he has used, including threats of punishing trade tariffs. Such a stance would reflect his foreign policy advisers, who have criticized the Obama administration for being weak toward Beijing. Alex Grey, a member of Mr. Trump’s State Department transition team, wrote an article, with another Trump adviser, Peter Navarro, in Foreign Policy magazine last month in which he described Mr. Obama’s treatment of Taiwan as “egregious. ” “This beacon of democracy in Asia is perhaps the most militarily vulnerable U. S. partner anywhere in the world,” Mr. Grey and Mr. Navarro wrote, declaring that the island needed a “comprehensive arms deal” with the United States to “deter China’s covetous gaze. ” Reince Priebus, Mr. Trump’s designated chief of staff, also has a history with Taiwan. In October 2015, he met with Ms. Tsai in Taipei as part of a delegation from the Republican National Committee. After Mr. Trump selected Mr. Priebus, Taiwan’s foreign minister, David Lee, told a legislative session that the appointment was “good news for Taiwan. ”   groups in Washington played down their role in orchestrating the call. But they welcomed it as a step to restore balance in the   relationship between Washington, Beijing and Taipei. They also said it need not provoke a confrontation with China. “It’s absurd that we talk about going to war with China to defend Taiwan, and our presidents can’t talk to each other,” said Randall Schriver, the chief executive of the Project 2049 Institute, a Washington think tank that favors closer American ties with Taiwan. “The Chinese understand this,” Mr. Schriver continued. “They don’t want to see their efforts to isolate Taiwan rolled back, but they also don’t want a bad relationship with the U. S. ” Other China experts said they saw value in Mr. Trump’s desire to rethink old diplomatic protocols. As Mr. Trump has observed, it is difficult to explain to ordinary people why the United States sells advanced weapons to Taiwan but the leaders cannot speak to each other. Some China scholars say it is not clear the policy serves the United States all that well  —   nor is it clear that Beijing would not learn to live with a closer American relationship with Taiwan. The trouble, said some, is that Mr. Trump needlessly antagonized China by trumpeting the phone call and then following it up with a series of defiant tweets. “It’s not the phone call that’s the problem it’s the making it public that’s the problem,” said Shelley Rigger, a professor of political science at Davidson College who specializes in Taiwan. That could put President Xi Jinping in a difficult position, forced to choose between playing down Mr. Trump’s attacks and risking a backlash at home, or raising the stakes by pushing back more forcefully and setting China on a potential collision course with the United States. The Chinese government’s initial reaction to Mr. Trump’s call has already drawn a torrent of criticism on social media from Chinese who complained that it was not tough enough. The statement from the foreign minister, Wang Yi, which was relatively low key, given the unprecedented nature of the call, refrained from criticizing Mr. Trump, instead accusing Taiwan of playing a “little trick” on the  . That offered Mr. Trump a   way out of the imbroglio, and a chance to  . But the messages he posted on Twitter late Sunday stepped up the pressure on China’s leaders instead. “Mr. Trump’s tweets and actions appear to be more than a symbolic act,” said James E. Fanell, a former director of intelligence and information operations for the United States Pacific Fleet. “This will upset Beijing, but it is going to remind the rest of the   Pacific region that the new administration is not going to be fettered by the past. ” Some Chinese analysts see Mr. Trump as striking out on a starkly different path from Mr. Obama’s, determined to strenuously compete with China on economic issues. But mindful of his career as a negotiator, some view last week’s moves optimistically as an opening gambit. “By showing strength at the beginning, he may hope to gain advantages in bargaining later with the Chinese,” said Zhang Baohui, a professor of international relations at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. “He is a businessman, and he could be bringing his business bargaining tactics to interstate relations. ”",0
17523,Donald Trump Celebrates House Vote for Obamacare Replacement: ’It’s Essentially Dead’ - Breitbart,"President Donald Trump celebrated the House vote to replace Obamacare on Thursday, bringing House Republicans to the White House to talk about their victory. [Trump spoke about how he traveled the country during the presidential election and heard everyone’s complaints about Obamacare.  “It’s been a catastrophe,” Trump said, describing Obamacare as “essentially dead. ” House Republicans finally passed their version legislation this afternoon and immediately boarded buses that transported them to the White House. Trump praised the plan with dozens of House Republicans in the Rose Garden, who laughed and celebrated with the president. “It’s a great plan,” Trump said, assuring Americans that premiums and deductibles would start coming down. “This is a repeal and replace of Obamacare, make no mistake,” Trump also appeared optimistic that the bill would succeed in the Senate. “We’re going to get this passed through the Senate,” he said. “I feel so confident. ” Trump and his aides spoke with Speaker Paul Ryan privately in the Oval Office before the statement as House Republicans stood in the Rose Garden. He thanked Ryan during his speech, “I want to thank Speaker Ryan, he has worked so hard,” Trump said, congratulating him for a “job well done” in getting the bill passed. Ryan also thanked Trump for his leadership in pushing the bill across the finish line. Vice President Mike Pence was also present and introduced Trump at the beginning of the event. “Thanks to the leadership of President Donald Trump, welcome to the beginning of the end of Obamacare,” he said.

17524,Reason of WHY the FBI reopened Clinton Investigation Decoded,"
Some of you may wonder and ask yourselves WHY has the FBI reopened the the Clinton email case. Anthony Weiner is just the surface reason.
FBI Director James Comey saw the mutiny within the FBI with many FBI agents revolting over his decision not to prosecute Hillary Clinton back in July 2016.
So here’s the bombshell: Comey decided to reopen Hillary’s email investigation because he is fearing that he will get arrested and put behind bars for corruption and collusion in case Donald Trump wins.
He reopened the case, to create an escape route in case Trump wins. Its quite simple actually. James Comey did not provide any recent proof he stumbled upon and neither will he until the election is over. Yes he’s technically not allowed to but he could just indict Hillary in a second if he truly wanted just for lying to the FBI or wiping the server to get rid of all the evidence after receiving a congressional subpoena.
So if Hillary Clinton wins, Comey will simply close the case and declare that nothing was substantial after all and she dust made a mistake, just like he did before.
If Donald Trump wins, he will finalize the investigation and put Hillary Clinton behind bars, then he will tell Donald Trump: “See? I was fair and I wasn’t corrupt! I DID arrest her after all and I did my job!” hoping to get away with what he did during the first investigation.
Make no mistake about it, this isn’t coincidence, Comey surely fears Trump’s retribution, the decision to reopen the investigation came just 1 single day after Trump called the FBI corrupt and called for a reopening of the investigation, see for yourself .
Trump is pretty tolerant guy so this may actually work out for Comey. He wrongfully forgave many people! For example, after having an conflict with Paul Ryan refusing to endorse Trump back in the primaries, Trump finally decided to forgive Ryan and ENDORSE him right before the Wisconsin congress elections. If Trump wasn’t soft regarding some of those traitors, he would have endorsed Paul Nehlen instead but he didn’t and it was a mistake as we now know.
Comey however will have to look authentic though and he will have to prove to Trump BEFORE the elections that he is truly on to something and that this isn’t just a political move. Don’t expect for Comey to go to hard because he’s well aware that if he goes too hard on Queen of the Underworld Hillary and she wins, then he will rot in jail for the rest of his life because Hillary is the revengeful type.
Just to prove the case that she is revengeful, look at what she did after Trump slammed Bill Clinton as a rapist during the 2nd debate. Before the 3rd debate even started, she paid a couple of skanks to go out and publically lie, falsely accuse Trump of raping and groping them. During the 2nd debate she was looking at Trump with hatred while he was speaking and she was looking like she was thinking to herself things similar to this: “Ohh yeah? F**k you! Wait till you see what I’ll do to you next time! You’re gonna regret this!” And YES she was even seen on live TV telling Trump “F**k you!” during the 2nd debate . Hillary was infuriated because Trump brought Bill’s rape victims up during that debate, but most people didn’t catch it! She was clearly infuriated and already plotting revenge in her mind.
So with that said, don’t expect Hillary Clinton to get indicted BEFORE the election. It’s not gonna happen. Comey is a weasel appointed by Obama. Basically he’s a Democrat. The funny thing is that even though he’s a Democrat in disguise, fellow Democrats are already calling Comey “traitor”, “Russian agent” and “Putin puppet” on Twitter . Everyone who disagrees with them must be a Russian agent these days. They really love their conspiracy theories. After all isn’t John Podesta interested in aliens, UFOs and Area 51? You can’t make this stuff up. Really funny stuff to watch those crazy liberals going full psycho.
But even if Comey is playing on the safe side with both candidates, Hillary would definitely sink her fangs into his neck for reopening the case, should she win. Even if he does NOTHING and just closes the case after a Hillary victory, she would still take her revenge. It’s in her character, she’s revengeful and besides its a classic mafia tactic, leave no traitor alive or among your ranks. She would at the very least replace him.
Additionally Comey wanted to calm down an FBI which was facing a full pitchfork revolution from within with many agents being angered by this. Jill McCabe, the wife of the FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe who investigated Hillary Clinton, received a $675.000 “donation” (bribe) from Hillary Clinton. The agents were angry. So this move to reopen the case was also strategic with his agents. It will calm the waters down for a while. If Hillary wins he will just tell the agents to go F themselves and look for a another job if they don’t like it, if Trump wins and Comey indicts Hillary after the election, the other agents will be pleased.
Hillary probably has something on Comey on which she could blackmail him with but it won’t matter because IF he will do his job and arrest Hillary shortly after the election, Trump will be pleased and keep him on as the director.
James Comey would prefer Hillary to win though because that’s why he didn’t indict her during the first investigation, but he’s gotta defend his ass by preparing for a different scenario, like a Trump victory so that’s exactly why he reopened the investigation now.
Trump will win in a landslide and Comey will most likely be fine should he prove himself worthy before the election and actually do something.
Expect more of those two-faced people to come out and do the same in the next days. Expect event he likes of CNN, New York Times to stop bashing Trump as everyone will have to prepare for the possibility of a Trump victory, out of fear of a huge retribution in case they don’t change. Remember those libel laws CNN?

17526,Early Voting Data Shows African American Turnout Dropping,"Early Voting Data Shows African American Turnout Dropping Neil Munro, Breitbart, October 31, 2016 
A blizzard of early reports show that early voting by pro-Democratic African-Americans has dropped significantly compared to 2012, giving a boost to Donald Trump’s prospects in critical swing-states, such as North Carolina and Ohio. 
In North Carolina, early voting by African-Americans is sharply down, so “you will see a very heavy push in this state for the African-American vote by Hilary Clinton to try to make up some of deficit,” said Michael Bitzer, a professor of politics and history at Catawba College, in Salisbury, N.C. 
{snip} 
Nationally, “African-American enthusiasm has dipped compared with that in 2012,” according to the New York Times . That’s “a surprising and disquieting development for Democrats who believed Trump’s racial appeals and flirtations with the birther movement would generate more urgency,” the Times reported . For example, in the two Virginia districts with the largest percentage of African American adults, early voting has dropped by more than 50 percent, the Times said. 
In Ohio, the decline of early voting in heavily Democratic African-American districts is causing worry for Democrats–and a shift of resources into the low-turnout areas. {snip} 
In Florida, “the bad news for Clinton/good news for Trump is that African-Americans and millenials are voting considerably lighter–so far–than four years ago,” the Tampa Bay Times reported Oct. 31. 
Daniel Smith, a political science professor in Florida noted the rising level of early voting among whites and Hispanics, compared to to African-Americans. 
In North Carolina, “white voters are currently 72 percent of all absentee ballots cast, with black voters being 22 percent and all other races 6 percent. This represents a steady continuation of the trends that we have seen, with white voters over-performing their 2012 numbers and black voters under-performing their 2012 numbers,” Blitzer said at his blog, Old North State Politics .

[Bannon broke the agenda down into three categories. pointing to economic nationalism, national sovereignty, and the deconstruction of the administrative state.  Part of restoring American sovereignty, Bannon explained, was fixing and improving intelligence, the defense department, and homeland security. Economic nationalism would focus on restoring American prominence in trade and commerce  —   “rethinking” how to reconstruct trade deals around the world to favor America first, he said. The most important two minutes of Steve Bannon’s CPAC speech  &gt pic. twitter.   —   Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) February 23, 2017,  Bannon explained that the Trump administration and Congress were already working together to focus on bilateral trade deals with other countries, especially after pulling out of the Trans Pacific Partnership. The goal, he said, was to make America a “fair trading nation” and bring more high paying jobs into America. The CPAC audience applauded and cheered when Bannon spoke of the deconstruction of the administrative state, cutting cabinet agency regulations that were choking business growth. “The way the progressive left runs is that if they can’t get it passed, they’re just going to put it in some sort of regulation in an agency,” he said. “That’s all going to be deconstructed. ”",0
17528,Detroit Judge Throws Drunk Driver’s Mother Out of Court,"A Detroit judge threw the mother of a drunk driver being sentenced for killing a man out of her courtroom and into jail after she laughed at the victim’s family during a statement from the victim’s sister. [VIDEO: Drunk Driver’s Mom Jailed for Laughing at Victim’s Family,  Amanda Kosal, 25, was awaiting sentencing when Judge Qiana Lillard threw Donna Kosal and her boyfriend out of the courtroom, calling them “clowns” after the victim’s sister gave a statement to the court, the Daily Mail reported. The video showed the judge losing patience with Donna and her boyfriend after she caught them smirking. The judge later brought the mother back in and sentenced her to 93 days in jail for contempt of court. Amanda Kosal pleaded guilty to killing    Jerome Zirker and severely injuring his    fiancee Brittany Johnson. She was sentenced to three to 15 years in prison. Judge Lillard said Donna Kosal and an unidentified boyfriend were acting disrespectfully in the courtroom. “It’s time for him to go,” Judge Lillard said, looking out into the gallery. “And I don’t know who he is, but whoever can sit here at a tragic moment like this and laugh and smile when somebody has lost a family member  …     in the entire time that Mr. Zirker’s sister was speaking that clown, and that’s what I am going to call him, a clown, was sitting there smiling and laughing. ” A guard escorted the man from the room, and Judge Lillard addressed Donna. “You can go too because if you don’t know how to act, you can go to jail, so leave,” she said. When Judge Lillard brought Donna back in, they exchanged a few words and the judge motioned to the bailiffs to take Donna to jail. “Take her, she’s going in the back,” the judge said to the bailiffs. “Anybody else wanna go? You can go, too. ” Donna said something   about the judge’s mouth, to which the judge replied, “Oh, my mouth? Well, thank you, your mouth got you 93 days,” the New York Post reported. The next day, Donna appeared before the judge, and apologized for what she did. “I deeply apologize for what I did. I was under a lot of stress,” Donna said to the judge. The judge took pity on her and reduced her sentence by 92 days, setting her free. Amanda’s vehicle slammed into Johnson and Zirker head on, crossing the center line.

17529,Trump Tells South Korea That Alliance With U.S. Is ‘Ironclad’ - The New York Times,"SEOUL, South Korea  —   President Trump assured South Korea’s acting president on Monday of the United States’ “ironclad” commitment to defend the country, agreeing with Seoul to strengthen joint defense capabilities against North Korea. Mr. Trump’s assurances came amid anxiety in South Korea over the future of the alliance with the United States. During his campaign, Mr. Trump cast some doubt on the United States’ defense and trade commitments, saying that South Korea was not paying enough to help keep 28, 500 American troops in the country. But speaking by phone to Hwang   the acting president of South Korea, Mr. Trump said that the coming visit to South Korea by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis reflected the close friendship of the two countries and the importance of their alliance. Mr. Mattis is scheduled to visit South Korea on Thursday on his first official trip abroad, which also includes a stop in Japan. “President Trump reiterated our ironclad commitment to defend the R. O. K. including through the provision of extended deterrence, using the full range of military capabilities,” the White House said in a statement after Mr. Trump’s phone conversation with Mr. Hwang, using the initials for South Korea’s official name, the Republic of Korea. “The two leaders agreed to take steps to strengthen joint defense capabilities to defend against the North Korean threat. ” Mr. Hwang’s office quoted Mr. Trump as saying that the United States would cooperate with South Korea “100 percent” and that bilateral relations would be “better than ever before. ” The two leaders shared the need for firm action to persuade North Korea to rethink its nuclear weapons development program and vowed to respond strongly if the North attempted military provocations, it said. Mr. Trump’s call with Mr. Hwang followed North Korea’s recent warnings that it could conduct its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile “anytime and anywhere,” in a rebuke to Mr. Trump. Although North Korea has vowed to develop the ability to attack the United States with nuclear warheads and has tested missiles that can cover the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity, it has never tested a   missile that could fly over the Pacific. In a New Year’s Day speech, Kim   North Korea’s leader, said his country had reached a “final stage” in preparing to test an intercontinental ballistic missile. The next day Mr. Trump said in a Twitter post, “It won’t happen!” It remains unclear how close North Korea is to building a reliable intercontinental ballistic missile, although North Korea has boasted of successfully testing crucial technology in the past year, such as   engines and heat shields for such a missile. Mr. Hwang, the prime minister of South Korea, is serving as acting president because President Park  ’s powers were suspended after the country’s Parliament voted to impeach her in December on charges of corruption and abuse of power. The Constitutional Court of South Korea is expected to decide in the coming weeks whether to formally end her presidency or reinstate her.",0

17532,Iraq Protesters Leave Baghdad Green Zone on Cleric’s Order - The New York Times,"BAGHDAD  —   After a day of sleeping, praying and even swimming in the Green Zone, the government citadel historically off limits to ordinary Iraqis, protesters began leaving Sunday evening on orders from the man who had sent them: Moktada   the influential Shiite cleric. In a statement issued from the holy city of Najaf in southern Iraq, Mr. Sadr directed his followers to leave the Green Zone in an orderly fashion, to chant for Iraq and not a sect, and to help clean the space they had occupied. A day earlier, hundreds of protesters demanding an end to corruption stormed the fortified Green Zone in dramatic scenes that hinted at revolution. But by Sunday evening the episode had become something less: an affirmation of Mr. Sadr’s sway over the street, but one aimed at pressuring the government to enact promised reforms rather than bringing it down. The question in the days ahead is whether Prime Minister Haider   who is Shiite, and the rest of Iraq’s ruling elite can come together to form a new cabinet of capable ministers, and not loyalists to a party or sect, something that Mr. Sadr has demanded and Mr. Abadi has promised. Since announcing last summer a set of measures to improve governance, Mr. Abadi has been thwarted repeatedly by parties and politicians who have long depended on Iraq’s system of patronage. They include the previous prime minister, Nuri Kamal  . The protests, which had been percolating for weeks and culminated on Saturday with the breaching of the Green Zone walls, were organized as a show of support for the promised changes. On Sunday, Mr. Abadi’s office distributed photographs of him surveying the hall of Parliament, surrounded by broken glass and damaged furniture. A statement also said the prime minister had ordered the arrests of those who had attacked lawmakers or damaged property. Later, Mr. Abadi met with President Fuad Masum and Salim   the speaker of Parliament. In a joint statement, the leaders said they condemned the storming of Parliament, and promised to continue meeting over the next days to “assure progress in reforming the political process. ” In his statement, Mr. Sadr demanded that Parliament meet soon and approve a new cabinet. If not, he said, he will push for the disbanding of the government and call for early elections. Mr. Sadr said the departure of his followers from the Green Zone had been done out of “respect” for a Shiite pilgrimage underway, and he vowed that they would return to the streets on Friday, typically the day of protest in Iraq. Inside the Green Zone on Sunday, protesters who had spent the night in an area called Celebration Square, once a parade ground for Saddam Hussein, seemed to luxuriate in having reached a space long forbidden to them. For many it is a place that has symbolized corruption and dysfunction. “I used to hear about the Green Zone and used to ask myself and my friends, ‘What does the Green Zone mean?’ ” said Ali Mustafa, 21, a college student. “Entering the Green Zone was like a dream for me. ” Diyab Abdullah, 74, who described himself as a member of the Communist Party, which decades ago had a foothold in Iraqi politics, said he had walked four hours on Saturday to participate in the protest. “I did not get tired, because my goal is to take part in kicking out this failed government,” he said. Many of the demonstrators, who had gathered near the American Embassy, said they hoped to galvanize a movement that would lead to the dismantling of the political system and its sectarian quotas, which they blamed the United States for establishing more than a decade ago. They railed at their leaders, many in power since the earliest days of the American occupation. Talib Mohammed, an amputee who said he had lost his leg in a battle against the United States last decade, said he was demanding his rights “from the Americans and all who stole from the people and became millionaires. ” He added, “We are here to change all of the faces that have been brought by the Americans. ” The United States Embassy issued a statement on Sunday that expressed concern about the   but said all Iraqis should work to “move the political and economic reform process forward” while combating the other threat to the country, the Islamic State. While recognizing the right to peaceful protest, the embassy said, it joined others in “urging restraint and respect for constitutional institutions and respect for the rights of others. ” Though the crisis seemed to be defused for the moment, Iraq’s political system is in disarray. Lawmakers, some of them caught up in the occupation, expressed pessimism. Haitham   a Shiite member of Parliament, said, “This crisis will break the country instead of fixing it. ” He called for Mr. Abadi’s resignation and said “a new government must be formed. ” He blamed Mr. Abadi for Saturday’s chaos, and noted the ease with which protesters entered the Green Zone despite tight security. There were numerous reports that security forces had allowed the protesters in as part of a deal with Mr. Sadr and his militia. The prime minister’s office denied news reports on Saturday that Mr. Abadi had ordered forces to accommodate the protesters. “I believe Abadi allowed them to enter,” Mr. Jibouri said. “This is a mysterious scenario aimed at putting pressure on the political blocs. ” The political crisis has diverted attention from the fight against the Islamic State. The United States has lately stepped up its military support to Iraq, and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. made a surprise visit to Baghdad on Thursday to show support to Mr. Abadi. Even as the attention on Sunday remained on the situation in Baghdad, the Islamic State carried out two devastating suicide bombings in the southern Iraqi city of Samawa. The attacks killed at least 37 people and wounded nearly 90, according to police officials and the provincial governor’s office. Also on Sunday, the United Nations released monthly casualty statistics, reporting that 741 Iraqis were killed in terrorist acts and in fighting against the Islamic State in April. The figures were a decline from March, when 1, 119 Iraqis were killed, but the United Nations office in Baghdad said difficulties in compiling the data suggested that the April totals were the “absolute minimum. ”",0
17533,"Going Home to Falluja, a City Slipping Back Into Turmoil - The New York Times","Times journalists are in Iraq’s Sunni heartland to evaluate rebuilding efforts after battles with the Islamic State. FALLUJA, Iraq  —   Iraqi forces had taken Falluja from the Islamic State months before, and Sabah Rashid was more than ready to return home. But the police warned him not to go. Fleeing Islamic State fighters had rigged bombs all through his south Falluja neighborhood, and these had still not been cleared, they told him. Insurgent corpses were said to lay unrecovered. Mr. Rashid, 30, a determined sort, moved back into his ransacked house anyway  —   he and his family fled the Islamic State three years ago and did not want to wait. Last week, they were camped out in their sagging house with no heat, electricity or running water. They boiled water on a wood fire. And they waited with mounting frustration for promised government aid. Nearly eight months after the recapture of Falluja showed that Iraq’s government could wrest one of the Islamic State’s major support bases away from it, the victory now seems at risk. The   national government has not yet demonstrated that it can secure and rebuild this shattered Sunni city, soothe sectarian grievances or provide for 250, 000 returning residents. Iraqi and American security officials now fear that if the Sunnis of Falluja are given no reason to trust the government, they may once again embrace the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL. Local officials say Islamic State sleeper cells remain active, and many residents continue to aid the insurgents. Guerrilla attacks have resumed in one of the most recent episodes, a suicide car bomb on Jan. 28 killed two police officers. The seeds of an incomplete victory were there from the start. Falluja had long been disaffected from the government, and it was the first Iraqi city to fall under Islamic State control. Even with the group mostly driven out, the government faced a widespread lack of trust. Further, the battle relied heavily on Shiite militia forces, many of which are backed by Iran, and reports of sectarian abuses of the Sunni population started almost immediately. In one case, the governor of surrounding Anbar Province said that militia fighters and some of their allies in the security forces had summarily executed 49 Sunnis from Falluja and tortured others. The government tried to keep the militias out of Falluja to avoid antagonizing Sunni residents. But many entered the city dressed as policemen, Sunni lawmakers said. Local officials said Shiite militiamen were now confined to checkpoints on Falluja’s outskirts, about 40 miles west of Baghdad. “Of course, violations occurred in some places,” by Shiite militiamen, said Salam Ajmi, a Falluja municipal councilman. But now, he said, some Sunni residents were cooperating with security forces to help root out Islamic State sleeper cells. A visit to Falluja by Times journalists showed that last summer’s battle had left some sections of the city relatively unscathed, but had reduced others to rubble. Many streets were littered with crumpled buildings, collapsed roofs and   cars, all coated with gray dust. The skeleton of a crushed Humvee lay near Mr. Rashid’s home. For Mr. Rashid, the satisfaction of returning home was dimmed by resentment toward local Sunni officials charged with rebuilding the city. “We get nothing from them but promises  —   we are on our own,” he said as his two young sons fed dry grass to the campfire. The family members survive on food purchased at a newly opened market in a nearby district. Their own Al Alamin neighborhood offered only a bleak panorama of   homes and deserted streets. “Falluja has had some hard lessons  —   we hope this will be our last hard lesson,” said Sheikh Talib   the head of Falluja’s local council, who has promised returnees that help is on the way. Mr. Efan spoke in a cold, darkened room, within a building he said had been used as an Islamic State headquarters and was now the council’s makeshift office. The electricity sputtered on and off. Mr. Efan is a returnee himself. His three homes  —   one for each wife  —   were destroyed during the Islamic State occupation, he said. He has lived at a friend’s house since returning in August. “People have to expect delays,” he said. “They need to be patient. ” The United Nations Development Program said it had made stopgap repairs to the city’s main teaching hospital and to five schools and health centers. The agency has restored rudimentary electricity and water in many areas, cleared debris and hired 300 locals to clean streets. Lise Grande, the United Nations deputy special representative in Iraq, said the agency’s stabilization work was to help patch up Falluja until more permanent repairs could be made. The agency has spent $8. 6 million of $18. 5 million allocated  —   a small fraction of the amount needed to rebuild the city. Mr. Ajmi, the councilman, said the council had little funding. Depressed oil prices have kept Iraq’s economy floundering. Life is precarious everywhere, he said, not just in Falluja. Hussein Ahmed, 53, who lived in a   camp for three years, said he had lost patience with the council. He returned to Falluja to find his house wrecked  —   the third he has lost. Two previous homes were destroyed during battles against fighters for Al Qaeda in Iraq, he said. “We were hurt badly by Daesh,” he said, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. “And now we’re being hurt by our own government. ” Mr. Ahmed pointed to an expanse of toppled buildings: “This area was liberated in June, and it still looks the same now. ” Other returning residents nodded as Mr. Ahmed added, “I speak for thousands of people when I say the government has forgotten us. ” Falluja has endured tragedy on an epic scale since 2003. The city was pounded during repeated battles  —   first between the United States and Saddam Hussein’s forces in 2003, then between American Marines and Al Qaeda fighters. Most insurgents were eventually evicted with the help of Sunni tribal fighters. But the insurgency was reborn as the Islamic State. It overran Falluja in December 2013, and the city became an important base for the group’s operations. One reason the government assaulted the city last May, even before turning to the critical campaign for Mosul, to the north, was to curb a devastating car bomb campaign against Baghdad that was being operated from Falluja. Now, the United States military is working with Iraqi forces to prevent Islamic State fighters from rising up in Falluja again, said a spokesman, Col. John L. Dorrian. “They have proved very resilient,” he said. Falluja is hardly the government’s only worry in a nation with 3. 1 million internally displaced people. The government is pouring resources into the Mosul battle while also trying to rebuild Falluja and Ramadi, in Anbar Province, and to repair the city of Tikrit, farther north. Of the 320, 000 people who fled Falluja for aid camps, about 250, 000 have returned since   the United Nations said. They are desperate to live at home again, whatever the risk. In south Falluja, First Lt. Walid Mohammed of the police shook his head as Mr. Rashid and his children tended their campfire. “We told them the risk is all theirs,” he said. “They are responsible if anything happens, not us. ” Elisabeth Koek, of the Norwegian Refugee Council in Iraq, said about letting residents return to dangerous areas deprived of public services: “This is incredibly worrying. ” Mr. Rashid said he returned even after a   killed a returnee in a supposedly cleared area nearby. After Mr. Rashid moved in, a woman was killed by an explosion on Jan. 31 as she was repairing her home in the same area, police said. Mr. Rashid said he was accustomed to danger. He lifted his shirt to reveal jagged, crimson scars on his belly from an Islamic State bomb that he said blew up the family car in late 2013. The blackened front seat lay in the front yard. A tall,   man suddenly appeared: Mohammed Saeed, 49, a neighbor whom Mr. Rashid had not seen since 2013. Mr. Saed had returned that morning, three years after fleeing. His home was dirty and bereft of electricity or water. But he was moving in. Mr. Saed kissed Mr. Rashid on both cheeks. “I’m so happy,” he told him. “It’s a dangerous, terrible place, but we are home. ”",0
17534,"Demand for ‘Himalayan Viagra’ Fungus Heats Up, Maybe Too Much - The New York Times","BAGDANDA, Nepal  —   From a pasture high in the Himalayas, Tulsingh Rokaya, 55, a shepherd, watched for years as the number of itinerant harvesters swelled. They came in search of what is known as caterpillar fungus, or yarsagumba in Nepali. A parasitic fungus, it forms  out of the head of ghost moth larvae living in the soil at altitudes above 10, 000 feet, and has been used as an aphrodisiac for at least a thousand years, earning it the nickname Himalayan Viagra. In the 1980s, the pickers used to trade the fungus for cigarettes and noodles. But as yarsagumba grew in popularity, it exploded into a   industry spanning China, Singapore and the United States. During the picking season, which runs from late May to July, the number of harvesters in Bagdanda and two neighboring camps has often reached several thousands of people. But this season, with the fungus becoming scarce, the number is down to the hundreds. They still hike from a camp below, carrying metal picks to dig out the fungus, helping to produce an average regional harvest of 135 tons a year. Occasionally, they stop at Mr. Rokaya’s tent to buy sheep’s curd. Most of the time they pass through, teetering on a steep hillside where they spend the morning hunched over to find the fungus’s crooked black stem poking through the dirt. Folklore has it that interest in the fungus stems from the startling performance of Chinese runners at an international track meet in 1993, which their coach attributed to their consumption of a soup combining the fungus with turtle blood. (Western competitors suspected something less exotic, namely   drugs.) With prices topping $50, 000 a pound in China’s coastal megacities, harvesting of the fungus has helped to curb endemic poverty in the Himalayas, which stretch across Nepal, northern India, Bhutan, Tibet and China. For hundreds of thousands of people living in remote villages, selling yarsagumba has become a primary source of income. A study by Nepal’s central bank found that harvesters earned an average of about $2, 500, or 56 percent of their yearly income, selling the fungus. Money from yarsagumba has given some of the world’s most impoverished people access to electricity, hospital care and education. “The whole Tibetan plateau is by now completely dependent on the cash influx,” said Daniel Winkler, a mycologist who has studied the caterpillar fungus extensively in Tibet. He estimated that over one million people in Tibet sell the fungus. But as quickly as demand for the fungus has surged, its supply has dropped sharply. Mycologists studying the fungus point to overharvesting as one reason. But another possible cause, some researchers now believe, is a warmer ecosystem precipitated by climate change, a phenomenon that may be more acute at higher altitudes. “There are strong theoretical reasons as to why we might expect the rate of climate change to be faster higher up in the mountains than it is at sea level,” said Nicholas Pepin, a geographer at the University of Portsmouth in England. Some of the most compelling data comes from the Tibetan plateau, where from 2001 to 2012, the increase in temperatures was between half a degree Fahrenheit and nearly an entire degree at weather stations above 10, 000 feet. In the same decade, global temperatures rose by only about 0. 2 degrees. Scientists say it is unclear why mountain ranges may be warming more rapidly than other parts of the planet. But Kamaljit Bawa, a biologist at the University of Massachusetts Boston, said failure to better understand warming in the Himalayas could have serious consequences for the region’s unique biodiversity. “We have to make very rapid progress,” he said. “We can’t use the slow approach, the traditional, slow scientific approach. ” Not for yarsagumba, apparently. As harvesters returned from the pastures to Bagdanda on a recent afternoon, children gathered in the camp’s dusty thoroughfare and divided teams for a volleyball game. A mother held down her squirming daughter to pick lice from her scalp. Men congregated on   dirt mounds and peeled strips of kutki, an herb used to treat vomiting and fever. In a village below the meadows, Prithvi Budha, 60, a beekeeper who is sitting out the harvest to watch dozens of empty mud and stone huts, said less precipitation might be the cause for the drop in yarsagumba supplies. “We used to have snow up to here and up to here,” he said, pointing to his torso and his shoulders as he recalled a string of childhood winters. Uttam Shrestha, a researcher at the University of Southern Queensland in Australia, said it was difficult to say why the supply of yarsagumba had dropped. Changes in temperature, he said, could be one of several factors affecting the supply of the fungus. “We can draw some inferences,” he said. “Here, the fungus is very sensitive to the increase in temperature and so that could have an impact, but there is no empirical evidence yet. ” Jir Bahadur Budha, 43, a farmer, said he was disappointed with this year’s harvest. He estimated that his family of six would collect only 400 pieces of yarsagumba, 200 fewer than last year and 500 fewer than the year before. The selling price for a single piece is about $3. 50 in Nepal. On a recent morning, Mr. Budha joined dozens of others in a pasture as a heavy fog set in. Within 10 minutes of searching, calls echoed from a few hundred feet away, where a teenager had spotted one of the day’s first pieces. Clawing away dirt from the larva’s body, the boy received a smattering of congratulations. He had found a good piece. “Only lucky people find yarsagumba in the morning,” one man said. Mr. Rokaya, the shepherd, was cautious in his appraisal of the day’s pickings. Whatever the reason for the decline in yarsagumba, he said, it may be too late to salvage what has been lost. “No jobs. No money. What to do?” he said, thrumming his fingers on a gnarled cane. “We eat the rice that even donkeys and horses don’t eat. ”",0
17535,Demonizing Russian Media,"Demonizing Russian Media November 23, 2016 
The West is escalating its demonization of Russian media as weapons of “information warfare” that need neutralizing, but Gilbert Doctorow finds that accusation just another part of the West’s own propaganda war. 
By Gilbert Doctorow 
One of the West’s top points in condemning Vladimir Putin’s “regime” since 2007 has been his alleged suppression of democratic institutions, including an assault on media freedom and imposition of government-directed propaganda. This week, the accusation was repeated in a resolution of the European Parliament calling for stronger counter-measures in defense of European values against “information warfare” from Moscow. 
The charges — that Russian media are only an instrument of state propaganda directed at the domestic population to keep Russian citizens in line and at foreign audiences to sow dissent among Russia’s neighbors and within the European Union — are taken as a matter of faith with almost no proofs adduced. Anyone who questions this “group think” is immediately labeled a “tool of Putin” or worse.

I experienced this firsthand in March 2015 when, as one of three debaters on “The Network,” a Euronews public affairs program, I objected to remarks by a fellow panelist, Chairman of the European Parliament’s Foreign Relations Committee Elmar Brok, who maintained that Putin crushed all liberties and his country has no free press. 
Based on my familiarity with the many different political lines of the Russian print media and of the patently unintimidated Kremlin-critics behind the national radio station Ekho Moskvy and television station Dozhd’, I countered that, for example, Russian coverage of events in the Donbass was more multi-sided and free than coverage in the U.S. 
Brok lashed out with the slanderous question: “And how much did the Kremlin pay you to say that?” The broadcaster then allowed this video-taped exchange to air freely. 
I have ruminated on this exchange ever since and sought incontrovertible proof of the relative freedom of expression on Russian broadcast media. My close examination of the wildly popular political talk shows on Russian television first as a spectator and then as a participant has provided just that. 
I have written previously about my initial experience going back six months to when I first took part in a program on the Rossiya 1/Vesti 24 state channel, Yevgeni Popov’s “Special Correspondent.” I mentioned at the time the nearly permanent presence on these programs of domestic opposition figures as well as of foreigners from the U.S., Ukraine, Poland and Israel, in particular, who could be counted on to present views on the political topic of the day’s discussion at sharp variance with the Kremlin line. 
Assessing the Talk Shows 
In early autumn I appeared on the same presenter’s new show “Sixty Minutes,” as well on what is probably the most respected show of this genre, “Sunday Evening with Vladimir Soloviev,” another Rossiya 1 production. Soloviev has done feature-length television interviews with Vladimir Putin and may be considered to be as close to power as people in this medium get. His personal views are probably more nationalist than the ruling United Russia party, but on his shows he, too, gives time on air to very diverse Russian and foreign views.

In the past month, I broadened my experience with the Russian talk show format by participating in shows on the other major state channel, Pervy Kanal (“Time Will Tell”) and on the country’s largest commercial television channel, NTV (“The Meeting Place”). This accelerated learning was facilitated by the U.S. presidential elections, which made Russian-speaking talking heads from America like myself a rather hot commodity on Russian television at least briefly. 
In speaking to fellow panelists during break time, in interviews with presenters, I gathered some inside information about the production side of the talk shows, including their target audiences, their technical aspects and their substantive positioning. 
Anyone looking over Russian television programming in general quickly finds that talk shows as a format take up a very large part of broadcast time. Of course, the focus of talk shows may be highly diverse, and political talk shows were traditionally an evening phenomenon, as is the case with the Rossiya 1 shows cited above, while daytime programming more typically focuses on housewives’ concerns, daydreams of romance or tips for cooking, and the like. 
In this sense, it was a bold move when two years ago Pervy Kanal decided to launch a daily two-hour political talk show (“Time Will Tell”) in mid-afternoon. As expected, the target audience proved to be stay-at-home women and viewers aged 50 and above, although it appears there are also a fair number of viewers watching the program in the work place. 
Going Daytime 
The ratings captured by this show typically are in the 20s, meaning that 20 or so percent of all television viewers in Russia at the given time are tuned to the given program, yielding an audience numbering in the millions. On Nov. 9, when I appeared on the show dedicated to analysis of the U.S. election results, the numbers spiked to 30 percent, as one might well understand given the very great interest among ordinary Russians in the outcome of the race for the U.S. presidency and the outlook for war or peace. A Russian orchestra performing at Palmyra’s Roman theater on May 5, 2016, after Syrian troops, backed by Russian air power, reclaimed the ancient city from the Islamic State. (Image from RT’s live-streaming of the event.) 
As “Time Will Tell” presenter Artyom Sheinin explained to me, the decision to appear on daytime television called for certain production decisions differentiating the programs from the evening talk shows. Firstly, the expectation of a less sophisticated audience meant that the language of panelists should be free of political science jargon and allusion to little known names or philosophies. 
Said Artyom, panelists are asked to pitch their arguments as they would “talking to their kids, their mom or their lover.’’ On the other hand, overly calm discussion is not seen as a benefit. The presenter explains that his audience sitting at home at mid-day is in need of “an adrenaline shot,” and the normal penchant of Russian panelists to shout down one another in a free-for-all is not discouraged in the way it is on evening programming. The evening viewer is assumed to have come home from work and is seated in his armchair before the television, wants his nerves soothed more than excited. 
All Russian political talk shows on the main channels are produced in the afternoon, Moscow time, and all feature on screen the caption “Live On Air.” However, where and when these shows are broadcast live versus rebroadcast from video tapes is another matter. 
For example, the Rossiya 1/Vesti programs are broadcast live to the Russian Far East, where they appear at the end of prime-time evening broadcasts. Then they are re-broadcast at local evening prime time in each of the eight other time zones of the Russian Federation lying to the west, showing last in Moscow. 
In this regard, two years ago when it launched “Time Will Tell,” Pervy Kanal took a second unparalleled risk by broadcasting live to Moscow in the afternoon. From a political standpoint, this was like a high-flying trapeze act without the benefit of a safety net. 
In fact all of these programs are also video-taped, and all the major channels make the tapes available for internet viewing on their websites in full or shortened versions. 
Similar Formats 
Just as Russian television has often copied studio design and presentation formats from American television (I think in particular of the way the “Tonight Show” has been replicated on major Russian channels), so they copy from one another. In fact, if you turn on any of the political talk shows I cited above, you will find rather similar studios with live audiences. A military parade on Red Square. May 9, 2016 Moscow. (Photo from: http://en.kremlin.ru) 
Indeed, at Pervy Kanal, the producers remark jokingly that when NTV decided to launch its own afternoon talk show, “The Meeting Place,” that network picked up not only the production format and studio design but also some of the production staff. The format of having male-female pairs of talk show hosts also has spread widely in the industry. 
But there appears to be a significant difference between these shows on the degree to which they are “scripted” by management upstairs, the degree to which they are free discussion. Perhaps the most scripted is this season’s new entry at Rossiya 1, “Sixty Minutes,” in which presenters Yevgeni Popov and Olga Skabeyeva are reading off teleprompters and the audience applause is aggressively prompted. On the other hand, the lead presenter on Pervy Kanal’s “Time Will Tell,” Artyom Sheinin proudly says that he has no script handed to him, that what he says on air is what he himself prepared or is thinking at the time. 
One ubiquitous fact is that the panelists are not scripted and if anyone is cut off in mid-sentence it is by other panelists vying for the microphone, not by the presenter keeping the political line of discourse in check. Except in the case of senior politicians, who are given the respect their rank demands, no panelist is safe from interruptions and the audience encourages a culture of gladiators in the arena, with applause punctuating the debates. 
On NTV there is the additional expression of audience disapproval, but that is rare. The benefits of these ground rules go to the quick-witted as well as to the loudest voices, whatever their political complexion. 
The culture of these talk shows is permeated by a newsroom mentality. Some of the presenters, especially on Rossiya 1/Vesti 24, come from television journalism and have gotten their appointments as a reward for successful work in the field, especially in hazardous areas. Such was the background of talk show host Yevgeni Popov, who for years reported from Ukraine, initially during the Orange Revolution days and later during the Maidan protests. 
The content of each program on all channels is subject to change at the last minute as are the list of invited panelists in case of breaking news. This favors inviting panelists who are living in the Moscow area. They can be invited and disinvited at short notice. In fact, all the major political shows on the three channels I observed from inside use many of the same Russian and foreign panelists chosen from among political scientists at universities or think tanks, journalists and Duma or Federation Council members. 
Western Voices 
To be sure, not all panelists come down to the studio. A very few lucky experts are given air time from remote locations, their close-up image projected onto a wall-sized screen. 
One such “regular” on the Rossiya 1/Vesti 24 channel is Dimitri Simes, president of The Center for the National Interest in Washington, D.C. These vignette appearances get special treatment, without any interruption from other panelists and only respectful questioning from the host. 
Panelists in greatest demand can be seen leaving one show early so as to be able to get over to another studio on a different channel when there is the rotation of panelists between advertising breaks. None is in greater demand than the American Michael Bohm, who in the dark days of worsening relations with the West provided all channels with highly fluent statements in Russian of the latest policy position of the Washington Consensus, often accompanied by Russian folk expressions. 
This has been especially appreciated by television producers representing the more hardline supporters of the Kremlin for whom Bohm is the kind of American the audience loves to hate, his every remark justifying demands for greater military expenditures by the Kremlin. Nonetheless, it remains true that through Bohm and a few other Westerners on these shows, the full blast of Western critiques of Kremlin policy gets prime broadcasting time in Russia. 
The senior politicians brought in as panelists come from all the Duma parties, not just the ruling United Russia. In the past half year, I noted in particular the frequent presence of the leader of the nationalist LDPR party, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, while Gennady Zyuganov of the Communists or Sergey Mironov, leader of Just Russia, have been rare birds. 
On the other hand, there have been frequent appearances by the Liberals of the Yabloko party, which never made it past 1 percent of votes cast in the latest parliamentary elections, not to mention the minimum 5 percent threshold for Duma representation. 
The talk show programs are prepared with great professionalism. Behind each there is extensive research to find appropriate archival and/or latest visuals. The administrative chores involved in arranging logistics for the panelists chosen are also considerable. The team members I have encountered were uniformly dedicated, working crazy hours to get their job done. 
Encouraging Strong Opinions 
I also noted a peculiar complicity between the staff “handlers” and us panelists. Clearly, production staff is rewarded for finding “fresh blood” panelists who play out well, and they make sure that their dogs in the race are well tended with coffee, tea, and, if needed, a shot of brandy during breaks to keep their spirits high. 
On the Rossiya 1/Vesti 24 talk shows presenters and the panelists all are wired with headset microphones. However, on both Pervy Kanal and NTV, only the presenters are wired, while panelists are seated next to production assistants holding microphones, which they make available upon request. Indeed, the assistants act as coaches to newcomers like myself, whom they urge to speak louder, speak faster, etc. to get the greatest debate effect out of us. 
In conclusion, my firsthand experience with the Russian political talk show phenomenon left me with no doubt that this is bona fide journalism serving the public interest, exposing the broad Russian television audience, from everyone’s parents and grandparents to business leaders and university dons, to a great many different competing and well-presented views on the major issues of the day, both domestic and international. 
This reality is sharply at variance with what U.S. and Western European mainstream media would have us believe about Putin’s Russia.

17538,Comment on BREAKING: Supreme Court Rules Cops Can Break the Law to Enforce the Law by Joseph Edward Bodden,"Home / Badge Abuse / BREAKING: Supreme Court Rules Cops Can Break the Law to Enforce the Law BREAKING: Supreme Court Rules Cops Can Break the Law to Enforce the Law Matt Agorist June 20, 2016 44 Comments 
Washington D.C. — In another devastating blow to the 4th Amendment, on Monday, the Supreme Court ruled that evidence of an alleged crime can be used against a defendant even if police did something inappropriate or even illegal to obtain it. 
In a split 5-3 decision, the justices voted to reinstate the drug-related convictions of Joseph Edward Strieff. In the case of Strieff, he was illegally detained during a “concededly unconstitutional detention,” which eventually led to the discovery of drugs inside his vehicle. 
In Strieff’s case, a trial court judge later found that the officer did not have enough evidence to initially stop and question him. But the judge ruled that Strieff’s subsequent arrest on an outstanding traffic warrant justified the search — implying that the use of criminal behavior to catch criminal behavior is just. The Utah Court of Appeals agreed with the trial court that the drug evidence was admissible at trial, but, in a moment of logic, the Utah Supreme Court last year reversed that decision. The Utah Supreme Court noted in its January 2015 decision that the case presented “a gap of substantial significance” in terms of prior rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court on Fourth Amendment issues, and that other courts that have addressed the issue have come to “substantially different conclusions” regarding search and seizure law. 
The Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule allows criminal defendants to suppress “fruit of the poisonous tree”— that is, evidence obtained as a result of a search or seizure that violates the Fourth Amendment. The reason this rule exists is due to the obvious conflict of interests in cops breaking the law to enforce the law. 
However, thanks to Monday’s ruling by the Supreme Court, that is exactly what will happen now. Police have essentially been given a free pass to violate the rights of individuals — just so long as they find evidence of a ‘crime.’ 
On Monday, the logic applied by the Utah Supreme Court in 2015, was thrown to the wayside in a handout to the police state. 
Given the reality of the militarized police state rising up from the horrors of the war on drugs, the fact that cops can now legally act illegally to bust people for possessing arbitrary substances is chilling. 
As if breaking the law wasn’t enough, prior to this ruling, p olice were no longer required to even give the appearance of an understanding of the laws they’re tasked with enforcing, thanks to a recent court decision surpassing even the veritable green light previously granted in Heien v. North Carolina . 
In the Heien case, the Supreme Court ruled a “police officer’s reasonable mistake of law gives rise to reasonable suspicion that justifies a traffic stop under the Fourth Amendment.” A motorist’s broken tail light caused an officer to make a traffic stop — during which evidence of a separate violation of the law was discovered in the vehicle. 
But in North Carolina, a broken tail light wasn’t illegal, thus not sufficient cause to justify the stop — nor the arrests stemming from it, lawyers argued, because that would be a violation of unreasonable searches and seizures. 
However, the Supreme Court ruled the officer’s ignorance of the law essentially didn’t matter — effectively allowing police around the country the ability to make stops if they ‘reasonably’ believe the cause for the stop is legal. Plainly, police can stop and search you despite ignorance of the law. 
Now, in U.S. v Shelton Barnes et. al. — a case that seemed to slip by largely unnoticed — even that flimsy justification has been deemed too constricting of police power, and police ignorance can actually be used against you in a trial. 
On Monday, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said in dissent that the decision in Utah vs. Edward Joseph Strieff, is a blow to constitutional rights. 
“The court today holds that the discovery of a warrant for an unpaid parking ticket will forgive a police officer’s violation of your Fourth Amendment rights,” Sotomayor wrote. 
Sotomayor’s dissent was joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Elena Kagan. 
Now, police need not understand the law, or even abide by the law — to enforce the law. In what world is this considered acceptable? Share

Here’s the problem. They guy already had a warrant even if the officer hadn’t used that fact in the stop and search. Sadly the Court has said such pre-existing circumstances can cover a multitude of ills. In short he had grounds to do an arrest and a search already even if he wasn’t aware of their existence. It’s bullshit, but there it is. Betty Anne Emery Rubendall 
Do you mean, if cop had run his tags, the warrant would have shown? I wonder why he didn’t. avelworldcreator 
Doesn’t sound like the cop in this case was bright enough to follow procedure or, more likely, he didn’t care and just wanted to fuck with someone. Even more likely it was a combination of both. He simply got “lucky”. William Keen

What an IDIOT!!! Dude, the ground work was laid for this trashing of the constitution by Ronald Reagan. And NOW idiots, think that DUMP is the answer!

Nope, he doesn’t mention mention Trump! The comment wasn’t aimed at him per se. I’m so used to reading comments from the sheeple that are guzzling Dump Kool-aid, it was I suppose what is known in military parlance as a preemptive strike. While I agree with you in theory, 100%, for the moment, I think the vote thing for what it’s worth, (if enough people would break the chains that bind their minds, and vote contrary to programming,) would upset the proverbial apple-cart.

17539,Mike Pence to Grove City Grads: Persist Fearlessly in the Face of Criticism - Breitbart,"Vice President Mike Pence challenged the 2017 graduates of Grove City College to lead with courage in the face of criticism and seeming setbacks and congratulated them for earning degrees at an institution which refuses federal funding. [Founded in 1876, Grove City College had to take its fight to refuse all federal funding to the U. S. Supreme Court in the 1980s. Pence recounted this history, telling the graduates, “The diploma that you will receive today was minted in an institution of principle and independence and you can be proud of it for the rest of your lives. ”  “People follow people they respect so first and foremost you must aspire to be men and women of character,” said Pence. TUNE IN! I’m at @GroveCtyCollege delivering the 2017 Commencement address. Congrats, grads! #GCCGrad2017 https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Vice President Pence (@VP) May 20, 2017,  He called the crowd to servant leadership: leadership grounded in faith and freedom, not selfish ambition, that “must the the animating force of the career that lies before you. ” “If you aspire to lead, you’ll need courage,” he added after referring to a quote from C. S. Lewis, “Courage was not one of the virtues it was actually a form of every virtue at the testing point. ” “Leadership brings both honor and opposition,” he continued. “Anyone who dreams big will encounter those who think small, anyone who dares to step forward will find those who’d rather stay put. And anyone who thinks they can will always hear from those who are sure they can’t. ” Pence told the graduates that for an example of courage they should look no further than his friend, the 45th President of the United States of America, Donald Trump. The vice president quoted the commencement message President Trump gave last Saturday at Liberty University. “Nothing worth doing ever came easy,” he said, quoting Trump. “Following your convictions means you must be willing to face criticism from those who lack the courage to do what’s right. ” Adding his own advice, Pence urged, “Don’t fear criticism. Have the humility to listen to it, learn from it and most importantly, push through it. Persistence is the key. Never quit on your dreams. Dreams may be deferred by they must never be abandoned. ” Pence recounted some of his life story and setbacks, particularly that he actually ran twice for the U. S. Congress and was not successful in those first attempts. He encouraged the graduates to trust the dream in their hearts and “never let it go. ” “That dream came back around,” said Pence, and he was eventually successful and able to serve in Congress, then serve as governor of Indiana and now has the privilege as serving as vice president of the United States. “Hold on to your calling. Never let it go,” he encouraged. Pence quoted former President Calvin Coolidge: Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. talent will not. Nothing is more common than unsuccessful people with talent. Genius will not. Unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not. Well the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. He then added his own words, “And so persistence men and women. Hold on to your dreams and drive forward. ” Vice President Pence declared that the graduates have been “called to lead, fearlessly. Be men and women of integrity with a servant’s heart. Expect opposition and persevere. And lastly, have faith. ” He quoted Jeremiah 29:11 from the Bible, as he often does, that God has a plan for them, to give them “hope and a future. ” “Have faith that He that brought you this far will never leave you and never forsake you because He never will,” said Pence. The Vice President said if the graduates “if you hold fast to Him, to the faith that deepened in this special place and to all that you learned from this extraordinary faculty, I know in my heart of hearts, you will not only persevere, but you will prevail. ” . @GroveCtyCollege Class of 2017  —   this is your day  —   the future is yours.

17540,"ICE Arrests 160 in Sweeping California Enforcement, Possibly More Across 6 States - Breitbart","SAN DIEGO, California  —   Federal immigration authorities arrested at least 160 illegal aliens over multiple days and across multiple states in what the U. S. Department of Homeland Security is calling “routine” immigration enforcement actions. [Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Gillian Christensen confirmed to the Washington Post that “routine” immigration enforcement actions were taken this week in Los Angeles, California Atlanta, Georgia and two other cities that were not identified. The enforcement actions took place at home and workplaces.  The spokesperson noted it was an unprecedented step to issue statements on such raids while they were ongoing, but   social media commentary triggered the agency to comment in this case. U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) attested that 160 illegal aliens were arrested in the southern Californian region, including Los Angeles, according to NBC San Diego. The report stated that those with criminal histories and deportation orders were targeted over a   sweep. The Post reported on Friday that federal immigration officials had declined to give numbers for how many arrests had been made. The report stated that “immigration activists” had documented “ICE raids” in at least six states as of Friday. President pro Tempore of the California State Senate Kevin de Leon, who has defiantly announced the state would oppose President Donald Trump’s plans for the enforcement of immigration law, said in a statement issued Thursday: There are reports that ICE today executed raids across Southern California. I have asked federal officials to disclose how many children, men, and women they have detained what the processing time will be what the rationale is for their detention and I asked that everyone be offered access to an attorney. De Leon announced an update on February 1 to his “California Values Act” bill that would effectively make California a sanctuary state. Lawyers and advocates for illegal aliens were scrambling to secure lawyers for those impacted, Grassroots Leadership executive director Bob Libal told the Post: “We’re trying to do some legal triage. ” The majority of those detained in the immigration enforcement actions were males according to both federal immigration authorities and “activists” cited by the Post. ICE spokesperson Virginia Kice echoed the DHS spokesperson when she told the Los Angeles Times that the immigration actions were “routine” and not part of any newly adopted policy under the Trump administration. Kice stated that the agency makes arrests every day: “Our operations are targeted and lead driven, prioritizing individuals who pose a risk to our communities. Examples would include known street gang members, child sex offenders, and deportable foreign nationals with significant drug trafficking convictions. ” Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana.",0

17543,Tucson Becomes an Unlikely Food Star - The New York Times,"TUCSON  —   There are food deserts, those urban neighborhoods where finding healthful food is nearly impossible, and then there is Tucson. When the rain comes down hard on a hot summer afternoon here, locals start acting like Cindy Lou Who on Christmas morning. They turn their faces to the sky and celebrate with prickly pear margaritas. When you get only 12 inches of rain a year, every drop matters. Coaxing a vibrant food culture from this land of heat and cactuses an hour’s drive north of the Mexican border seems an exhausting and impossible quest. But it’s never a good idea to underestimate a desert rat. Tucson, it turns out, is a muscular food town. Eight months ago it became the only place in the United States designated a City of Gastronomy by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, known by its acronym, Unesco. A   years ago, the international agency began including food as a part of cultural heritage worth protecting, recognizing the importance of things like Armenian lavash, the Mediterranean diet and the gastronomic meals of the French. In 2004 the group began a Creative Cities Network to link places where folk art, literature, music and other creative pursuits are being put to use to guide sustainable urban development. In the gastronomy category, Tucson joined 17 other cities, among them Parma, Italy Bergen, Norway and Ensenada, Mexico. “They want towns where the designation will make a difference,” said Jonathan Mabry, Tucson’s officer for historic preservation and an author of the application. To an outsider, Tucson’s star turn may be a bit of a head scratcher. Certainly, the city has plenty of reliably delicious tamales, brilliant renditions of huevos rancheros and devoted eaters who will spend the day debating the best place to get a good raspado. There’s even an outpost of Pizzeria Bianco, Chris Bianco’s Phoenix restaurant, which serves what several critics have called the best pizza in the United States. Still, Tucson has never been high on any list of great food cities. Even Santa Fe, its   sister, gets more love. But as people here will tell you, being a great food city is not always about the restaurants. “Tucson has really figured out the connection game,” said Megan Kimble, the editor of the Tucson magazine Edible Baja Arizona and the author of the 2015 book “Unprocessed: My   Year of Reclaiming Real Food. ” She pointed to strong advertiser and reader support for the magazine as just one example of the love people have for local food in this city of about 500, 000. The magazine consistently has more advertising pages than any of the other 90 published under the Edible Communities umbrella in the United States and Canada, said Nancy Brannigan Painter, the executive director of Edible Communities. The Unesco designation has been a rallying point for a city that has to balance an annual influx of snowbirds and University of Arizona students with a substantial Native American community, recent immigrants and deep pockets of poverty. “It gives us a reason to have deeper discussions about food and what it means to everyone who lives here,” Ms. Kimble said. Of the many facets of Tucson food culture included in its   application, one has risen above the rest: the claim that the city has the longest history of agricultural cultivation in North America. Dr. Mabry was part of a team hired by the city that made the discovery in 2000. He was working as an archaeologist, digging not far from downtown Tucson, when they discovered layer after layer of irrigation trenches, then found some charred corn. They sent it to be carbon dated. It was proof, he said, that   Tucson had been built on top of a    farming village. The fact is now dropped into even the most casual discussions about Tucson’s culinary assets. “It’s like part of the brand now,” Dr. Mabry said. Cooks here make great use of the food that comes from the desert, finding ways to incorporate agave, cactus pads, amaranth and the tiny wild pepper called chiltepin. Mesquite pods are pounded into sweet flour that is baked into cookies. Descendants of fruit trees introduced in the 1600s by the Rev. Eusebio Francisco Kino, an Italian who explored the Southwestern deserts, offer quince, figs and white pomegranates with soft seeds that taste of apple and grapefruit. Cholla buds, the slippery flowers of a cactus that taste vaguely of asparagus, are chopped into salads and salsas. Members of the Tohono O’odham nation sometimes gather them on the San Xavier Indian Reservation near Tucson and dry them, selling the buds in jars and soup mixes at the San Xavier   Farm. “They’re O. K. but it’s not like cholla buds are going to take the country by storm,” said Janos Wilder, a   chef who opened his first Tucson restaurant in 1983. “But they’re neat because it’s an absolutely unique and important story. It takes its place in a larger context. ” A lot of the food from the Sonoran Desert is like that. “I thought it was a wasteland when I first came here, but slowly my eyes opened up,” he said. To celebrate the new designation, Mr. Wilder has spent the better part of the summer at his latest restaurant, Downtown Kitchen and Cocktails, cooking a different menu based on each of the new cities of gastronomy. This week, he’s preparing the food from Phuket, Thailand. Tucson’s passion for its food culture goes well beyond the kitchen. People embrace new ventures and cheer creative solutions to help people eat better. When the lines at the Community Food Bank of Southern Arizona nearly doubled during the economic crash in 2008, the people who run it helped clients build gardens in their backyards and sell extra produce on consignment at the bank’s farmers’ markets. Not far from downtown, a nonprofit group is recreating a Spanish colonial walled garden like the ones Father Kino built. The Mission Garden project is a history lesson on four acres, tracing agricultural practices that began on the site with the Hohokam and Tohono O’odham tribes. The county’s libraries tuck seed banks into old card catalogs. If you want to plant tomatoes, or the little brown tepary beans that were long a staple of the Southwestern Native American diet (and don’t require much water to grow) simply check them out with a library card. If you save some seeds from your crop and bring them back, all the better. The city’s devotion to creating livelihoods from its heritage foods is part of what appealed to Unesco, said Gary Paul Nabhan, a   expert who advised the city on its application. Mr. Nabhan, a MacArthur Fellow and director of the Center for Regional Food Studies at the University of Arizona, has written more than 30 books, most of them about the plants and cultures of the Sonoran Desert. Mr. Nabhan, an ecumenical Franciscan brother who helped start Native   a nonprofit organization that saves and distributes Southwestern heirloom seeds, is a proponent of what he calls desert terroir, and the ingredients that make up what he calls borderland cuisine. One of them is white Sonora wheat, one of the oldest varieties grown in North America. Father Kino introduced it to the Tohono O’odham farmers, who welcomed it as a winter crop and used it to make the precursor to the thin, stretchy wheat tortilla that is the foundation of Mexican border cooking. Don Guerra, a cult star among the nation’s   bread bakers, uses it in the loaves he bakes in an Italian deck oven he installed in his Tucson garage. His   bakery, Barrio Bread, produces 900 loaves a week for people who order it online. “Tucson has a kind of   approach to food,” he said. “People want others to succeed, especially if you can make food from this region. ” The Unesco honor has lifted a town that sometimes doubts its place in the cultural hierarchy. “It’s like a new point of pride,” he said. “For so long we’ve been this poor cousin of Phoenix. ” But Tucson will always be Tucson, a place people either love or hate. “There’s no one who’s ambivalent about it,” said Ms. Kimble, a Los Angeles transplant. “But once it gets in your soul, it’s in there. ”",0

17545,"Donald Trump, Shifting Immigration Tone, Stresses a ‘Fair’ Approach - The New York Times","Donald J. Trump, tempering the tone of his   approach to immigration for a general election audience, avoided repeating his previous call for mass deportations on Monday and instead said he wants to come up with a “really fair” plan to address the millions of undocumented immigrants now in the country. The softer comments from Mr. Trump, who postponed plans to give a major immigration speech this week in Colorado, follow months of vows to build a wall along the Southern United States border with Mexico and deport immigrants who have entered the country illegally. Those proposals were a centerpiece of the platform that helped propel Mr. Trump to winning the Republican presidential nomination, and a shift would be significant. Asked on Fox News if he was   on his immigration ideas, Mr. Trump insisted that he still intends to be “strong” while emphasizing the importance of fairness when it comes to immigrants who came to the United States illegally. “We want to come up with a really fair, but firm, answer,” Mr. Trump said. “It has to be firm. But we want to come up with something fair. ” Although he held back on offering specifics, Mr. Trump’s different tone could be an attempt to court moderate Republican voters disturbed by the candidate’s tough stances on immigration. His remarks come as recent polls have shown him falling behind Hillary Clinton in several swing states and struggling to appeal to minorities. The campaign has sent conflicting signals about whether Mr. Trump would actually change his proposals regarding immigration. He was expected to give a major immigration speech in Arizona, but it was moved to Colorado and planned for this Thursday. On Monday, the campaign canceled the speech without explanation and declined to discuss his latest thinking on immigration. Speaking on Monday evening at a rally in Akron, Ohio, Mr. Trump did not mention any changes in his immigration policy, but promised another of his key proposals, to build a wall on the border with Mexico. “That wall will go up so fast your head will spin,” he said as the crowd cheered. “And they’ll say: ‘You know what? He meant it.’ And you know what else I mean? Mexico is going to pay for it. ” In an evening interview with Fox News’s Bill O’Reilly, Mr. Trump insisted he was not backing down on deportations, but would be focusing on criminals. “We’re going to obey the existing laws,” he said. “The first thing we’re going to do, if and when I win, is we’re going to get rid of all of the bad ones. We’ve got gang members, we have killers, we have a lot of bad people that have to get out of this country. ” But there have been signs that Mr. Trump is preparing to publicly evolve on his immigration plans. Mr. Trump’s new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, signaled on Sunday that he has been reconsidering his approach to deportations. Pressed in an interview on CNN as to whether a deportation force was still on the table as a law enforcement measure, Ms. Conway said it was “to be determined. ” Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a staunch ally of Mr. Trump’s who advises him on immigration policy, also acknowledged the new uncertainty, saying on CBS that Mr. Trump was “wrestling” with what to do about deportations. Speculation that Mr. Trump was wavering also grew over the weekend after he met on Saturday with his newly formed Hispanic advisory council. Univision and BuzzFeed reported that he expressed interest in finding a “humane” way to deal with undocumented immigrants that sounded at odds with his previous plan to forcibly remove them from the country. The Trump campaign denied that he was wavering. Any reversal on immigration by Mr. Trump would represent a political feat, considering he has said repeatedly that “we don’t have a country” if border laws are not enforced. During the primary campaign, Mr. Trump assailed all of his Republican rivals for being too weak on immigration. He kicked off his campaign saying that Mexico was sending criminals and rapists into the country, vowed that Mexico would pay for his planned border wall and called for the “mandatory return of all criminal aliens. ” In interviews about his immigration plans, Mr. Trump offered himself little leeway. Questioned a year ago about breaking up families, Mr. Trump said that “they have to go. ” Last November, he was explicit in his desire to deport and pointed to President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s “Operation Wetback” as an example of successfully removing people en masse. “You’re going to have a deportation force, and you’re going to do it humanely,” Mr. Trump told MSNBC at the time. “Look, we have to do what we have to do, and Ike did it and other people have done it. ” Immigration experts and independent analysts have warned that mass deportations would be costly and chaotic, but until recently, Mr. Trump has remained steadfast. A move to tone things down at this stage of the race could anger Mr. Trump’s base of supporters. Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa and one of the most conservative voices on immigration in the Republican caucus, said that he was not concerned that Mr. Trump is changing his position, given the ambiguity of his comments and the close counsel he keeps from the likes of Mr. Sessions. But he conceded that he would be troubled if Mr. Trump did change his sentiment on mass deportations, or if he were to advocate a “touchback” system in which people would return to their home country and then apply for visas to return to the United States under an expedited process. “That would concern me,” Mr. King said, saying that it would essentially convert the immigration system into a large enterprise by which people were being   for entry. Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, said that Mr. Trump’s softer language is less about a turnaround that could draw in Hispanic voters than it is an effort to woo swing voters who are turned off by the candidate’s language and proposals. “No rational person would believe that he’s actually going to do significantly better among nonwhite voters after the last 15 months,” Mr. Ayres said. “There may be a calculation that reaching out verbally makes him more acceptable to moderate Republicans and some women, perhaps. But actions speak a lot louder than words, and he has 15 months of action to overcome. ” Since reshuffling his campaign leadership last week, Mr. Trump has demonstrated a new affinity for flexibility. He has already expressed “regret” for remarks that he has made during the campaign that might have been hurtful, and he expanded his outreach to black voters. However, leading Hispanic groups said that it was too late for Mr. Trump to win their trust on immigration reform. “The fact of the matter is he can’t unring the bell,” said Javier Palomarez, the president of the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. “These are the acts of a desperate candidate who knows he is going to lose. ” The Clinton campaign, meanwhile, has no plans of letting Mr. Trump’s immigration contortions go unnoticed. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, the Democratic   nominee, seized on Mr. Trump’s latest remarks at a union convention on Monday in Las Vegas. He said that they were more evidence that Mr. Trump could not be trusted on the issue. “We can’t afford to be tricked by Trump,” Mr. Kaine said. “He’s saying that he’ll try to deport people in a humane way  —   whatever that means.

According to Kenneth Meshoe, chairman of the African Christian Democratic Party faction, any attempt to compare Palestinians’ experience in Israel with the former racist regime is offensive to individuals who suffered under the system of racial separation. 
Whatever challenges the Arab minority in Israel faces, the reality of life here cannot be compared to his experiences growing up, he insists. 
“There is freedom of movement in this country that we never had in South Africa,” Meshoe told Tazpit Press Service (TPS) during a visit to Jerusalem last week. “Benches and bathrooms said ‘whites only.’ We could never take ‘white’ transportation. Most white doctors would not treat black patients, only white ones. And those who were willing to treat black patients out of compassion – many of them would ask the patients to enter their clinics through the back door so they wouldn’t be seen by the white patients in the lobby. I don’t know if it was illegal for white doctors to treat black patients, but the reality was that very few did.” ‘Perpetuating Propaganda’ 
According to Meshoe, “Some South Africans who say there’s apartheid in Israel are only repeating things they’ve heard from other people, not because they’ve actually seen it themselves. They are just perpetuating propaganda. 
“Other people – politicians – are only thinking about their needs, and the statements that will serve their needs. They ask ‘what do I gain [by claiming there is or is not apartheid in Israel] and then make a decision. So they are perpetuating something that that they know very well is a lie.” 
Meshoe said he first visited Israel several years after Nelson Mandela was elected president in 1994. He joined a church delegation to the Holy Land and used the opportunity both for a religious pilgrimage and a political education, but the latter came as a surprise. 
“On that trip, I deliberately looked for anything that looked like apartheid. I took a bus to the center of Jerusalem, but blacks, Jews, Arabs and

17548,Warning or threat? Hillary hints at second civil war if Trump wins,"Warning or threat? Hillary hints at second civil war if Trump wins 11/02/2016 
While speaking to supporters in Cincinnati on Monday, Democrat Hillary Clinton hinted at a second civil war if GOP nominee Donald Trump wins, Breitbart.com reported. 
Charlie Spiering wrote: 
“He has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart,” Clinton said to supporters in Cincinnati, Ohio on Halloween. 
Clinton specifically referred to the Civil War, suggesting that the country faced a similar threat of divisiveness from Donald Trump. 
“Abraham Lincoln understood a house divided against itself cannot stand, and that was over the greatest of challenges – the challenge posed by slavery – and we fought a civil war,” she said. 
She warned voters that it was time for the country to take the divisions in the country seriously. 
“But we also have to take stock of how divided we are today, the kinds of divisions that need to be healed to bring people together,” she added, failing to admit that her side is the one that has divided America by race, class and gender. 
She also claimed that Trump would start a nuclear war if a foreign leader got under his skin. 
“I know there are some who will say that any discussion of this topic could be fear-mongering, but I don’t think so,” she said at a rally in Kent, Ohio, earlier in the day. 
A post at Barracuda Brigade observed: 
Liberals especially the Clinton are always projecting. Anything that they accuse the other side of is what they are doing. She suggests that her message is one of “hope and change” when in fact it is just more of the same. 
Moreover, Trump has spent a great deal of time talking about policies and issues while Clinton & Co. have done absolutely nothing but engage in fear-mongering and fingerpointing. 
Still, we have to ask — was Clinton’s “hint” a “warning” or a “threat?”

Bu arada, gayrimeşru olarak ABD atom bombalarına ev sahipliği yapan Devletlerin, Nükleer Silahların Yayılmasının Önlenmesi Anlaşmasının 2nci Maddesi gereğince bunların topraklarından geri çekilmesini şart koşmaları muhtemeldir.
Voltaire İletişim Ağı | Roma (İtalya) | 5 Kasım 2016 français italiano English Español « Teşekkürler, Başkan Obama. İtalya nükleer güvenlik için çabalarını büyük bir kararlılıkla sürdürmeye devam edecektir »: Başbakan Matteo Renzi, tarihi bir tweeter mesajında böyle yazıyordu. Altı ay sonra aynı Renzi Birleşmiş Milletlerde, nükleer silahlara « evet » oyu verdi. ABD’nin kuyruğuna takılan İtalyan Hükümeti, Genel Kurul Birinci Komitesinde büyük çoğunlukla onay gören, 2017 yılında Birleşmiş Milletlerde « tamamen ortadan kaldırılmalarıyla sonuçlanacak şekilde, nükleer silahların yasaklanması için zorlayıcı yasal bir aracı müzakere etmek » için bir konferans toplanması davetini öngören karar tasarısına karşı tavır aldı.
Böylece İtalyan Hükümeti, bundan iki yıl önce Viyana Konferansı sırasında, « sabır ve diplomasiyle arabulucu rolü » oynayarak nükleer silahsızlanma adına hareket etme iradesi konusunda güvence vererek, « kolay tatmin olmayan » nükleer karşıtı hareketlere verdiği söz konusunda tükürdüğünü yaladı. Böylece, hükümetten İtalya’nın « aktiften de öte, muhtemelen uç noktada bir rol » oynayabileceği, « nükleer silahsızlanmaya doğru giden insani ve hukuksal » bir güzergah içerisinde, « nükleer silahların ülke dışına çıkarılması için yürütülen çaba ve mücadelenin sürdürülmesinin » talep edildiği, « topyekun nükleer silahsızlanmayı şart koşuyoruz » çağrısı boşluğa düşüyor.
Bunun sonucunda, aynı şekilde aynı içerikteki parlamento önergeleri de boşluğa düşüyor. Nükleer silahsızlanmaya yönelik jenerik çağrılar kolayca araçsallaştırılabilir: 1 000 milyar dolarlık yeniden nükleer silahlanmanın mimarı ABD Başkanının, « nükleer silahlardan arınmış bir dünya vizyonu » için Nobel Barış Ödülü’ne layık görüldüğünü düşünmek yeterli.
Birleşmiş Milletlerin karar tasarısında sözü edilen nükleer silahsızlanma hedefine varmak için İtalya’dan katkıda bulunabileceğimiz somut yöntem, ülkemizi ABD’nin nükleer silahlarından kurtarmaktır. Bu amaçla hükümete çağrıda bulunmak yerine, onu, 2nci maddesinde « sözleşmeye taraf olan ve askeri açıdan nükleer olmayan Devletlerin her biri, herhangi birinden nükleer silah ya da diğer patlayıcı nükleer aygıtları almamayı ve bu tür silah ve patlayıcı aygıtları üzerinde doğrudan ya da dolaylı olarak denetimi altında bulundurmamayı taahhüt eder » koşulunu içeren ve İtalya tarafından imzalanan ve onaylanan Nükleer Silahların Yayılmasının Önlenmesi Anlaşmasına uymaya zorlamamız gerekiyor. İtalya’nın Nükleer Silahların Yayılmasının Önlenmesi Anlaşmasını ihlal etmeye son vermesini ve ABD’den topraklarımızdaki bütün nükleer silahları derhal geri çekmesini ve buraya, Rusya’ya karşı ABD/NATO’nun mızrak başı yeni B-61-12 bombalarını, ne de başka nükleer silahları yerleştirmemesini talep etmeye zorlamalıyız. İtalyan pilotlarının, ABD komutası altında nükleer silahların kullanımı konusunda eğitim almamalarını talep etmeliyiz.
Bu, No Guerra, No Nato komitesi ve başka özneler tarafından başlatılan kampanyanın hedefidir. Kampanyanın elde ettiği ilk önemli kazanım, 26 Ekim’de Toskana Bölgesel Konseyinde, Si Toscana a Sinistra (Evet, Toskana sola) grubunun verdiği ve « Nükleer Silahların Yayılmasının Önlenmesi Anlaşmasına uymayı ve ABD’nin derhal her türlü nükleer silahı İtalyan topraklarından geri çekmesi ve yeni B-61-12 bombalarını ve diğer nükleer silahları yerleştirmemesi için gerekeni yapmasını hükümetten talep etmesi için yerel idareyi yetkilendiren » bir önerge kabul edildi.

17550,Credit Suisse Boss Faces Revolt From Bankers Over Strategy Shift - The New York Times,"When Tidjane Thiam took over at Credit Suisse last July, he laid out a new direction for a financial giant with a storied investment banking history: Do less investment banking. And he used forceful language in doing so. He has referred to once core businesses  —   such as trading in distressed bonds and derivatives  —   as “ugly ducklings. ” He has suggested publicly that traders increased their investments in risky debt without his knowledge. Instead, Mr. Thiam said, the firm should dedicate itself to cultivating billionaires in China, Indonesia and Africa. The message: The future for the company is in managing the wealth of others. One year in, Credit Suisse stock is down 50 percent. And the investment bank, the second largest in Switzerland after UBS, is in open revolt. Credit Suisse has a wide range of businesses, like overseeing the fortunes of billionaires and managing initial public offerings for technology companies. But for decades, the bank has been dominated, both culturally and financially, by a richly paid banking elite. These deal makers in New York and London are now furious at Mr. Thiam, not just for cutting their pay but also because they resent his blaming them for the $6 billion in losses that the firm has suffered on his watch. Across Europe, banking giants like Barclays, Deutsche Bank, UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland have, to varying degrees, moved away from traditional investment banking activities because of increased regulation and volatile markets. Sluggish growth in large European economies  —   not to mention the remarkable phenomenon of negative interest rates  —   have not helped matters, either. But what makes the situation at Credit Suisse stand out is that Mr. Thiam appears to have done little to cloak his disdain for these activities. The question is not whether Mr. Thiam is right to grab power and capital from these declining businesses but whether his blunt, domineering style as a change agent will end up alienating bankers instead of winning them over. “It is never easy to tell people that whole parts of the business that have put bread on their table and bought them a second house have become uneconomic,” said Guy Moszkowski, a longtime securities analyst at Autonomous Research. By any measure, Mr. Thiam is an unconventional choice to lead an investment bank. Born to a prominent family in Ivory Coast, he cut short a career at McKinsey  Company in Paris in 1994 to join a   government in his home country as a top banker and minister. Following a military coup in 1999, Mr. Thiam returned to McKinsey, and in 2009, he was named chief executive of Prudential, the British insurance conglomerate  —   becoming the first African to head a major listed company in Britain.    and snugly tailored, Mr. Thiam has an air about him of not suffering fools. He had a successful run at Prudential (no relation to an American company with a similar name) overcoming an uproar following a failed bid to buy the Asian operations of the American International Group. Along the way, he became one of London’s more celebrated executives and a regular on the circuit of global  . That he has not bent to the complaints of bankers and traders in unprofitable businesses should not come as a surprise. “There needs to be a cultural change,” he said in a televised interview in March, in which he argued that bankers were pursuing risky trades to justify their high pay. “A lot of the problems in the investment bank are that people are trying to generate revenue at all costs. ” In turn, deal makers in London and New York, who have seen their bonuses slashed by nearly 40 percent, are not hiding their dislike of the man. More than any other bank on Wall Street, Credit Suisse restricts the cash portion of its bonuses, allocating large chunks in company stock, which has halved in value. So when their new chief executive gave a speech in May and said that Credit Suisse’s stock price “reflected reality,” bankers, especially the many who have worked at the firm for decades, could not believe it. On Credit Suisse’s newly renovated trading floor in New York, several bankers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, grumbled that Mr. Thiam had “lost the building,” which is Wall Street parlance for chief executives who no longer command the respect of their traders. And when he has appeared on television in recent months, employees loudly vented their frustrations at the screen, according those bankers, who witnessed the events but were not authorized to speak publicly. Mr. Thiam was hailed during his first visit to the trading floor in New York last year, but the reception during a more recent appearance was chillier, said two employees who were on the floor during his visits but were not authorized to speak publicly. In particular, many at Credit Suisse find Mr. Thiam’s personal style to be jarring at a time when thousands are being laid off and the stock is trading at a multiyear low. This is particularly true when compared with Brady W. Dougan, his   predecessor: Mr. Thiam’s own dealings with the media are handled by a British firm, Powerscourt. He enjoys a robust social life and has been seen doing the rounds at clubs in London and Davos, Switzerland. And he recently purchased a luxury home in Herrliberg, an exclusive lakeside enclave in Zurich. To be sure, analysts agree that Credit Suisse can no longer rely on trading derivatives with firms like Deutsche Bank as a profit center. Instead, Mr. Thiam is encouraging his deal makers to support the firm’s private bankers in Asia, by providing loans to   magnates in Indonesia or helping billionaire clients in China with initial public offerings. Mr. Thiam is clearly enamored with the prospect of tapping growth markets in emerging economies. He has been to China and broader Asia at least four times in his new capacity, and his business cards carry a Mandarin translation on the back. Mr. Thiam’s defenders say that with the future of Credit Suisse in doubt, he has no choice but to make these painful changes and that resistance from   traders and bankers should not deter him. And it is also true that wealth managers in Switzerland and Asia, where Mr. Thiam is adding resources, are embracing the new strategy. Following last year’s losses, he also asked his board for a 40 percent cut in his bonus, taking in $4. 5 million for the six months he worked last year. To date, the Credit Suisse board appears to be standing with Mr. Thiam. Indeed, having had two Wall Street chiefs since 2001, the board clearly believes that only a prominent nonbanker like Mr. Thiam can wean the firm off a line of business that has so long defined it. Nevertheless, directors were not happy with his televised comments in March when Mr. Thiam suggested that traders at the bank were hiding losses from him. Mr. Thiam quickly corrected himself at a conference that same day and said no limits were breached, though not without taking another dig at his traders by questioning their judgment. Mr. Thiam also called these   traders and offered what a spokeswoman for the bank said was a “clarification” of his remarks. “The board is 100 percent behind the strategy, Tidjane and the executive board,” said Richard E. Thornburgh, a former Credit Suisse banker with 30 years of experience at the firm who is now chairman of the board’s risk committee. With morale in New York at a low point, Mr. Thornburgh has had recent meetings with top bankers and traders, hearing them out and urging them to remain focused on their clients. For many, though, this is easier said than done. It is unusual, after all, for an incoming chief executive to be so publicly critical of employees responsible for a quarter of a firm’s revenue. That is particularly true on Wall Street, where punctured vanities can quickly harm a firm, as productive bankers head for the exits in droves. Over the last six months, at least 18 bankers and traders have left the firm, with many of these coming from Credit Suisse’s once prestigious technology unit in San Francisco. The culture clash at Credit Suisse recalls a similar dispute at Morgan Stanley a decade ago. Like Mr. Thiam, Philip J. Purcell was a former whiz kid consultant from McKinsey who preferred slow and steady brokers over bankers with big egos and even bigger paychecks. A   uprising forced Mr. Purcell’s departure, since power on Wall Street was then still in the hands of deal makers and traders. With wealth managers now ascendant, Mr. Thiam seems willing to accept the wounded cries of his own bankers as a painful necessity if his grand plan is to succeed. “Is there a vision. Is there a direction?” Mr. Thiam asked aloud last year in a speech introducing his strategy. “The Germans say that the horrible end is better than horror without end. ”",0
17551,"Gary Johnson Mourns Harambe, Asks: ""Why Did They Have To Kill The Gorilla?""","Share on Twitter 
LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - Politicians often try to relate to the common man and fail miserably. However, in a moment of blunt candor and honesty, Libertarian candidate for President Gary Johnson spoke for all of us when he openly mourned the loss of majestic Harambe. 
“Why did they have to kill the gorilla?” Johnson lamented in an exclusive interview with Independent Journal Review. 
The former New Mexico Governor and nature enthusiast was visibly moved when asked about his feelings on Harambe, a celebrated Western Lowlands Gorilla living peacefully in the Cincinnati Zoo before he was cruelly cut down in the prime of his life after a child fell into his enclosure this past May. “I'm sure it was a difficult decision for everyone involved,” Johnson said before ultimately bemoaning the cruel fate of the endangered, peaceful animal. 
Harambe's legacy has become a cultural and even political phenomenon. Green Party candidate Jill Stein has tweeted her defense of sweet Harambe and there is now an official Harambe Super PAC registered with the FEC called 'Justice For Harambe.' 
The Super PAC's creator Ryan Hall spoke with IJR last month describing what his PAC will be committed to doing: 
We will endorse any candidate who is willing to honor Harambe's legacy. Harambe represents all Americans and what it truly means to be an American. We will back candidates who will work toward legislation which ensures that innocent gorillas can live in peace and not be shot. We want candidates who support safe enclosures for majestic gorillas. We also will support candidates who will fight for nationwide Harambe memorials, so our children may learn the story of his life. 
We have reached out to Hall to see if the PAC, which had raised $20 at last reporting, would now be backing Gov. Johnson's Presidential run. ",0

[Ed. – Now teaching the gospel of racial grievance.] 
San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick hosted a “Know Your Rights” camp for Oakland-area youth Saturday, an event designed to expand his focus on social and racial injustice beyond his national anthem protest. 
“This is exciting for me because I see a lot of hope, what is to come,” Kaepernick said beforehand, in an interview with The Undefeated’s Marc J. Spears . 
Kaepernick said the campers, who numbered around 100, would have sessions to learn about situations with police, their rights, holistic health, financial literacy, and understanding both community and self. He said the camp’s aim is to “empower youth, give them resources and tools” to deal with difficult situations. 
“We want to let them know they have options and people that are behind them to help them,” he said. “And that’s a powerful thing, for someone else to have belief in you.”",0
17555,What Does Mayor de Blasio Do at the Gym? He Runs New York - The New York Times,"On most mornings, Mayor Bill de Blasio departs Gracie Mansion, the mayoral residence of New York City, in a black sport utility vehicle, accompanied by a police escort. The caravan then makes the drive down the East Side of Manhattan, a ride familiar to his predecessors, before embarking on a detour: past City Hall, across the East River to his final destination, a Y. M. C. A. on Ninth Street in Park Slope, Brooklyn. There, for an hour  —   and sometimes more  —   Mr. de Blasio runs the nation’s largest city from a gym mat. Or a stationary bicycle. Or the weight room. For the entirety of his 30 months as mayor, the Y. M. C. A. gym has served as the center of a kind of Camp David for Mr. de Blasio, an archipelago of neighborhood haunts in a roughly   radius that was part of his   life and where he now routinely returns. There is the Colson Patisserie, the mayor’s favorite morning stop the S  S Cleaners the nearby Brooklyn Public Library branch where Mr. de Blasio votes the Little Purity Diner and Bar Toto, where he has held meetings and made   calls. The uniqueness of the mayor’s routine has been noted since his early days in office, before he and his family moved to Gracie Mansion from their Park Slope home. But close observation by a reporter for The New York Times, who is a fellow member of the Y. M. C. A. reveals it to be more rigid, lengthy and leisurely than previously known. During a recent week, Mr. de Blasio did not miss a single workout  —   hitting the gym each and every weekday, usually leaving the mansion around 8 a. m. or a bit later. He texts and emails on his phone. He stretches. He reads sheets of paper and watches television news. He once appeared to be reviewing a speech or a policy brief. No City Hall staff members came to speak with him nor did any other friends or associates. His wife, Chirlane McCray, accompanied him to the gym on two days, though they mostly worked out separately. No one begrudges the mayor’s right to exercise, even though some may take issue with his choice of venue to do so. But his sojourn in Park Slope is hardly a solitary affair. There is a security detail, as well as a rotating cast of staff members from his press office who stay either outside or across the street at the patisserie before accompanying him to City Hall or other events. One is assigned per day, said Eric F. Phillips, the mayor’s top spokesman, to help Mr. de Blasio “stay connected and efficient while he’s working out. ” Mr. Phillips adds that the mayor’s day starts “with calls, emails and briefings by 7 a. m.,” rarely ends before 9 p. m. and often extends into the weekend. “Mayor Bloomberg had Bermuda Mayor de Blasio has a corner coffee shop and Y in Brooklyn,” Mr. Phillips said, referring to Michael R. Bloomberg’s frequent weekend jaunts by private jet out of New York. Mr. de Blasio, as it turns out, happened to have left the country on Sunday for a weeklong family vacation in Italy. But in a normal week, the Prospect Park Y. M. C. A. and its environs clearly offer Mr. de Blasio a respite from the grind of city business, a place where the mayor has said he feels “grounded” and where he remains largely unaccosted for much of his workout. Fellow members of the gym largely ignore him, and Mr. de Blasio mostly keeps to himself. The mayor has kept the routine even after facing criticism last year for remaining at the gym during a violent standoff in Staten Island in which a firefighter was shot. He also adheres to the daily journey even when Park Slope presents a significant detour. Last Tuesday, for example, Mr. de Blasio traveled from the Upper East Side to Brooklyn, before reversing direction to head 15 miles north  —   straight past Gracie Mansion  —   to an event in the Bronx at 10:30 a. m. The routine has also survived a raft of continuing investigations into the mayor’s   activities by state and federal prosecutors. As recent observations showed, it is, in many respects, a routine that most busy people can only dream of. In one week in late June, the mayor emerged on that Monday into the gym’s stretching area in a   running shoes and khaki cargo shorts with pockets. After 15 minutes of stretching and BlackBerry multitasking, he moved to the weight room. By 9:24 a. m. he was wearing headphones on a stationary bicycle, pedaling at a gentle pace while watching CNN. In the   lobby, a communications adviser, Wiley Norvell, sat waiting for the mayor. At 10:23 a. m. Mr. de Blasio exited the gym wearing a suit and got into a waiting car. Mr. Norvell got in the back seat next to him. Sixteen minutes later, the mayor’s office sent reporters a statement on the Supreme Court’s ruling on Texas abortion laws. New Yorkers sometimes hear directly from their mayor while he is at the gym, as in one case when a prerecorded interview earlier that Tuesday aired at 9:30 a. m. on NY1. As his voice sounded on the television, Mr. de Blasio was working out. The mayor also conducts his weekly radio appearances with Brian Lehrer, the WNYC host, from nearby  —   occasionally in his gym clothes. That Wednesday, he hustled from the stationary bicycle and out of the gym, still in his workout cargo shorts. Minutes later, he was live on the air taking questions and calls from listeners. At the time, he was seated with his press secretary in a room at the library around the corner. On his public schedules through May, the location for at least five previous interviews with Mr. Lehrer had been listed as the Park Slope Library, suggesting a quick trip there after the gym. After the   segment, the car drove back to the gym so Mr. de Blasio could finish and change he   in a suit at 11:06 a. m. Mr. de Blasio, who sends emails to his staff throughout his workout, often does not arrive at City Hall until well after 10 a. m. On the Thursday of that week, when he got to the gym at 8:55 a. m. he walked into City Hall at exactly 11 a. m. George Arzt, the press secretary for Mayor Edward I. Koch, said the days back then began early. “Koch was at the gym at 6 o’clock,” he said. “By 7:30 we were already having a staff meeting in his office. ” But the purpose of that meeting was a briefing of the morning newspapers, Mr. Arzt said, a task that Mr. de Blasio can accomplish himself from the gym mat or the back seat of his car. (Indeed, Mr. de Blasio’s schedules often begin with a late morning call en route around 9:30 or 10 a. m. with a press aide.) When Mr. Bloomberg was mayor, he favored an early jog on a treadmill at his Upper East Side townhouse. (Mr. Bloomberg did not live at Gracie Mansion.) William T. Cunningham, a former spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, noted that Mr. de Blasio had “taken a lot of shots,” but said that his use of the Prospect Park Y. M. C. A. should not be among them. “Give the man his gym,” he said. “If he doesn’t care what it looks like, why should we?” Mr. Cunningham also suggested that New Yorkers should not expect Mr. de Blasio’s schedule to look like his predecessor’s. “We didn’t work the same way that Giuliani did,” he said. “Giuliani didn’t work the way that Dinkins did. Nobody worked the way Koch did. ” “I don’t want to be critical of it,” he added. “If he’s on a bicycle, he can still check his emails. ”",0

[Kelly shared a preview clip of the interview with Jones on her Twitter account Sunday.  In the clip, Jones defends against being called “the most paranoid man in the world,” calls the September 11 terrorist attacks in the U.

17557,Document préparatoire de la présidence russe,"Réunion du Conseil de sécurité du 28 octobre 2016
Document préparatoire de la présidence russe Réseau Voltaire | New York (États-Unis) | 27 octobre 2016 English Español русский عربي 中文 Coopération entre l’Organisation des Nations Unies et les organisations régionales et sous-régionales aux fins du maintien de la paix et de la sécurité internationales : Organisation du Traité de sécurité collective, Organisation de Shanghai pour la coopération et Communauté d’États indépendants La Fédération de Russie compte organiser, le 28 octobre 2016, un débat sur le thème « Coopération entre l’Organisation des Nations Unies et les organisations régionales et sous-régionales aux fins du maintien de la paix et de la sécurité internationales : Organisation du Traité de sécurité collective, Organisation de Shanghai pour la coopération et Communauté d’États indépendants », qui constituera un évènement phare de sa présidence au Conseil de sécurité.
Au vu de la dimension mondiale des problèmes et menaces actuels et de la nécessité d’élaborer des stratégies collectives pour les combattre efficacement, il est essentiel de renforcer la coopération entre l’ONU et les organisations régionales et sous-régionales dans le domaine du maintien de la paix et de la sécurité.
Pour ce qui est de l’ONU, il s’agit avant tout de tirer parti de son caractère universel, aussi bien au niveau de ses Membres que de ses activités, ainsi que de sa légitimité mondialement reconnue. Les organisations régionales, quant à elles, connaissent souvent mieux la situation dans les régions relevant de leur compétence et, dans de nombreux cas, sont dotées de mécanismes de prévention et de maintien de la paix adaptés aux réalités locales. Il importe à cet égard que les activités des organisations régionales tendent à trouver des solutions pacifiques et politiques aux conflits émergents.
Dans ce contexte, il est particulièrement important que l’ONU et ses principaux partenaires régionaux se coordonnent régulièrement sur les questions ayant trait au maintien de la paix et de la sécurité internationales. Ainsi, le Conseil de sécurité tient régulièrement des séances sur la coopération avec l’Union africaine, l’Organisation pour la sécurité et la coopération en Europe et l’Union européenne. Ces dernières années, un examen a également été mené sur la coopération avec la Ligue des États arabes, l’Association des nations de l’Asie du Sud-Est, l’Union des nations de l’Amérique du Sud et d’autres organisations régionales.
Comme on le sait, la collaboration entre l’ONU et ses partenaires régionaux couvre un nombre toujours plus grand de questions. Aux activités de maintien et de consolidation de la paix sont venues s’ajouter la lutte contre la prolifération des armes de destruction massive et le trafic d’armes légères et de petit calibre ainsi que la lutte contre le cyberterrorisme et la migration illégale, domaines dans lesquels la coopération entre les organisations concernées et l’ONU est de plus en plus étroite. Cette coopération joue un rôle essentiel dans le maintien de la paix et de la stabilité à l’échelle de l’Eurasie et, plus particulièrement, en Asie centrale.
C’est précisément dans ce domaine qu’œuvrent trois organisations relativement jeunes dans une vaste zone s’étendant de l’Europe orientale à l’Extrême-Orient, à savoir l’Organisation du Traité de sécurité collective (OTSC), l’Organisation de Shanghai pour la coopération et la Communauté d’États indépendants (CEI). De plus en plus influentes sur la scène politique mondiale, ces organisations contribuent considérablement au renforcement de la sécurité régionale et internationale.
Le débat sera axé sur le rôle de ces trois organisations dans la lutte contre les menaces qui pèsent sur la paix et la sécurité dans la région, notamment le terrorisme, le trafic de drogues et la criminalité organisée. Il permettra également à ces organisations de réaffirmer leur volonté de renforcer la coopération sur le plan pratique avec l’ONU, notamment avec son Centre régional pour la diplomatie préventive en Asie centrale.
L’OTSC est une structure pluridimensionnelle à même de réagir résolument aux divers problèmes et menaces actuels auxquels peuvent faire face ses États membres. À cet égard, le resserrement de la coopération entre l’ONU est l’OTSC dans le domaine du maintien de la paix est prometteur. L’OTSC déploie d’importants efforts pour renforcer ses propres capacités de maintien de la paix, qui pourront aussi être mises à la disposition des opérations de maintien de la paix des Nations Unies. Elle contribue activement, en outre, aux actions menées sur le plan international pour reconstruire l’Afghanistan après le conflit et pour écarter la menace que représentent les stupéfiants provenant de ce pays.
Ses relations avec l’ONU se révèlent fructueuses dans de nombreux domaines, comme la lutte contre le terrorisme et le trafic de drogues, le maintien de la paix ou la lutte contre la criminalité organisée. L’OTSC entretient et développe des rapports productifs avec les entités spécialisées de l’ONU, notamment le Comité contre le terrorisme du Conseil de sécurité et l’Office des Nations Unies contre la drogue et le crime.
Tous les deux ans, l’Assemblée générale adopte une résolution sur la coopération entre l’ONU et l’OTSC, et il est prévu qu’elle en adopte une à sa soixante et onzième session, au titre du point de l’ordre du jour intitulé « Coopération entre l’Organisation des Nations Unies et les organisations régionales ou autres ».
Les fondements juridiques de la coopération entre l’ONU et l’Organisation de Shanghai pour la coopération dans le domaine du maintien de la paix et de la sécurité internationales au titre du Chapitre VIII de la Charte des Nations Unies ont été posés à la suite de la signature, en 2010, de la Déclaration conjointe sur la coopération entre les secrétariats des deux organisations. Actuellement, l’Organisation de Shanghai et l’ONU collaborent étroitement dans des domaines tels que la prévention et le règlement des conflits, la lutte contre le terrorisme (l’Instance régionale de lutte contre le terrorisme relevant de l’Organisation de Shanghai œuvre à cette fin), la non-prolifération des armes de destruction massive, la lutte contre la criminalité transnationale et le trafic de drogues, et la sécurité informatique internationale.
Dans ce contexte, l’Organisation de Shanghai appuie activement les efforts déployés par la communauté internationale et les organismes des Nations Unies pour rétablir la paix en Afghanistan, se prononçant toujours en faveur du maintien du rôle central de coordination de l’ONU dans le règlement du conflit afghan.
Quant à la CEI, la sécurité et la lutte contre les menaces actuelles ont toujours été et demeurent un des domaines prioritaires de coopération entre ses États membres.
Une coopération constructive avec les organisations internationales est également essentielle pour contrer les menaces émergentes. Les pays de la CEI sont parties à tous les principaux instruments internationaux régissant la coopération dans les domaines de la sécurité, du désarmement et de la lutte contre les menaces actuelles, et contribuent efficacement à leur mise en œuvre.
Des mesures conjointes sont prises compte tenu du rôle moteur de l’ONU et de la nécessité d’établir des partenariats constructifs avec d’autres institutions internationales et leurs entités spécialisées, comme le Comité contre le terrorisme, l’Office des Nations Unies contre la drogue et le crime, l’Organisation internationale de police criminelle (INTERPOL), l’Organisation internationale pour les migrations, le Haut-Commissariat des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés et le Groupe d’action financière sur le blanchiment des capitaux.
L’élargissement et le renforcement de la coopération entre l’ONU et l’OTSC, l’Organisation de Shanghai pour la coopération et la CEI au titre du Chapitre VIII de la Charte des Nations Unies semble contribuer de manière constructive à la réalisation des objectifs de l’ONU, y compris à l’élimination des menaces et problèmes actuels. D’une part, ces organisations régionales doivent activement envisager de mettre leurs capacités au service de l’ONU et, d’autre part, l’ONU doit continuer d’accorder l’attention voulue au renforcement de la coordination et de la coopération avec ces organisations, dans le strict respect de ses propres prérogatives et de celles de son Conseil de sécurité.
Dans ce contexte, nous invitons les États Membres de l’ONU à exposer leurs idées sur les moyens de renforcer la sécurité dans la région eurasienne avec l’aide des mécanismes régionaux existants. Force est de constater que la stabilité de cette vaste région est une condition sine qua non de la croissance économique et de l’édification de l’État des pays de l’Eurasie et nous serions par conséquent reconnaissants aux délégations de nous faire part de leurs vues, notamment en ce qui concerne les liens entre sécurité et développement. Nous sommes convaincus qu’ici, dans le cadre de l’ONU, qui jouit d’une légitimité universelle, nous serons tous ensemble en mesure de proposer des stratégies novatrices visant la stabilisation des régions vulnérables, susceptibles, par la suite, d’être mises en œuvre dans d’autres régions du monde qui sont au centre des préoccupations du Conseil de sécurité.
Le Secrétaire général de l’ONU, Ban Ki-moon, le Secrétaire général de l’OTSC, Nikolaï Bordiouja, le Secrétaire général de l’Organisation de Shanghai pour la coopération, Rachid Alimov et le Vice-Président du Comité exécutif de la CEI, Serguei Ivanov, feront un exposé lors du débat. Les États membres des organisations régionales susmentionnées et les représentants d’autres États intéressés sont invités à participer à la réunion.",0
17558,Conway: Dems Trying to ’Embarrass and Humiliate’ Trump’s Cabinet Picks - Breitbart,"Wednesday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox  Friends,” incoming aide to   Donald Trump’s Kellyanne Conway said Democrats are using the confirmation hearings to “embarrass and humiliate” Trump’s cabinet nominees.

17559,Alabama’s Last Execution was an Atrocity,"Email 
The last time Alabama played God, executing death row inmate Christopher Brooks by lethal injection on January 21, 2016, The Montgomery Advertiser and al.com published a column of mine in which I wrote: “Initial reports out of Alabama are that the execution went as ‘smoothly’ as killing a reasonably healthy 43-year-old man can go. In any event, it appears there was no visible evidence Brooks suffered bodily distress as the lethal drugs were administered, prompting Alabama Prison Commissioner Jeff Dunn to say that the execution with the controversial sedative drug midazolam ‘went exactly as planned[.]” ( See “ Executions are hardly an exact science ,” on February 8, 2016, and “ Courts denied phone to attorneys of man condemned to death ,” on February 9, 2016). 
Boy, was I wrong. I was wrong just like Commissioner Dunn, and every media representative and Alabama law enforcement official in attendance was wrong – for painting Mr. Brooks’ execution as a peaceful passing, like he just curled up in a comfy hammock and dozed off – never to wake again. 
In a federal court filing on April 15, 2016, that has been inexplicably unreported in the media, Mr. Brooks’ federal defenders, who additionally represent Ronald Bert Smith (scheduled for execution on December 8), allege that after Mr. Brooks was injected with the controversial drug midazolam – the first in Alabama’s three-drug execution cocktail which is supposed to anesthetize the prisoner so that they are “insensate” (completely lacking any physical sensation) – a witness to Brooks’ execution, a federal investigator, Ms. Terri Deep, saw that “Mr. Brooks’ left eye opened after the consciousness assessment and, assuming they even noticed, no one from the ADOC [Alabama Department of Corrections] took any action.” 
The filing further alleges that: (1) “[t]he fact that Mr. Brooks’ eye opened indicates he was feeling sensation contemporaneous with, or prior to, injection of the paralytic. Therefore, he was sensate at the time he was executed by injection of potassium chloride,” (2) “[t]he final drug, potassium chloride, disrupts the normal electrical activity of the heart and induces cardiac arrest by stopping the heart from pumping blood. Potassium chloride traveling in the blood stream from the site of injection towards the heart causes an extreme burning sensation as it moves through the body destroying the internal organs,” and (3) in the event the inmate is not properly anesthetized, “potassium chloride will cause excruciating pain” (citing a 2016 report by the National Institutes of Health). 
In “ The death penalty in Alabama: What’s it really like ?,” published by The Montgomery Advertise r in April, I discussed in graphic detail what it means when lethal drugs are administered to a condemned person who is not “insensate,” a word commonly used in the death penalty context to, as the Supreme Court put it, “eliminate any meaningful risk that a prisoner would experience pain from the subsequent injections” ( Baze v. Rees , 553 U.S. 35, 49 (2008)). 
I wrote: 
“That first drug is supposed to put you down, painlessly, like a dog – your eyes just close and you ‘go to sleep’ forever. Except often, it don’t work like that. Because when that first drug don’t do the trick and your eyes close like your sleepin’, but really, you’re not, they inject them next drugs and then your muscles stop workin’, your lungs can’t breathe, and your beaten broken-down heart goes bust. And then, Jesus H. Christ have mercy, you feel it, every sharp stinging step of the way. Like your insides are melting, ‘cause they are … they’re melting from the inside out … they’re burnin’, bubblin’, liquefyin’ … like a bonfire raging inside of you … and you’re the witch. You ever hear that expression a death by a thousand cuts? The needle, the ‘big jab,’ the ‘stainless steel ride,’ – whatever you want to call this lethal injection business – it may be worse.” 
Attached to their filing pending before The Honorable Chief District Judge W. Keith Watkins, Smith and Brooks’ federal defenders have attached a sworn affidavit from Ms. Deep about her observation that “[b]efore the curtains were closed, Mr. Brooks’ left eye opened, and was still open when the execution chamber curtains were closed.” Medical experts, they allege, indicate that it is medically impossible for Mr. Brooks’ eye to have opened during his execution unless he was experiencing exactly that type of “excruciating pain” the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution forbids. 
Alabama’s Attorney General’s office, beleaguered Governor Robert Bentley, and ADOC have not, to this date, offered any substantive response to the federal defenders’ claims about what now appears to be yet another shameful example of a botched U.S. execution – in which a death row inmate was forced to suffer cruel and unusual punishment – in the name of justice. 
Tommy Arthur’s execution in Alabama, scheduled for November 3, will mimic Mr. Brooks’ gruesome demise if allowed to proceed. Ronald Bert Smith’s execution date follows closely after on December 8. Will the people of Alabama allow these executions to go forward in their name, or will they, in the name of all that is good, and all that is right, demand that Governor Bentley immediately declare a halt to all state executions? 
Why? Because Alabama may have just burned a man alive.

17562,New Head of Nutrition Gives Liverpool a Taste of Premier League Success - The New York Times,"LIVERPOOL, England  —   Jurgen Klopp did not introduce his Liverpool players to the woman who would subtly change their lives right away. When she joined the team, at the club’s preseason camp in Palo Alto, Calif. last summer, Klopp waited a couple of days, eager to see if her actions would win them over more easily than his words. “Usually, in preseason, the players eat as much as they can, as fast as they can,” Klopp said in an interview this month at Liverpool’s Melwood training base. He wanted them to slow down, not to “come, eat, go,” to leave their phones outside, to relax. After a couple of days in Palo Alto, he noticed something was different. The players, aching from his demanding conditioning sessions, were lingering at their tables. They were lining up by the salad bar, intrigued by the choices. “I had not seen that atmosphere before,” he said. “They were staying to eat, and they loved it. ” Only then did Klopp stand up in the restaurant and formally welcome his two new staff members. The first, Andreas Kornmayer, a former fitness coach at Bayern Munich, was easy. “A lot of them knew Andy,” Klopp said. “And they are used to having a fitness coach: He is the drill sergeant guy, shouting at them to run more. ” The second introduction, the one Klopp had delayed, could have been trickier. Mona Nemmer had come from Bayern, too, to be Liverpool’s head of nutrition. Such appointments can be awkward: Players can be reluctant to embrace the less familiar. Had Klopp detailed exactly what she had been hired to do, they might have been skeptical. Nemmer’s plans  —   for individualized, scientifically planned diets, for food sourced as locally and as organically as possible, for four compulsory meals a day and even for cooking lessons  —   would have been revelatory even to seasoned pros, far in advance of what most soccer clubs offer. He did not need to go into all of that, though. The food had done his job for him. A couple of days of Nemmer’s meals were all the recommendation his players needed. Casting his mind back, Klopp mimed them putting down their knives and forks, eyes bright with intense concentration. “They were eating unbelievable food,” he said. “She had already made that first impression, so they paid attention. ” Six months into her new job, Nemmer, regarded within the club as one of Klopp’s biggest summer signings, is far too modest to claim much credit for her part in   Liverpool’s blistering start to the Premier League season. She insists that she is just a cog in the machine. “All of the departments  —   medical, coaching, psychological and sports science  —   play an important role,” she said. She certainly does not regard herself as a guru. The word she returns to  —   in fluent English already tinged with Liverpool’s distinct, and apparently contagious, long vowels  —   is “holistic. ” She is there, she said, to support and dovetail with others. Her colleagues, though, are more forthcoming. Klopp insists “you do not find a lot of people like her” she has already been flown out to meet Liverpool’s owners, John Henry and Tom Werner, in Boston. Adam Lallana, the England midfielder, admits that all of his teammates “love her to bits. ” “She almost mothers us,” he said, a little bashfully. That caring, personable side is part of Nemmer’s secret. Some players  —   notably goalkeeper Simon Mignolet and left back James Milner  —   pepper her with questions, keen to learn as much as possible about what she is doing and why. She is happy to take a more discreet approach with others. “She does not try and blind us with science,” Lallana said. That does not mean, though, that the science is not there. Nemmer, 32, did not mean to go into sports. She fell into it almost by accident, after studying nutrition in her native Germany. “I learned a lot of theoretical stuff, but I was missing the practical side,” she said. “So I took an apprenticeship as a chef. ” When a chance came up to help cater for Germany’s national youth teams while they traveled to tournaments, she fit the profile: someone who knew what the players should be eating, and how to prepare it. Her work for Germany, she says, was largely basic  —   “Don’t get food poisoning while you’re away in Nigeria”  —   but it lit a fire. “I got deeper and deeper into the topic of sport, studying, doing conferences, doing another apprenticeship in sports nutrition,” she said. Her reputation in Germany soared, too, enough for her to win a job at Bayern. She spent three years there, nourishing Germany’s biggest club, before she was recommended to Klopp earlier this year. The two met near his old home in Dortmund, and clicked immediately. With Bayern in transition, to Carlo Ancelotti from Pep Guardiola, Liverpool saw an opening and lured her away. What convinced her to move was not just Klopp’s wholehearted backing, but the conviction of the club’s owners, Henry and Werner. “They have a brilliant perspective,” she said. “They are so  . Together with Jurgen, they have given nutrition an importance and respect, and they have given me the chance to try this. That is not too common. ” Nor is it cheap. Most clubs, even now, employ nutritionists only as consultants, visiting a couple of times a week. Liverpool, by contrast, has given Nemmer free rein. She has not overseen vast structural changes at its Melwood training complex, or at the club’s stadium at Anfield. The training ground cafeteria is not markedly different: a station for fresh fruit juices, a spot for granola and nuts, her famous salad bar. She has placed a juicing station in the   changing room, so players can refuel as soon as they step off the field. At Anfield, there is now a kitchen in the home dressing room, where bespoke meals can be prepared after matches. The seismic differences are below the surface. They are, first and foremost, in the food itself. “As much as we can, it is all local and seasonal,” Nemmer said. “We have a focus on real food, to keep natural nutrition as high as possible. ” When she has to, Nemmer will travel to find the best suppliers: Together with her team of chefs, she sources fish and game from Scotland, venison from Norfolk,   organic meat from Chester. “It is important for us that the animals have a great life,” she said. One of her first tasks at Liverpool was to travel to London, to find the right bakery. She eschews previously prepared food, preferring instead that sauces and dressings be made on site. Her eye for detail extends all the way down to the oil in which the food is cooked. She uses sea salt, instead of chemically treated table salt. “We want to have as much influence as possible,” she said. “What makes sense in a product, and what is beneficial. ” Certain styles of preparation  —   deep frying, for example  —   are considered “red lines,” but it is a key tenet of Nemmer’s approach that “nothing is forbidden. ” “We can have a chocolate pudding, of course,” she said. “But we can choose rice or almond milk, no powder, use a good quality cacao, molasses instead of sugar. Then you have a totally different product. ” Her emphasis is on variety, and accessibility. “It is no good telling them to eat apple, some golden raisins and oats for breakfast if they cannot find them,” she said. The canteen now, she said, has “the feel of a marketplace. ” The players can pick and choose what they want  —   as they do, for salads and juices  —   and Nemmer can be confident no choice is a bad one. The other great innovation at Liverpool is that everything is now tailored to specific players. “We are not all the same,” Klopp said, “so it makes no sense that we all eat the same. ” Nemmer, in consultation with the players, has drawn up specific diet recommendations for the entire team. They depend not just on the results of various tests  —   taking into account body fat composition, metabolic rates and the rest  —   but things like nationality, and position, too. “There are different energy levels depending on where you play on the pitch,” she said. “Goalkeepers do not run as much as midfielders. And then Brazilians, say, have a different breakfast culture to the English. Everything is broken down on different cultures, body types, positions. We have players who focus more on protein, and ones who need different types of minerals and electrolytes. ” She will tweak her menus, depending on the time of season, or even on the number of games on the schedule. Nemmer receives Klopp’s training schedules in advance she is kept    with bulletins from the club’s doctors, its physiotherapists, its fitness coaches, even its psychologists. Injured players are given different recommendations from those trying to regain fitness on the training field, or those enduring a period out of the team. It is all informal: quick chats are considered more effective than summons to her office convenient apps preferred to long questionnaires. Slowly, almost imperceptibly, Nemmer has changed habits. Instead of a candy    at halftime, Lallana, Milner and Jordan Henderson now have a slug of apple juice laced with caffeine. There is fresh pasta, with a range of homemade sauces, available after games Nemmer travels with the team on trips to ensure that the hotel can follow her menus, and under her direction the team provides meals on the bus, too. Indeed, her food has proved so popular that Klopp no longer has to force his players to stay for four meals a day at the training ground. Many take advantage of what Nemmer laughingly refers to as the “takeaway service. ” Individual players have been taught how to cook her meals at home, and there are plans to invite families in next year to spread the word. “We have even, in a wild dream, talked about opening a store, or doing a recipe book,” Klopp said. Both surely would thrive. The players might not have noticed, but they are now at the cutting edge of nutrition science. “We are not even halfway yet,” Klopp said. “But we are going in the right way. We can make this the best nutrition department in the world. I am not proud of much, but I am very proud of this. ”",0
17563,"VIDEO: LAPD Shoots from Helicopter, Kills Armed Home Invasion Suspect","Video has emerged of Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) Swat officers shooting from a helicopter and killing an armed home invasion suspect in Sunland on Monday. [According to the Los Angeles Times, LAPD Chief Charlie Beck said a woman alleged that she woke up to an intruder in her home. She fled out of a window and called police. When officers arrived, the suspect had armed himself, and a   standoff followed. A SWAT team was called in as officers attempted to negotiate with the suspect, but negotiations failed.  Beck said the home was on a hill and was “surrounded by bushes and debris,” making the SWAT team’s job difficult. Moreover, the suspect was using the elevated position to his advantage, shooting at the officers when they got close or came into sight. So the decision was made to bring in the helicopter. Officers then fired tear gas into the home, and the suspect was shot when he ran outside to get away from the gas. He exited the house about 2:45 pm: Officers on the ground and air fired on the suspect simultaneously. The Los Angeles Daily News reported that the man fell under the barrage of fire and “tumbled down a ravine. ” He was pronounced dead at the scene. According to KTLA, Chief Beck said “an autopsy would reveal how many times the    [suspect] was struck by gunfire” and whether it was from officers on the ground or those in the air.

17564,Congressional Black Caucus to Re-Hang Anti-Cop ’Police as Pigs’ Painting in Capital Citing ’Constitution’ - Breitbart,"According to a report, the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) intends to sponsor a ceremony in the U. S. Capital to   the offensive,   painting depicting police as pigs. Members of the Caucus are insisting that they are “defending the Constitution” by   the controversial artwork. [The news of the CBC’s intentions was made public by a January 9 tweet from Fox Business Network contributor Charles V Payne.  Breaking News Congressional Black Caucus to rehang ”Police as Pigs” painting tomorrow saying: ”It’s about defending the Constitution. ”  —   Charles V Payne (@cvpayne) January 9, 2017,  The painting depicting police officers as giant pigs pushing minorities around in Ferguson, Missouri, was originally hung by Missouri Democrat Lacy Clay in the tunnel of the Congressional Cannon office building of the U. S. Capitol complex. But it was recently pulled down by California Republican Duncan Hunter who said the thing fosters an “untrue narrative” that police don’t care about the public in general and minorities in particular. “This false narrative portrays law enforcement professionals as posing a danger to the very communities we serve. That is untrue and this ‘art’ reinforces this false narrative and is disrespectful on so many levels,” Rep. Hunter said after he removed the offensive painting from the wall. The Californian also said that numerous members of the Capitol Police had expressed their dismay at the painting’s inclusion in the display of art works submitted by the nation’s high schoolers to the Congressional Art Competition. Hunter also noted that Rep. Lacy can keep putting it up, but he can also keep taking it back down. Since the painting attacking police went up in the Capitol, police groups and unions have criticized the artwork and have demanded its removal. One police union called the painting “reprehensible and repugnant. ” The CBC, though, is claiming it is replacing the panting because of “the Constitution. ” “The rehanging of this painting for public view represents more than just protecting the rights of a student artist, it is a proud statement in defense of the 1st Amendment to the U. S. Constitution which guarantees freedom of expression to every American,” a statement by the CBC said. The statement also noted the offensive painting had been “removed without permission or proper authority” by Rep. Hunter. In reply to his tweet announcing the intention to   the painting, one Twitter user ruefully noted that the family of a recently murdered African American Orlando officer might not be very appreciative of the CBC’s using the Constitution as an excuse to spread hate. @cvpayne I am sure Master Sgt.

17565,"David Samson, Ally of Christie, Admits to Bribery Over Airline Route - The New York Times","David Samson, a longtime friend of Gov. Chris Christie, pleaded guilty to a felony count of bribery on Thursday and admitted that he had pressured United Airlines to operate a weekly flight to South Carolina for his personal convenience. The plea, which was offered before Judge Jose L. Linares of United States District Court in Newark, appears to put an end to Mr. Samson’s career as a public official and power broker. And it casts a shadow over the political fortunes of Mr. Christie, a New Jersey Republican who until this week had been considered a potential running mate for Donald J. Trump, the party’s presumptive nominee for president. “One of the problems with Chris Christie is there are skeletons in his closet that still have skin on the bones,” Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said. The prosecution of Mr. Samson grew out of a federal investigation into the closing of access lanes  to the George Washington Bridge in 2013. Federal prosecutors contend that allies of Mr. Christie at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey conspired to tie up traffic on the New Jersey side of the bridge to punish a local mayor for declining to endorse Mr. Christie’s bid for   as governor. Mr. Samson, who was Mr. Christie’s appointee as chairman of the Port Authority at the time of the lane closings, has not been charged in that case. But two of the governor’s former allies, Bill Baroni and Bridget Anne Kelly, are scheduled to stand trial in September for their alleged roles in the   scheme. A third, David Wildstein, has already pleaded guilty in that case. Paul J. Fishman, the United States attorney for New Jersey, declined to say whether Mr. Samson was cooperating with the prosecution of the   case. The Port Authority is the nexus of the two matters because it operates the bridge and the three big commercial airports in the New York City area. Mr. Fishman said that Mr. Samson, 76, had abused his position at the agency by coercing United to reinstate a canceled route between Newark Liberty International Airport and Columbia, S. C. near one of Mr. Samson’s homes. He said Mr. Samson had threatened to block the construction of a maintenance hangar for United at the airport unless the airline restored the “ ” flight. Tall and   Mr. Samson, a former New Jersey attorney general, spoke on Thursday in a soft voice when the judge asked if he understood that he could spend up to two years in prison and that his license to practice law might be affected. He said he did. Judge Linares scheduled a sentencing hearing for Oct. 20. Mr. Fishman said he was saddened because “David Samson was a major force in the legal community in New Jersey. ” He added, “This kind of case shakes public confidence in our institutions of government, when people who are so accomplished and who have occupied so many positions of public trust misuse their authority to get something for themselves. ” Mr. Fishman also announced that Jamie Fox, a former executive of the Port Authority and former transportation commissioner in New Jersey appointed by Mr. Christie, had been charged with conspiring to commit bribery in connection with the flight. Mr. Fox, who was a lobbyist for United, advised Mr. Samson on how to pressure the airline to acquiesce to his demand, Mr. Fishman said. In one email exchange, he said, Mr. Fox told Mr. Samson, “You have them dancing. ” Mr. Samson wrote back: “Good. I hope they dance to my tune  —   let me know if there’s a way to keep the pressure on this issue: It will save me a lot of heartache. ” The Port Authority staff had recommended that its board of commissioners approve a lease deal with United for the hangar. But Mr. Samson, who controlled the agendas of the board’s meetings, pulled the matter off the agenda in November 2011, Mr. Fishman said. Mr. Fox then advised Mr. Samson to bring it up for a vote at the December 2011 meeting to demonstrate his clout to United, Mr. Fishman said. Less than a year after the hangar deal was approved, United started flying a plane every Thursday evening from Newark to Columbia, a short drive from Mr. Samson’s home in Aiken, S. C. Every Monday morning, United flew a plane back to Newark. Mr. Fishman said that Mr. Samson used the flights 27 times. Mr. Fishman said Mr. Samson and other agency officials called the route “the chairman’s flight,” adding that Mr. Fox referred to it as “Samson Air. ” Mr. Fox, 61, faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250, 000 fine. “They both should have known better,” Mr. Fishman said of Mr. Samson and Mr. Fox. “They both did know better. ” Although Mr. Fishman said United “caved” to the pressure from Mr. Samson, neither the airline nor any of its executives will be charged in connection with the case. United agreed to pay a penalty of $2. 25 million, he said. Mr. Fishman said United had cooperated and responded just as prosecutors would have wanted. He noted that among the actions the airline took were the dismissals of several executives, including Jeff Smisek, its former chairman and chief executive. United stopped flying the route soon after Mr. Samson resigned from the agency in 2014. He retired last year from Wolff  Samson, the law firm he helped found. The firm had been very close to the state’s government for decades and had served as outside counsel to state agencies. It had also lobbied agencies on behalf of clients seeking state contracts, favorable regulation changes and approval for large development projects. The firm immediately changed its name to Chiesa, Shahinian  Giantomasi. Jeff Chiesa, one of the partners, worked for Mr. Christie in the United States attorney’s office, and as his chief counsel and attorney general. He was appointed by the governor to temporarily fill the United States Senate seat left open when Frank R. Lautenberg died in 2013. After the hearing on Thursday, Mr. Samson exhaled deeply as one of his lawyers, Justin Walder, escorted him away from the courtroom. He and Mr. Walder declined to comment. Another of Mr. Samson’s lawyers, Michael Chertoff, the former secretary of homeland security, said, “The next you’ll hear from us is at the sentencing. ”",0
17567,GERMAN INTERIOR MINISTER demands that Italy send all new illegal alien Muslim invaders back to Africa,"GERMAN INTERIOR MINISTER demands that Italy send all new illegal alien Muslim invaders back to Africa Germany’s Minister of the Interior has launched a controversial proposal to return African Muslim male invaders home rather than bringing them to Italy, in order to discourage more economic freeloaders from attempting the dangerous crossing. Even worse, Italy has been rescuing them near Libya, not even waiting until they get within spitting distance of Italy. So, where are all the women and children? @moas_eu the taxi service just outside of Libya is part of the pull factor 
— The Champ (@audioexpression) November 5, 2016 Breitbart Minister Thomas de Maizière said Sunday that those “saved in the Mediterranean should be sent back to Africa” instead of taking them to Europe. According to a spokeswoman for the minister, this measure would serve a twofold purpose: discouraging new migrants from coming while also demolishing the organizations of human traffickers that organize the crossings. Germany’s interior minister Thomas de Maiziere threatened to close Italy’s border with Austria if Rome starts sending migrants north. With the migrant route through the Balkans from Greece closed, migrants are instead crossing the Mediterranean from North African countries such as Libya and arriving in Italy. De Maizière is not alone in his approach. “The prevention of illegal migration does not start at our internal borders,” said Helmut Teichmann, director of the Germany’s Federal Police. “The aim of the federal government is to stop the refugees before they reach Europe,” he said. On Saturday, 2,200 more people tried to cross the Strait of Sicily in 16 different vessels, and were rescued in a series of operations coordinated by the Italian Coast Guard who later brought them to Italy. Rescuers also recovered ten bodies of migrants who drowned during the attempt. Critics were quick to remark that part of the incentive for attempting the crossing in the first place is the knowledge that migrant rescuers are providing a free “taxi service” to Italy. Protesters have raised their voices in opposition to De Maizière’s plan, claiming it was a “scandal” that would effectively deny potential refugees the right of asylum, but the Minister did not back down. “Eliminating the prospect of reaching Europe could keep them from risking their lives in a dangerous journey.” In point of fact, this year has seen the deaths of a record number of migrants during the perilous trip. On Thursday, some 240 migrants drowned in two shipwrecks off the coast of Libya, bringing the year’s death toll in the Mediterranean to 4,220, compared with 3,777 in the whole of 2015. The Minister suggested that once the migrants were returned to Tunisia, Egypt or other North African countries, they could submit their asylum applications which, if approved, would allow them to reach Europe safely. 
As of 2 November, 159,496 people had reached Italy by sea so far in 2016, according to the International Organization of Migrants (IOM).",0
17568,Officer’s Murder Trial in Freddie Gray Death Turns on ‘Rough Ride’ - The New York Times,"BALTIMORE  —   In opening the state’s case against Caesar R. Goodson Jr. the driver of the police van in which Freddie Gray suffered the spinal cord injury that killed him, the prosecutor uttered two crucial words: “Rough ride. ” Officer Goodson, the prosecutor said, intended to “bounce” Mr. Gray, a black man, around in the van that morning. Officer Goodson, who is also black, is facing the toughest charge  —     “depraved heart” murder  —   of the six officers accused in Mr. Gray’s death. And legal experts say the prosecution’s chances of a conviction on that count hinge in large part on being able to prove that Officer Goodson intentionally, and with disregard for Mr. Gray’s life, drove him dangerously. The defense rested its case Friday, and closing arguments are set for Monday. But just before the state rested its case earlier this week, a crucial prosecution witness said he could not say whether a rough ride had occurred  —   another indication of just how difficult the prosecution’s case may be. It has different names around the country, including “screen test” and “nickel ride. ” Since it is a colloquial term, not a legal one, the precise definition can vary. But, legal and policing experts say, there is an element of intent. “A rough ride is basically the police driving in such a manner to inflict injury or pain on the person being transported,” said A. Dwight Pettit, a lawyer in Baltimore, who has represented dozens of plaintiffs in police brutality cases, “because they have knowledge that the person is not secure in the vehicle and is usually handcuffed or possibly leg chained and therefore has no way to protect themselves. ” Geoffrey P. Alpert, a criminology professor at the University of South Carolina, said the tactic was known anecdotally as a form of punishment for unruly prisoners. “Normally,” he said, “it’s just kind of, they end up with a few bruises or, worst case, it’s a broken arm. ” On Wednesday, Stanford Franklin, a retired Baltimore police officer who was the prosecution’s key policing witness, listed some possible elements of a rough ride during  : “Sudden acceleration, sudden stops, quick turns. ” It is difficult to assess the frequency of the practice, but cities including Chicago, Philadelphia and Aurora, Ill. have settled lawsuits  related to accusations of rough rides. In Baltimore, Tessa   president of the local branch of the N. A. A. C. P. and Mr. Pettit said they had both received complaints about rough rides, although they were not always substantiated in court. Those complaints have dropped off somewhat since Mr. Gray’s story took over the headlines, increasing scrutiny of the police and raising calls for working cameras inside police wagons. Charles J. Key, a retired Baltimore police lieutenant, said that he “never saw a single instance” of a rough ride in 26 years of his career there, beginning in 1970. But in 1997, a black man named Jeffery Alston was paralyzed during a ride in a Baltimore police van. In 2004, he received a $6 million settlement from the city. In 2005, another black man, Dondi Johnson Sr. died after suffering a spinal fracture during a police ride. A jury awarded his family more than $7 million, but the award was later reduced to $219, 000. Mr. Key testified as an expert witness in both cases. Officer Goodson faces seven charges, including   “depraved heart” murder  —   meaning murder born of willful disregard for human life  —   and three counts of manslaughter. Prosecutors allege that Officer Goodson failed to buckle Mr. Gray’s seatbelt or call for medical attention, which they say could have saved his life to them, those omissions were tantamount to a crime. And they allege Officer Goodson rolled through a stop sign and took a sharp right turn so fast that the van could not stay in its lane. “He was injured because he got a rough ride,” Michael Schatzow, a prosecutor, said during opening statements, adding, “There was no good reason for the officer to repeatedly fail to seatbelt Mr. Gray except to bounce him around. ” Legal experts said it could be difficult for the prosecution to secure a murder conviction against Officer Goodson without proving that a rough ride had occurred. “The rough ride is important,” said David Jaros, an associate professor of law at the University of Baltimore, “because it tells us something about the driver’s mental state and his willingness to risk human life. ” The state has presented evidence of Mr. Gray’s devastating injuries. And with a detective, Michael Boyd, on the stand, prosecutors presented a series of surveillance videos showing the van making its way through Baltimore. But on Tuesday, during   Matthew Fraling, one of Officer Goodson’s lawyers, asked Detective Boyd if he had observed the van at any point “make an abrupt start, an abrupt stop, or an abrupt turn. ” “No, sir,” Detective Boyd answered. On Wednesday, Mr. Franklin, the prosecution witness, testified that leg shackles made it hard for passengers to brace themselves in a van, and that, without a seatbelt, “your ability to limit yourself from being a projectile in that van is very limited. ” “It’s extremely important,” Mr. Franklin added, “that that ride be as smooth as possible to prevent the person in the back from being tossed to and fro. ” Mr. Gray’s legs were shackled during most of the ride and he was not wearing a seatbelt, but prosecutors did not draw direct connections between those facts and Mr. Franklin’s testimony  —   a point that Officer Goodson’s lawyers sought to emphasize. “Is it not your contention today that Officer Goodson in any way engaged in a rough ride?” Mr. Fraling said. Mr. Franklin paused. “I can’t say. ” On Wednesday, Officer Goodson’s lawyers moved to have the charges dismissed. While it is a common move by defendants, the lawyers focused on the rough ride during their oral arguments on Thursday. “There was no evidence introduced by the state to support a theory that Officer Goodson gave Mr. Gray a rough ride,” said Andrew Graham, another lawyer for the officer, calling it a “centerpiece” of the state’s argument. When the judge, Barry G. Williams, asked Mr. Schatzow to elaborate on how the prosecution had supported its case, including the murder charge, the prosecutor turned not to the rough ride, but to what they said was Officer Goodson’s failure to buckle Mr. Gray’s seatbelt on five different occasions, suggesting a possible pivot in the state’s strategy. “Five times is enough to demonstrate depraved heart,” Mr. Schatzow said. Later, Judge Williams asked Mr. Schatzow if the state was acknowledging that it had not presented evidence of a rough ride. “The No. 1 piece of evidence is the fact that the man suffered a broken neck, and it killed him,” said Mr. Schatzow, adding that that injury, combined with the “limited” video evidence and that Mr. Gray was shackled, handcuffed and not wearing a seatbelt, made it possible to infer that a rough ride had occurred. But, he added, a rough ride was not a necessary element of the charges. “There are lots of ways to cause people to move about the compartment” in the van, he said. Judge Williams allowed the case to continue with all the charges intact, but said it was a “closer call” to let the murder charge move forward. Mr. Jaros, the law professor, said that the rough ride theory had “flatlined,” but “that doesn’t mean that they don’t have a case at least for manslaughter based on his failure to buckle and then his refusal to get medical attention. ” “There’s no question,’’ Mr. Jaros said, that “you’ve got really a horrific level of callousness to the experience of the people who are being shuttled through the system. ” “The problem is, that doesn’t necessarily satisfy a criminal charge. ”",0
17569,The Left Must Mobilize In The Face Of A Trump Victory,"American liberals are now living a nightmare they never imagined would come true: a Donald Trump presidency. Not only did Trump win, but he did so after pollsters and pundits forecasted a solid landslide victory in Hillary Clinton’s favor.
In their mind, this was not supposed to happen. The glass ceiling should have broken and their cups should have been overflowing in celebration. Instead, many are dumbfounded, unable to comprehend how things could have gone so wrong. As the hours crawled by, Clinton voters took to social media and consoled one another—“it’s still too early…she can still take Michigan…this can’t happen…” And yet, despite the prophecies of the foremost data pundits, here we are: a Trump presidency, and Republicans in control of both the House and Senate.
This demonstrable failure on the part of the Democratic Party will not be a cause for reevaluation but will be passed on to third party voters, who have long served as their proverbial whipping boy. The corpse of Ralph Nader’s 2000 campaign is still unearthed every election season to serve as bogeyman, after all.
Early on, Clinton warmed to right wing ideologues while maligning those on the left pushing for more authentic and progressive policies. Her surrogates boasted of a more efficient platform, mocking her leftist detractors as half-witted and starry-eyed.
The reinvention of Clinton as a cool and relatable pop culture icon who was still “your abuela” was a wasted effort; her campaign was a theater of pretentious absurdity that alienated those forced to straddle the intersections of race, gender, and poverty, who will face a multitude of struggles whether or not the glass ceiling shattered around them.
Clinton, and those ensnared in the sputtering limelight of her campaign, turned some the most consequential issues—from universal healthcare and police brutality to the prison industrial complex and a living wage—into detached and immaterial concerns.
This staggering loss to a candidate portrayed as both a balmy object of ridicule and a calamitous threat to numerous communities should serve as a moment of clarity, but if things are to remain guided by the reactionary sentiment we’ve seen expressed so often, then the next few years will push us further towards the edge of the cliff.
There should be no exoneration of the Democratic Party, whose funeral knell should have rung decades ago. The bourgeois liberals who have long enjoyed spreading political fan-fiction instead of mobilizing, who have denounced even the most benign criticism of Clinton as being untimely and lending credence to right wing populism, are frantic. Yet, they still take up spaces across the media landscape that they do not deserve. It is time we make them irrelevant.
As liberals apply for Canadian citizenship and drown their sorrows in bottles of maple syrup, the rest of us must organize. There is no retreating. Mourn if you must, but come hell or high water, we must mobilize.

We have copies of everything. We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that.” The NYPD Chief said once Comey saw the alarming contents of the emails he was forced to reopen a criminal probe against Clinton. “People are going to prison,” he said. Meanwhile, FBI sources said Abedin and Weiner were cooperating with federal agents, who have taken over the non-sexting portions the case from NYPD. The husband-and-wife Clinton insiders are both shopping for separate immunity deals, sources said. “If they don’t cooperate they are going to see long sentences,” a federal law enforcement source said. NYPD sources said Weiner or Abedin stored all the emails in a massive Microsoft Outlook program on the laptop. The emails implicate other current and former members of Congress and one high-ranking Democratic Senator as having possibly engaged in criminal activity too, sources said. Prosecutors in the office of US Attorney Preet Bharara have issued a subpoena for Weiner’s cell phones and travel records, law enforcement sources confirmed. NYPD said it planned to order the same phone and travel records on Clinton and Abedin, however, the FBI said it was in the process of requesting the identical records. Law enforcement sources are particularly interested in cell phone activity and travel to the Bahamas, U.S. Virgin Islands and other locations that sources would not divulge. The new emails contain travel documents and itineraries indicating Hillary Clinton, President Bill Clinton, Weiner and multiple members of Congress and other government officials accompanied convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein on his Boeing 727 on multiple occasions to his private island in the U.S Virgin Islands, sources said. Epstein’s island has also been dubbed Orgy Island or Sex Slave Island where Epstein allegedly pimps out underage girls and boys to international dignitaries. Both NYPD and FBI sources confirm based on the new emails they now believe Hillary Clinton traveled as Epstein’s guest on at least six occasions, probably more when all the evidence is combed, sources said. Bill Clinton, it has been confirmed in media reports spanning recent years, that he too traveled with Epstein over 20 times to the island. This is a big tragedy for those childrens, and more than one person should be in jail!

17572,"Sean Spicer to Media: Twitter a ‘Very, Very Effective Tool’ for President Trump","White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer continued fielding questions about President Donald Trump’s Twitter account, reminding the press that it was an effective tool for Trump during his campaign for president. [“Does he sometimes cross the line where his tweets become the news, become the agenda, and actually impedes the ability to get things done?” asked Fox News White House correspondent John Roberts during Tuesday’s White House press briefing, pointing out that “using it and using it wisely are two different things. ”  Spicer said that Trump’s use of social media was a “very, very effective tool” for communication for his millions of followers across social media platforms. “I think the same people who are critiquing his use of it now, critiqued it during the election, and it turned out pretty well for him then,” Spicer quipped.

17573,"Donald Trump, Laying Out Foreign Policy, Promises Coherence - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   Donald J. Trump, exuding confidence after his resounding primary victories in the East, promised a foreign policy on Wednesday that he said would put “America first. ” He castigated President Obama and Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state and a possible opponent in the general election, for what he described as a string of missteps that have disillusioned the nation’s allies and emboldened its rivals. Mr. Trump, the   for the Republican presidential nomination, pledged a major buildup of the military, the swift destruction of the Islamic State and the rejection of trade deals that he said tied the nation’s hands. But he also pointedly rejected the   of the George W. Bush administration, reminding his audience that he had opposed the Iraq war. “America is going to be strong again America is going to be great again it’s going to be a friend again,” Mr. Trump said. “We’re going to finally have a coherent foreign policy, based on American interests and the shared interests of our allies. ” “The world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends and when old friends become allies,” he added. “That’s what we want: We want to bring peace to the world. ” For Mr. Trump, whose campaign appearances are often a gleeful exercise in showmanship and    wisecracks, the speech had all the trappings of a serious address. Standing beneath a twinkling chandelier in a Washington hotel ballroom, backed by American flags and facing a sedate, largely   audience, a measured Mr. Trump read his remarks from a teleprompter, staying almost completely on script. But if Mr. Trump adopted establishment trappings, his speech still had an insurgent tone. He criticized allies in Europe and Asia for not bearing the burden of their own defense, he said he would try to mend fences with Russia, and he assailed his opponents for being overly aggressive in foreign affairs. Mr. Trump said he had no plans to take advice from the foreign policy elite, and his agenda reflected that  —   a mélange of ideas that defied Republican and Democratic orthodoxy. There were paradoxes throughout Mr. Trump’s speech. He called for a return to the coherence of America’s foreign policy during the Cold War. Yet he was openly suspicious of the institutions that undergirded that era. He promised to eradicate the Islamic State, but said the campaign against extremism  —   or as he called it, “radical Islam”  —   was as much a philosophical struggle as a military one. “Our friends and enemies must know that if I draw a line in the sand, I will enforce that line in the sand  —   believe me,” Mr. Trump said. “However, unlike other candidates for the presidency, foreign aggression will not be my first instinct. ” He did not mention anyone by name, though his strongest Republican opponent, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, has threatened to   the Islamic State until the desert sand glows. Mr. Trump’s speech drew negative reaction across the political spectrum. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, posted on Twitter that “Ronald Reagan must be rolling over in his grave. ” Lanhee Chen, a fellow at the Hoover Institution who advised Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, said “There was clearly an isolationist strain to the speech, but that runs into the reality of the world that we live in. ” R. Nicholas Burns, a former senior State Department official under Mr. Bush who now advises Mrs. Clinton, said, “He’s casting these thunderbolts and threats at our allies, and yet there was almost a   treatment of Russia and China. ” Even Mr. Trump’s embrace of the slogan “America first” raised eyebrows, with critics noting that it was popularized in the 1930s by the aviator Charles A. Lindbergh and other isolationists who opposed the United States’ entering World War II. “To fly the banner of America First shows that he has historical amnesia or just doesn’t understand history,” Mr. Burns said. In one of his few concrete proposals, Mr. Trump said he would convene summit meetings in Europe and Asia to overhaul NATO and rebalance nuclear security arrangements with Japan and South Korea. He did not repeat a statement he made to The New York Times that those countries should consider acquiring their own nuclear weapons. Mr. Trump was scathing about the Obama administration’s intervention in Libya, lashing Mrs. Clinton to the policy, which he said had left a security vacuum filled by the Islamic State. He also faulted Mr. Obama for his failure to enforce the red line he laid down in Syria. Yet Mr. Trump made clear he would use military force only as a last resort. “We’re getting out of the   business and instead focusing on creating stability on the world,” Mr. Trump said. On pressing issues like counterterrorism, Mr. Trump broke little new ground. He declined, for example, to give any details on how he planned to destroy the Islamic State to avoid tipping the military’s hand, beyond vowing that “they will be gone quickly. ” Mr. Trump repeated his desire to seek improved relations with Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin  —   a strategy that carried echoes of Mr. Obama’s attempt to “reset” relations with Russia after its invasion of Georgia in 2008. But he said his skills as a deal maker would make him more successful at it. “I see improved relations with Russia, from a position of strength, as possible,” Mr. Trump said. “Some say the Russians won’t be reasonable I intend to find out. ” In another echo of Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump said he would seek advice from outside the foreign policy establishment. He said he would choose “the best minds” with practical solutions, rather than people with “perfect résumés” and records of failure around the world. He did not mention any names. Mr. Trump promised to make the United States more dependable in the eye of its friends and allies, and more respected by its enemies. Yet just moments earlier, he also advocated increased unpredictability. “We have to be unpredictable,” he said. “And we have to be unpredictable starting now. ” The relatively small,   crowd consisted of journalists (seated in the back) and seven rows of guests  —   a largely    crowd that included Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a senior policy adviser to the campaign a handful of House members and Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform. Mr. Trump recently overhauled his campaign team, bringing in new advisers who have begun to impose discipline and organization to what was often a chaotic campaign. The candidate himself has taken steps toward “more presidential” behavior, as he calls it. Mr. Trump, who delights in mocking scripted candidates who use teleprompters, delivered his speech with the help of two teleprompters, and aides said he had practiced with them over the weekend. The New York billionaire worked on his foreign policy speech for more than a week, according to an aide, with the help of some advisers his campaign would not identify. “The speech is his words and his thoughts,” said Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s newly installed campaign chief. Mr. Trump was introduced by Zalmay Khalilzad, an   diplomat who was Mr. Bush’s ambassador to Afghanistan and Iraq, and is closely identified with the American wars in those countries. Mr. Khalilzad said afterward that he was not advising Mr. Trump formally or informally, and that the two men met for the first time in a holding room adjacent to where he delivered his speech.",0
17574,No Charges for Mother of Boy Who Slipped Into Gorilla Enclosure at Cincinnati Zoo - The New York Times,"An Ohio prosecutor said Monday that no charges would be brought against Michelle Gregg, the mother of a    boy whose foray into an exhibit at the Cincinnati Zoo led to the killing of a gorilla and set off a frenzy of condemnation online. The Hamilton County prosecutor, Joseph T. Deters, made the announcement at a news conference in Cincinnati after an investigation that relied on the recollections of four witnesses. “She was being attentive to her children by all witness accounts,” he said. “And the    just scampered off. ” Ms. Gregg, 32, who was also accompanied on the trip by three of the boy’s sisters on May 28, had turned her back for a matter of “seconds” when the child made a beeline for the Gorilla World enclosure, Mr. Deters said. “If anyone doesn’t believe a    can scamper off very quickly,” he said, “they’ve never had kids because they can, and they do. ” In a statement, the Gregg family said it was pleased with the decision. “This is one more step in allowing us to put this tragic episode behind us and return to our normal family life,” the statement said. “We extend thanks to all of those who have been praying for us and who have supported us through this trying ordeal and praise to God for his mercy and grace. ” Ms. Gregg had faced intense public scrutiny, as well as unrelenting invective on social media, over what some saw as her failure to block the boy from the pen. After breaching a   fence, the boy fell about 15 feet into a shallow moat and was then dragged around by Harambe, a western lowland gorilla weighing more than 420 pounds. Zoo workers, fearing for the child’s safety, shot and killed the animal. By early Monday, a petition demanding that Ms. Gregg be investigated for evidence of child neglect had nearly half a million signatures from people who called her attention to the boy “unacceptable” and “grossly negligent. ” Ms. Gregg has declined to give interviews, but in statements released through a spokeswoman, Gail Myers, the family said it had cooperated with the police investigation. The family had no plans to sue the zoo, Ms. Myers said. Witnesses at the zoo described panicked moments as Harambe at times seemed to take a protective posture with the child, but would then yank him violently by the ankle. Thane Maynard, the zoo’s director, said the boy’s head was “banging on concrete. ” In Ms. Gregg’s 911 call, she sounds frantic: “He’s dragging my son,” she says. “I can’t watch this. I can’t. I can’t. ” The screams of the crowd added another volatile element, causing Harambe to become agitated and disoriented, zoo officials said. After about 10 minutes, zoo officials made the fraught decision to kill the endangered animal, firing a single rifle shot to Harambe’s head as he stood over the boy. The boy ended up with scrapes and bruises, but no serious injuries. “This is a beautiful little boy,” Mr. Deters said on Monday, “and had they not acted and this animal behaved sometimes like animals behave, we could have had a genuine tragedy here. ” The zoo faced harsh questions over its decision to use live rounds rather than a tranquilizer dart, and was criticized for erecting a security barrier that could be so easily breached by a small boy. Mr. Maynard, the zoo director, said that the drug would not have acted quickly enough in a situation that at any second could have turned deadly for the boy. The pierce of a dart also presented a risk of startling the powerful animal, he said. The zoo has also defended the barrier around the gorilla enclosure as adequate, noting that until May it had not once been breached since the exhibit opened in 1978. Still, last week the zoo unveiled a reinforced version, raised to 42 inches and secured by wooden beams and knotted rope netting. The exhibit is scheduled to reopen on Tuesday. The Department of Agriculture and the Association of Zoos and Aquariums have both opened investigations into the episode. During his news conference, Mr. Deters defended the zoo’s decision to kill the animal: “The one thing I will say, the zoo lost a beautiful animal, one that many people in this area have enjoyed watching for a long time, but it’s still an animal. “It does not equate human life,” he added. “And they felt that this boy’s life was in jeopardy, and they made the painful choice to do what they did. ” Western lowland gorillas are considered critically endangered, with fewer than 175, 000 left in the wild in Africa. The zoo said Harambe, who was born in captivity and turned 17 the day before he was killed, was an intelligent and curious animal on his way to becoming a group leader. Last week, the Gregg family asked that people offering to send money direct it instead to the Cincinnati Zoo in Harambe’s name.",0

17578,U.S. Sues to Block Anthem-Cigna and Aetna-Humana Mergers - The New York Times,"Within a   span last summer, four of the five biggest health insurers announced two mergers totaling $85 billion. Suddenly, what was five would be three, reshaping the industry. But on Thursday, antitrust regulators said, Not so fast. United States Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch announced that the government had filed lawsuits to block the deals, between Aetna and Humana and Anthem and Cigna. The proposed mergers, she said, “would leave much of the   health insurance industry in the hands of three mammoth insurance companies. ” “If these mergers were to take place, the competition among insurers that has pushed them to provide lower premiums,   care and better benefits would be eliminated,” she said. The companies responded by vowing, in varying degrees, to fight the government’s challenge. Aetna, which had hoped to gain an advantage by being the first to reach a deal, aggressively defended its proposed merger, which it contended was different from the larger   deal that followed. “I like my chances in front of a judge,” Mark T. Bertolini, chief executive of Aetna, said in an interview. In a statement, Anthem said the Justice Department’s “action is based on a flawed analysis and misunderstanding of the dynamic, competitive and highly regulated health care landscape. ” The company said it was “fully committed” to challenging the lawsuit. But Cigna, which has appeared to be a somewhat reluctant partner in the merger, said only that it was evaluating its options within the confines of the merger agreement but did not expect the transaction to close anytime soon, “if at all. ” Anthem and Cigna declined to comment beyond their statements. The health insurers have been concerned for a few years about how the government would respond to consolidation. Anthem had mulled a merger with Cigna in 2014 but ultimately dropped the idea. They were forced to revive the combination after Humana put itself up for sale in early 2015 and “sparked a bidding frenzy in the industry,” according to the government’s lawsuit. The big five, including UnitedHealth Group, were desperate not to be left out of any potential  . After the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration’s signature piece of legislation, federal officials have kept a close eye on the sweeping changes taking place in health care. One of the major provisions of the federal law was to encourage more competition among insurers to provide people with more choices and more affordable policies. The health insurers were seeking to merge during an administration that has not been shy about quashing deals  —   especially in health care. The government has blocked mergers among large hospital systems, as well as contributed to the scrapping of the $152 billion deal between Pfizer and Allergan for tax reasons. Large deals in the energy and retail industry were also abandoned this year over antitrust. If both health insurance deals are withdrawn, 2016 would set a record for the volume of abandoned deals, according to data from Dealogic. “The Obama administration has had robust antitrust enforcement in the realm of mergers, particularly in health care,” said Matthew L. Cantor, a partner who focuses on antitrust issues at the law firm Constantine Cannon. “Anyone who’s going to attempt a horizontal merger should take note of that and particularly consider the antitrust merits of the deal. ” Mr. Bertolini of Aetna, however, had a much more skeptical view on Thursday. “There are a lot of politics in this,” he said. From the moment they were announced, the proposed mergers were met with an outcry from critics, who said the deals would lead to higher prices for consumers and would stunt innovation by the companies. Congress held hearings, and there was a concerted push by consumer advocates and others to stop the mergers. “The level of consumer opposition was impressive,” said David A. Balto, a lawyer and former antitrust official who helped lead the effort to oppose the mergers. Erik Gordon, a professor of business and law at the University of Michigan, said the lawsuits suggested that the Justice Department looked at the two mergers together in the context of the whole industry, instead of more specific markets, making it harder to justify both deals. Professor Gordon pointed to the broad statements about the health insurers contained in the suit, saying the government went beyond the typical legal arguments. It is the “most politicized antitrust case I’ve seen,” he said. The Justice Department declined to comment on whether there was any political aspect to their decisions. By looking at the deals in combination, the Justice Department makes a stronger case, said Thomas L. Greaney, the   of the Center for Health Law Studies at Saint Louis University and a former Justice Department lawyer. “There is a tactical advantage to having both cases go on at the same time,” he said, adding that the case against one merger “poisons the other. ” The insurers may not have many options to push their deals through. At its news conference on Thursday, the Justice Department made it clear that the companies’ proposals had not assuaged their concerns about competition. “There are some mergers that can be solved through divestitures, but we’ve seen nothing to suggest they can,” said William J. Baer, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s antitrust division. As a result, the companies’ best bet may be to persuade a federal judge that they should be viewed as very different in nature. The Aetna and Humana deal raises concerns largely in the private Medicare market. Those companies may have an easier time divesting themselves of assets to appease regulators. The larger deal, between Anthem and Cigna, is more vulnerable because of its size and overlap nationally, where large employers have fewer options when they pick plans for their workers. “There were substantial risks and they took risks,” said Mr. Cantor of Constantine Cannon. “The risks were very real. ”",0
17579,"Animal Protein, Pregnancy, and Childhood Obesity","Animal Protein, Pregnancy, and Childhood Obesity VN:F [1.9.22_1171] Close Transcript Transcript: Animal Protein, Pregnancy, and Childhood Obesity 
Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video. 
If you expose pregnant crickets to a predatory wolf spider, her babies will hatch exhibiting increased antipredator behavior—and, as a consequence, improved survival from wolf spider attack. The mother cricket appears to be able to forewarn her babies about the threat when they were still inside her, so they would be pre-adapted to their external environment. 
This even happens in plants. If you grow two genetically identical plants—one in the sun, one in the shade—the sun-grown plant will produce seeds that grow better in the sun, and the shaded plant will grow seeds growing better in the shade, even though they’re genetically identical. So, what we’re dealing with is epigenetics—external factors changing gene expression. 
Vole pups born in the winter come out growing thicker coats. Vole mothers are able to communicate the season to their babies in utero, and tell them to put a coat on, even before they’re born. And people are no different. You know how some people have different temperature tolerances, resulting in battles of the bedroom—do you turn the AC on or off; open the windows? It’s not just genetics. Whether you’re born in the tropics or in a cold environment determines how many active sweat glands you have in your skin. 
But what does this have to do with diet? Can what a pregnant woman eats permanently alter the biology of their children in terms of what genes are turned on or off throughout life? Or, what they don’t eat? 
What happened to the children born during the 1945 Dutch famine imposed by the Nazis? Higher rates of obesity fifty years later. The baby’s DNA gene expression, reprogrammed before birth to expect to be born into a world of famine, to conserve calories at all cost. But, when the war ended, this propensity to store fat became a disadvantage.   and don’t eat doesn’t just help determine the birth weight of the child, but the future adult weight of the child. 
For example, maternal protein intake during pregnancy may play a role in the obesity epidemic—but not just protein in general. Protein from animal sources, primarily meat products, consumed during pregnancy may increase the risk of their children growing up overweight. Originally, they thought it might be the IGF-1—a growth hormone boosted by animal product consumption—that may increase the production of fatty tissue. But weight gain was tied more to meat than dairy. 
Every daily portion of meat intake during the third trimester resulted in about an extra percent of body fat mass in their children by their sixteenth birthday, potentially increasing their risk of becoming obese later in life, independent of how many calories they ate, or how much they exercised. But no such link was found with cow’s milk intake, which would presumably boost IGF-1 levels just as high. 
So, maybe, instead it’s the obesogens in meat—chemicals that stimulate the growth of fatty tissue. Emerging evidence demonstrates that environmental factors can predispose exposed individuals to gain weight, irrespective of diet and exercise. After all, even our infants are fatter—you can’t blame that on diet and exercise. Animals too. And not just our pampered pets, even rats in labs and subways. The likelihood of 24 different animal populations from eight different species all showing a positive trend in weight over the past few decades by chance is less than one in a million. And so, it appears there’s something else going on—like obesogenic chemicals. 
One such candidate is polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons—found in cigarettes, spewing out of exhaust pipes, and in grilled meat. This nationwide study of thousands found that the more children are exposed, the fatter they tended to be. They could measure the level of these chemicals right out of their urine. And, it can start in the womb. Prenatal exposure to these chemicals may cause increased fat mass gain during childhood, and a higher risk of childhood obesity. 
If these pollutants sound familiar, I’ve covered them before, in relation to increasing breast cancer risk in the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project. So, maybe they’re not just obesogens, but carcinogens as well—perhaps explaining the 47% increase in breast cancer risk among older women in relation to a lifetime average of grilled and smoked foods. 
If you look at one of the most common of these toxins, smokers get about half from food, and half from cigarettes. But for nonsmokers, 99% comes from diet. The highest levels are found in meat, with pork apparently worse than beef. But, as you can see, even dark green leafies, like kale, can get contaminated by pollutants in the air. So, don’t forage your dandelion greens next to the highway, and make sure to wash your greens under running water. 
Now, these are fat-soluble pollutants, so need lots of fat to be absorbed. So, even heavily contaminated plant-based sources may be safer, unless you pour lots of oil on your food—in which case the toxins would presumably become as readily absorbed as the toxins in meat. 
The good news is that they don’t build up in your body. If you expose people to barbecued chicken at time zero here, you can see they get a big spike in these chemicals, like up to a hundred-fold increase, but your body can get rid of it within about twenty hours. 
The problem, of course, is that people who eat these kinds of foods every day may constantly be exposing themselves—which may not only affect their health, and their children’s health, but maybe even their grandchildren’s health. 
Being pregnant during the Dutch famine didn’t just lead to an increase in diseases among their kids, but even, apparently, their grandkids. So, what a pregnant woman eats now may affect future generations. 
The issue of generation-spanning effects of poor conditions during pregnancy may help shed some light on the explosive epidemics of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease associated with this transition towards Western lifestyles.

Epigenetics is the science of altering the expression of your genes. No matter your family history, some genes can be effectively turned on and off by the lifestyle choices you make. See, for example:

Wow! I’m speechless for once! This falls under the category of mind-blowing for me. NFmoderatorRenae 
It’s fascinating right?! HaltheVegan 
Fascinating stuff for sure. I’ve heard of epigenetics, but this takes it one step further. I’ll have to watch this video a few more times for all this to sink in :-) First question that arises: can the gene expression be changed somewhat after the child is born by what the child eats? This video implies they’re stuck with the gene expressions that are inherited at birth, depending on what the mother was exposed to. Joanne B, RD 
Hi HaltheVegan – some food for thought …. have you heard of the expression, “genes load the gun, the environment pulls the trigger” ? plant_this_thought 
Strictly speaking, epigenetics concerns itself only with traits that are not inherited. It has to do with gene expression as influenced by environmental factors. The fetal environment influences genetic expression in the unborn baby, and whatever environment the newborn and growing child encounters will continue to affect, for better or worse, its genetic expression. :) baggman744 
Not inherited? plant_this_thought 
baggman744: Correct. Two individuals with identical DNA can exhibit very different traits depending on their environment. These differences are then said to be attributable to epigenetic factors, and in many cases they are reversible. It becomes more complicated when epigenetic factors result in a genetic mutation, an actual change in the DNA. Genetic changes have roughly 100,000 times the permanence of epigenetic ones. NFmoderatorRenae 
I just wrote the same thing haha I love it! Wade Patton 
The sooner we all move away from the idea that genetics are a “LOCK” on anything, the sooner well have a better understanding of the interplay amoungst all the factors affecting expression. I read a good book on it just a few years back, but cannot recall the title at this moment. Blair Rollin 
T. Colin Campbell talks a lot about this in “The China Study” and “Whole”. Mutated genes aren’t a problem if they don’t express themselves. Cancer cells aren’t a problem if they don’t proliferate. This is obviously true. But, my understanding of, what Campbell says is that what causes expression of mutated genes and what causes cancer cell proliferation is animal protein. Particularly bad is casein, dairy protein (we have learned also on NF how dangerous dairy is in other ways). He says that a very small percentage of cancers are genetic. (Just a couple of percent as I remember?) NFmoderatorRenae 
The best explanation I have heard is from Dr Neal Barnard- ‘Genetics load the gun, but diet/environmental/lifestyle pull the trigger’. So genes may give you predispositions, but in most cases (particularly with chronic diseases) YOU still have the CHOICE as to what the outcome is :) HaltheVegan 
Thank you for the explanation. That is the understanding I had before I watched this video. I remember the Dean Ornish study where cancer genes were “turned off” with a plant based diet. So I still agree with the interpretation that genes can expressed or not expressed due to diet (ie. internal environment). But what threw me off in this video is the statement: ” even our infants are fatter—you can’t blame that on diet and exercise.” This statement seems to be saying that the infants were fatter regardless of what they ate or how much exercise they got. Similarly with the sweat gland example in the video. If one is born in a cold environment, then the person will have fewer active sweat glands. Do the inactive sweat glands become active when one moves to a warm climate? How long would it take? Or will the person always feel hotter because he/she has fewer active sweat glands. These are simply rhetorical questions. Seems to me this is a very fertile area for continued research! Alexandre 
Ok but werent they during the famine eating less of animal protein? Im confused Tom Goff 
They were eating fewer calories overall so yes they were consuming less animal protein. 
It is important to remember that most things don’t usually have just a single cause. Starvation in parents.may predispose offspring to obesity. Chronic exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by parents may also predispose offspring to obesity. Alexandre 
I understand that.. but its still confusing.. so the best way to make sure your kids wont be obese is to be obese yourself so their body wont feel the need to store as much energy? confusing Tom Goff 
No. It does not follow that parents must be obese so that their children are not. 
In fact there is some evidence from animal studies that, if you do not want your children to be obese, you must not eat a high fat diet. 
The best thing that you can do is maintain a healthy weight, eat a healthy diet and follow a healthy lifestyle. And teach your kids to do the same. plant_this_thought Lori Tompkins 
I’m 99% vegan and I’ve recently read about the woes of Lectins, which my vegan diet is high in. I don’t see Lectins discussed on this site and would really like Dr. Greger’s take on this subject. A low lectin diet seems to be more meat oriented. Thea 
Lori Tompkins: I found one blog post on NutritionFacts which talks about lectins. Here is a quote: 
“Modern paleo advocates claim that these foods weren’t part of Paleolithic-era diets, but new research challenges that assumption.5 They also argue that lectins naturally present in these starchy foods are harmful to human health. Consuming too many lectins can cause significant gastrointestinal distress. However, because legumes and grains are almost always consumed in a cooked form—and lectins are destroyed during cooking—eating beans and grains doesn’t result in lectin overload. Sprouting also reduces lectin levels in plants, although not as effectively as cooking. Generally, pea sprouts, lentil sprouts, and mung bean sprouts are safe to consume, as are sprouted grains, which are naturally low in lectins. Most larger legumes contain higher amounts and should be cooked. ” from: http://nutritionfacts.org/2014/09/23/will-the-real-paleo-diet-please-stand-up/ 
Since I eat my grains and legumes cooked, I consider the lectin brouhaha to be much ado about nothing. Todd 
@disqus_EXJURIXKLQ:disqus I don’t think it’s quite true that lectins are destroyed during cooking, but they are significantly reduced, and the more thoroughly they are cooked the more the lectins are reduced. But many lectins are fairly heat resistant, so it’s not an all-or-nothing situation. I’ve noticed that occasionally when I cook black beans in the Instant Pot, I get some transient gastric distress, probably because they weren’t quite well done enough. 
There is one thing, however, that consistently causes me to have gastric distress: ground flax seed. I know it’s an important source of omega-3, but when I put it in food I invariably experience a stomach ache for ten or fifteen minutes. I’m pretty sure it’s the lectin content. 
I think there’s still a lot we don’t understand about how lectins affect the body. We tend to assume that they are “bad,” since they are part of the plant’s self-defense against being eaten. But we used to say the same about phytates, which we now know to have positive aspects as well for health. Thea 
Todd: I don’t have any references one way or another to say whether or how much cooking destroys lectins. Brenda Davis and Vesanto Melina are usually pretty careful with their words on these topics, but maybe they got lazy in that sentence and only some lectins are destroyed. Either way, I’m not aware of a body of evidence that says the general human population needs to worry about the lectin content of our cooked beans, intact grains, or raw nuts and seeds. 
Of course, if you are getting a reaction from eating a certain food, say ground flaxseed, you need to consider that situation regardless of what is in the flaxseed that is causing it. I wonder if you ate your flaxseed in something cooked (like a muffin?) if that would help your tummy issue??? I have no idea if that’s a good suggestion or not. Just trying to be helpful. Vege-tater 
Mind blown here too, the poor grandkids! Pretty disconcerting also how many potent chemicals are now ubiquitous and the myriad of effects…and we are supposed to be the brainy species? NFmoderatorRenae 
Scary isn’t it?! Heidi 
Interesting. However, this does not account for the fact that Americans have been eating animal protein going back to the 1800s. However, the obesity epidemic has only started in the 1980s. People were consuming a lot of animal protein in the 1950s and 60s, but very very few Americans were obese. You can tell by looking at the photos of that time as well. However, the difference came with the addition of sugars and high fructose corn syrup as well as a high intake of fatty carb rich foods like fries and chips. Fructose is leading contender. We can see the rise in obesity related to the rise in sugar consumption world wide. Hunter gatherer societies that consume animal protein but do not consume processed sugars do not gain weight and are no obese. However when those people are introduced to processed foods with sugars added they immediately gain weight and become obese. When looking at the overall picture, fatty meats, fried chicken and fish for sure would be a factor, but the sugars issue shows a much closer connection to the problem. linda 
hello Heidi, I thought you might be interested in this usda brochure that tables the increase in meat since the 1950s as 57 lbs per person per annum to the year 2000. A huge rise in cheese consumption fro 7.7lbs to close to 30 lbs ! per year for the same time period. http://r.duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1&uddg=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usda.gov%2Ffactbook%2Fchapter2.pdf Foroogh – NF Moderator 
This video by Dr. G. is very educational about Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons and childhood obesity. Also Heidi you make a good point about sugar and sugar industry in contribution towards obesity in the 1980’s era to which I also like to add salt, processed food, meat, dairy, egg industries have great part to play in confusing general public about nutrition. Big Salt – Getting to the Meat of the Matterhttp://nutritionfacts.org/video/big-salt-getting-to-the-meat-of-the-matter/ NFmoderatorRenae 
If you look at Agricultural data, the amount of animal products consumed has increased greatly since the 1800s. John 
The size of the animals is larger, they aren’t running around on pasture, they are creating an environmental mess, and it is cheaper to eat this kind of meat. John S Tom Goff 
This is just keto and paleo ideology. There is no solid science to support it apart from some spurious observational correlations, misrepresented studies and industrial-strength speculation. People may have been consuming a lot of animal protein in the 1950s and 1960s but cardiovascular disease death rates were very high then. There was less obesity simply because people consumed fewer total calories then than in later decades..",0
17580,"Nuclear Plants, Despite Safety Concerns, Gain Support as Clean Energy Sources - The New York Times","Just a few years ago, the United States seemed poised to say farewell to nuclear energy. No company had completed a new plant in decades, and the disaster in Fukushima, Japan, in 2011 intensified public disenchantment with the technology, both here and abroad. But as the Paris agreement on climate change has put pressure on the United States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, some state and federal officials have deemed nuclear energy part of the solution. They are now scrambling to save existing plants that can no longer compete economically in a market flooded with cheap natural gas. “We’re supposed to be adding   sources, not subtracting,” Ernest Moniz, the energy secretary, said recently at a symposium that the department convened to explore ways to improve the industry’s prospects. As a result, there are efforts across the country to bail out nuclear plants at risk of closing, with important test cases in Illinois, Ohio and New York, as well as proposed legislation in Congress. Exelon, one of the country’s largest nuclear operators, for example, is deciding whether to close two of its struggling plants in Illinois after efforts to push a bailout through its Legislature fell apart. Nuclear power remains mired in longstanding questions over waste disposal, its safety record after the catastrophes at places like Fukushima and Chernobyl, and the potential for its plants to be converted into   factories. In spite of the lingering issues, policy makers, analysts and executives, along with a growing number of environmentalists, say that at stake is the future of the country’s largest source of clean energy. “Nothing else comes close,” Mr. Moniz, a nuclear physicist, said at the symposium. In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Moniz added, “Maintaining the nuclear fleet is really important for meeting our   and midterm goals. ” Renewable sources like solar and wind have grown in popularity in recent years, but nuclear plants provide nearly 60 percent of   power, followed by hydroelectric plants at roughly 18 percent, according to the Energy Information Administration. In addition, nuclear plants, which can produce power steadily and on demand, run at more than 90 percent of their capacity, higher than any other type of plant, including gas and coal facilities. They also have the advantage of keeping fuel   which allowed them to supply electricity during the extreme cold of the polar vortex in 2014, when the use of natural gas for heating led to shortages and when some coal plants shut down because of frozen fuel or equipment. In recent years, a rise in greenhouse gas emissions has tended to follow nuclear plant closings, since they are most often replaced by natural gas, industry executives say. This was the case in California and New England after the San Onofre and Vermont Yankee plants folded. But the nuclear industry is facing a crisis of old age. The majority of the country’s 99 nuclear reactors are more than 30 years old and were opened before deregulation. Starting in the late 1970s, under federal rules established to help reduce the price of electricity, independent power producers gained the ability to compete in wholesale electricity markets. When prices were relatively high, nuclear plants were able to fare well because their facilities, once up and running, were inexpensive to operate. However, the recent slowdown in the demand for electricity and the glut of natural gas from the rise in fracking has driven down wholesale prices. That lower revenue poses special challenges for nuclear plants, which operate potentially for as long as 80 years, and so require costly upgrades and repairs during their life spans. “At these prices,” said Jay Apt, a professor and a director of the Electricity Industry Center at Carnegie Mellon University, “they can’t save up enough to have cash on hand for periodic capital investments. ” Supporters of the bailouts say the current prices undervalue nuclear power, given the method’s lack of greenhouse gas emissions and ability to operate at all hours. The low prices make it hard for the plants to compete with other clean technologies like wind and solar, which receive subsidies and are bolstered by mandates that require purchases of clean power. They argue that the environmental and efficiency value of nuclear plants mean they should be eligible for similar subsidies or be included in clean energy mandates. “We get no recognition for the fact that we emit nothing,” said Marvin S. Fertel, chief executive of the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry trade group. Support for plans to save nuclear energy has come from a seemingly unlikely group  —   environmentalists, some who have come to believe that the climate benefits of nuclear energy far outweigh the risks. Michael Shellenberger, president of Environmental Progress, a nonprofit research and policy organization, said that because nuclear plants produce so much more energy than other forms, they can be more environmentally friendly than even renewables when all the mining, development and land disturbances are taken into account. “Those of us who have changed our minds on it have changed most often on the climate stuff,” Mr. Shellenberger said, “but from the whole   analysis, it’s just better. ” Opponents argue that the industry has already had decades of support, which made many of the companies that own the plants profitable, and that further subsidizing nuclear energy would take momentum and investment away from renewables like solar and wind. “We need to be building the   energy system and not continuing to subsidize the energy system of the past,” said Abraham Scarr, director of the Illinois Public Interest Research Group, a consumer advocate. Without help, nuclear officials say, there will be far less nuclear power. Two Exelon plants, Quad Cities in Illinois and Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, for instance, were unable to submit winning bids in a recent auction to meet future energy needs in the PJM territory, covering 13 Middle Atlantic and Midwestern states and the District of Columbia. After the auction, Christopher M. Crane, chief executive at Exelon, said that by itself the market “can’t preserve   emitting nuclear plants that are facing the lowest wholesale energy prices in 15 years. ” Exelon pressured the Illinois State Legislature to approve a raft of energy measures, including extra subsidies for nuclear as a   energy source, by the end of May or risk the shutdown of the two plants. However, the proposals never came up for a vote. Exelon, which has not yet announced a decision on the plants, is hardly the only company seeking more income for its facilities. In March, Ohio regulators approved plans between the utilities and power generation subsidiaries of FirstEnergy and AEP that guaranteed set rates for power from some struggling nuclear and coal plants, even if other plants in the market charged less. But federal regulators blocked the arrangement pending a review. FirstEnergy is now pursuing an amended version, which executives hope will go forward with state approval alone. It would allow the company to charge customers for the shortfall between the costs to operate the plants and the market rate it receives over the next eight years customers would receive credit if the rate rose above the costs. In New York, officials are taking a different approach. Public hearings were held last month on a proposed clean energy mandate that would include an credit paid to nuclear operators, aimed at helping keep upstate plants like FitzPatrick in Oswego County in operation. The Exelon proposal in Illinois followed a similar logic but attracted a number of critics  —   including the state attorney general, Lisa Madigan  —   who said that customers had paid for the plants twice and should not have to pay again, especially when Exelon’s overall finances may not be so dire. “The disruption in these communities if Exelon decides to shut down the plants is very significant and has a human consequence,” said Dave Lundy, a Chicago public relations executive who leads a coalition opposed to the proposal. “But I don’t know that they actually have to shut down these plants. ”",0
17581,Nigel Farage Responds to Racism Accusations by Kike Media,"Sky News: Kay Burley, 55 interviews Nigel Farage 
Nigel Farage: 
The Labour Party, historically, was there to look after working communities in this country, and it's given all of that up in favor of an open door to southern and eastern Europe. 
Sky News Female: 
But isn't that racist? 
Nigel Farage: 
I don't think it is. No. I don't think it can be deemed as such in any way. 
But we've never in our history had a complete open door, and now we have one to 485 million people. 
I don't think, in terms of common sense, that really adds up. 
Sky News Female: 
But if you're a 'racist', according to the Oxford English dictionary, it means that you have or are showing the belief that a particular race is superior to another. 
Presumably, if you're saying that British people should have jobs above east Europeans, you're suggesting that they're superior and, as a result, that's racist. 
Nigel Farage: 
Well, actually, this is a big argument in London amongst the Afro-Caribbean community, fifty percent of whose youngsters haven't got jobs. 
And that same survey that was done recently showed over 60% of the settled ethnic minorities in this country also believe that we have got to have some degree of control. So this crosses all boundaries within this country. 
Sky News Female: 
OK, you're getting bogged down in the figures, again. 
And, as I said, remember to what happened to Mr Clegg when he did that. [hand gesture] 
I've given you the definition of 'racist'. [hand gesture] 
You've told me what you thought about the fact that British workers should have a superior chance of getting a job above European workers, whether they're from eastern Europe or whatever, and that is quite simply a 'racist' comment. 
Nigel Farage: 
No, it isn't. It is a job of the British government, firstly, to defend the realm and, secondly, to put the interests of the people that live in this country, first. 
That's what we should be doing, and I'm afraid we've turned out backs on that over the course of the last few years, which has led to much, much unhappiness among millions of families. 
... 
How can anyone take more of this ludicrous 'racist' propaganda any longer? 
What they refer to as 'racism' is protection of the vital interests of oneself and of one's own kind, in one's own land. 
As if an Afro-Caribbean settlement belongs in any normal European society? 
As if European interests may only be defended using the shield of the interests of the non-European invaders themselves? 
How can European man not see this for what it is, and how can European man allow himself to be subjugated to this degree?",0
17582,В России впервые успешно испытали гиперзвуковую ракету,"Политика » Силовые структуры » Министерство обороны Гиперзвуковой летательный аппарат, известный как ""изделие 4202"" или ""15Ю71"" 25 октября впервые успешно прошел испытания в ходе стрельб из пускового района Домбаровский в Оренбургской области по камчатскому полигону Кура. Все бортовое оборудование, электронные комплексы, а также система управления полностью состоят из российских комплектующих. 0 комментариев 5 поделились 
Как пишут ""Известия"", оружие способно развивать на максимальной высоте скорость порядка 15 Max, или 7 км/сек. Аппарат предназначен для установки на перспективные межконтинентальные баллистические ракеты, вместо традиционных боеголовок. ""4202"" начинает работать на высоте порядка 100 км и летит к цели на скорости 5-7 км/с. А перед входом в плотные слои атмосферы непосредственно над целью гиперзвуковой летательный аппарат совершает сложный маневр, который затрудняет его перехват средствами противоракетной обороны. 
Отметим, проект гиперзвуковых боевых блоков под названием ""Альбатрос"" появился в СССР еще в середине 1980-х годов, как ответ на попытку США создать противоракетную оборону в рамках концепции ""Звездных войн"". Однако, из-за технических сложностей проект был закрыт. В середине 1990-х годов Научно-производственное объединение(НПО) машиностроения возобновило разработку, но уже под обозначением ""4202"". 
По словам источников в госкорпорации ""Роскосмос"", проведению успешных летных испытаний гиперзвукового летательного аппарата предшествовала обширная программа импортозамещения. Пришлось избавиться от системы управления, ранее изготавливаемой харьковским предприятием ""Хартрон"", и некоторых других комплектующих. Успешно реализованная программа дала возможность возобновить испытания. Сейчас бортовое оборудование, электронные комплексы, а также система управления теперь полностью состоят из российских комплектующих. 
Как рассказал главный редактор интернет-проекта Militaryrussia Дмитрий Корнев, в ""4202"" изначально было не так уж и много иностранных комплектующих, однако ключевой элемент изделия — система управления, контролирующая полет летательного аппарата, выполнение им гиперзвукового маневра и наведение на цель, изготавливалась украинским предприятием. 
""НПО машиностроения начало разработку новой системы управления еще в 2014 году. Вероятно, ее начали испытывать в 2015 году, однако оба пуска ""4202"" прошли неудачно. 25 октября нынешнего года пуск удался, что свидетельствует об успешной работе НПО маш по импортозамещению"", — сказал Корнев ""Известиям"". 
Ранее Pravda. Ru писала, что гиперзвуковое оружие к 2020 году должно поступить на вооружение российской армии. Развитие высокоскоростных зенитных ракет привело к тому, что практически любой современный самолет или даже ракета могут быть с высокой долей вероятности перехвачены и сбиты на любой высоте. Ну, а выход из создавшегося положения может быть только один — создать летательные аппараты способные лететь быстрее ракет-перехватчиков. 
Вот поэтому-то ведущие державы мира, такие как США, Россия и Китай в спешном порядке занялись созданием гиперзвуковых летательных аппаратов разных типов и предназначения, то есть включились в очередное противоборство ""меча и щита"". 
Китай, например, еще 9 января 2015 года испытал гиперзвуковой планер WU-14, запускаемый в космос при помощи межконтинентальной баллистической ракеты. Затем развивая скорость в 10 М, то есть более 12,3 тыс. км/ч он сверху пикирует на цель. Современные средства противовоздушной обороны летящую на такой скорости цель отследить и перехватить не могут. 
Так что теперь и Китай стал третьей в мире страной, после России и США, у которой есть технологии гиперзвуковых носителей как ядерного, так и обычного оружия. По сути, у китайцев получалась боеголовка с управляющими поверхностями, которая может маневрировать в полете и потому-то она и практически неуязвима. Но собственного двигателя у этого аппарата нет, так что это очередное оружие для ""самых бедных"". 
В России же идут работы над ракетами разных типов с гиперзвуковыми прямоточными воздушно-реактивными двигателями (ГПВРД), которые можно будет запускать с земли, с кораблей или с боевых самолетов.

17583,Health Officials Split Over Advice on Pregnancy in Zika Areas - The New York Times,"As the Zika virus bears down on the United States, federal health officials are divided over a politically and ethically charged question: Should they advise American women to delay pregnancy in areas where the virus is circulating? Some infectious disease experts are arguing that avoiding conception is the only sure way to prevent the births of deformed babies, according to outside researchers who serve on various advisory panels. Women’s health specialists, on the other hand, counter that the government should not tell women what to do with their bodies. Indeed, federal health officials have never advised all the women in a region of the country to stop having children. Moreover, they say, most babies conceived during Zika epidemics in Latin America have been born healthy. Several federal experts central to the discussion declined to be interviewed for this article. Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, described the internal debate as “a very long conversation. ” For now, “we do not have a recommendation to not become pregnant,” Dr. Frieden said at a “Zika summit” held recently at disease agency headquarters in Atlanta. “We do recommend access to contraception. ” On Wednesday, the agency confirmed what many experts already believed: that the   virus, which is usually mild in adults, can cause severe brain damage in infants. In view of the gathering evidence, health officials in some countries struck by Zika epidemics, including El Salvador and Colombia, have urged women to avoid pregnancy. Dr. Marcos Espinal, who directs the Zika response of the Pan American Health Organization, an arm of the World Health Organization, said in an interview that he thought advising women to avoid conception during an epidemic’s relatively brief peak months, as Colombia did, “is sound advice. ” Yet the W. H. O. does not follow that policy. Dr. Bruce Aylward, the agency’s head of emergency response, called avoiding pregnancy “a complicated decision that is different for each individual woman. ” Currently, the question affects Americans only in Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands and American Samoa, where the Zika virus is circulating locally. But if the virus spreads as expected this summer, women in Hawaii and many Gulf Coast states may also be faced with tough choices. Despite the C. D. C. ’s stance, Puerto Rico’s health secretary, Dr. Ana Ríus, has been advising women to avoid pregnancy, although she has done so in public interviews, not in a large health campaign. Women on the island may be following her advice, she said preliminary figures indicate that there are 8 percent fewer pregnancies than there were at this time last year. For women living on those islands, the disease agency’s current guidelines do not advocate delaying pregnancy, instead calling the timing of conception a “deeply personal and very complex decision” and suggesting that women consult their doctors for “pregnancy planning. ” But tourists visiting the islands receive specific advice to avoid pregnancy for eight weeks after a visit, and for six months if male partners have had symptoms of Zika infection. One expert familiar with the debate, Michael T. Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, described it as “two groups describing an elephant, one looking at the head and the other at the tail. ” Dr. William Schaffner, the chairman of department of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical School, who also described the outlines of the split, said that withholding conception advice might leave couples adrift. “They have to think it through by themselves,” he said. “They may hear it from their doctors or mothers or friends at the beauty parlor, but not from the C. D. C. ” Advocates of delaying pregnancy give several reasons. First, they do not believe that even the most aggressive   efforts can protect pregnant woman 24 hours a day for nine months. No country yet has stopped dengue or chikungunya, which, like Zika, are spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, and the disease agency itself has warned that reductions of 80 percent to 90 percent in those mosquito populations sometimes does not reduce disease transmission. Second, no vaccine is expected to be ready for at least two years. Third, evidence is mounting that Zika outbreaks are intense but brief. In French Polynesia in 2013, the virus infected 66 percent of the population within seven months and then disappeared. Because women who recover from Zika appear to be permanently immune, experts argue that delaying conception spares them the risk of having a child with severe birth defects, along with the agonizing worry  —   and lets them conceive safely a year later. “It’s a ” said Dr. Peter J. Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. “They should say, ‘Don’t get pregnant  —   watch TV for six months and you won’t have a badly hurt baby. ’” In framing the language of the guidelines, Dr. Frieden said he was “guided by the perspective” of Dr. Denise J. Jamieson, a medical officer in the disease agency’s division of reproductive health. In an interview, Dr. Jamieson described birth defects as a rare complication of Zika infection. Even during an epidemic, she said, “most women will have healthy babies. ” Further, Dr. Jamieson said, delays “would also prevent wanted pregnancies,” especially in older women struggling with fertility, for example. Advice from government doctors on such personal decisions, she added, “is not likely to be effective. ” Asked what advice she would have given during the last American rubella epidemic  —   which killed or severely handicapped an estimated 20, 000 babies  —   she answered: “I would have said, ‘This is an extraordinarily risky time to get pregnant.’ ” But she does not endorse giving the same advice this time, she said, because rubella was unavoidable in those prevaccine days, whereas now, “highly motivated women can take measures to avoid mosquito bites. ” Local health officials have offered a variety of perspectives. In the United States Virgin Islands, Michelle S. Davis, the territory’s new health secretary, said she had not advocated pregnancy delay, although individual doctors may be doing so. The story has played out differently in Puerto Rico, where the C. D. C. has said there could be thousands of pregnant women infected by late summer. Dr. Ríus, the health secretary, suggested in several public interviews that women delay conception until more is known about the virus. She also instructed public clinics to distribute condoms. She was accused of alarmism, and the island’s Roman Catholic archbishop criticized her condom plan. But in an interview at the Atlanta summit meeting, she said that a new pregnancy surveillance network created by the disease agency for the epidemic suggested that women there may be heeding her advice. Births are expected to number 28, 000 this year, below last year’s total of 30, 323. Prominent gynecologists in Puerto Rico also are advising patients to avoid pregnancy. Dr. Jose Alvarez Romagosa, a fertility specialist at the Auxilio Mutuo Hospital in San Juan and star of a popular television show, “Latin Doctors,” said he had dissuaded three patients from conceiving in a single day. Dr. Manuel Navas, a fertility specialist and medical director of   Pablo Hospital in Fajardo, a town where some of the island’s earliest Zika infections were detected, said he, too, was discouraging most patients from conceiving unless they were desperate for a child and he was sure they understood the risks. That was the advice he would give his daughter, he added. Asked how his patients reacted, he said, “They appreciate it. ”",0

The temporary ban is meant to allow the U. S. government to properly vet individuals listed on it. The countries listed in the initial ban are Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen Iraq has since been taken off the list. The U. S. Department of Justice is appealing Judge Watson’s decision. According to the Associated Press, U. S. Justice Department spokesman Ian Prior clarified Sessions’ statements in an email, saying the attorney general was questioning one judge’s ability to block the president’s executive order for the travel ban. “Hawaii is, in fact, an island in the Pacific  —   a beautiful one where the Attorney General’s granddaughter was born,” Prior said. “The point, however, is that there is a problem when a flawed opinion by a single judge can block the President’s lawful exercise of authority to keep the entire country safe. ” In a Sunday interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos on “This Week” about why he referred to Hawaii as an “island in the Pacific,” Sessions said, “Nobody has a sense of humor anymore. ” Follow Adelle Nazarian on Facebook and Twitter.",0

Tulsi Gabbard ( ) said she was “doing her homework” on the impeachment process of President Donald Trump but warned President Mike Pence would potentially push through a more conservative agenda.  Gabbard said, “On the issue of impeachment, I am doing my homework. I am studying more about the impeachment process. I will just say I understand the calls for impeachment, but what I am being cautious about and what I give you food for thought about is that if President Trump is impeached, the problems don’t go away, because then you have a Vice President Pence who becomes President Pence. If you do your research on positions on many of the issues we’ve talked, many of the issues that I get phone calls about from people all across the state, the issue of war and peace, he’s about as hawkish as they come. ” “Issues relating to the environment, education, healthcare  —   I disagree with so many of the positions that he has. And in some ways given the fact that he’s a former member of Congress and very well connected within the Republican establishment in Washington, he’d be able to, I believe, be far more effective in furthering his agenda than we have seen so far in President Trump’s first 100 days,” she added.

Officials called the March 22 attack at the Birmingham open plan UK Athletics office “frenzied” and “wholly unprovoked,” yet was also a “cool and calculated attack. ” The attacks came after Jeska faced having her series of wins vacated because she refused to supply blood tests to prove she had a woman’s level of testosterone in her system at the time of her victories. “We understand Jeska had been asked to provide further evidence of hormone levels after historical complaints to UK Athletics that she had an unfair advantage competing in women’s events because she had been born a man,” Detective Sergeant Sally Olsen said after the latest hearing. “The governing body’s policy required the athlete to take a blood test but she took exception to this and feared being unable to compete,” Olsen added.

The MostDamagingWikileaks.com Reports : 
The person who wrote the superdelegate rules advises the Clinton Campaign how to create an illusion that Bernie people won something so they would work hard for Hillary after she is nominated. More shocking is the fact that they admit that the superdelegates are undemocratic. This guy flat out admitted that he rigged the system, and is proud of it. 
There was also a man who was acting as a mole for Bernie and writing positive/negative things about him then using that reputation to sway Bernie supporters to Hillary. 
Lastly, we see how to rig the debate schedule to be more favorable to her. One on one debates would have been better for Bernie Sanders, so they wanted to avoid that at all costs. They also wanted to limit the number of debates, and start them late to minimize the impact of the debates.

18. Clinton Foundation schemed with Big Pharma to keep the price of AIDS drugs high in America and cheaper generic versions out 
https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/24440 
“Since President Clinton’s comments were made, we have been contacted by a number of advocacy groups who are now intending to wage a public campaign to bring in generics and lower drug prices. We do not feel we can participate in this without jeopardizing our work around the world. We cannot oppose what they might do, but we also cannot be publicly supporting it either.” 
“we think that publicly pressuring the US and European AIDS drug companies to lower prices and bringing pressure to allow generic AIDS drugs into the United States will have limited if any success and could seriously jeopardize our negotiations to continually lower prices in poor countries… We have always told the drug companies that we would not pressure them” 
""We have always told the drug companies that we would not pressure them and create a slippery slope where prices they negotiate with us for poor countries would inevitably lead to similar prices in rich countries."" 
""we suggest that we approach the innovator companies that can currently sell products in the US with the idea of making donations to help clear the ADAP lists."" 
""the companies will likely favor a donation approach rather than one that erodes prices across the board. I would guess that they would also likely favor a solution that involved their drugs rather than an approach that allowed generic drugs from India to flood the US market at low prices or one that set a precedent of waiving patent laws on drugs."" 
The MostDamagingWikileaks.com Reports : 
When the Clintons are questioned about the obvious sketchiness of their foundation, they routinely cite AIDS work. But the AIDS work is carried out by CHAI (""Clinton Health Access Initiative""), a separate organization. 
CHAI freely admits there is an implicit agreement with the drug companies not to pressure them to lower domestic prices. Bill Clinton made comments that added pressure. CHAI receives a great amount of positive publicity for their AIDS work abroad, and the comments jeopardize that program. Here, CHAI admits it is in their interests for U.S. AIDS drug prices to remain high, so that they can continue getting credit for keeping them low abroad. 
But CHAI is not content with simply fleecing American AIDS sufferers. Since CHAI doesn't want pressure on Pharma companies to linger, they propose to torpedo other AIDS advocacy groups by creating a smaller, watered-down domestic program with the Pharma companies before those other advocacy groups begin their assault in January. 
The Clintons are only out for themselves. In comments on World AIDS day in the subsequent years of 2012 and 2013 , Bill says nothing whatsoever about domestic drug prices. If AIDS advocacy groups cannot trust the Clintons not to stab them in the back, how can the American people? 
Also remember, the Clinton foundation only donates 5.6% of their earnings to charity , despite Hillary knowingly and blatantly lying to the American people by claiming they donated 90% at the last debate, but she is counting on you to not do research, and her mainstream media to not report it.

17591,"Beware, iPhone Users: Fake Retail Apps Are Surging Before Holidays - The New York Times","SAN FRANCISCO  —   Hundreds of fake retail and product apps have popped up in Apple’s App Store in recent weeks  —   just in time to deceive holiday shoppers. The counterfeiters have masqueraded as retail chains like Dollar Tree and Foot Locker, big department stores like Dillard’s and Nordstrom, online product bazaars like Zappos. com and Polyvore, and   makers like Jimmy Choo, Christian Dior and Salvatore Ferragamo. “We’re seeing a barrage of fake apps,” said Chris Mason, chief executive of Branding Brand, a Pittsburgh company that helps retailers build and maintain apps. He said his company constantly tracks new shopping apps, and this was the first time it had seen so many counterfeit iPhone apps emerge in a short period of time. Some of them appeared to be relatively harmless  —   essentially junk apps that served up annoying   ads, he said. But there are serious risks to using a fake app. Entering credit card information opens a customer to potential financial fraud. Some fake apps contain malware that can steal personal information or even lock the phone until the user pays a ransom. And some fakes encourage users to log in using their Facebook credentials, potentially exposing sensitive personal information. The rogue apps, most of which came from developers in China, slipped through Apple’s process for reviewing every app before it is published. That scrutiny, which Apple markets as an advantage over Google’s less restrictive Android smartphone platform, is supposed to stop any software that is deceitful, that improperly uses another company’s intellectual property or that poses harm to consumers. In practice, however, Apple focuses more on blocking malicious software and does not routinely examine the thousands of apps submitted to the iTunes store every day to see if they are legitimately associated with the brand names listed on them. With apps becoming more popular as a way to shop, it is up to brands and developers themselves to watch for fakes and report them, much as they scan for fake websites, said Ben Reubenstein, chief executive of Possible Mobile, a Denver company that makes apps for JetBlue Airways, the PGA Tour and the Pokémon Company, among others. “It’s important that brands monitor how their name is being used,” he said. Apple removed hundreds of fake apps on Thursday night after The New York Times inquired about the specific app vendors that created many of them. Other apps were removed after a New York Post article last week drew attention to some of the counterfeits. “We strive to offer customers the best experience possible, and we take their security very seriously,” said an Apple spokesman, Tom Neumayr. “We’ve set up ways for customers and developers to flag fraudulent or suspicious apps, which we promptly investigate to ensure the App Store is safe and secure. We’ve removed these offending apps and will continue to be vigilant about looking for apps that might put our users at risk. ” In September, Apple also embarked on a campaign to review all two million apps in the App Store and remove “apps that no longer function as intended, don’t follow current review guidelines or are outdated. ” The company says that a significant number of apps have been removed and that the review is continuing. Despite Apple’s efforts, new fake apps appear every day. In some cases, developers change the content of an app after it has been approved by Apple’s monitors. In other instances, the counterfeiters change their names and credentials, and resubmit similar apps after one round of fakes is discovered. “It’s a game of  ” Mr. Mason of Branding Brand said. On Friday, for example, an entity calling itself Overstock Inc.  —   an apparent attempt to confuse shoppers looking for the online retailer Overstock. com  —   was peddling Ugg boots and apparel through a fake app that was nearly identical to one banished by Apple on Thursday. The same Chinese app developer, Cloaker Apps, created both fake Ugg apps on behalf of Chinese clients. Jack Lin, who identified himself as the head of Cloaker, said in a phone interview in China that his company provides the   technology for thousands of apps but does not investigate its clients. “We hope that our clients are all official sellers,” he said. “If they are using these brands, we need some kind of authorization, then we will provide services. ” Mr. Lin said Cloaker charged about 20, 000 renminbi  —   about $3, 000  —   for an app written in English. But like so many of the apps his company produces, Cloaker is not what it purports to be. Its website is filled with dubious claims, such as the location of its headquarters, which it says is at an address smack in the middle of Facebook’s campus in Menlo Park, Calif. In the interview, Mr. Lin at first said he had offices only in China and Japan. When asked about the California office, he then claimed to have “tens of employees” at the Facebook address. China is by far the biggest source of fake apps, according to security experts. Many of the fake retail apps have red flags signaling that they are not real, such as nonsensical menus written in butchered English, no reviews and no history of previous versions. In one fake New Balance app, for example, the tab for phone support did not list a phone number and said, “Our angents are available over the hone  . ” Data from Apptopia show that some of the fake apps have been downloaded thousands of times, although it is unclear how many people have actually used them. Reviews posted on some of the apps indicated that at least some people tried them and became frustrated. “Would give zero stars if possible,” wrote one reviewer of the fake Dollar Tree app. “Constantly gets stuck in menus and closes what you were doing and makes you start over. ” Mr. Mason says consumers want to shop online and they search for apps from their favorite stores and brands. “The retailers who are most exposed are the ones with no app at all,” he said. Dollar Tree and Dillard’s, for example, have no official iPhone apps, which made it easier to lure their customers to the fake apps. But the counterfeiters have also mimicked companies that do have an official presence in the App Store, hoping to capitalize on consumer confusion about which ones are real. The shoe retailer Foot Locker Inc. for example, has three iPhone apps. But that did not stop an entity calling itself Footlocke Sports Co. Ltd. from offering 16 shoe and clothing apps in the App Store  —   including one purporting to be from a Foot Locker rival, Famous Footwear. Similarly, the supermarket chain Kroger Company has 20 iPhone apps, reflecting the various retail chains in its empire. An entity calling itself The Kroger Inc. had 19 apps, purporting to sell things as diverse as an $80 pair of Asics sneakers and a $688 bottle of Dior perfume. Some of the fake apps have even used Apple’s new paid search ads to propel them to the top of the results screen when customers search for specific brands in the App Store. Jon Clay, director of global threat communications for Trend Micro, an internet security firm, said Apple’s tight control over the iPhone had historically kept malicious apps out of its App Store. Fake apps appeared more often on Google’s Android platform or on   app stores, he said. But that is beginning to change. Shortly after the Pokémon Go game was released in the United States in July, for example, a spate of fake iPhone apps related to the game appeared, especially in countries where the game was not yet available. “The criminals are going to take advantage of whatever is hot,” Mr. Clay said.",0
17592,Acquittal in Freddie Gray Case Casts Doubts About Future Trials - The New York Times,"BALTIMORE  —   The acquittal on Thursday of a Baltimore police officer charged with murder and six other crimes in the death of Freddie Gray has dealt a devastating blow to the prosecution, legal experts say, and raises questions about whether the state should press ahead with the trials of four other officers. Officer Caesar R. Goodson Jr. who drove the police transport van in which Mr. Gray suffered the spinal cord injury that killed him, faced the most serious charges of any of the six officers indicted in the fatal arrest. His acquittal on seven counts leaves the state without any convictions after three trials, in one of the nation’s most closely watched police misconduct cases  —   and continues to leave open the question of what, exactly, happened to Mr. Gray inside the van. Judge Barry G. Williams, who presided over the Goodson trial, issued the verdicts to a hushed, packed courtroom. He drew no conclusions about exactly when during the van ride Mr. Gray got hurt, saying there were several “equally plausible scenarios. ” And he rejected the state’s contention that the officer had given Mr. Gray an intentional “rough ride” and knowingly endangered him by failing to buckle him into the van or provide medical help. Mr. Gray was detained after fleeing, apparently unprompted, from officers in the downtrodden Sandtown neighborhood of West Baltimore, and loaded into a police wagon that made six stops in West Baltimore before it arrived at the Western District police station, where Mr. Gray was found unresponsive and not breathing, with a devastating spinal cord injury. The death of Mr. Gray, a    black man, set off a wave of violent unrest here last year and thrust this majority black city into the center of a wrenching national debate over race and policing. The state’s attorney, Marilyn Mosby, sought to quell the violence by telling protesters she heard their “call for ‘no justice, no peace,’” promising to deliver “justice on behalf of this young man. ” But the first trial, of Officer William Porter, ended with a hung jury in December he is scheduled to be retried. A second officer, Edward M. Nero, was acquitted last month of four charges. Thursday’s verdicts instantly reignited debate here over whether Ms. Mosby had overcharged the officers and prompted speculation about what she will do next. “This was the state’s Waterloo,” declared Warren Brown, a defense lawyer who has been watching the trials, and has been sharply critical of the prosecution. Mayor Stephanie   issued a bland statement after the verdict that said, in part, “I know the citizens of Baltimore will continue to respect the judicial process and the ruling of the court. ” The Baltimore police union called immediately for all remaining charges to be dropped and accused Ms. Mosby of “playing politics with our agency. ” Ms. Mosby had no comment like all parties in the case, she is bound by a judge’s order barring her from talking about it. But most legal experts agreed that Ms. Mosby must now rethink her strategy. Still, the road ahead is a complicated one for her. Several officers charged in the cases have filed defamation suits against her a decision to drop criminal charges against them could become fodder for their lawsuits  —   and hurt her if she seeks  . “If she abandons the prosecution of the four remaining trials, the only interpretation of that is that she has been defeated  —   certainly that does not bode well politically for her,” said Warren Alperstein, a lawyer who represents police officers, though not those charged in the Gray cases. “On the other hand, how far do you take this when you are oh for three?” One calculation, if she does go forward, is whether to seek the removal of Judge Williams from future trials. The judge, a former federal prosecutor who tried police misconduct cases for the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, has presided over all three trials so far. The first trial was a jury trial the other two were tried by the judge, at the request of the officers. In the process, though, he has tipped his hand as to his thinking about some of the other defendants. For instance, he said on Thursday that it “strains credibility” to think that Officer Porter, who testified that he did not believe that Mr. Gray was in medical distress, had told Officer Goodson that Mr. Gray was in danger. And during the trial of Officer Nero, one of the two arresting officers, the judge raised the idea that the other officer  —   Garrett E. Miller  —   had been more deeply involved in the arrest. Officer Miller faces trial starting on July 27. The courtroom was tense and quiet as the judge read the verdicts on Thursday sheriff’s deputies had issued a warning: “no moans, no groans. ” Afterward, Officer Goodson hugged members of his family and Officers Nero and Miller, both of whom were seated in the front row. Ms. Mosby heaved a sigh and walked out, her head down, escorted by her security guard. Jan Bledsoe and Michael Schatzow, who prosecuted the case, followed,   and looking glum. Outside the courthouse, a small band of protesters gathered, maybe a few dozen in all. Many had expected the verdict some sounded more resigned, others angry. “It’s business as usual  —   you’re not going to convict nobody for killing a black man in America, whether it be New York or Chicago, Philadelphia or Baltimore,” said Duane “Shorty” Davis, a chef and activist here. “Black lives don’t matter to white America. ” Mr. Davis said he believed Ms. Mosby never had any “intention of winning this case,” and that the only reason she brought charges “is because they had an uprising. ” Others said they saw the $6. 4 million settlement that Baltimore paid to Mr. Gray’s family, including his mother, to settle an expected civil suit last year as a kind of payback, or trade, for the acquittals. Among them were George Grady and his girlfriend, Carleen White, near Pennsylvania and North Avenues, not far from the site of last year’s unrest. “When she took the money, why would you find the police guilty now?” Mr. Grady said. As to whether Ms. Mosby should drop the remaining cases, he said was of two minds. At first, he said she should not. But then, he switched gears: “The family got paid. Let it go, let this rest. ” Despite the sense here that little has changed since then, some civil rights leaders, like Tessa   the president of Baltimore’s branch of the N. A. A. C. P. said the very act of trying the officers has brought scrutiny to police practices that had long endured in the shadows. And some police practices appear to be changing. “We’re here, and the police are being looked at, and they have to change their behavior,” Ms.   said, adding that she hoped the prosecutions would continue for that reason. “As a person out in the street, I think we should keep them coming. ” Late last month, the Baltimore police announced they were putting new cameras in transport vans. Ms.   as well as a lawyer, A. Dwight Petit, who represents police brutality plaintiffs in Baltimore, say anecdotal complaints of rough rides have dropped since Mr. Gray’s case took over the headlines. That has trickled down to anecdotes on the street. Standing at the intersection of Pennsylvania and North Avenues, Darrius Colbert, 26, who said that he had served about seven years in prison, said he had been arrested and loaded into a police wagon on three occasions  —   twice before Mr. Gray’s death, and once after. On the former occasions, Mr. Colbert said, he was not secured with a seatbelt, and felt “weak and powerless,” though he was not hurt. “The van takes off,” he said, “you just slide around, thinking, ‘I have no control over my life whatsoever. ’” But during his most recent arrest, he said that he was buckled in.",0
17594,"Julian Assange Isn’t Done With Hillary, Reveals Hidden Human Trafficking Network | EndingFed News Network","
I have been reporting for weeks now about the D.C.-based “pizza pedophilia” ring that is being exposed based on thousands of “Podesta emails” released by Wikileaks in the past month or two. 
As of last week, the case became even more explosive. 
— Thomas Bernpaine (@ThomasBernpaine) November 11, 2016 
Now, don’t get nervous because it looks like computer mumbo-jumbo. You only need to remember two things. 
1 – Every picture file is actually a code/pattern of numbers that our computers “translate” into images on the screen. 
2 – Some “extra” information has been discovered in at least one picture code/pattern from a Wikileaks email. 
I reported weeks ago about this “pedo ring” something called “photo steganography,” which is just the fancy term for the two points I explained just now. 
The image (.jpg) of the two girls eating pizza was discovered as an attachment in the Podesta emails by Wikileaks. Data can be hidden in a .jpg file. In that image, a zipped directory (PK) was hidden inside. That doesn’t happen by accident. The directory likely contains illegal imagery and/or discussion. It is highly suggestive of illegal activity connected to child pornography, child exploitation, and child abuse. 
Some have objected that the pizza.jpg file size is simply too small to contain any useful data (like an image, a link, a message, etc.), but the point is this: all the file would have to “smuggle” is a short password to open a secret website or .zip file. The hidden data could literally just be a few bits of information but it could open up thousands of gigabytes of data in the right website or compressed file. That’s how the users would access the dirty pictures, videos, messages, etc. 
So, from a technical angle, this method is very possible, and it makes sense of why the Podesta emails include so many strange photo attachments. Are all those attachments little “Trojan ponies” for sharing images, videos, passwords, payment resources, etc.? 
WATCH (Language/NSFW Warning): 
“Why do we even have an FBI? Is the FBI just covering for these people?” 
Let me be honest: 
I have researched corruption cases like this for many years, whether in current events or from historical records. So, I believe I have a somewhat thick skin when it comes to facing human sinfulness and evil like this. 
Last Friday night, however, I won’t lie: I totally lost it. 
All of a sudden, too many lightbulbs went off at once, too many connections hit me at once, too many implications dawned on me at once–and I just went into a kind of panic attack about how massive this whole cartel is, how well protected it is, and how truly destructive it is in real children’s lives. 
If you want to get an idea of what set me off, let me show you three images. 
BUT I WARN YOU: When you understand the context, these images are EXTREMELY DISTURBING. 
First, here is a photo of Tony Podesta’s favorite work of art in his home: 
Tony Podesta is a big fan of “The Arch of Hysteria” 
Next, here is an ad from Ping Pong Pizza, a restaurant in D.C. that has numerous, very disturbing connections to pedophilia and D.C. elites like the Podestas. 
Another “arch of hysteria”? 
Next we come to a police photo from the Jeffrey Dahmer case. 
VIEWER DISCRETION ADVISED: 
I wonder if Tony Podesta would also like this “arch of hysteria”… 
Finally, here is the logo for Comet Pizza, another D.C. restaurant with deep connections to Ping Pong Pizza and the Podestas. 
Can you see now why I “lost my [bleep]” last Friday? 
Worse, in terms of how protected this satanic ring of perverts is, I recently reported that even the DOJ is compromised . 
A man named Arun Rao has shown a disturbing interest in some sexually “creepy” images and expressions that are connected to the Podestas and this pedo ring. The problem is that Rao is an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the DOJ. 
Specifically, Rao is Supervisor of the Southern (“Greenbelt”) Division office for the DOJ’s District of Maryland in Chevy Chase, Maryland. This means that Rao’s district is virtually on top of the area in D.C. where Besta Pizza operates. In addition, Besta Pizza and two other associated properties are directly over abandoned underground tunnels, many of which could easily connect to Chevy Chase. 
On top of his social and geographical proximity to Alefantis, Rao’s DOJ division handles cases that seem tailor-made for busting—or covering up—the dark circles that sex traffickers hide in: federal racketeering, conspiracy, national and international fraud and corruption, immigration violations, counterfeiting, and —wait for it—child pornography . 
In closing I will leave you with three “infographics.” 
They are very complicated and “dense” so I don’t expect everyone to examine them. 
However, even if you don’t look into the details yourself, I want you to be aware of how vast this whole network of evil is, and, therefore, of how many hands and prayers we need on deck to expose it and bring it down. 
(NOTE: You don’t have to download these images to view them. You can just right-click open them in a separate internet browser tab, and click “+” to zoom in.)

First, a diagram of “key players” in the pizza restaurant side of the pedo ring. You can see the diagram for yourself here . 
Second, a much larger diagram of how this pizza-pedo ring connects to international kidnapping (esp. the Madeleine McCann case) and other DNC allies like “spirit cooker” Marina Abramovic. 
This is an ongoing investigation so stay tuned for more.

17595,Comment on Sunday Devotional: A Petition to the Father by muchmadness,"Hear, LORD, my plea for justice; pay heed to my cry; Listen to my prayer From you let my vindication come; your eyes see what is right. You have tested my heart, searched it in the night. You have tried me by fire, but find no malice in me. My mouth has not transgressed as others often do. As your lips have instructed me, I have kept from the way of the lawless. My steps have kept to your paths; my feet have not faltered. I call upon you; answer me, O God. Turn your ear to me; hear my speech. Show your wonderful mercy, you who deliver with your right arm those who seek refuge from their foes. Keep me as the apple of your eye; hide me in the shadow of your wings from the wicked who despoil me. My ravenous enemies press upon me; they close their hearts, they fill their mouths with proud roaring. Their steps even now encircle me; they watch closely, keeping low to the ground, Like lions eager for prey, like a young lion lurking in ambush. Rise, O LORD, confront and cast them down; rescue my soul from the wicked. I am just—let me see your face; when I awake, let me be filled with your presence. 
Two days from now, Americans will each go to our respective polling stations to cast our ballots for the gravest, most consequential election in our lifetime. 
May God send the Holy Spirit and the Archangel Michael to help us. 
May God have mercy on us, a sinful people. 2 Thessalonians 2:7, 9-12 For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work. [T]he one whose coming springs from the power of Satan in every mighty deed and in signs and wonders that lie, and in every wicked deceit for those who are perishing because they have not accepted the love of truth so that they may be saved. Therefore, God is sending them a deceiving power so that they may believe the lie, that all who have not believed the truth but have approved wrongdoing may be condemned. 2 Thessalonians 3:1-3, 5 Finally, brothers and sisters, pray for us, so that the word of the Lord may speed forward and be glorified, as it did among you, and that we may be delivered from perverse and wicked people, for not all have faith. But the Lord is faithful; he will strengthen you and guard you from the evil one. May the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God and to the endurance of Christ.",0
17596,Comment on Democratic National Committee Shuts Out Officer From Debate After Calling For More by elliptic curve,"According to The New York Times, the vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee has been disinvited from the Democratic debates. Representative Tulsi Gabbard did confirm this. 
The New York Times reported : “Ms. Gabbard confirmed on Sunday that her chief of staff received a message last Tuesday from the chief of staff to Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chairwoman of the national committee, about her attendance at the debate.” 
So why? 
The day before receiving the email Gabbard called for more debates on MSNBC. “More and more people on the ground from states all across the country are calling for more debates, are wanting to have this transparency and greater engagement in our democratic process at a critical time, as they make the decision of who should be the next person to lead our country.” 
Sunday night, Gabbard spoke with The New York Times: “When I first came to Washington, one of the things that I was disappointed about was there’s a lot of immaturity and petty gamesmanship that goes on, and it kind of reminds me of how high school teenagers act… It’s very dangerous when we have people in positions of leadership who use their power to try to quiet those who disagree with them. When I signed up to be vice chair of the D.N.C., no one told me I would be relinquishing my freedom of speech and checking it at the door.” 
Wow. 
An anonymous source with ties to the committee disagrees and according to The New York Times: “… an aide to Ms. Wasserman Schultz expressed a desire to keep the focus on the candidates as the debate approached, rather than on a ‘distraction’ that could divide the party, and suggested that if Ms. Gabbard could not do that, she should reconsider going. She was not uninvited. The D.N.C. team wanted this first debate to have all the focus on the candidates. Gabbard’s people were told that if they couldn’t commit to that since Tulsi was trying to publicly divide the D.N.C. leadership last week, then they should consider not coming. The fact that she is still making this about her and not our great candidates by talking to The New York Times says something unfortunate.” 
You know, I love how the Wasserman Schultz camp is trying to spin this and make Tulsi look like the villain wanting attention. Tulsi is a bad person for voicing an opinion that the majority of Democrats have? If that’s the case, I applaud her for being the villain. Even if she wasn’t disinvited, the fact that it was suggested is remarkably disgusting. 
The fact is many Americans want more debates. Several of the few candidates have called for more debates. What’s the f**king hold up here? What’s the problem? Does Wasserman Schultz have her head so far up someone’s colon that she can’t hear what the American people are screaming at her? 
Let me speak a little louder. Can you hear me now Debbie? We are not happy. We want more debates. We are not the ones dividing the party. You and the leadership put in place to serve Democrats nationwide are dividing the party. You are not listening to us. That’s the dividing factor. Not us. It’s not dividing a party when you’re speaking up for the ignored majority. 
This isn’t about wanting Bernie to annihilate Hillary. This is about listening to a majority of American citizens who put you in your chair. I can only hope there will be audience members holding signs up calling for more debates to show that it’s not just attention-seeking.
