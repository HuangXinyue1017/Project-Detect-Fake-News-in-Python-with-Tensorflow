9358,California Today: Vaccinate Schoolchildren or Keep Them Home - The New York Times,"Good morning. Welcome to California Today, a morning update on the stories that matter to Californians (and anyone else interested in the state). Tell us about the issues that matter to you  —   and what you’d like to see: CAtoday@nytimes. com. Want to receive California Today by email? Sign up. With the new school year underway, California is cracking down on parents who refuse to vaccinate their children. Since a new law took effect in July, no longer will a child be able to attend class unimmunized on the basis of a parent’s objections. In the past, parents could sidestep vaccine mandates by declaring that the injections were contrary to their religious or personal beliefs. This occurred despite overwhelming evidence from doctors and public health officials that they are safe and effective in preventing infectious diseases. Tens of thousands of   parents across California now face three options: yield, tutor your children at home or pack up and leave the state. But if there is to be any exodus from California schools, expect it to unfold slowly. The law, known as SB 277, only requires proof of immunizations as children enter school for the first time or the seventh grade. That means many won’t have to vaccinate for years or, if they’re in eighth grade and above, at all. In 2015, parents of incoming kindergartners in California filed more than 13, 000 personal belief exemptions. It’s unclear how the latest crop of   kindergarten parents are responding to the law. Schools took steps to ensure that parents understood the rules and even helped coordinate vaccine clinics, said Robert Oakes, a spokesman for the California Department of Education. “It’s the right thing to do for public health, and it’s the law in California,” he said. Still, opponents say a trickle of defectors has been leaving California since the middle of last year, when the bill was signed into law in the wake of a measles outbreak, which began at Disneyland and was attributed, in part, to diseases being spread by children who had not been vaccinated. Stefanie Duncan Fetzer, an opponent in San Clemente, said she personally knew of roughly 200 families who have fled. Many went to Oregon, Colorado or Texas, she said, states seen as unlikely to impose strict vaccine rules. Other parents are in a sort of limbo, unable to make other arrangements for their children. Ms. Fetzer described one family that sold their house, bought a camper and “just took off. ” “They don’t know where they are going to land,” she said. “They are just going to drive around the country and   their kids and hope to find a place to go. ” • Brock Turner, the former Stanford University student who spent three months in jail after sexually assaulting an unconscious woman, registered as a sex offender in his home state of Ohio.

Mike Karas, a tourist from Honolulu, had his camera pointed toward an exquisite view of Yosemite when a bride and her groom stepped onto a rocky ledge high above a valley. She turned to him as the sun burst into an apricot hue on the horizon. “It was like wow, that’s amazing,” Mr. Karas, 31, said. He snapped a photo. But the mystery couple vanished down a trail before he could flag them down. Later, he posted the image to Instagram, where it spread like crazy and inspired reports as far away as New Zealand. It also fueled an effort to identify the couple that stretched for days. Then, late Tuesday, the mystery was solved. The bride was Catherine Mack, an Australian actress, and her groom Rick Donald, also an actor.

9360,Zika Surge in Miami Neighborhood Prompts Travel Warning - The New York Times,"Federal health officials on Monday urged pregnant women to stay away from a Miami neighborhood where they have discovered additional cases of Zika infection  —   apparently the first time the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has advised people not to travel to a place in the continental United States. Florida officials said the number of Zika cases caused by local mosquitoes had risen to 14 from the four announced on Friday: 12 men and two women. They declined to say whether either woman was pregnant. All of the cases have been in one neighborhood. Health officials said they still did not expect the number of local cases to grow into anything comparable to the epidemic that has raged across Latin America in recent months. The 10 newly identified patients were most likely infected weeks ago, as early as   the officials said. But the new information casts doubt over the effectiveness of weeks of intensive   efforts in South Florida and raises questions about tourism in the state, which drew more than 100 million visitors last year. Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the C. D. C. said that the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which transmits the Zika virus, has proved to be a wily adversary in Wynwood, a crowded, urban neighborhood in north Miami where all the cases were found. The mosquito may be resistant to the insecticides being used or may be able to hide in standing water. “Aggressive mosquito control measures don’t seem to be working as well as we would like,” he said in a press briefing on Monday. The authorities had expected additional cases of Zika infection linked to the neighborhood, he said. But officials were particularly concerned by indications over the weekend that “moderately high” numbers of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and their larvae were still being found in a    section in Wynwood, an area of warehouses, art galleries, restaurants, bars, apartments and condominiums. “We advise pregnant women to avoid travel to this area,” Dr. Frieden said, “and pregnant women who live and work in this area and their partners to make every effort to avoid mosquito bites and practice safe sex. ” Pregnant women who traveled to the neighborhood on or after June 15 should talk with their doctors about getting tested for possible infection, he said. In addition, said Dr. Denise J. Jamieson, a leader of the C. D. C. ’s pregnancy and birth defects team, “we are recommending women who are considering pregnancy not get pregnant for up to eight weeks after returning from that area. ” No mosquito found in the neighborhood has tested positive for the virus, but this species has a short life span. Health officials said the Florida mosquitoes carrying the virus had probably acquired it by biting an infected traveler from Latin America or the Caribbean. At the request of the state, the C. D. C. has dispatched an emergency response team of eight experts in fields including birth defects and mosquito control. Dr. Frieden said mosquitoes in the neighborhood would be tested for resistance to the insecticides being used, which he said were two different types of pyrethroids. In a sign that the Zika cases might affect tourism in Florida, Britain’s health agency, saying the risk was moderate, advised pregnant women on Saturday to “consider postponing nonessential travel to affected areas until after the pregnancy. ” Jack Ezon, the president of Ovation Vacations in New York, said that his agency received 22 reservation cancellations on Monday for trips to Florida over the next six months, and that about four times as many people called for information about the travel advisory. “Yesterday, the news was terrorism. Today, the news is Zika,” he said. The airline JetBlue said in a statement that it would allow refunds for people with “concerns of traveling to   areas confirmed by the C. D. C. ” But Ross Feinstein, a spokesman for American Airlines, which has a hub in Miami, said no refunds would be issued, even for pregnant women. “The C. D. C. advisory doesn’t tell people they shouldn’t travel to Miami,” he said. Abraham Pizam, the dean of the Rosen College of Hospitality Management, said that if the travel advisory had any effect on tourism, it would be only “for a very short period of time” and would not put a big dent in the diverse range of tourists who visit Florida. Gov. Rick Scott said in a statement that the Florida health authorities had tested people in three locations in   and Broward Counties and ruled out transmission by local mosquitoes in two of those locations. Six of the 10 newly identified cases were asymptomatic and discovered through the    testing. Dr. Frieden said 12 of the 14 cases were linked to a   area around two workplaces where the initial two cases were identified in July. Since July 7, when Florida began investigating what turned out to be the first diagnosed local transmission, more than 200 people in   and Broward Counties who live or work near the Wynwood neighborhood have been tested, Mr. Scott said. Mosquito experts said Aedes aegypti thrives in tiny pockets of water  —   a bottle cap, a storm drain  —   making for a notoriously elusive foe. “Very little historically has worked on Aedes aegypti, owing to its stealthy and domestic behavior,” said Phil Lounibos, a professor of entomology at the University of Florida. Aerial spraying is largely ineffective in an urban setting like Wynwood. Instead, mosquito control employees have conducted 621 property inspections there, treated 21 properties for mosquito breeding and used portable sprayers against adult mosquitoes on 100 properties, said Gayle Love, the spokeswoman for the   County Department of Solid Waste. Spray trucks were also sent to the neighborhood, but were legally allowed to spray only at night, while Aedes aegypti mosquitoes tend to bite during the day, said Michael S. Doyle, the executive director of the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District. “Most of the chemicals that are available for mosquito control are not effective against Aedes aegypti  —   they are resistant,” he said. On Monday, in Wynwood, there was little obvious concern. “I haven’t seen any panic,” said Virgil Cantú, 22, a bartender at the Bar Next Door. Melanie Hernandez, 20, who was working Monday at the Marine Layer clothing store in Wynwood, said she was worried, even though she did not plan to get pregnant anytime soon. “I looked up the symptoms online after I heard that Wynwood is ground zero for Zika,” she said. “Obviously you’re scared, because you never know. ”",0

(CNN) The Democratic National Committee is suing the Republican National Committee for aiding GOP nominee Donald Trump as he argues that the presidential election is “rigged,” claiming that Trump’s argument is designed to suppress the vote in minority communities. 
The suit, filed Wednesday in US District Court in New Jersey, argues that the RNC has not sufficiently rebuked Trump for the line of attack, which he has used as a rallying cry and is assumed to be a way to explain away a potential loss on Election Day.

9363,"Watch: Alex Marlow Talks Media, Free Speech, and Rhetoric with Bill Maher - Breitbart","On Friday’s “Real Time with Bill Maher” on HBO, host and comedian Bill Maher interviewed Breitbart News    Alex Marlow.  The two discussed Breitbart’s coverage, the media, Russia, free speech, the shooting at a congressional baseball practice, and political rhetoric. Marlow said that Breitbart is “not going to cover the exact same stories the exact same way as all the other outlets. We’ll leave that to the rest of the establishment press. We’re very much   trying to highlight stories that we don’t think get their fair day. ” After the discussion turned to Russia, Marlow stated that there was no evidence of collusion or obstruction of justice, adding, “You guys continue to talk about this story in the establishment press instead of talking about the president’s agenda, which is by design. Because you guys won’t apologize if it turns out there’s nothing, no one will come out on MSNBC, they’ll just move on to the next hysteria, and that’s a huge advantage for people like me who are covering the rest of the news. ” Marlow later said, “I love highlighting Muslim voices who are progressive and reformist and want to take out some of the misogyny and some of the hatred associated with radical elements of it. And I think that’s an important place to start, but to bring back what Breitbart does different than anyone else, is we cover stories the establishment press doesn’t want to cover. ” On free speech, Maher and Marlow agreed that if the depictions of the assassination of President Trump were of President Obama, the reaction on the left would be different. Maher then raised corporations pulling ads from people who engage in speech they do not like. Marlow said, “This really started —  in my view —  in the modern era, with Breitbart —  where a lot of people are boycotting Breitbart. And what they’re doing is, there’s a lot of anonymous people online, cowardly people. We don’t know who’s funding them. We don’t know who they are, who are putting out all of this misinformation about who we are and what we stand for, and they’re trying to round up corporations to boycott us. And so, what’s happened is that corporations are now deciding what’s free and fair speech, who can make a living, what opinions you can make a living saying now, and, of course, now, you’re seeing the right fight fire with fire and want boycotts of when the left takes it too far in their Trump hatred. So it’s a very dangerous path we’re on, and I really do think, Bill, and I appreciate you giving me this opportunity, people on the left and the right who are free speech advocates need to come together right now and say that corporations are not going to define the First Amendment and free speech in this country. ” Marlow said that he does not believe Bernie Sanders is at fault for the congressional baseball practice shooting and continued, “When you have a climate where you have, CNN, for example, calling Breitbart to the number one platform for the Nazi salute over a video we never played and CNN played, when you have the New York Times accusing Breitbart of putting racist dog whistles out, when the media lies so much about people, calling Trump supporters racists, despicable, deplorable, all of these things over and over  …    ” Maher cut in, “They have been racist, despicable, and deplorable. ” Marlow concluded, “I encourage everyone to go to breitbart. . You can meet some of the Breitbart reporters, the Breitbart editors. They’re the most wonderful, diverse, influential journalists on the planet, and no one is interested in their real story because they’re so quick to call people racist. And it’s not working. That is why so many Democrats are losing across the country.   …     And so, if you want to play that game, Bill, if you want to keep calling us racists, I don’t think it’s going to work for you, so please, have at it. ” Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo.",0

9365,Daredevil Patient on Bed Jumps Through Ring of Fire | GomerBlog,"Tweet 
LAS VEGAS, NV – Patient Brian McDowell put on a show for the ages, as he became the first patient on a hospital bed to successfully leap through a ring of fire unscathed. Performed during a matinee show at the MGM Grand Hospital yesterday, health care personnel applaud the act, calling it the best combination of entertainment and treatment in recent memory. 
“There hasn’t been much to write about since Philip Rogers rode in a wheelchair through a halfpipe back in 2001,” wrote local entertainment reporter Eva Roberts. “All we’ve had is magic mouthwash and pet therapy , but that’s about it. McDowell’s death-defying leap against patient safety precautions was a much needed breath of fresh air.” Thankfully, the Joint Commission wasn’t there to witness it. 
The 55-year-old McDowell has always been a lifelong adventurer. His youth saw participation in skateboarding, snowboarding, and motocross biking until “a few too many broken bones ” sidelined him for good over two decades ago. However, it was during this most recent hospitalization that McDowell felt the old itch come back and thought the hospital was just the place to get things started. 
“The way I saw it, the worst thing that happens, I get set on fire and there’s a burn unit right here; or if I broke a bone, I knew ortho , PT, and OT would be ready and waiting,” explained McDowell. “Best case scenario I’ve provided a hospital, a setting not typically known for world-class entertainment, something to talk about for weeks, months, maybe even years to come.” McDowell idolized Rogers and his wheelchair X Games jumps, and wanted to make a name for himself in a hospital one day. 
After convincing his transport tech to arrange the ramps accordingly and give him a good running push, McDowell used his arms and body to steer the hospital bed before he took off “like a Haldol blowdart ,” guiding himself through the heart of the ring of fire. His landing was perfect, no bedsheets were singed, and everyone there to witness the feat got on their feet to give McDowell a rousing standing ovation . 
Though McDowell is being treated for asthma exacerbation, he reassures his family, friends, and Gomerblog that the smoke inhalation while passing through the smoky ring of fire was “minimal,”“worth it,” and “better than a ring of my aunt’s perfume.” 
McDowell finishes an albuterol nebulizer treatment, takes the mask off, and hacks up some charred mucous. “If it brought a smile to even one person who looked up from their charting , it was worth it, it was totally worth it.” 87 Shares ",0
9366,Chinese Women Head Overseas to Freeze Their Eggs - The New York Times,"BEIJING  —   The anesthesia was administered, and Lu Yi gradually lost consciousness. Over the next 30 minutes, a doctor retrieved eight eggs from her body. They were transferred to a liquid nitrogen storage chamber, where the fragile bubbles of human potential entered a frozen future full of hope and uncertainty. Ms. Lu has a business degree from Stanford University and founded a company in Shanghai that connects Chinese cancer patients with American medical specialists. But like many other women, she has found it difficult to pursue both career and family. “I knew at some point I might want to have children, but definitely not now,” said Ms. Lu, who is single. So last year, at the age of 34, she decided to have her eggs frozen. China prohibits fertility treatments for unmarried women, so she underwent the procedure in California, joining the growing number of single Chinese women going abroad to have their eggs frozen as a way to preserve an option and control the pace of their lives. That there even was such an option was unknown to much of the Chinese public until last year, when the actress Xu Jinglei posted on Weibo that she had gone to the United States to have her eggs frozen in 2013. “It was the first time that many of us learned that this technology exists,” Ms. Lu said. “We thought, if she can do it, why can’t I?” According to the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China, assisted reproductive technologies are denied to “single women and couples who are not in line with the nation’s population and family planning regulations. ” Even married women must provide proof of marriage, a license to give birth and evidence either of infertility or of medical treatments that could impair fertility, such as chemotherapy. The restrictions have been driven in part by population controls that have been in place since 1979. The recent easing of those controls, allowing all families two children, do not apply to unmarried women. “There is still a lack of enthusiasm for reproductive technologies, because the government is worried about the negative impact on its population policies, and possible problems like a black market for human eggs,” said Wang Hongxia, a researcher at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences specializing in urban and demographic development. “So the solution was to ban them at the cost of reproductive rights for certain groups, like unmarried women. ” In addition, Ms. Wang said, “The idea of women having babies out of wedlock is in conflict with the sense of moral order within the society. ” Ms. Xu’s account of her own experience set off a public debate in China over access to fertility treatments. CCTV, the state broadcaster, responded to her statement with a   segment on   that reiterated the restrictions. But a Weibo poll conducted after the show attracted more than 83, 000 respondents, with nearly 80 percent voting against the ban on egg freezing for unmarried women. Determined single women circumvent the law the way Ms. Xu did: by leaving China. “Regulations simply cannot stop people from going elsewhere,” Ms. Lu said. Among them is Ye Qinmin, 39, an interior designer in Shanghai who had her eggs frozen at a reproductive clinic in Canada. “The government shouldn’t have a say about my ovaries just because I’m not married,” she said. Medical consultancies have begun to capitalize on this trend, bridging the gap between Chinese citizens and foreign fertility clinics. “We’ve seen a 10 to 15 percent annual increase in demand for services in the U. S. in the last three years,” said Yang Jie, the marketing director of Travel Healthcare, an agency in Shanghai that cooperates with Oregon Reproductive Medicine. The agency assists clients with visa applications, airport pickups, housing, translators, even   drivers. “Whatever our clients need, we will arrange for them,” Ms. Yang said. She added that Travel Healthcare also held seminars and promoted its services to employees of major companies in Shanghai. Some American clinics have also set up offices in China. Six doctors at HRC Fertility, a   chain of clinics, established Mengmei, which now has offices in 10 Chinese cities. Its website reads: “We offer reproductive services to L. G. B. T. s, H. I. V. patients and single women to help them achieve their dreams. ” “Most of our clients are affluent and   Chinese women in their 30s,’’ said Deng Xuyang, Mengmei’s chief executive. “They are open enough to seek the service and can afford it. ” In the United States, egg freezing typically costs between $11, 000 and $16, 000, and annual storage fees range from $450 to $600. “We partner with different companies to reach out to potential clients,” Mr. Deng said. “We also work with real estate groups to combine open houses abroad with visits to our clinics. ’’ According to data from the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, 33 out of 51 clinics in California provide services tailored to Chinese clients, such as documents and websites in Chinese, and   staff. However, the rising popularity of the procedure among women like Ms. Lu has not yet matched its outcomes. According to Dr. Kevin Doody, the society’s   from 2009 to 2014, the number of   cycles in the United States rose from 568 to 6, 165. For this same   period, however, the live birthrate from thawed eggs was just below 24 percent, he said in an interview. Both the quality and quantity of a woman’s eggs decline over time, especially after the age of 34. And the procedure can have side effects. Ms. Lu was in the 1 percent of patients who experienced ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome from the medication that promotes egg growth. “I looked like I was eight months pregnant by the end of day five,” she said. “I wasn’t sure if I would be able to continue. But I kept telling myself, I must go on, I will go on. ” Ms. Lu chronicled her experiences on WeChat, the microblog service, and received more than 100, 000 views. She also set up a group chat with more than 100 Chinese women who were either considering or were in the process of having their eggs frozen. “We share information, support each other,’’ Ms. Lu said. “Some even go to the U. S. together for the procedure. ” For now, Ms. Lu continues to focus on her company, while holding onto the thought that she has bought herself more time to attend to her personal life. Looking back on her decision to freeze her eggs, she said, “It changed nothing and everything. ”",0
9367,"Virginia Refuses to Track Refugee TB, State’s High Rate of Foreign-Born Cases Climbs - Breitbart","The state of Virginia refuses to track the number of refugees it resettles who are diagnosed with active tuberculosis (TB). [This refusal continues even as the number of cases diagnosed in the state has increased for two consecutive years, from 180 in 2013  —    the year former Democratic National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe, a staunch Clinton ally, was elected governor  —   to 198 in 2014, the year he took office, to 212 in 2015, the last year for which data is available.  The percentage of   cases of TB in Virginia has increased from 74 percent in 2013 (147 out of 180) to 79 percent in 2015 (168 out of 212) well above the national average of 66 percent in 2015 (6, 350 out of 9, 536). In the Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) Reported Tuberculosis in the United States, 2015, those 6, 350   cases of TB were broken down into the following categories of immigration status upon arrival: But the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) does not think it should be a priority to track   TB cases by category, as do 44 states who have provided the CDC with that data since 2012 (Tennessee became the 45th state to do so in 2014) in its annual Report on Tuberculosis in the United States. “The Virginia Department of Health does not collect the data you have requested,” a spokesperson for VDH responded when Breitbart asked to know the immigration status upon first entry of the 168   residents of Virginia diagnosed with active TB in 2015. “When the revised Report of Verified Case of Tuberculosis was adopted in 2009, the additional variables regarding immigration status were not required by CDC to be collected. The Virginia Department of Health TB program did not consider this information a priority for surveillance, since it already collected country of origin and arrival date for foreign born people,” the spokesperson responded when Breitbart asked why Virginia fails to provide the data 45 other states do to the CDC. “We collect surveillance data to track tuberculosis in Virginia and to prioritize our prevention efforts. All refugees and B1 immigrants are evaluated for TB when they enter the country and if they have disease they will be treated. Prompt treatment for active disease is the primary intervention public health has to control tuberculosis,” the spokesperson answered when asked why Virginia does not consider the information a priority for surveillance, though 45 other states and the CDC do, adding: As you can see from the national data available not very many refugees are diagnosed with tuberculosis once they get here. In Virginia, the number would be insignificant and it would not contribute to planning or thinking about prevention efforts, therefore collecting that information was not a priority for surveillance. Every state has different populations and different approaches to data collection within a general framework provided by the CDC. As a result each state and indeed even at the county and city level the focus will be based on what the risks are among the population in that location. (emphasis added) The spokesperson did not respond when Breitbart asked for evidence to support the assertion that “ not very many refugees are diagnosed with tuberculosis once they get here. ” The overwhelming evidence presented in numerous medical reports shows exactly the opposite —  the per capita rate of active TB among refugees is much higher than the per capita rate in the general population, and by an order of magnitude. The rate of TB among the general population was 3. 0 per 100, 000 in 2015. In contrast, the estimated rate of TB among refugees nationally exceeded 20 cases per 100, 000 refugees that same year (409 cases diagnosed in 45 reporting states where an estimated two million refugees reside). In states where   cases of TB are significantly above the national average, like Virginia, the estimated rate of TB among refugees is even higher. McAuliffe has been a   advocate of open borders and refugees. In November 2015 he very publicly refused to ask the Obama administration to halt the resettlement of Syrian refugees in the state. “Gov. Terry McAuliffe said Tuesday that he would veto any attempt by the General Assembly to block Syrian refugees from coming to the state, dismissing the idea as ‘political posturing’ ” Richmond. com reported at the time. The number of Syrian refugees resettled in the state by the Obama administration increased significantly after that statement, from 21 in the three years between FY 2013 and FY 2015, to 196 in FY 2016, according to the Department of State’s interactive website.   Syrian refugees have been resettled in Virginia in the first three months of FY 2017. Virginia’s problem with   TB began before McAuliffe was elected governor in 2013. In 2002, for instance,   TB cases were only 60 percent of all TB cases in  the state. Since then, a total of 19, 213 refugees have been resettled in the state, according to the Department of State’s interactive website. In 2007, an influx of refugees from high TB burden countries like Bhutan and Burma began. In the four years between FY 2003 and FY 2006, 117 refugees were resettled in Virginia from Burma. In the four subsequent years, FY 2007 to FY 2010, 969 refugees were resettled from Burma. In the five years between FY 2003 and FY 2007, no refugees were resettled in Virginia from Bhutan. In the five subsequent years, FY 2008 to FY 2012, 2, 233 refugees were resettled from Bhutan. Virginia does, however, track country of origin for   TB cases.

9368,Trump: It Is ’Possible’ FBI Director Position Will Be Filled by Friday - Breitbart,"President Trump hinted that it is “possible” that the FBI’s top post will be filled by Friday, according to a White House press pool report released Saturday. [Trump mentioned that he might even make the final decision on who gets the top FBI post before he leaves for Saudi Arabia Friday, saying “even that is possible. ”  “We can make a fast decision,” Trump said, explaining the FBI’s vetting process. Trump spoke highly of the candidates for the position, describing them as “very  ” and “ ” people with a lot of talent, according to the pool report. The president did not say whether these candidates are being vetted for the interim director or permanent director position. “Almost all of them are very well known,” he said. “They’ve been vetted over their lifetime, essentially. But very well known, highly respected, really talented people. And that’s what we want for the FBI. ” Four candidates for the permanent position to replace former FBI director James Comey are being interviewed Saturday by Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, Fox News reported. The four candidates include Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher, acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, Sen. John Cornyn ( ) and New York Court of Appeals Judge Michael J. Garcia. Trump said he would have fired Comey “regardless” of the recommendations he received from Sessions and Rosenstein in an interview with NBC Nightly News Thursday. The White House told Breitbart News Wednesday that Comey’s inability to handle the FBI’s tendency to leak to the media “was one of many” reasons why Trump was dissatisfied with his performance.",0
9369,AUDIO TAPE OF HILLARY LEAKED ABOUT RIGGING ELECTION,"AUDIO TAPE OF HILLARY LEAKED ABOUT RIGGING ELECTION 20.2K shares by DML DAILY / October 29, 2016 / CRAZY LEFT / According to the Observer , “On September 5, 2006, Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press, and Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator. Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press.” Her conversation was secretly recorded. 
The audio was never released, and according to Chomsky it has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. He claims his copy is the only copy and no one has heard it since 2006. He gave a copy of the audio to the Observer. During the recording, Hillary is allegedly heard about rigging the election. She says: “I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake. And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.” It shows she is willing to do whatever it takes to win. 
Chomsky told the Observer he was taken aback that “anyone could support the idea – offered by a national political leader, no less – that the U.S. should be in the business of fixing foreign elections.” The Observer is owned by Donald Trump’s son in law.

9370,UN Migration Agency Says People-Smugglers Making $35 Billion from Migrant Trade,"Criminal   are generating around 35 billion USD in revenue from the migrant trade, according to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). [Lacy Swing, who heads the United Nations agency, estimated that around 1, 700 migrants have died while in the care of   this year. Around 5, 000 died in 2016, and 3, 700 in 2015, suggesting a worrying upward trend.  Swing cautioned that we should be “careful” when considering these figures, however, “because those are the people we know who died, how many other bodies are submerged in the Mediterranean or buried in the sands of the Sahara?” He added: “That’s the tragedy and this is why we are so concerned to try to caution migrants about smugglers. The smugglers are really the big problem. It’s about $35 billion a year [that people smugglers make] and we know they’re making lots of money across the Mediterranean. ” People smugglers make about USD 35 billion a year   @IOMchief https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   IOM (@UNmigration) June 1, 2017,  Swing claimed the migrant crisis was being exacerbated by “unprecedented   sentiment,” although he did not appear to offer any explanation as to the mechanism through which this alleged sentiment could contribute to the issue. He added that   feelings were “fueled now by suspicions that some of those fleeing terrorism might be terrorists themselves”  —   a possible reference to migrants like the Islamist refugee Ramadan Abedi, whose son Salman killed 22 children, young people and parents at Britain’s Manchester Arena in May or bogus asylum seeker Anis Amri, who drove a hijacked lorry into a Christmas market in Berlin last year. The IOM has actively supported open borders and mass immigration throughout the migrant crisis, claiming that, “with 244 million people on the move, migration is inevitable, necessary, and desirable” as part of its #ForMigration campaign. With 244 million people on the move, migration is inevitable, necessary, and desirable: https:  .  #ForMigration pic. twitter.   —   IOM (@UNmigration) May 19, 2017,  Significantly, a comprehensive Risk Analysis by the European Union Border Agency (Frontex) indicates that global bodies’ relaxed and even welcoming attitude towards mass immigration is a large part of the problem when it comes to   with the “taxi service” to Europe offered by the authorities and NGOs strengthening their business model, encouraging more journeys and, inevitably, resulting in more drownings. “Apparently, all parties involved in [  ] operations in the Central Mediterranean unintentionally help criminals achieve their objectives at minimum cost [and] strengthen their business model by increasing the chances of success,” the report noted. “Migrants and refugees  —   encouraged by the stories of those who had successfully made it in the past  —   attempt the dangerous crossing since they are aware of and rely on humanitarian assistance to reach the EU. ” Stopping the boats has stopped the drownings. Australia’s “tough love” policy less deadly than EU’s. https:  .   —   Jack Montgomery ن (@JackBMontgomery) February 8, 2017,  Worryingly,   is known to be a significant source of income for terror groups such as the Islamic State, which was reported to have made over $320 million from the trade in 2015. This suggests that, so long as   continues relatively unchecked, efforts to cut off the revenue streams to Islamic radicals will be unsuccessful.",0
9371,"Apple Opens the iMessage Door, and the Ephemera Rushes In - The New York Times","Apple built an empire on hermetically sealed systems with sleek, minimalist designs. Nowhere was its strategy more evident than in iMessage, the company’s instant messaging system that offered a free, elegant chatting solution exclusive to Apple devices. Until last week, that is, when Apple updated its software, cracked open iMessage and allowed the ephemera of the outside internet to seep in. Now, click on an unassuming arrow in the chat window, and you’ll throw open a junk drawer of digital tchotchkes scavenged from web properties new and old. GIFs, stickers and supersized emoji dominate this digital playground, while text  —   actual words  —   becomes almost an afterthought. But unlike the freewheeling world of the outside web, where we grab and go as we please, Apple is steering users toward a tightly curated selection of   toys. None would look out of place at a   ’s birthday party. Many come at a price. Welcome to Apple’s sanitized, monetized version of internet culture. Apple’s extreme messaging makeover gives us a suite of new visual effects  —   throw confetti, release balloons and shoot lasers across the text screen  —   that recall the crude,   décor of   GeoCities sites. Another set of tricks turns the text box into a kind of slick, improvised web video: The “loud” effect makes the chat bubble stretch and tremble as it’s delivered, while the “gentle” effect shrinks it down to visualize a whimper. The most superfluous piece of flair is the “digital touch” feature, which conjures a beating heart or a sizzling fireball when you press on the screen just so. These features mimic the aesthetics of the open internet, which is obsessed with nostalgia and is not exactly subtle. But they can’t replicate the feeling of collecting digital miscellany in our travels across the internet, remixing the material and sending it along to friends who might appreciate the find. The programmatic iMessage sucks the spontaneity from the experience. It standardizes the strange. Several new features, meanwhile, blow up iMessage’s intimate chat experience to help it compete with the social networks. A handy GIF keyboard jumps off the   empire that Tumblr built, calling up video loops of broadly accessible cultural references (Honey Boo Boo dancing, two Minions giggling) to convey a range of emotional states. Another feature lets you   directly onto your photos, just like you can on Snapchat. But mostly, this thing feels like Facebook. A new class of iMessage apps  —   yes, apps within an app  —   lets chatters play Words With Friends, send money through Square or make dinner reservations on OpenTable, all right within the chat window. It feels like iMessage is trying to swallow the rest of your phone. The camera is in here, and so too can be Fandango, ESPN, and, if you want, Carrot, a snarky robot that reads you the weather report for $3. 99. In many of these cases, the service is so slight that exchanging actual words would work just fine: Want to see “Snowden” at 10:15? Did you catch the Nats game? It’s 77 and sunny  —   greeaaaaat. It’s not clear why every shade of human interaction needs to be mediated by its own app. Here’s one theory: Each tap into the iMessage world sends you further away from your chat bubbles and deeper into Apple’s labyrinth of special features. Follow the path to its inevitable conclusion, and all of a sudden, you’re no longer talking with your friends. You’re shopping. Five clicks into iMessage, you’ll arrive at Apple’s   sticker shop. Offering colorful sets of illustrations to drag and drop into your chats, it’s one of iMessage’s most tantalizing new destinations. If our chat windows function as modern living rooms, stickers offer the opportunity to appoint our walls with art from   digital creators. Too bad Apple is most excited to highlight stuff created by brands. This past weekend, the app store showcased sticker packs sponsored by Pokémon, Star Wars and Disney. Other top offerings came from the Powerpuff Girls, Marvel, Sesame Street, Sephora, the Backstreet Boys and Ellen DeGeneres, who’s charging $1. 99 for a set of illustrations including an avocado in a top hat and a cucumber in a snapback cap. The products are ads for other products. iMessage is the iPhone’s most trafficked feature. Its chats facilitate an endless combination of social interactions and emotional expressions. But Apple’s shop suggests that all conversations would improve from a Party   redecoration, with generic celebratory sentiments and   flair. “Stickers” sound inherently childish, but they don’t have to be. The stickerification of chats was pioneered by Line, a Japanese chat giant that swept Asia and is lately making a bid for western audiences. Line loves corporate synergy, too, heralding sticker sets starring Snoopy, Super Mario and Hello Kitty. But even as it attempts world chat domination, Line services online subcultures. Dozens of sticker sets feature gay characters, and more than one  —   “Fangirl’s Activities” and “I Love KPOP”  —   depicts anime girls in various states of obsession. Then there’s the sex stuff. The “UMAOTOKO” sticker shows two men in horse costumes, uh, stretching together. The most risqué sticker I could find in Apple’s version was in a set called “Failmoji. ” It’s a   butt with the caption “FART! !” Apple’s chat overhaul ushers elements of internet creativity into the company’s tightly controlled  . But the most truly creative expression to unfurl inside iMessages so far has been made in opposition to Apple’s imposed boundaries. Madison Malone Kircher, a writer at the New York magazine tech blog Select All, wrote a handy guide to using iMessage to “annoy the hell out of your friends. ” When the tech writer Casey Johnston updated her phone and the new iMessage, she posted screenshots of herself and a friend virtually vandalizing their chat window with smarmy pregnancy stickers,    effects and graphics layered so high the images became unintelligible. As Ms. Johnston put it: “The race to find the worst thing iOS can possibly do is on. ” May I suggest this celebrity sticker pack created in the image of the white rapper  ?",0
9372,"Hey Bernie Supporters, Here are 45 Times Hillary Promoted the TPP – TruthFeed","11. July 10, 2012: Remarks With Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh After Their Meeting “So we’re working on expanding it through a far-reaching, new regional trade agreement called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would lower trade barriers while raising standards on everything from labor conditions to environmental protection to intellectual property. Both of our countries will benefit. And in fact, economists expect that Vietnam would be among the countries under the Trans-Pacific Partnership to benefit the most. And we hope to finalize this agreement by the end of the year.” 12. July 10, 2012: Remarks at American Chamber of Commerce Reception and Commercial Signings “Domestic and international businesses alike continue to face rules that restrict their activities, and that, in turn, deters investment and slows growth. So we are encouraging the Government of Vietnam to keep on the path of economic and administrative reform to open its markets to greater private investment. And through the Trans-Pacific Partnership, we’re working with Vietnam and seven other nations to lower trade barriers throughout the region, as we ensure the highest standards for labor, environmental, and intellectual property protections. Vietnam was an early entrant to the TPP, and we’re hoping we can finalize the agreement this year. And the economic analysis is that of all the countries that will be participating — Australia, Canada, Mexico, others — of all the countries participating in the TPP, Vietnam stands to benefit the most. So we’re hoping to really see this agreement finalized and then watch it take off.” 13. July 8, 2012: Remarks With Foreign Minister Koichiro Gemba “We also discussed the opportunity to strengthen our economic relationship, and the United States welcomes Japan’s interest in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which we think will connect economies throughout the region, making trade and investment easier, spurring exports, creating jobs. The TPP is just one element of our increased focus on the Asia Pacific, but it is important that we recognize that the Japanese-American relationship is really at the cornerstone of everything we are doing in the Asia Pacific. We are not only treaty allies; we are friends and partners with common interests and shared values.” 14. April 30, 2012: Remarks With Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, Philippines Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario, and Philippines Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin After Their Meeting “Finally, we discussed the maturing economic relationship between our countries as well as our shared commitment to enhanced development, trade, and investment. We would like to see the Philippines join the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade community. The foreign secretary raised the Philippines’ interest in seeking passage of the Save our Industries Act, and we have conveyed that message to the United States Congress.” 15. April 12, 2012: Remarks at the White House Conference on Connecting the Americas “Now President Obama and I have said many times that this will be America’s Pacific century, and we are focused on the broader Pacific. But remember, the Pacific runs from the Indian Ocean to the western shores of Latin America. We see this as one large area for our strategic focus. That’s why we’re working with APEC; that’s why we’re creating the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We recognize the mutual benefits of engagement between the Americas and the rest of the Pacific.” 16. April 10, 2012: Forrestal Lecture at the Naval Academy “As part of that same trip last November, the President built momentum for a new far-reaching trade agreement called the Trans-Pacific Partnership that we are negotiating with eight other countries in the Asia-Pacific region. This agreement is not just about eliminating barriers to trade, although that is crucial for boosting U.S. exports and creating jobs here at home. It’s also about agreeing on the rules of the road for an integrated Pacific economy that is open, free, transparent, and fair. It will put in place strong protections for workers, the environment, intellectual property, and innovation — all key American values. And it will cover emerging issues such as the connectivity of regional supply chains, the competitive impact of state-owned enterprises, and create trade opportunities for more small-and-medium-sized businesses.” 17. April 21, 2012: Keynote Address At Global Business Conference “Big or small, we’re standing up for an economic system that benefits everyone, like when our Embassy in Manila worked with Filipino authorities on new intellectual property protections or when our negotiators ensure that the new Trans-Pacific Partnership requires that state-owned enterprises compete under the same rules as private companies.” 18. February 1, 2012: Remarks With Singaporean Foreign Minister and Minister for Law K. Shanmugam “This is a very consequential relationship. The multidimensional growth of our relationship with Singapore is an example of the importance that the United States sets on strengthening our engagement in the Asia Pacific. We are working together on a full range of issues, including moving forward on a high-quality trade agreement through the Trans-Pacific Partnership process.” 19. December 19, 2011: Remarks With Japanese Foreign Minister Koichiro Gemba After Their Meeting “The minister and I also discussed a number of bilateral and regional issues and reviewed the close and ongoing collaboration between Japan and the United States in the aftermath of last March’s earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear crisis. We discussed Japan’s recent move to pursue consultations on joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations to resolve longstanding trade concerns in order to deepen the economic ties to the benefit of both our countries. I also urged that Japan take decisive steps so that it accedes to The Hague Convention on International Parental Child Abduction and address outstanding cases.” 20. November 18, 2011: Remarks at ASEAN Business and Investment Summit “Now let me describe briefly four ways that we want to work with you: first, by lowering trade barriers; second, by strengthening the investment climate; third, by pursuing commercial diplomacy; and fourth, by supporting entrepreneurs. We’re excited about the innovative trade agreement called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. That would bring economies from across the Pacific, developed and developing alike, into a single trading community, not only to create more growth, but better growth.” 21. November 16, 2011: Presentation of the Order of Lakandula, Signing of the Partnership for Growth And Joint Press Availability With Philippines Foreign Secretary Albert Del Rosario “Together we hope to deliver an array of benefits to the people, including more foreign investment to create new jobs, a more streamlined court system that can deliver justice and protect local businesses, better services, and more resources to fight poverty. Over time, these steps will better position the Philippines to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which we hope will dramatically increase trade and investment among the peoples of the Pacific.” 22. November 10, 2011: America’s Pacific Century “There is new momentum in our trade agenda with the recent passage of the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement and our ongoing work on a binding, high-quality Trans-Pacific Partnership, the so-called TPP. The TPP will bring together economies from across the Pacific, developed and developing alike, into a single 21st century trading community. A rules-based order will also be critical to meeting APEC’s goal of eventually creating a free trade area of the Asia Pacific.” 23. October 14, 2011: Economic Statecraft One of America’s great successes of the past century was to build a strong network of relationships and institutions across the Atlantic — an investment that continues to pay off today. One of our great projects in this century will be to do the same across the Pacific. Our Free Trade Agreement with South Korea, our commitment to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, are clear demonstrations that we are not only a resident military and diplomatic power in Asia, we are a resident economic power and we are there to stay.” 24. September 15, 2011: Celebrating 60 years of the U.S.-Australia Alliance “We are working to encourage trade through the Trans-Pacific Partnership and through APEC, whose leaders the President will be hosting this fall in Hawaii. Together, we are strengthening regional institutions like the East Asia Summit and ASEAN. And as Secretary Panetta will explain, our military relationship is deepening and becoming even more consequential.” 25. July 25, 2011: Remarks on Principles for Prosperity in the Asia-Pacific “That is the spirit behind the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the so-called TPP, which we hope to outline by the time of APEC in November, because this agreement will bring together economies from across the Pacific—developed and developing alike—into a single trading community.” 26. July 20, 2011: Remarks on India and the United States: A Vision for the 21st Century “The United States is pushing forward on comprehensive trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and our free trade agreement with South Korea. We are also stepping up our commercial diplomacy and pursuing a robust economic agenda at APEC. India, for its part, has concluded or will soon conclude new bilateral economic partnerships with Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, South Korea, and others. The more our countries trade and invest with each other and with other partners, the more central the Asia Pacific region becomes to global commerce and prosperity, and the more interest we both have in maintaining stability and security. As the stakes grow higher, we should use our shared commitment to make sure that we have maritime security and freedom of navigation. We need to combat piracy together. We have immediate tasks that we must get about determining.” 27. May 17, 2011: Secretary Clinton’s Remarks With New Zealand Foreign Minister Murray McCully “We looked ahead to the East Asia summit where President Obama will participate for the first time, and the United States will send our largest, most senior delegation ever to the Pacific Island Forum in New Zealand later this year. We talked about developments in Fiji, and both New Zealand and the United States agree that the military junta must take steps to return Fiji to democracy. And we agree on the importance of pursuing negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will provide a free trade agreement for nine countries across the region, including both of ours. We’re making steady progress on this. We hope to be able to have the negotiations complete by the time we all meet in Hawaii for APEC toward the end of this year.” 28. May 2, 2011: Remarks With Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd After Their Meeting “And both of us understand the benefits of deeper economic integration and fair trade. Minister Rudd was very influential in helping us to work toward a greater, more relevant involvement in the Pacific-Asian institutions, such as joining the East Asian Summit. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is exploring ways to expand opportunity, is critical, and APEC and ASEAN are two other organizations where we work together.” 29. April 17, 2011: Remarks at the American Chamber of Commerce Breakfast “We will be hosting the 2011 APEC summit in Hawaii later this year. We are pushing to advance economic integration, remove trade barriers, and make sure that our national regulations line up in a way that encourages trade. We are also working hard on the trans-Pacific partnership, a cutting edge regional free trade agreement that would eventually cover an area responsible for over 40 percent of global trade.” 30. March 18, 2011: Remarks at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) on Latin America “As countries step up on the global stage, they will make essential contributions to helping all of us meet some of those most important challenges. Mexico, for example, made a crucial contribution to the fight against climate change through its remarkable leadership in Cancun last year. Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina in the G-20; Chile and Mexico in the OECD; Chile and Peru in the Trans-Pacific Partnership; and along with Mexico in APEC, these are all helping to build a foundation for balanced global growth, a transparent global economy, and broad-based opportunity. “ 31. March 9, 2011: Remarks at the First Senior Officials Meeting (SOM) for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum “The United States is also making important progress on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will bring together nine APEC economies in a cutting-edge, next generation trade deal, one that aims to eliminate all trade tariffs by 2015 while improving supply change, saving energy, enhancing business practices both through information technology and green technologies. To date, the TPP includes Brunei, Chile, New Zealand, Singapore, Australia, Malaysia, Peru, Vietnam and the United States.” 32. January 14, 2011: Inaugural Richard C. Holbrooke Lecture on a Broad Vision of U.S.-China Relations in the 21st Century “We are taking steps to ensure that our defense posture reflects the complex and evolving strategic environment in the region and we are working to ratify a free trade agreement with South Korea and pursuing a regional agreement through the Trans-Pacific Partnership to help create new opportunities for American companies and support new jobs here at home. Those goals will be front and center when we host the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum in Hawaii later this year.” 33: November 7, 2010: Remarks at U.S. Trade Promotion Event “Now, we’ve seen how bilateral trade benefits both sides. Our challenge now is to broaden those benefits. That means we have to look for even more opportunities to increase trade and investment between us. And it means that we work harder to broaden the benefits of trade even beyond our two countries. Australia is an important partner in negotiating the ambitious new multilateral trade deal called the Trans Pacific Partnership. Over time, we hope to deliver a groundbreaking agreement that connects countries as diverse as Peru and Vietnam with America and Australia to create a new free trade zone that can galvanize commerce, competition, and growth across the entire Pacific region.” 34. November 7, 2010: Speech and Townterview with Australian Broadcasting Company “To continue this progress, we are both pressing ahead on something called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It’s an ambitious multilateral free trade agreement that would bring together many more nations of the Pacific Rim. Australia and the United States are helping to lead those negotiations and we’re also working through APEC, which the United States will host in Hawaii in 2011. We see that as a pivotal year to drive progress on internal economic changes that will open more markets and make sure that any growth is more sustainable and inclusive. And finally, we believe that the United States and Australia have been at the forefront of organize the entire region for the future.” 35. November 5, 2010: Christchurch Trade Reception Hosted by the American Chamber of Commerce “We are looking for ways to broaden and deepen our economic ties and build on the strong foundation we already have. And we think that the Trans-Pacific Partnership is a very exciting opportunity. This multilateral free trade agreement would bring together nine countries located in the Asia Pacific region — New Zealand and the United States, Australia, Chile, Singapore, Brunei, Peru, Vietnam, and Malaysia. By eliminating most tariffs and other trade barriers, and embracing productive policies on competition, intellectual property, and government procurement, we can spur greater trade and integration not only among the participating countries, but as a spur to the entire region.” 36. November 4, 2010: Remarks With New Zealand Prime Minister John Phillip Key and New Zealand Foreign Minister Murray Stuart McCully ” Well, let me say that we discussed at some length, both the foreign minister and I and then the prime minister and I, the way forward on trade. We are very committed to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and New Zealand, again, is playing a leading role. And we want to expedite the negotiations as much as possible. So we are exploring ways that we can try to drive this agenda. I am absolutely convinced that opening up markets in Asia amongst all of us and doing so in a way that creates win-win situations so that people feel that trade is in their interests.” 37. November 3, 2010: Remarks at the Pratt & Whitney Trade Event “That is why the United States is very pleased by Malaysia’s decision to join the negotiations for the Trans Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership. This regional trade agreement will promote shared success by expanding markets and building a level playing field for workers in every country that participates.” 38. November 2, 2010: Remarks with Malaysian Foreign Minister Anifah Aman “Finally, we are pleased that Malaysia joined last month’s negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That is a pact that would expand markets and create a level playing field for people in every country that does participate. I know there are tough issues to work out, as there always are with these agreements, but Malaysia’s leadership in this region for greater economic growth is absolutely essential.” 39. November 2, 2010: Secretary Clinton’s Meeting with Kuala Lumpur Embassy Staff and Their Families “And I think we have tremendous opportunities here. But I know when I leave tomorrow, the work to make those opportunities into realities falls to all of you. So I know a lot is expected of you, but we’re going to be doing even more in Malaysia. We have a lot of plans for educational exchanges. We have some very exciting work on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, enhancing trade and investment (inaudible) that will promote closer cooperation.” 40. November 2, 2010: Townterview Hosted by Media Prima in Malaysia “So in our meetings with your government officials and even in my conversation with the prime minister earlier today, we of course talked about our bilateral relationship but we also talked about the role that Malaysia is playing in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a new free trade agreement that will enhance market access, but also working to support Afghanistan and the people there with training and medical services.” 41. October 30, 2010:Remarks With Vietnamese Foreign Minister Pham Gia Khiem “I n trade, our two countries have already made great progress. Fifteen years ago, our bilateral trade was about $450 million. Last year it was more than $15 billion. And the foreign minister and the prime minister and I talked about how to expand this trade relationship, including through the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The United States, Vietnam, and seven other countries finished a third round of negotiations on the TPP this month and we hope that Vietnam can conclude it in internal process and announce its status as a full member of the partnership soon.” 42. October 28, 2010: America’s Engagement in the Asia-Pacific “We are also pressing ahead with negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an innovative, ambitious multilateral free trade agreement that would bring together nine Pacific Rim countries, including four new free trade partners for the United States, and potentially others in the future. 2011 will be a pivotal year for this agenda. Starting with the Korea Free Trade Agreement, continuing with the negotiation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, working together for financial rebalancing at the G-20, and culminating at the APEC Leaders Summit in Hawaii, we have a historic chance to create broad, sustained, and balanced growth across the Asia Pacific and we intend to seize that.” 43. September 8, 2010: Remarks on United States Foreign Policy “On the economic front, we’ve expanded our relationship with APEC, which includes four of America’s top trading partners and receives 60 percent of our exports. We want to realize the benefits from greater economic integration. In order to do that, we have to be willing to play. To this end, we are working to ratify a free trade agreement with South Korea, we’re pursuing a regional agreement with the nations of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we know that that will help create new jobs and opportunities here at home.” 44. July 22, 2010: Remarks With Vietnam Deputy Prime Minister And Foreign Minister Pham Gia Khiem “And I am very much supportive of Vietnam’s participation as a full member in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. As Vietnam embarks on labor and other reforms, the American businesses that are investing in Vietnam can provide expertise that will aid Vietnam’s economic and infrastructure development.” 45. January 12, 2010: Remarks on Regional Architecture in Asia: Principles and Priorities “In addition, the United States is engaging in the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade negotiations as a mechanism for improving linkages among many of the major Asia-Pacific economies. And to build on political progress, we must support efforts to protect human rights and promote open societies.” 
For once in our lifetime, we the people have an opportunity to elect a President who was NOT chosen by Multinational Corporations, Big Banks, DC Elites, and the Globalist Lapdog Mainstream Media.

9373,NYT: Immigration Hard-Liners Rising in Trump Administration - Breitbart,"Advocates who want America’s immigration laws enforced have found a home in President Donald Trump’s administration, the New York Times’ Nicholas Kulish reports. [From the Times:  For years, a network of immigration   in Washington was known chiefly for fending off proposals to legalize the status of more people. But with the election of a   president, these groups have moved unexpectedly to offense from defense, with some of their leaders now in positions to carry out their agenda on a national scale.   …     Mr. Trump’s senior White House adviser, Stephen Miller, worked tirelessly to defeat immigration reform as a staff member for Senator Jeff Sessions, now the attorney general.

Hamilton, who worked on illegal immigration as Mr. Sessions’s counsel on the Judiciary Committee, is now a senior counselor at the Department of Homeland Security, the parent agency of the Border Patrol and ICE, where Mr. Feere is working. Julia Hahn, who wrote about immigration for Breitbart  —   with headlines like “  Congress Oversees   Importation of Somali Migrants”  —   has followed her former boss, Stephen K. Bannon, to the White House as a deputy policy strategist.   …     Their influence is already being felt. Mr. Trump is known for his    pledges to deport millions of people here illegally and to build a border wall, but some of the administration’s more technical yet critical changes to immigration procedures came directly from officials with long ties to the   groups.   …     Even those who have labored for decades to scale back immigration did not expect such a dramatic change. “This is inconceivable a year ago,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies. “Frankly, it’s almost inconceivable six months ago. ” Click here for the rest of the article.",0
9374,Marine Le Pen Echoes Trump’s Bleak Populism in French Campaign Kickoff - The New York Times,"LYON, France  —   The French   leader Marine Le Pen delivered a grim populist kickoff to her burgeoning presidential campaign on Sunday, warning thousands of her   supporters of “two totalitarianisms,” globalization and Islamism, that want to “subjugate France. ” Ms. Le Pen’s dark picture of a weakened France troubled by bureaucrats and burqas was a striking echo of themes being sounded across the Atlantic. France, a prosperous country with the world’s   economy, was depicted as a besieged wreck. In a packed hall here, she made a point, in an hourlong speech brimming with nationalist fervor, of praising President Trump and the Americans who had elected him, as her supporters shouted forcefully, “This is our country!” Americans, she said, had “kept faith with their national interest,” even as she promised to do the same for France, saying the French had been “dispossessed of their patriotism. ” Whether it will sell in a country undoubtedly frightened by terrorism and weary of unemployment hovering around 10 percent is unclear, but it is certain that Ms. Le Pen’s National Front party is closer than it has ever been to gaining power in France after over 40 years of existence. Polls show that she is very likely to reach at least a second round of voting in France’s   electoral process this spring. The weekend’s campaigning in this prosperous southeastern metropolis  —   her likely runoff opponent, Emmanuel Macron, the centrist former economy minister, also drew thousands to a rally across town on Saturday  —   offered a taste of the fierce electoral battle to come and a rerun of some of the American election’s dynamic. The populist Ms. Le Pen, 48, offered up a forbidding dystopia in urgent need of radical upheaval, much like Mr. Trump did. The boyish Mr. Macron  —   he is 39 and has created a nonparty political movement that has suddenly caught fire  —   spoke of “reconciling” France and of “working together,” and repeatedly addressed more than 10, 000 supporters in a giant stadium as “my friends. ” France would certainly stay in the European Union, in his view, and there would be none of Ms. Le Pen’s war on globalization. The crowd spilled onto the grounds outside the stadium, forcing many to watch Mr. Macron on huge screens. He took a backhanded slap at Mr. Trump, promising refuge in enlightened France to American scientists, academics and companies “fighting obscurantism” at home. They would have, “as of next May,” the date of the presidential runoff, “a homeland, and that will be France,” Mr. Macron promised. The candidates both present themselves as outsiders  —   Mr. Macron served in the Socialist government but is not a Socialist, while Ms. Le Pen’s party has never held power  —   but the crowds at the two rallies were a study in contrast. Judging by a   interviews, Mr. Macron’s group was peppered with teachers, doctors, academics, civil servants and men who described themselves as “heads of companies. ” In contrast, Ms. Le Pen’s crowd was full of factory workers and former soldiers, and it adored her thundering opening line: “I’m against the Right of money, and the Left of money. I’m the candidate of the people!” Still, the slickly produced   National Front event at Lyon’s modernist conference center, full of party functionaries in blazers scurrying about, showed how far the party has come from its disreputable ragtag origins in the early 1970s, when it emerged as a xenophobic coalition of former Nazi collaborators and disgruntled veterans of the Algerian war who had not forgiven the country’s leaders for having agreed to Algeria’s independence  —   like Ms. Le Pen’s father, the party’s founder,   Le Pen. She has effectively kicked him out of the party. But Ms. Le Pen’s populist tirade echoed with many of the former patriarch’s themes. She delivered her speech against a screen projecting the words “In the Name of the People,” and it was full of immigrants committing crimes, jihadists plotting attacks and European Union bureaucrats stealing jobs from the French. Ms. Le Pen promised to crack down on all of them. Clearly buoyed by Mr. Trump’s victory after years of electoral defeats in France  —   “The impossible becomes the possible,” Ms. Le Pen said of it  —   she offered a sketch of what her presidency might look like. She promised to hold a referendum within six months on European Union membership, which she called a “nightmare,” secure the country’s borders and pull France out of NATO. Foreigners, she said, were eating up France’s social benefits and offering little in return. “Our benefits are distributed to people all over the world,” she said. But in contrast to Mr. Trump, for Ms. Le Pen restoring what she called “sovereignty” to France appeared as an end in itself. She offered no return to a golden age of prosperity for her country, promising instead to “restore order” within five years. Ruin was just around the corner, in her telling. “After decades of cowardice and   our choice is a choice of civilization,” she said. “Will our children live in a country that is still French and democratic?” The crowd ate it up. “She’s got a real program, in the name of the people, for the workers, and by the workers,” said Eric Fusis, a    retired military officer from the Doubs. “It’s for the nation, and not for the financial sector and the banks,” he said.",0
9375,Forget the FBI Cache; The Podesta Emails Show How America is Run      : Information Clearing House - ICH,". Mr Netanyahu has presented this as a rebuff to those who accuse him of jeopardising Israeli security interests with his governments repeated affronts to the White House.
In the past weeks alone, defence minister Avigdor Lieberman has compared last years nuclear deal between Washington and Iran with the 1938 Munich pact, which bolstered Hitler; and Mr Netanyahu has implied that US opposition to settlement expansion is the same as support for the ethnic cleansing of Jews.
American president Barack Obama, meanwhile, hopes to stifle his own critics who insinuate that he is anti-Israel. The deal should serve as a fillip too for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic partys candidate to succeed Mr Obama in Novembers election.
In reality, however, the Obama administration has quietly punished Mr Netanyahu for his misbehaviour. Israeli expectations of a $4.5bn-a-year deal were whittled down after Mr Netanyahu stalled negotiations last year as he sought to recruit Congress to his battle against the Iran deal.
In fact, Israel already receives roughly $3.8bn  if Congresss assistance on developing missile defence programmes is factored in. Notably, Israel has been forced to promise not to approach Congress for extra funds.
The deal takes into account neither inflation nor the dollars depreciation against the shekel.
A bigger blow still is the White Houses demand to phase out a special exemption that allowed Israel to spend nearly 40 per cent of aid locally on weapon and fuel purchases. Israel will soon have to buy all its armaments from the US, ending what amounted to a subsidy to its own arms industry.
Nonetheless, Washingtons renewed military largesse  in the face of almost continual insults  inevitably fuels claims that the Israeli tail is wagging the US dog. Even The New York Times has described the aid package as too big.
Since the 1973 war, Israel has received at least $100bn in military aid, with more assistance hidden from view. Back in the 1970s, Washington paid half of Israels military budget. Today it still foots a fifth of the bill, despite Israels economic success.
But the US expects a return on its massive investment. As the late Israeli politician-general Ariel Sharon once observed, ­Israel has been a US aircraft carrier in the Middle East, acting as the regional bully and carrying out operations that benefit Washington.
Almost no one blames the US for Israeli attacks that wiped out Iraqs and Syrias nuclear programmes. A nuclear-armed Iraq or Syria would have deterred later US-backed moves at regime overthrow, as well as countering the strategic advantage Israel derives from its own nuclear arsenal.
In addition, Israels US-sponsored military prowess is a triple boon to the US weapons industry, the countrys most powerful lobby. Public funds are siphoned off to let Israel buy goodies from American arms makers. That, in turn, serves as a shop window for other customers and spurs an endless and lucrative game of catch-up in the rest of the Middle East.
The first F-35 fighter jets to arrive in Israel in December  their various components produced in 46 US states  will increase the clamour for the cutting-edge warplane.
Israel is also a front-line laboratory, as former Israeli army negotiator Eival Gilady admitted at the weekend, that develops and field-tests new technology Washington can later use itself.
The US is planning to buy back the missile interception system Iron Dome  which neutralises battlefield threats of retaliation  it largely paid for. Israel works closely too with the US in developing cyber­warfare, such as the Stuxnet worm that damaged Irans civilian nuclear programme.
But the clearest message from Israels new aid package is one delivered to the Palestinians: Washington sees no pressing strategic interest in ending the occupation. It stood up to Mr Netanyahu over the Iran deal but will not risk a damaging clash over Palestinian statehood.
Some believe that Mr Obama signed the aid package to win the credibility necessary to overcome his domestic Israel lobby and pull a rabbit from the hat: an initiative, unveiled shortly before he leaves office, that corners Mr Netanyahu into making peace.
Hopes have been raised by an expected meeting at the United Nations in New York on Wednesday. But their first talks in 10 months are planned only to demonstrate unity to confound critics of the aid deal.
If Mr Obama really wanted to pressure Mr Netanyahu, he would have used the aid agreement as leverage. Now Mr Netanyahu need not fear US financial retaliation, even as he intensifies effective annexation of the West Bank.
Mr Netanyahu has drawn the right lesson from the aid deal  he can act against the Palestinians with continuing US impunity.

November 01, 2016 "" Information Clearing House "" - "" The Guardian "" - T he emails currently roiling the US presidential campaign are part of some unknown digital collection amassed by the troublesome Anthony Weiner, but if your purpose is to understand the clique of people who dominate Washington today, the emails that really matter are the ones being slowly released by WikiLeaks from the hacked account of Hillary Clintons campaign chair John Podesta. They are last weeks scandal in a year running over with scandals, but in truth their significance goes far beyond mere scandal: they are a window into the soul of the Democratic party and into the dreams and thoughts of the class to whom the party answers.
The class to which I refer is not rising in angry protest; they are by and large pretty satisfied, pretty contented. Nobody takes road trips to exotic West Virginia to see what the members of this class looks like or how they live; on the contrary, they are the ones for whom such stories are written. This bunch doesnt have to make do with a comb-over TV mountebank for a leader; for this class, the choices are always pretty good, and this year they happen to be excellent.
They are the comfortable and well-educated mainstay of our modern Democratic party. They are also the grandees of our national media; the architects of our software; the designers of our streets; the high officials of our banking system; the authors of just about every plan to fix social security or fine-tune the Middle East with precision droning. They are, they think, not a class at all but rather the enlightened ones, the people who must be answered to but who need never explain themselves.
Let us turn the magnifying glass on them for a change, by sorting through the hacked personal emails of John Podesta, who has been a Washington power broker for decades. I admit that I feel uncomfortable digging through this hoard; stealing someones email is a crime, after all, and it is outrageous that peoples personal information has been exposed, since WikiLeaks doesnt seem to have redacted the emails in any way. There is also the issue of authenticity to contend with: we dont know absolutely and for sure that these emails were not tampered with by whoever stole them from John Podesta. The supposed authors of the messages are refusing to confirm or deny their authenticity, and though they seem to be real, there is a small possibility they arent.
Republican nominee hunkers down at Valley Forge; surrogates spread out as campaign enters final week; Clinton camp accuses FBI of double standards
With all that taken into consideration, I think the WikiLeaks releases furnish us with an opportunity to observe the upper reaches of the American status hierarchy in all its righteousness and majesty.
The dramatis personae of the liberal class are all present in this amazing body of work: financial innovators. High-achieving colleagues attempting to get jobs for their high-achieving children. Foundation executives doing fine and noble things. Prizes, of course, and high academic achievement.
Certain industries loom large and virtuous here. Hillarys ingratiating speeches to Wall Street are well known of course, but what is remarkable is that, in the party of Jackson and Bryan and Roosevelt, smiling financiers now seem to stand on every corner, constantly proffering advice about this and that. In one now-famous email chain, for example, the reader can watch current US trade representative Michael Froman, writing from a Citibank email address in 2008, appear to name President Obamas cabinet even before the great hope-and-change election was decided (incidentally, an important clue to understanding why that greatest of zombie banks was never put out of its misery).
The far-sighted innovators of Silicon Valley are also here in force, interacting all the time with the leaders of the party of the people. We watch as Podesta appears to email Sheryl Sandberg. He makes plans to visit Mark Zuckerberg (who, according to one missive, wants to learn more about next steps for his philanthropy and social action). Podesta exchanges emails with an entrepreneur about an ugly race now unfolding for Silicon Valleys seat in Congress; this man, in turn, appears to forward to Podesta the remarks of yet another Silicon Valley grandee, who complains that one of the Democratic combatants in that fight was criticizing billionaires who give to Democrats. Specifically, the miscreant Dem in question was said to be:
 spinning (and attacking) donors who have supported Democrats. John Arnold and Marc Leder have both given to Cory Booker, Joe Kennedy, and others. He is also attacking every billionaire that donates to [Congressional candidate] Ro [Khanna], many whom support other Democrats as well.
Attacking billionaires! In the year 2015! It was, one of the correspondents appears to write, madness and political malpractice of the party to allow this to continue.
There are wonderful things to be found in this treasure trove when you search the gilded words Davos or Tahoe. But it is when you search Vineyard on the WikiLeaks dump that you realize these people truly inhabit a different world from the rest of us. By vineyard, of course, they mean Marthas Vineyard, the ritzy vacation resort island off the coast of Massachusetts where presidents Clinton and Obama spent most of their summer vacations. The Vineyard is a place for the very, very rich to unwind, yes, but as we learn from these emails, it is also a place of high idealism; a land of enlightened liberal commitment far beyond anything ordinary citizens can ever achieve.
Consider, for example, the 2015 email from a foundation executive to a retired mortgage banker (who then seems to have forwarded the note on to Podesta, and thus into history) expressing concern that Hillarys image is being torn apart in the media and theres not enough effective push back. The public eavesdrops as yet another financier invites Podesta to a dinner featuring food produced exclusively by the islands farmers and fishermen which will be matched with specially selected wines. We learn how a Hillary campaign aide recommended that a policy statement appear on a certain day so that It wont get in the way of any other news we are trying to make  but far enough ahead of Hamptons and Vineyard money events. We even read the pleadings of a man who wants to be invited to a state dinner at the White House and who offers, as one of several exhibits in his favor, the fact that he joined the DSCC Majority Trust in Marthas Vineyard (contributing over $32,400 to Democratic senators) in July 2014.
(Hilariously, in another email chain , the Clinton team appears to scheme to hit Bernie Sanders for attending DSCC retreats on Marthas Vineyard with lobbyists.)
Then there is the apparent nepotism, the dozens if not hundreds of mundane emails in which petitioners for this or that plum Washington job or high-profile academic appointment politely appeal to Podesta  the ward-heeler of the meritocratic elite  for a solicitous word whispered in the ear of a powerful crony.
This genre of Podesta email, in which people try to arrange jobs for themselves or their kids, points us toward the most fundamental thing we know about the people at the top of this class: their loyalty to one another and the way it overrides everything else. Of course Hillary Clinton staffed her state department with investment bankers and then did speaking engagements for investment banks as soon as she was done at the state department. Of course she appears to think that any kind of bank reform should come from the industry itself. And of course no elite bankers were ever prosecuted by the Obama administration. Read these emails and you understand, with a start, that the people at the top tier of American life all know each other. They are all engaged in promoting one anothers careers, constantly.
Everything blurs into everything else in this world. The state department, the banks, Silicon Valley, the nonprofits, the  Global CEO Advisory Firm  that appears to have solicited donations for the Clinton Foundation. Executives here go from foundation to government to thinktank to startup. There are honors. Venture capital. Foundation grants. Endowed chairs. Advanced degrees. For them the door revolves. The friends all succeed. They break every boundary.
But the One Big Boundary remains. Yes, its all supposed to be a meritocracy. But if you arent part of this happy, prosperous in-group  if you dont have John Podestas email address  youre out.",0
9376,Slave labor: Prison food contractors funded efforts to combat marijuana legalization,"Mint Press News Tue, 25 Oct 2016 13:50 UTC An inmate makes a sandwich while working in the employees’ cafeteria at Coxsackie Correctional Facility in Coxsackie, N.Y. Food Services of America, a subsidiary of Services Group of America is funding efforts to keep marijuana illegal. It makes sense, considering that a vast majority of America's prisoners are locked in prison on marijuana charges, and the company stands to gain a lot of business from the laws staying the same. Marijuana.com report ed that the company donated $80,000 to a campaign committee opposing the legal cannabis measure on Arizona's November ballot. Services Group of America has been criticized in the past for providing food to prisons that failed to meet basic nutritional requirements. The report also indicated that the Arizona state Chamber of Commerce contributed $498,000 to the same campaign week. The effort also received a half million dollar donation from opioid maker Insys Therapeutics as well as sizeable contributions from various players in the alcohol industry. The influence that the alcohol and pharmaceutical industries have on keeping marijuana illegal has been well documented, but the influence of prison contractors is rarely discussed. The prison industry is one of the fastest growing and top-earning businesses in the United States. In the past three decades, this enterprise has grown into a monstrous system of oppression that now houses over 2 and a half million people in the US. This number is, by far, the largest prison population in the world. No country on earth has as many inmates as the ""land of the free."" Ironic isn't it? Since 1991 the violent crime rate in America has dropped at least 20%, while the amount of people in prison has increased by 50% in that time. These numbers show that the rapid growth in the prison population is primarily due to over prosecution of nonviolent crimes. This has nothing to do with ""cleaning up the streets"" or making our society safer — it is all about money and control. The prison system as it stands now does not make our society any safer but instead turns average nonviolent offenders into hardened criminals by exposing them to such a harsh environment. The sad truth is that the way our prison system has been structured has actually outlawed more than half of the US population. Nonviolent offenders have no place behind bars. The savage conditions of prison will turn most people into violent offenders once they get out. Which is exactly what the prison establishment wants - return customers. This establishment is the collection of state and quasi-state/private industries that make up the ""prison industrial complex."" Billions of dollars are made every year in this industry. One company, Wackenhut Corrections, makes over a billion dollars a year and they aren't even the biggest prison service in the country. Comment: It's a no brainer why the US has more prison inmates than any other country in the world, private prisons get slave labor and are making billions of dollars in profits! These numbers also don't take into consideration the many satellite businesses that surround this industry. There are over 1,000 vendors that specifically sell correctional paraphernalia. Even local phone companies cash in on the operation. The companies install payphones for free because those phones can generate $15,000 per year from each inmate making a phone call every day. Those companies are just the tip of the iceberg. That isn't even counting the police, lawyers, wardens, politicians and food distributors that line their pockets through the incarceration of peaceful Americans. All of these organizations have a distinct interest in keeping nonviolent people in jail. So, it should come as no surprise a prison contractor is working to keep marijuana illegal.",0
9377,Clinton Email Confirms Night On Lash In Dundalk In 2000,"0 Add Comment 
EMAILS uncovered by global hacker conglomerate Wikileaks have confirmed that Hillary Clinton and her husband Bill went on an epic session during their visit to Dundalk in December of 2000. 
Arriving in ‘the town’ to speak to 60,000 people, then-president Bill Clinton praised Dundalk for their part in cross-border relations and spoke of the influx of investment in the area from American companies such as Xerox. 
However, leaked emails have revealed that rather than go straight on up to Dublin as once believed, the Clinton’s went on the lash in the town with a gang of lads from Drogheda before ending up ‘buckled’ in the Fairways at half three in the morning. 
“The email was among those we found in a ‘deleted’ folder on Hillary’s old server,” said a spokesperson for Wikileaks. 
“In it, she talks about being ‘pure dying’ the next day, after upwards of 9 pints of Harp and ‘a big feed out of Mullens’. This just goes to show how out of control things were during the Clinton administration, and it’s just the tip of the iceberg. Who’s to say what else went on that night? Did Bill end up fingering some young one from Muirhevnamor? We can only assume he did”. 
Currently on the 2016 presidential campaign trail, Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the allegation, although a look of ‘oh fuck’ crept across her face when it was mentioned.",0
9378,"A Saudi Imam, 2 Hijackers and Lingering 9/11 Mystery - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   Inside an opulent palace in Riyadh late one evening in February 2004, two American investigators interrogated a man they believed might hold answers to one of the lingering mysteries of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks: What role, if any, did officials in Saudi Arabia’s government play in the plot? The man under questioning, Fahad   had been a Saudi consular official based in Los Angeles and the imam of a mosque visited by two of the hijackers. The investigators, staff members of the national   commission who had waited all day at the United States Embassy before being summoned to the   interview, believed that tying him to the plot could be a step toward proving Saudi government complicity in the attacks. They were unsuccessful. In two interviews lasting four hours, Mr. Thumairy, a father of two then in his early 30s, denied any ties to the hijackers or their known associates. Presented with phone records that seemed to contradict his answers, he gave no ground, saying the records were wrong or people were trying to smear him. The investigators wrote a report to their bosses saying they believed Mr. Thumairy was probably lying, though no government investigation into the Sept. 11 attacks has ever found conclusive evidence that Mr. Thumairy  —   or any other Saudi official  —   assisted in the plot. But nearly 15 years after the attacks on New York and Washington, the question of a Saudi connection has arisen again amid new calls for the release of a   section of a 2002 congressional inquiry into the attacks that discusses a possible Saudi role in the terrorist plot  —   the   28 pages, whose secrecy has made them almost mythical. American officials who have read the 28 pages say that, of all the investigative leads in that section of the report, the unanswered questions about Mr. Thumairy and the two hijackers remain the most intriguing. If there was any Saudi government role whatsoever, some still believe, it most likely would have gone through Mr. Thumairy. The fact that years of investigation found no hard proof of official Saudi involvement has led some, notably the Saudi government, to argue that it is now the stuff of wild conjecture and conspiracy theory. The material in the 28 pages has been thoroughly investigated, the Saudi foreign minister, Adel   said during a news conference here on Friday, and “those investigations have revealed that these allegations are not correct. ” “There is no there there,” he said. John O. Brennan, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, said during a recent interview with the   Al Arabiya television network that while he supported the release of the 28 pages, “people shouldn’t take them as evidence of Saudi complicity in the attacks. ” American investigations into   he said, concluded that the attacks were the work of “Al Qaeda, of Bin Laden” and “others of that ilk. ” But to some, all the circumstantial evidence provides a glimpse of a truth that has yet to be unearthed. “It’s one of those cases where there are an awful lot of very troubling coincidences,” said Richard L. Lambert, who oversaw the investigation into the hijackers’ contacts as the assistant agent in charge of the F. B. I. ’s San Diego office in the year after the attacks. At the F. B. I. the Sept. 11 plot officially remains an open case. While there is broad agreement on how it unfolded, there are aspects of the investigation that remain unresolved. And the mystery begins with the arrival at Los Angeles International Airport on Jan. 15, 2000, of two Saudi men who more than year and a half later would be among the hijackers who crashed American Airlines Flight 77 into the Pentagon. Apart from their proven devotion to the jihadist cause, the men, Nawaf   and Khalid   seemed unlikely choices for a pair of terrorists who would have to survive, and plot for months, in the United States. Neither spoke English or had experience navigating American life. That circumstance would make it all the more critical for the F. B. I. after the attacks, to find out whether the two hijackers received help after reaching Los Angeles. But after an exhaustive canvass of hotels, investigators were unable to find any definitive evidence of where and how Mr. Hazmi and Mr. Mihdhar spent their first two weeks in the United States. By some accounts, however, they worshiped at the King Fahad Mosque in the Culver City area, where Mr. Thumairy was an imam, and they may have stayed in a nearby apartment rented by the mosque. An F. B. I. document from 2012, cited last year by an independent review panel, concluded that Mr. Thumairy “immediately assigned an individual to take care of   and   during their time in the Los Angeles area. ” The review broadly upheld the conclusions of the   commission on Saudi involvement, and the F. B. I. has still not been able to fill other gaps in the timeline of those initial two weeks in January 2000. When the two hijackers reappeared in early February, they were eating at a restaurant, Mediterranean Gourmet, near the mosque. There, they encountered Omar   a fellow Saudi who was on the Saudi government payroll through the country’s civil aviation authority, possibly with an assignment to keep an eye out for Saudi dissidents in California. Mr. Bayoumi later told the F. B. I. that the meeting was happenstance  —   that he overheard Mr. Hazmi and Mr. Mihdhar, noticed their Gulf accents and struck up a conversation. But the bureau believed that Mr. Bayoumi had met with Mr. Thumairy at the mosque just before he met the hijackers in the restaurant, and investigators wondered whether Mr. Thumairy had arranged the meeting. At the time, Mr. Thumairy was part of a network of representatives of the Saudi Ministry of Islamic Affairs, which finances   trains clerics and proselytizes the conservative and intolerant strain of Islam known as Wahhabism. During his interview in Riyadh in 2004, Mr. Thumairy spoke fondly of his six years in Los Angeles, praising the warm weather and friendly people. His job at the consulate and the nearby mosque, he said, was to answer religious questions. But investigators wrote that Mr. Thumairy appeared to be “deceptive” when questioned about his contacts, notably with Mr. Bayoumi. He denied knowing Mr. Bayoumi, despite telephone records that showed 21 calls between them over two years. Whether out of charitable instincts or at someone’s direction, Mr. Bayoumi, then 42, helped the two future hijackers settle in San Diego, in the apartment building where he himself lived. He   the lease and paid the security deposit and first month’s rent, though they reimbursed him. Mr. Lambert, the former F. B. I. official in San Diego, said he was skeptical that the assistance was given by chance. With the   plot riding on the hijackers’ ability to manage daily life, he said, Qaeda leaders would most likely have made arrangements to get them help. “I have to believe something was planned for the care and nurturing of these guys after they arrived,” he said. “They weren’t too sophisticated, and they didn’t speak English. They needed help getting settled and making preparations. ” There were other tantalizing suggestions of a possible network of supporters. Mr. Hazmi and Mr. Mihdhar began worshiping at a San Diego mosque where the imam was Anwar   an American cleric who years later would became an infamous online recruiter for Al Qaeda. A Yemeni student named Mohdar Abdullah drove them around, helped them open bank accounts and connected them with flight schools. Two Saudi naval officers living in San Diego had telephone contact with Mr. Hazmi. But it was the   connection that some investigators found to be the most suspicious. The first independent panel investigating the attacks, the Congressional Joint Inquiry, compiled a list of leads into the California part of the plot that it turned over to the F. B. I. and C. I. A. and eventually became part of the 28 pages withheld from the public version of the report. That section has remained classified even though the Saudi government has long called for its release. Mr. Jubeir, the Saudi minister, reiterated that call on Friday because, he said, his government could not “respond to blank pages. ” The questions about his government’s possible role are coming from several sources. The Senate unanimously passed a bill last month that would make it easier to sue the Saudi government for any role in the terrorist attacks, and the House might take up the bill next week. A lawsuit filed against Saudi Arabia on behalf of the families of those killed in the attacks continues its slow progress through the courts. Eleanor J. Hill, the staff director for the congressional inquiry, cautioned that the 28 pages were not a Rosetta Stone that would decipher the enduring puzzles of  . “What the 28 pages are is a summary of the information given to the agencies for further investigation,” she said. “Nobody should be expecting that the 28 pages will give a final conclusion” In a statement in April, Thomas H. Kean and Lee Hamilton, the   commission’s   insisted that they took all questions about a possible Saudi role in the plot seriously, following up on the leads in the 28 pages. They said that while the commission had “not found evidence” that Mr. Thumairy assisted the hijackers, he was “still a person of interest” in the case. The commission’s final report said that “we have found no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded” Al Qaeda. Today, some commission staff members point out that the wording did not rule out the possibility that   Saudi officials had assisted the hijackers. They also said the commission operated under extreme time pressure and was not able to follow up fully on every lead. Mr. Thumairy’s visa was quietly revoked in 2003 because American officials believed he was a “radical imam,” documents show. When he tried to return to Los Angeles from a trip home, he was detained for two days and sent back to Saudi Arabia. But he told his interrogators that night in 2004 that he would never have knowingly assisted terrorists. “He said that he has always spread the message of peace, both in the U. S. and here in Saudi Arabia, and especially since ” the two commission investigators who questioned him, Dieter Snell and Rajesh De, wrote in their report on the interview. “He said he wants to work with the U.

9379,Can the U.S. Really Get Astronauts to Mars by 2030? - The New York Times,"In an essay published Tuesday on CNN’s website, President Obama renewed his call for American astronauts to visit Mars. “We have set a clear goal vital to the next chapter of America’s story in space: sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth, with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time,” he wrote. The plan is not new: The president laid out the same goal in 2010 during a speech at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. But the column on Tuesday, along with a joint blog post by senior White House and NASA officials, offered new details on how the United States expected to reach the red planet. In August, NASA awarded contracts to six companies to develop habitats that could eventually sustain astronauts on   missions like Mars. On Tuesday, John P. Holdren, the White House science adviser, and Charles F. Bolden Jr. the NASA administrator, announced that NASA would also allow private companies to hitch their own modules to the International Space Station. In the next decade, the officials added, work aboard the space station will move into a stage in which new technologies will be tested in the stretch of space between Earth and the moon. Still, plenty of challenges remain. Here are some answers to the most pressing questions. Is travel to Mars even possible? Yes. For decades, a human mission to Mars has been regarded as difficult but doable, given enough time and money and a willingness to subject astronauts to risks like radiation during the long journey. Then why aren’t we there already? In his article, President Obama quoted John Noble Wilford, the New York Times reporter who covered the Apollo moon landings in the 1960s and ’70s. Mars tugs at the imagination “with a force mightier than gravity,” Mr. Wilford wrote. Wernher von Braun, the mastermind of Apollo, sketched out plans for reaching Mars, too. Back then, many people thought the journey would move from the moon to Mars in a decade or two. But President Richard M. Nixon pared back NASA’s grand ambitions, leaving just the space shuttle. Astronauts have not ventured beyond   orbit since 1972, when the crew of Apollo 17 returned home after a   trip to the moon. In 1989, on the 20th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, President George Bush announced an initiative to send astronauts back to the moon and then onward to Mars. When NASA came back with a plan that was rumored to cost half a trillion dollars over two to three decades, the initiative faded. The main challenge is not technical it is political and financial. If Congress was to provide steady funding for the next 20 years, NASA could probably finish the task. But changes in presidential administrations have generally led to   and changes in NASA’s marching orders. Unlike the flush years at the height of the Apollo program, peaking at 4. 4 percent of the federal budget in 1966, NASA’s budget today is steady and comparatively small: The $19. 3 billion for the space agency this year amounts to about 0. 5 percent of federal spending. Won’t SpaceX get there sooner? At the International Astronautical Congress last month in Guadalajara, Mexico, Elon Musk, the chief executive of SpaceX, announced his architecture for a giant rocket and spaceship  —   what he called the Interplanetary Transport System  —   that would take colonists to Mars, 100 at a time. The trips could begin as soon as 2024, he said. Mr. Musk was confident, but that was a highly optimistic timeline. His smaller, workhorse rocket, the Falcon 9, has had two catastrophic failures in the past two years. A larger rocket under development, the Falcon Heavy, is years behind schedule. SpaceX still has to prove new technologies, like the ability to land big spacecraft on Mars. And Mr. Musk was vague about how his company would pay for all this. SpaceX is still fairly small in size and profits, and Mr. Musk conceded that he would need to rely on “a huge   partnerships. ” Has NASA been preparing for a trip to Mars? Yes, but the pace has been slow. NASA has never received a large infusion of money to pursue a trip to Mars. And while the destination has not changed, the details certainly have. For the last couple years, NASA news releases, web pages and social media postings have been festooned with the #JourneyToMars hashtag, tying a multitude of projects to the   goal of sending astronauts to Mars. In 2010, the Obama administration scuttled the rockets and crew capsule that were to have been part of the canceled Constellation program in favor of developing better technologies for space travel. Members of Congress objected, particularly those from Texas and Florida, home to big NASA facilities. The Orion crew capsule from the Constellation program was revived, and Congress instructed NASA to start work on the Space Launch System, a   rocket similar to the one that would have been built for the moon. The first launch of the Space Launch System, without a crew, is scheduled for late 2018. The second launch, with astronauts, would be at least three years later. The space agency is only now filling in details of what it would like to do on subsequent   missions between Earth and the moon, which it calls “the proving ground. ” When might the work begin in earnest? Operating the International Space Station costs NASA $3 billion to $4 billion a year. Ditching the station  —   which NASA plans to do in 2024  —   would free up money to build the other big pieces for a human Mars mission. Last year, a team at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory presented a proposal on how the agency could get to Mars in the early 2030s with its existing budget, along with increases to keep pace with inflation. It would not be enough for the astronauts to land on Mars, as a lander would be too expensive. This year, engineers at Lockheed Martin, building upon the pieces that NASA is developing, offered a proposal to send a spacecraft into orbit around Mars by 2028. NASA officials are not yet convinced. At the International Astronautical Congress meeting, William H. Gerstenmaier, NASA’s associate administrator for human exploration and operations, said he expected NASA astronauts in orbit around Mars in the 2030s. But a landing will not occur until the 2040s, he said.",0
9380,"Trump Supporter BUSTED Committing Voter Fraud: Trump Says Polls Are ‘Rigged’, So I Had To","Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr 
Voter fraud has been on the minds of Republicans for a while now. It has been proven that while yes, there are isolated incidences of in-person voter fraud, there has never been a case where it was so rampant that it changed the results of an election. But that’s exactly what the GOP wants you to think is going on. 
Donald Trump took Republican rhetoric about voter fraud and has ramped it up to an entirely new level, claiming that the upcoming election is going to be “rigged.” Apparently, Republicans are in on this alleged rigging along with Democrats, since a number of the states where the vote looks to be close are controlled by the GOP. And as everyone outside of Trump’s basket of deplorables knows, election mechanics are handled by the states, not the federal government. 
How are Trump’s supporters reacting to all of his claims about voter fraud? Well, in at least one case the answer to that question is “By committing voter fraud themselves.” 
Terri Lynn Rote, 55, an Iowa Trump supporter, has been charged with “election misconduct,” which is a Class D felony in the state. According to Iowa Public Radio, Rote allegedly voted for Trump twice when she cast her ballot during early voting. And her reason? She was afraid that her first vote would be changed to a vote for Hillary Clinton, so she voted again. The Des Moines Register reports that Rote voted once at the Polk County elections office , then again at a county satellite polling location. 
Rote told Iowa Public Radio, 
“I wasn’t planning on doing it twice, it was spur of the moment. The polls are rigged.” 
According to the Register, Rote’s case was one of three voter fraud cases that occurred in Polk County alone. The other two incidents involved people who voted on mail-in ballots, then voted again in person. Polk County auditor Jamie Fitzgerald says this is the first time in his 12 years in office he has had to deal with even one case of voter fraud, let alone three. There are no details about who the other two suspects cast ballots for. The sad thing is, polls have been saying for weeks that Trump is going to win Iowa. Cases like this might put his win there in question, which would be a perfect example of poetic justice. 
This is what the rhetoric about voter fraud has come t0 — people attempting to vote multiple times because they’re convinced that their chosen candidate is going to be cheated out of a legitimate win. Republicans, unwilling to accept that their policies are being rejected by a larger and larger segment of the U.S. population, are trying to sell the message that elections are being stolen from the GOP by “massive” voter fraud. Yet, time after time, it seems to be Republicans who are committing the lion’s share of it. They claim to love the country, but Trump and the GOP are deliberately undermining the foundation of a democracy — the integrity of the vote. Next, Trump will claim that people like Terri Rote are “political prisoners.” Just wait for it.

9381,Sarah Sanders: We’ve Got to Get Back to Draining the Swamp - Breitbart,"White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders indicated that President Donald Trump was anxious to continue draining the swamp and focusing on issues important to the American people, despite the ongoing investigation into Russia’s attempt to influence the election. [One reporter suggested during the White House press briefing that by firing Comey, Trump had made it more difficult to work with Democrats to solve other problems in Washington like health care.  “Frankly, I don’t think it matters what this president says, you’re going to have Democrats come out and fight him every single step of the way,” Sanders said. “I think that’s one of the things that’s wrong with Washington, and I think that’s one of the reasons that we’ve got to get back to focusing those issues and frankly draining the swamp a little bit further. ” Sanders drew fire from Trump opponents for trying to move beyond the investigation, when so many Democrats were calling for a special independent prosecutor. But she assured reporters that there was still no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, despite a year’s worth of speculation in the media. “I know that you all will not let this go until it does,” Sanders told reporters. “And so we’d love for that to be completed. Let’s put it behind us, let’s move on, and let’s focus on what we need to do to turn our country around. ”",0
9382,"David Cameron Gets Hustled Out of Downing Street, but the Cat Stays - The New York Times","LONDON  —   The cat can stay. The only member of the household on Downing Street to be spared the indignity of one of the fastest political transitions in recent memory will be Larry the Cat, a tabby who holds the title of chief mouser to the cabinet office. The sudden victory of Theresa May, Britain’s home secretary, in the Conservative Party’s leadership contest on Monday put Prime Minister David Cameron in the unenviable position of having to vacate his residence in about 48 hours. A large blue moving van pulled up on Downing Street on Tuesday to retrieve the Cameron family’s belongings. It is a rite of passage Britain has experienced many times, but one that is unfamiliar for most Americans. In the United States, a newly elected president has more than two months  —   between Election Day in early November and Inauguration Day, Jan. 20  —   to set up a new administration. Transitions in Britain are far swifter. A prime minister typically takes up official residence at 10 Downing Street upon getting the job, as Mr. Cameron did in 2010, when his Conservative Party took power after 13 years of Labour Party government. But the transition can seem even more jarring when a prime minister takes office without a general election. This occurred most recently in 2007, when Gordon Brown succeeded Tony Blair, and before that in 1990, when John Major took over from Margaret Thatcher. “The prime minister has said he is glad there will not be an elongated leadership process,” a spokesman for Mr. Cameron’s office said in a phone interview on Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity because of government protocol. He noted that the need for stability engendered by Britain’s vote to leave the European Union had created a sense of urgency. “This is how British democracy works. When the leader changes, the prime minister changes, and the evacuation of the premises soon follows. It’s a quick departure, but it is what it is. ” Mr. Cameron led his final cabinet meeting on Tuesday. On Wednesday, after his final prime minister’s questions in Parliament, he will visit Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace to tender his resignation. Shortly after, Ms. May will be granted an audience with the queen and invited to form a government. She and her husband, Philip, will most likely pose for a photo in front of 10 Downing Street with Mr. Cameron and his family, as their predecessors have done. Larry the Cat will be staying, the government spokesman said wryly, adding that Ms. May would inherit the tabby, adopted from an animal shelter in 2011 to help address a rat problem. Mr. Cameron made his resignation announcement on June 24, one day after the referendum to withdraw from the European Union, a decision commonly known as Brexit. On Monday, after he announced the timetable of his departure and expressed his support for Ms. May, he was recorded jovially humming as he   10 Downing Street, seemingly relieved. But the rapid departure poses logistical challenges for Mr. Cameron and his wife, Samantha, including the question of where to live. The Camerons have three children  —   their youngest, Florence, is 5  —   and hope to stay in the capital. But their home in the North Kensington area of west London has been rented out, and their farmhouse in the hamlet of Dean, Oxfordshire, about 73 miles northwest of London, is probably too far for daily commuting. The arrival of the moving van at the rear entrance on Downing Street suggested that the Camerons have at least found temporary lodgings, although officials would not confirm this. The movers arrived with 330 boxes, 30 rolls of tape and three rolls of Bubble Wrap. Simply Removals, the company that handled the Camerons’ move into Downing Street in 2010, and calls itself “London’s affordable removal firm,” advertises a “Big One” package that includes 25 standard boxes, two large boxes, two wardrobe boxes, Bubble Wrap, packing paper and tape, for 169 pounds, or about $224. A recording on the company’s office phone extolled its qualifications, adding: “That’s why we were Prime Minister David Cameron’s choice when he first moved into No. 10. ” The house at 10 Downing Street has been the official residence of the prime minister since 1735, but the Cameron family actually lives in more spacious quarters at 11 Downing Street. That house is the official residence of the chancellor of the Exchequer, Britain’s finance minister. (In 2010, the chancellor, George Osborne, chose to remain at his residence in the Notting Hill section of west London.) Peter York, a cultural commentator, said the speed with which Mr. Cameron was being “ejected” reflected the viciousness of the power struggle within the Conservative Party. The party has been known for disposing of its leaders with ruthless efficiency, notably in 1990 when Mrs. Thatcher was effectively ousted in a party coup. “He is practically being thrown out of his house, though I dare say he will have some people to help him pack his bags,” Mr. York said in a phone interview. Comparing the Conservative establishment to an elite boarding school like Eton, which Mr. Cameron attended, Mr. York added: “They are saying: ‘You are no longer the head boy. Get out of the house. It’s for the good of the school. ’” Mr. York predicted that Ms. May, the  daughter of a vicar, would bring a change in the atmospherics at 10 Downing Street, including, he said, replacing the “socially smart,   ” social circles of the Camerons  —   the “Notting Hill set,” as observers often call it  —   with a   middle England sensibility. “Theresa will make No. 10 more mainstream bourgeois, and redo the place for the   era,” Mr. York predicted. “I imagine lots of floral sofas. ”",0
9383,"Christo, Trump and the Art World’s Biggest Protest Yet - The New York Times","With one dramatic no, a major artist has just escalated the culture world’s war against Donald J. Trump. For more than 20 years, the artist Christo has worked tirelessly and spent $15 million of his own money to create a vast public artwork in Colorado that would draw thousands of tourists and rival the ambition of “The Gates,” the saffron transformation of Central Park that made him and   his collaborator and wife, two of the most   artists of their generation. But Christo said this week that he had decided to walk away from the Colorado project  —   a silvery canopy suspended temporarily over 42 miles of the Arkansas River  —   because the terrain, federally owned, has a new landlord he refuses to have anything to do with: President Trump. His decision is by far the most visible  —   and costly  —   protest of the new administration from within the art world, whose dependence on   and sometimes politically conservative collectors has tended to inhibit galleries, museums and artists from the kind of   public disavowal of Mr. Trump expressed by some other segments of the creative world. Last week, the artist Richard Prince fired an opening salvo, returning a $36, 000 payment for an artwork depicting Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter, owned by her family. The Christo project, titled “Over the River,” conceived with his wife, who died in 2009, has been fiercely opposed in state and federal court by a group of Coloradans who contend that it will endanger wildlife and cause other problems in Bighorn Sheep Canyon. Almost six miles of fabric panels were to be erected over the river for two weeks, at a cost that could have exceeded $50 million. Christo, who sells artwork depicting his proposed projects to pay for them completely on his own, has prevailed in every court battle and is awaiting a decision by a federal appeals court that would represent a final stand by opponents. But in an interview on Tuesday, he said that even if he won the case, he would no longer go forward with the work. “I came from a Communist country,” said Christo, 81, who was born Christo Vladimirov Javacheff in Bulgaria and moved to New York with   in 1964, becoming an American citizen in 1973. “I use my own money and my own work and my own plans because I like to be totally free. And here now, the federal government is our landlord. They own the land. I can’t do a project that benefits this landlord. ” Asked to elaborate on his views of the new president, he said only, “The decision speaks for itself. ” He added, “My decision process was that, like many others, I never believed that Trump would be elected. ” The establishment art world is slowly beginning to become more vocal about Mr. Trump, invoking the power of past protest movements, like the Art Workers Coalition, whose Moratorium of Art to End the War in Vietnam pressured museums to close for a day in October 1969, and led the next year to an Art Strike Against Racism, War and Oppression, which drew picketers to the Metropolitan Museum of Art because it declined to shut its doors. In late November, more than 150 prominent artists, curators and gallery workers picketed in front of the Puck Building in Downtown Manhattan, owned by the family of Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump’s husband and now a senior adviser to President Trump. Under the banner of a continuing   and protest movement called Dear Ivanka, critics of the President have directed almost daily condemnations of his actions and policies to his daughter, a prominent art collector. And on Inauguration Day, dozens of galleries  —   and a few public art institutions  —   closed in cities across the country as a part of a movement, J20, that plans to broaden protest activities in the coming months to address issues like racism, immigration and gentrification. Aesthetic refusal as a form of protest does not have universal support in the art world. Some see it as ineffective, a defeatist position that denies the power of expression itself to effect change. “I would argue that this project, on a river that traverses both red and blue states, could draw attention to the importance of federal land management and stewardship of the environment,” said Tom Eccles, the executive director of the Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College and former director of the Public Art Fund in New York. “If anything, Christo’s projects promote a sense of collective wonder, something we need more than ever right now. ” Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the White House, said it had no comment. Christo, whose work usually involves monumental wrapping or draping, a kind of beautifying abstraction of architecture or landscape, is known not only for “The Gates,” but also for highly visible projects like “Wrapped Reichstag,” in Berlin, realized in 1995 after more than 20 years of planning and proposals. Last year, “The Floating Piers,” a   walkway of fabric atop 220, 000 interlocking polyethylene cubes on Lake Iseo in the Lombardy region of Italy, drew 1. 2 million visitors. The Colorado project would have been the largest work Christo had ever attempted in America. In interviews, he spoke about how the idea came about in 1985, during a project in which he and   had wrapped the Pont Neuf in Paris. “We looked up at the fabric, and it was so beautiful, silvery and shimmering in the reflected light of the river, and we smiled at each other,” he said. The two inspected dozens of rivers and selected a length of the Arkansas, partly because it was a popular rafting spot, and the canopied fabric, stretched over steel wire cables anchored on the banks, would be best seen from beneath, on the water itself. The project, expected to take more than two years to construct, was to remain in place for two weeks, during an August, before, like all of Christo and  ’s projects, being dismantled. In court, Christo argued that he had taken every step possible to prevent   damage to the river, land around it, or animal or plant life. The group that has opposed him, Rags Over the Arkansas River, or ROAR, has argued that the federal Bureau of Land Management, in approving the project, failed to take sufficiently into account its possible threat to bighorn sheep and the impact on traffic on U. S. Highway 50 through the canyon. On Wednesday, Joan Anzelmo, a spokeswoman for ROAR, said it was “ecstatic” to hear of the decision, no matter what the artist’s reasons. “This means local people will now be protected,” she said, “as well as wildlife, birds and fish. ” In the interview on Tuesday, Christo said the   patience required in seeking approval for his projects has always been an element of the spirit of the projects themselves. He needs to feel passion about them, in the same way that a more traditional painter or sculptor does, he added. But in this case, “that pleasure is gone” because of the nature of the new administration. “I am not excited about the project anymore,” he said. “Why should I spend more money on something I don’t want to do?”",0
9384,War on Drugs Heading in Wrong Direction?,"License DMCA My guest today is Maya Schenwar, Truthout's editor-in-chief, author of Locked Down, Locked Out: Why Prison Doesn't Work and How We Can Do Better , and co-editor of Who Do You Serve, Who Do you Protect? Police Violence and Resistance in the United States . Joan Brunwasser: Welcome back to OpEdNews, Maya. We last spoke back in January, 2015. Now, I'd like to discuss your recent piece: Death Penalty for Heroin Dealers? More Proof the Drug War Is Not Over . Who thought the drug war was over in the first place and why? - Advertisement - Maya Schenwar: There has been a shift in mainstream politics toward condemning the drug war, and for good reason. It has done nothing to stem drug misuse, and meanwhile it has resulted in the criminalization and incarceration of millions of people, overwhelmingly Black and Brown people. With countless studies demonstrating its ""failure"" (I put this in quotes because I don't think the drug war was actually devised to help people in the first place), politicians who defend it end up looking pretty bad. So the current line is to say it's in the past, and that we have a new approach to drugs going forward. The Obama administration, many state governments, and even conservative politicians (including the ""Right on Crime"" crowd) have said that we need to leave behind the old war on drugs. In February, Eric Holder said the drug war is ""over,"" and Obama increasingly talks about treating drug-related issues as ""public health problems"" instead of criminal problems. JB: How does that change anything: the disproportionate numbers of minority members locked up for possession, more single moms incarcerated for the same, families split up and minors left with no parent at home? Are they, then, opening the prison gates and saying, ""We were wrong. This was all a big mistake; it didn't work and we diverted and wasted billions of dollars that could have been used to good purpose. And we ruined your lives for nothing. Oops. Sorry.""? MS: No, no one is opening the prison gates, unfortunately! There are some limited steps being taken toward scaling back drug-war-related incarceration. For example, Obama has issued hundreds of commutations to people serving super-long drug sentences. Some states have taken steps to reduce some very low-level drug offenses to misdemeanors instead of felonies, which means people are a lot less likely to be incarcerated for them. (California's Proposition 47 is an example of this, although the emphasis on ""low-level offenses"" has actually entrenched the idea that people should be severely punished for ""higher-level offenses.) - Advertisement - Obviously, in a number of states, marijuana is being decriminalized, and some are legalizing it. However, that doesn't mean there are no longer marijuana arrests -- in fact, an ACLU study released recently showed there were more marijuana possession arrests last year than arrests for all violent crimes. The study also showed that Black people are still disproportionately arrested in far greater numbers than white people, despite using marijuana at about the same rate as white people. JB: How do we understand this, Maya? Beyond being convinced that the whole penal system is seriously screwed up, what's the point of increased marijuana arrests? Is this a last gasp effort or at least partly to fill up jail cells and local or private prison coffers? MS: There wasn't an increase in marijuana arrests overall last year; there was a decrease. But obviously it was a small decrease, given that there was a larger number of possession arrests than all violent crime arrests. I don't think it's about filling private prison coffers. Ultimately, prisons are expensive for states, and I don't actually see money as a primary motivator to incarcerate people. Until we challenge criminality itself -- and challenge the white supremacy that underlies the US's version of criminality -- we won't be done with large-scale incarceration. We have to understand incarceration by looking at how people are being labeled as disposable and as ""dangerous,"" and how those things are racialized. Whether it's marijuana possession or something else, there will always be a convenient ""crime"" with which to charge Black and Brown people unless white supremacy itself is confronted. We also have to think about ableism, transmisogyny, patriarchy, economic injustice, capitalism -- really confronting the structures that make it possible for our society to lock millions of people in cages. If we look at the drug war through this lens, we understand that's it's not some stand-alone entity; it's one tool deployed by a larger power structure that continually targets marginalized people in order to keep itself going. JB: Good point. Does the fact that the penal dysfunction is part of a larger overarching dysfunction make it easier or harder to improve it? And what's ableism? I don't know that I'm familiar with that term. MS: I think the fact that it's part of an overarching structural problem means that it can't really been improved, per se -- it really has to be uprooted. I wouldn't say that can happen extremely easily; it's more a goal to move toward while making incremental changes. Ableism is the structural oppression against and devaluation of people with disabilities. One of the ways it plays out in relation to prison is the extremely high level of incarceration of people with psychiatric and intellectual disabilities. 'Locked Down, Locked Out: Why Prison Doesn't Work and How We Can Do Better' by Maya Schenwar(image by Berrett-Koehler Publishers) License DMCA JB: Quite true. I believe much of that shift occurred when President Reagan ""reallocated"" resources, closing many state mental hospitals and dumping the patients onto the streets and the unprepared public. And we've been paying the price, one way or another, ever since. What haven't we talked about yet? MS: There's of course much more to talk about, but we have to end things somewhere, right? One thing I'd caution people against is assuming that the automatic alternative to incarceration for people convicted of drug offenses should be drug treatment. First of all, most people arrested for drug offenses aren't dependent on drugs (most people who use drugs are not dependent on them); there are safe ways to use drugs and we have to challenge laws that stigmatize their use.",0
9385,Kanye West rushed to hospital with suspected ‘dislocated ego’,"Tuesday 22 November 2016 by Mark Maguire Kanye West rushed to hospital with suspected ‘dislocated ego’ 
Rap ‘legend’ Kanye West is this evening undergoing emergency treatment for a suspected dislocated ego, suffered while talking to himself in the mirror. 
The self-loving 39-year-old was rushed to hospital after a member of his entourage noticed worrying signs that the usually conceited front-man was not his normal vanity-obsessed self. 
They told reporters, “One minute everything seemed fine, and he was swaggering around the place looking down his nose at all the rest of us, like normal. 
“Then, what seemed like just seconds later, he was stood at the side of the room, shoulders slumped, displaying some frankly worrying signs of genuine humility. 
“I asked him he was OK, but all he could say was, ‘The Life of Pablo – that album is just a load of old self-indulgent horseshit, isn’t it?’. I’m not afraid to admit that at that moment, I was terrified.” 
“It soon became a race to see how quickly we could reach the emergency services and get him some treatment before the ego suffered permanent damage.” 
The star’s support staff reacted swiftly, with an on-site emergency first-aider ensuring Kanye received some much needed mouth-to-ear ego stroking. 
One witness explained, “I think that first-aid saved his ego to be honest – they just seemed to instinctively know how to react, and the right thing to say. Thankfully the paramedics arrived after just a few minutes. 
“They brought all this incredible equipment and spent about fifteen minutes applying emergency ego-massage, while the rest of us just looked on in horror. 
“Fortunately they managed to stabilise him so that they could get him to the hospital, but they continued the ego-massage as they loaded him into the ambulance. 
“The last thing I heard them say was, ‘You’re amazing Kanye, and The College Dropout is the best album of the last twenty years, and that’s absolutely all down to you, and you alone’.” 
Kanye was rushed to a specialist ‘Ego Hospital’ in Beverly Hills and underwent a complex eight-hour surgery to re-locate the ego, which Doctors have declared a complete success. 
A hospital spokesperson confirmed that his recuperation could take up to eight weeks, but that he would likely make a full recovery and should return to his previous levels of brazen egotism.

9386,‘La La Land’ Sizzles in Limited Release in North America - The New York Times,"LOS ANGELES  —   It was a weekend of nice and naughty at the box office, with two buoyant musicals, “Moana” and “La La Land,” turning in big results alongside the decidedly raunchy “Office Christmas Party. ” After a celebrated run on the fall film festival circuit, the Lionsgate musical “La La Land” arrived in five locations and collected a sizzling $855, 000, one of the best   results on record. The total surpassed the initial outcome for “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” which became a runaway indie hit in 2014. “La La Land,” directed by Damien Chazelle and starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, cost $30 million to make. It is widely considered by awards prognosticators to be the film to beat at the coming Academy Awards. In its third weekend in theaters, “Moana” (Disney) maintained a remarkable hold on multiplex audiences, once again selling the most tickets of any film in North America. The animated juggernaut collected about $18. 8 million, for a new domestic total of $145 million, according to comScore, which compiles ticketing data. Disney is also expected to dominate in the weeks to come. The company’s Lucasfilm division will unleash “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” on Friday in more than 4, 000 theaters, and sites like MovieTickets. com are reporting breakneck advance sales. “Office Christmas Party,” with an ensemble cast led by Jason Bateman and Jennifer Aniston, took in about $17. 5 million over the weekend, a heftier total than some analysts had predicted before its release. The   comedy, which cost DreamWorks Pictures and a partner $45 million to produce, was distributed by Paramount.

It is called the SS-18, the “Satan” for short. As Obama has gutted military preparedness, Putin has busily been doing the opposite. The Russian military is capable of wiping our large swaths of this country in less than an afternoon. 
The title of this piece is 115 million Americans killed in 30 minutes. Thirty minutes is the approximate time that an SS-18, launched from inside Russia, would reach the Eastern Seaboard, where 5 of these missiles would destroy the entire east coast in which 115 million Americans would perish with scarcely a trace. The casualty figures come from Paul Craig Roberts. 
When will the bulk of Americans realize that they have been sold out under a treasonous chief executive? You will scarcely believe your eyes and ears in the following report as you are about to learn that we are Russia’s mercy. 
The stunning details are in the following video. DOES ANYONE THINK THAT HILLARY’S “NO-FLY ZONE” IN SYRIA, IS STILL A GOOD IDEA?",0
9388,"For Many Farmers, Retirement Is a Source of Dread - The New York Times","MASONVILLE, Iowa  —   Lavern Kelchen stood in the back of a church hall in jeans and a   shirt, tapped his left index finger on his leg and placed the winning bid on a   farm here in eastern Iowa. It marked the seventh auction he had attended in the last five years and, with a bid of $9, 000 an acre, his first win. “I’m just getting a really good start,” said Mr. Kelchen, 51, who farms 2, 400 acres near Edgewood, Iowa. “I plan to go as long as I possibly can. ” For farmers like Mr. Kelchen, whose work is a   lifestyle, retirement seems more like a sentence than a prize. “The first two days I’d probably be all right,” he said. “But after that, I’d be going haywire. ” Mark Francois, 64, a farmer who also bid on the farm, echoed that sentiment. “I can only play so much golf,” he said, seated beside his son. “I don’t look forward to retirement. I look forward to doing fieldwork. ” Even Dean Vaske, 52, the farmer whose late parents’ land was being auctioned off, agreed. “I’m glad retirement is far away,” he said. “I love what I do, so why would I want to quit?” Farmers tend to work longer than most Americans, and recent statistics show they are farming even later in life, driven by work that is their identity, aided by technology that lightens its physical toll, and spurred by solid profits off record yields. According to the Department of Agriculture’s latest census, conducted in 2012, the average age of principal farm operators in the United States is 58, up from 50. 5 in 1982. One third are at least 65, the traditional retirement age, and 12 percent are 75 or older. Ask baby boomer farmers here how they are planning for retirement and the likely answer is: They are not. Fifteen percent of Iowa farmers never intend to retire, according to a 2014 farm poll by Iowa State University Extension and Outreach and the state agriculture department. Another 20 percent said they plan to eventually   continuing to provide some managerial control or labor to their farms. Many do not have a formal retirement fund. The land, they say, is their 401( k). The same fierce independence that drew them to farming characterizes their retirement approach: free of pensions, unions and   experts, just how they like it. “We’re on our own,” Mr. Francois said. “All you have to do is ask for advice, but we don’t. ” Only 49 percent of Iowa farmers have identified a successor to eventually run their farms, according to the 2014 farm poll. Many avoid the topic because they equate retirement with mortality. They are quick to relay stories of farmers who died shortly after retiring  —   presumably, they imply, because of a loss of purpose. Even those who have selected a successor are loath to pick a retirement date and actively prepare for it. It took a tornado for Dean Vaske’s father, Art, to retire and move into town. He had been milking cows twice a day until his early 70s. Then the tornado wiped out another son’s farm buildings, prompting Art to invite that son to move onto his farm. Looking back, Dean Vaske said, the transition was smooth. “We couldn’t have planned it much better,” he said. Farmers here assume retirement will work itself out. “If everyone’s raised right, the next generation will take care of us when we get to the point that we can’t farm ourselves,” said Jim Hogan, 66, a   farmer from Monticello, Iowa, whose father never retired. Mr. Hogan has two sons who farm with him and “no idea” how he will structure his retirement income when he scales back from daily operations. Yet he admits that his father’s lack of succession planning (the farm was ultimately left in the control of Mr. Hogan’s mother when his father died) was not ideal, limiting what Mr. Hogan and his brothers can now do with the land, which is still owned by his mother in a trust controlled by a law firm. David W. Baker, a farm transition specialist from Iowa State Extension and Outreach, said that when he counsels families to help them begin discussing retirement, 90 percent of his meetings bring someone to tears. “There are strong feelings about the farm, about what grandpa and grandma did, about my son or daughter having no interest in my farm,” Mr. Baker said. Amanda Van Steenwyk, who leads a   program for the Iowa Farm Bureau, said the   scenario can be devastating. “From the lack of planning, the farm will get split up  —   or even worse, the family will get split up,” she said. A farmer’s retirement is determined by whether an adult child is involved in the operation. This is the case for 31 percent of Iowa farmers, according to the farm poll, which means they will typically sell or rent the land to their farming child upon retirement. Arriving at an equitable arrangement for the nonfarming children can be a challenge, experts say. Meanwhile, there is pressure on the child operating the family farm, said Matt Hein, 61, a Monticello farmer. “You’re actually working with your father’s retirement plan,” he said. “You to go to bed at night thinking, ‘That’s a retirement plan. ’” For Jack Kintzle, 73, a retired   farmer near Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the fact that his children chose not to farm made him wistful at first, but ultimately simplified his retirement equation. “It helped me make a cleaner break,” he said. Now Mr. Kintzle lives off his 700 acres. Some retired farmers   leasing their land and splitting the crop between owner and operator. Others set up a   lease in which another operator pays a fixed price per acre to work the land and keep all of its income. Last year’s average rate was $235 per acre, according to Iowa State data. But farmers are in no rush, guided by a reversal of conventional wisdom on retirement. While many Americans fear they could work themselves to death, farmers see their livelihood as their lifeline. Success does not allow them to quit earlier, it prods them to keep going. And they don’t envy retirees  —   they feel sorry for them. “It’s sad when people have a countdown to retirement,” Mr. Francois said. “They obviously don’t love their job. My friend who worked at the Postal Service had it right down to the hours till he could quit. Now he spends a lot of time just reading. He doesn’t get outside as much. I don’t think he even looks good. ”",0
9389,Technology Blackout Feared As Solar Storm Hits Earth,"  Edmondo Burr in Sci/Environment // 0 Comments Yesterday the sun erupted with a huge solar flare sending streams of particles bombarding towards Earth. 
A solar storm can wreak havoc on electricity power lines and technologies that rely on satellites. 
People are warned to prepare for the worst in coming days. 
The Daily Express reports: 
Solar storms can affect technology here on Earth as the radiation thrown at our planet heat the outer atmosphere, resulting in it expanding. 
As a result, satellite communications struggle to penetrate the atmosphere, essentially blocking communications which could lead to a lack of GPS navigation, mobile phone signal and satellite TV such as Sky. 
Furthermore, higher currents in the magnetosphere – the Earth’s magnetic field – could result in a surge of electricity in power lines, which can blow out electrical transformers and power stations leading to a temporary loss of electricity in a region – although this usually only occurs in areas that are in high altitude. 
The solar storm is predicted to carry on until October 27 and officials are telling citizens to prepare for the worst. 
The US Space Weather Prediction Center said: “Voltage corrections may be required, false alarms triggered on some protection devices. 
“Drag may increase on low-Earth-orbit satellites, and corrections may be needed for orientation problems”. 
The storm was originally described as a “serious” G3 level storm, although it was later downgraded to a G2. 
The UK Met Office said: “Elevated solar winds are expected throughout the period, with G1-G2 minor to moderate geomagnetic storms forecast.” Greenland 
However, on the plus side, solar storms can lead to the Northern Lights being visible. 
As the magnetosphere gets bombarded by solar winds, stunning blue lights can appear over the upper reaches of the Northern hemisphere and the lower parts of the southern hemisphere.",0
9390,Aid Agencies in Iraq Brace for Exodus as Civilians Flee Mosul,"First Civilians From Surrounding Towns Arrive in Camps   
Aid agencies which have been trying to prepare for the huge influx of displaced persons from the city of Mosul are reporting the first arrivals of civilians who fled the surrounding towns , most arriving on foot, and many with nothing more than the clothing on their backs. 
The agencies are playing up the months of preparation they engaged in, but exactly how they will cope with what could easily be a million new refugees with very little assistance from either the Iraqi government or from the US-led coalition, is still up in the air. 
The UN has reported six camps are ready to accept about 50,000 people, and 11 more camps are in the process of being readied. At the same time, the UN has warned that they don’t have the funding to support all of these refugees over the long run, and the Mosul battle looks to very much be the long run. 
Iraq has warned civilians in Mosul against fleeing from the city, a warning that came after the US announced they intend to conduct air strikes against fleeing ISIS fighters. It’s unclear how many civilians will be able to “stay put” as they were ordered, but the expectations of an intense urban battle are likely to drive many to flee while they still can.  ",0

9392,When Solar Panels Became Job Killers - The New York Times,"WUHAN, China  —   Russell Abney raised two children on solar power. The    Georgia Tech graduate worked for the last decade in Perrysburg, Ohio, a suburb of Toledo, pulling a good salary as an equipment engineer for the largest American   maker. On the other side of the world, Gao Song boasted his own solar success story. A former organic fruit retailer who lives in the dusty Chinese city of Wuhan, he installed solar panels on his roof four years ago and found it so lucrative that he went into business installing them for others. By last summer, he and a team of 50 employees were installing   systems on nearly 100 roofs a month. Then China shook the global solar business  —   and transformed both their lives. “A small vibration back in China,” said Frank Haugwitz, a longtime solar industry consultant in Beijing, “can cause an avalanche in prices around the world. ” Late last summer, Chinese officials began publicly toying with slashing the subsidies they offer domestic   buyers. Mr. Gao’s business dried up, and he laid off half his workers. “I have been working hard and was just off to a good start,” he said. “Now I have to start over. ” China’s   makers cut their prices by more than a quarter to compensate, sending global prices plummeting. Western companies found themselves unable to compete, and cut jobs from Germany to Michigan to Texas and points beyond. Those points included Perrysburg  —   where Mr. Abney and about 450 other employees suddenly found themselves out of work. “Within just a few months, it all came crashing down,” Mr. Abney said. “It’s like a death in the family. People feel awkward talking about it. ” President Trump, who pressed President Xi Jinping of China on trade and other issues this week when they met at    in Palm Beach, Fla. has vowed to end what he calls China’s unfair business practices. Much of his oratory has involved   smokestack industries like steel  —   industries in which the jobs were already disappearing even before the rise of China. But economists and business groups warn that China’s industrial ambitions have entered a new,   phase. With its deep government pockets, growing technical sophistication and a comprehensive plan to free itself from dependence on foreign companies, China aims to become dominant in industries of the future like renewable energy, big data and   cars. With solar, it has already happened. China is now home to   of the world’s   capacity. The efficiency with which its products convert sunlight into electricity is increasingly close to that of panels made by American, German and South Korean companies. Because China also buys half of the world’s new solar panels, it now effectively controls the market. For much of the past century, the ups and downs of the American economy could spell the difference between employment or poverty for people like Chilean copper miners and Malaysian rubber farmers. Now China’s policy shifts and business decisions can have the same kind of global impact once wielded by power brokers in Washington, New York and Detroit. The story of China’s rise in solar panels illustrates the profound difficulties the country presents to Mr. Trump, or to any American president. Its size and   economy give it the ability to redefine industries almost on a dime. Its   pursuit of dominance in crucial industries presents a direct challenge to countries where leaders generally leave business decisions to the businesses themselves. Already, China is the world’s largest maker and buyer of steel, cars and smartphones. While it does not necessarily dominate those industries, its government ministries are moving to replicate that success with robots, chips and software  —   just as in solar. Chinese panel makers “have the capital, they have the technology, they have the scale,” said Ocean Yuan, the chief executive of Grape Solar, a distributor of solar panels based in Eugene, Ore. Of American rivals, he said, “they will crush them. ” Before he became one of the solar industry’s most powerful players, Liu Hanyuan raised fish. The son of peasants from China’s hardscrabble southwest, Mr. Liu sold some of the family’s pigs in 1983 for what was then around $100 to buy some fish. Soon he went into the even more lucrative business of selling fish feed, and he eventually moved into pig feed and duck feed. The brand name, Keli, is a combination of the first and last Chinese characters from a famous paraphrasing of Karl Marx by Deng Xiaoping, the father of modern China: Science and technology are primary productive forces. According to Mr. Liu’s authorized biography, he faced local criticism at first for his early embrace of capitalism, and responded by saying that his fish feed was an improved product that followed Deng’s dictum. “When my business grows bigger,” he said at the time, “I will build another floor for labs. ” Plans to shift into computer chips did not pan out, so by 2006, he shifted to solar technology, after taking control of a company that made chemicals for the production of polysilicon, the crystalline raw material for solar panels. That move proved fortunate: China was just then embarking on a concerted effort to become a   powerhouse. Over the next six years, Beijing pushed   banks to provide at least $18 billion in loans at   rates to   manufacturers, and encouraged local governments to subsidize them with cheap land. China had more on its mind than just dominating solar exports: Its severe pollution problems and concerns that rising sea levels from climate change could devastate its teeming coastal cities lent urgency to efforts to develop green technology. At the same time, China also became a major player in wind power through similar policies. With ample assistance, China’s   production capacity expanded more than tenfold from 2007 to 2012. Now six of the top 10   makers are Chinese, including the top two, compared with none a decade ago. The solar division of Mr. Liu’s company, the Tongwei Group, which discloses few financial details, is one of the   players in the industry. That growth forced many American and European   manufacturers into a headlong retreat. Two dozen of them filed for bankruptcy or cut back operations during President Barack Obama’s first term, damaging the heady optimism then about clean energy. In 2012 and 2013, the United States and the European Union concluded that Chinese   makers were collecting government subsidies and dumping panels, or selling them for less than the cost of producing and shipping them. Both imposed import limits. Chinese manufacturers and officials denied improper subsidies and dumping, and still do. Several large Chinese manufacturers that had previously overexpanded and had been selling at heavy losses for years then closed their doors. But Western solar companies say Chinese banks still lent heavily to the survivors despite low   rates from the defaults of big Chinese solar companies like Suntech, Chaori and LDK Solar. “The main subsidy is massive,   loans by Chinese   commercial banks to finance new capacity and also the massive ongoing losses of Chinese companies,” said Jürgen Stein, the president of American operations for SolarWorld, a big German panel maker. Li Junfeng, a top architect of China’s   policies until he retired from that responsibility in early January, said that the West had exaggerated the role of the state in helping to finance Chinese   manufacturers. “The market can decide for itself,” he said. “The good companies can get money, the bad companies cannot. ” Like the Chinese solar industry as a whole, Tongwei is thinking bigger. Mr. Liu’s company bought an enormous   manufacturing complex in central China in 2013 from LDK Solar, which had run into severe financial difficulties. Now it plans to build factories of five gigawatts apiece in the Chinese cities of Chengdu and Hefei. By comparison, the entire global market is only about 77 gigawatts each year, while world capacity is 139 gigawatts. At the same time, Mr. Liu is dismissive of companies in the West that pioneered many solar technologies but have lost their market shares to China. “They are very jealous,” he said, “and cannot catch up with China’s pace. ” From an environmental standpoint, China’s solar push has been good for the world.   prices have fallen close to 90 percent over the past decade. Many of the solar panels in America’s backyards and solar power plants are made by Chinese companies. But for the solar industry, Chinese expansion could mean an extended period of low prices and cutbacks for everybody else. “The solar industry is facing again, I would say, a new winter,” said Patrick Pouyanné, the chairman and chief executive of Total, the French oil and gas giant, which owns a controlling stake in SunPower, an American   maker. China now hopes to replicate its solar industry’s growth in other areas. Under a plan called Made in China 2025, China hopes to become largely   within seven years in a long list of industries, including aircraft,   trains, computer chips and robots. The plan echoes the   and   buildup a decade ago, but with a larger checkbook. Made in China 2025 calls for roughly $300 billion in financial backing: inexpensive loans from   banks, investment funds to acquire foreign technologies, and extensive research subsidies. If successful, Made in China 2025 would represent a fundamental shift in how China deals with the world. Initially, most of the industries that moved to China, such as shoe and clothing production, were already leaving the United States anyway. Heavy industries such as steel followed. While the shift was profound  —   some economists estimate that up to 2. 4 million American jobs were lost to China from 1999 to 2011, though others dispute that analysis  —   China has struggled in some areas like autos to create viable global competitors. American and European business groups have warned that the China 2025 plan means that a much wider range of Western businesses will face the same kind of   competition that has already transformed the solar industry. “The policies started in solar and are now starting to infect the higher reaches of the economy with Made in China 2025,” said Jeremie Waterman, the president of the China Center at the United States Chamber of Commerce in Washington. In the end, China did not slash subsidies for rooftop solar panels, and cut them only slightly for large   arrays. But prices barely rebounded from last year’s slump. Mr. Gao, of Wuhan, is a slender    whose dark hair is already thinning. He said that his business had depended not on homeowners but on   investors who made use of the subsidies. The investors would pay   of the cost of a homeowner’s system. The homeowner would take only enough electricity from the panels to power the home. The investor would sell the rest of the electricity to the grid at a high,   price. The suggestion that the government might cut the subsidy, even though the government did not follow through on it, panicked his investors. So they stopped financing further deals. “They fear that the year after next, they may have nothing,” he said. He recently hired four more employees to drum up sales, even as installations creep along at a small fraction of demand a year ago. In Perrysburg, Mr. Abney lost his job at First Solar, the largest   manufacturer based in the United States, and looked in vain for a job in the auto industry in the Toledo area. He ended up taking a job three weeks ago at a building materials company in Lancaster, Pa. His daughter is going off to college in the autumn, while his wife and son, a high school freshman now, will follow him to central Pennsylvania this summer. “It’s hardest on him because we’re pulling him away from his high school and his activities,” Mr. Abney said. First Solar struggled with improving Chinese technology as well as dropping prices. It laid off workers in Perrysburg partly because it decided not to produce its Series 5 generation of panels, which represented a limited improvement over its existing Series 4 panels. First Solar, to better compete with Chinese producers, will wait for its     Series 6 panels to be ready for production in 2018. In the end, First Solar, which is based in Tempe, Ariz. laid off 1, 600 people worldwide. “It’s just kind of a shock factor when a lot of families realize they’re no longer going to have a job,” said Michael Olmstead, the Republican mayor of Perrysburg. Though Mr. Abney has started his new job at almost the same pay as his previous one, he says part of him pined for the days when the United States still led in solar energy, and when First Solar was at the forefront of that leadership. “They were good for us,” he said. “And it was great while it lasted. ”",0
9393,Meet Peter Kadzik – Another Clinton Stooge at the Justice Department,"Liberty Blitzkrieg October 27, 2016 
The name Peter Kadzik probably doesn’t ring a bell for many of you, although it probably should. This guy is a real piece of work, as an excellent article published earlier today at the Daily Caller demonstrates. 
Here’s some of what we learned: 
The day after Hillary Clinton testified in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October, John Podesta, the Democrat’s campaign chairman, met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends, including Peter Kadzik, a top official at the Justice Department. 
The dinner arrangement, revealed in hacked Podesta emails released by WikiLeaks, is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the Clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of state’s email practices. 
Podesta and Kadzik, the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs, were in frequent contact, other emails show. In one email from January, Kadzik and Podesta, who were classmates at Georgetown Law School in the 1970s, discussed plans to celebrate Podesta’s birthday. And in another sent last May, Kadzik’s son emailed Podesta asking for a job on the Clinton campaign. 
“The political appointees in the Obama administration, especially in the Department of Justice, appear to be very partisan in nature and I don’t think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server,” says Matthew Whitaker, the executive director of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a government watchdog group. 
Kadzik, who started at the DOJ in 2013, helped spearhead the effort to nominate Lynch, who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president. 
Kadzik represented Podesta during the Monica Lewinsky investigation. And in the waning days of the Bill Clinton administration, Kadzik lobbied Podesta on behalf of Marc Rich, the fugitive who Bill Clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office. 
In a Sept. 2008 email , which the Washington Free Beacon flagged last week, Podesta emailed an Obama campaign official to recommend Kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign. 
Podesta, who would later head up the Obama White House transition effort, wrote that Kadzik was a “fantastic lawyer” who “kept me out of jail.” 
Podesta made false statements to a grand jury impaneled by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for the investigation. But he defended the falsehoods, saying later that he was merely relaying false information from Clinton that he did not know was inaccurate at the time. 
“He did lie to me,” Podesta said about Clinton in a National Public Radio interview in 1998. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in Feb. 1999 of perjury and obstruction of justice charges related to the Lewinsky probe. 
Kadzik, then a lawyer with the firm Dickstein Shapiro Morin & Oshinsky, represented Podesta through the fiasco. 
Podesta had been promoted to Clinton’s chief of staff when he and Kadzik became embroiled in another scandal. 
Kadzik was then representing Marc Rich, a billionaire financier who was wanted by the U.S. government for evading a $48 million tax bill. The fugitive, who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism, had been living in Switzerland for 17 years when he sought the pardon. 
To help Rich, Kadzik lobbied Podesta heavily in the weeks before Clinton left office on Jan. 20, 2001. 
A House Oversight Committee report released in May 2002 stated that “Kadzik was recruited into Marc Rich’s lobbying campaign because he was a long-time friend of White House Chief of Staff John Podesta.” 
The report noted that Kadzik contacted Podesta at least seven times regarding Rich’s pardon. 
On top of the all-hands-on-deck lobbying effort, Rich’s ex-wife, Denise Rich, had doled out more than $1 million to the Clintons and other Democrats prior to the pardon. She gave $100,000 to Hillary Clinton’s New York Senate campaign and another $450,000 to the Clinton presidential library. 
The first mention of personal contact between Podesta and Kadzik in the WikiLeaks dump is in an Oct. 23, 2015 email sent out by Vincent Roberti, a lobbyist who is close to Podesta and his superlobbyist brother, Tony Podesta. In it, Roberti refers to a dinner reservation at Posto, a Washington D.C. restaurant. 
The dinner was set for 7:30 that evening, just a day after Clinton gave 11 hours of testimony to the Benghazi Committee. 
Podesta and Kadzik met several months later for dinner at Podesta’s home, another email shows . And in an email sent on May 5, 2015, Kadzik’s son asked Podesta for a job on the Clinton campaign. 
I’ll have the lobster risotto with a side of cronyism and middle class destruction. 
As head of the Office of Legislative Affairs, Kadzik handles inquiries from Congress on a variety of issues. In that role he was not in the direct chain of command on the Clinton investigation. 
The Justice Department and FBI have insisted that career investigators oversaw the investigation, which concluded in July with no charges filed against Clinton. 
But Kadzik worked on other Clinton email issues in his dealings with Congress. 
Last November, he denied a request from Republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation. 
Seems like a pretty important decision for a Clinton crony to make. 
The Justice Department declined to comment on the record for this article. 
Could the Department of Injustice have any less credibility?

9395,Neighbors Add To Hillary Sign With Blunt Message Of Their Own Next Door,"Neighbors Add To Hillary Sign With Blunt Message Of Their Own Next Door Posted on October 30, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics Share This 
When an apartment-dweller decided to use their entire balcony to show their support for the Democratic candidate, their clever neighbors to the right completed it with a blunt message of their own. By incorporating the “Hillary” sign into a sentence, the people in the building next door made the liberal regret hanging their stupid sign. 
Unlike the sea of Donald Trump signs that fill neighborhoods throughout the country, it’s exceptionally rare to see a sign supporting Hillary Clinton for president. Perhaps this person of the top floor of a small apartment building was making up for that by being loud and proud of their criminal candidate, but the people parallel to them won the war of words in a big way. 
John Nolte posted a photo of the opinionated neighbors, noting that he’s not sure where these buildings are, but the message they made was very clear. Rather than ripping the Hillary sign down, setting it on fire, or any other destructive act of vandalism that liberals have done to Trump signs, the clever conservative simply completed what the liberal should have said, adding “Is A Liar” to their windows so passersby read the overall display as “Hillary Is A Liar.” Photo of the war or words between neighbors, Tweeted by John Nolte 
This statement is not only true but also proves the difference in each candidate’s followers when they disagree with something. The Trump supporters didn’t make a big deal about the Hillary-loving idiots, they had a sense of humor about it. 
If it was the other way around, the outcome would have been damaging to the resident’s personal property and possibly even their person, because ignorant liberals get violent when they feel “offended” by something. Conservatives fight with facts, as these people did here by pointing out that Hillary is a liar and why they aren’t voting for her.",0

Scientists have managed to reconstruct the route by which HIV/Aids arrived in the US – exonerating once and for all the man long blamed for the ensuing pandemic in the west. 
Using sophisticated genetic techniques, an international team of researchers have revealed that the virus emerged from a pre-existing epidemic in the Caribbean, arrived in New York by the early 1970s and then spread westwards across the US. 
The research also confirms that Gaétan Dugas, a French-Canadian flight attendant, was not the first person in the US to be infected, despite being dubbed “Patient zero” in a study of gay men with Aids in 1984. Based on that study, author Randy Shilts named Dugas in 1987 and wrote that “there’s no doubt that Gaëtan played a key role in spreading the new virus from one end of the United States to the other.”",0

Here are a few guidelines with some memorable toasts from television and movies as examples of what to avoid. 1. Keep the alcohol at bay. Even Dean Martin sipped apple juice when performing. If there is one common denominator for the world’s worst wedding toasts, it could probably be measured in blood alcohol content. Giving a good toast is tricky enough without trying it with half of your wits about you, so wait until afterward to enjoy your favorite beverage. 2. Don’t wing it. Think about what you are going to say long in advance. Then write it down. “You should start writing a wedding toast months before,” said Peggy Klaus, a speech and presentations coach in Berkeley, Calif. And practice your toast in front of a mirror several times to nail the delivery. “If you don’t prepare, your nerves will take over, and it just won’t work,” Ms. Klaus said. Everyone needs an editor, and if you don’t have one handy, ask a friend or a spouse to play one for a few minutes and show them what you plan to say. 3. Keep it short and simple. No more than three minutes. (Lincoln finished the Gettysburg Address in less time, and that seemed to turn out O. K.) “You basically want to tell one nice story about the couple and wish them well, and that’s all anyone wants to hear,” said Sarah Parker, who wrote a   book on wedding toasts. “But you should find time to identify yourself and your relationship with the newlyweds, and perhaps remark upon the beauty of the ceremony. “ Keeping it short will allow you to spend time polishing those few sentences that you will have to deliver. 4. Don’t rush it. Speak slowly and loudly enough for everyone to hear. Nonprofessional speakers tend to rush through a speech, or talk so softly that many people strain to hear what they are saying  —   if they can hear it at all. Some speakers post a friend at the back of the room to signal whether the speech is being heard there. 5. Tell one story about the bride and groom. An embarrassing anecdote may be funny  —   but this may not be the time to share it. Try to say something the couple would enjoy hearing. It’s their day, not yours. Some toastmasters seem to gravitate toward roasting the couple, rather than praising them. But sarcasm is overrated, and often focuses on shortcomings rather than strengths. Concentrate on what is particularly nice about the bride and groom, and try to celebrate that. 6. If you want to get fancy by staging a skit, singing a song or performing some elaborate dance, be careful. Most of us dance more like “Seinfeld’s” Elaine than the Jackson Five’s Michael. And remember who are the real stars of the show. Ms. Klaus cautions anyone going in this direction, since she thinks it can be a little  : “Remember, the toast is not about you, it’s about the couple. ” And there is a risk of trying to do too much: There was a reason they kept a hook just off the stage during the old vaudeville shows. 7. Have fun. Think of giving a toast as a great opportunity, not a burden. “It’s a gift to the bride and groom,” said Ms. Parker, the author of a book on how to toast at weddings. And if you do it just right, you may start a few tears running down their cheeks.",0
9398,"Keith Lamont Scott Was Killed by Two Gunshot Wounds, Family Autopsy Finds - The New York Times","A    black man whose fatal shooting by the police in September prompted days of   protests in Charlotte, N. C. died from gunshot wounds to the back and the abdomen, according to an autopsy performed at the request of his family. The results, released on Wednesday, show that the man, Keith Lamont Scott, was shot three times: in the back, the abdomen and the wrist. The Mecklenburg County Medical Examiner’s Office has not yet released the results of its own autopsy. “The Scott family authorized this release of information because, as they have maintained from the very beginning, they are simply seeking transparency,” Charles G. Monnett, a lawyer for the family, said in a statement. “We will continue to pursue justice for this family. ” The autopsy was performed on Sept. 30, at the Newberry County Memorial Hospital morgue by Newberry Pathology Associates. Mr. Scott was in a sport utility vehicle in the parking lot of his apartment complex on Sept. 20 when police officers, there to serve a warrant on someone else, confronted him. He was rolling a marijuana cigarette and held a gun up, the police said. His family has disputed that Mr. Scott was armed. Officer Brentley Vinson, who is also black, fatally shot Mr. Scott, whose actions he perceived as threatening, the police have said. In   obscured footage of the shooting, released by the   Police Department, Mr. Scott did not appear threatening, although officers can be heard at one point shouting, “Drop the gun!” His right hand appeared empty, but it was unclear if he was holding anything in the other hand. The shooting immediately drew protests, which lasted for several days. On the second night, one protester was fatally shot.",0

9400,Trump Wine Boycott at Wegmans Backfires - Breitbart,"A boycott of Trump Winery products sold at Wegmans stores in Virginia appeared to backfire after the wine sold out at stores in the area. [The grocer said that nine of its Virginia stores sold out of the wine despite efforts to boycott the product and Wegmans stores that sold it, the Democrat and Chronicle reported.  The Stop Trump Wine group from Charlottesville has asked Virginians to boycott any establishment that does business with Trump Winery, USA Today reported. The Washington Post reported that members of the National Organization for Women pressured Wegmans to stop selling the product just a few days before. A spokesman for the grocer said it sold products from the winery long before Trump bought it and gave it to his son to manage. Regardless of the grocery store’s intentions, Wegmans ended up on the #GrabYourWallet list of companies to boycott until they stopped selling the Trump brand. “I personally will not shop there,” Terry O’Neill, president of the National Organization for Women, said in response to her members’ boycott. But the boycott has made some shoppers want to go out and buy more Trump Wine products. “This makes me want to dig in my heels, stand firm and buy Trump wine,” one shopper told USA Today. As a result of the boycott, all Wegmans stores in Virginia except one sold out of Trump Wine products. Wegmans said that its Charlottesville location was the only one with any bottles of Trump Wine left. The store said there were 160 bottles left of a Meritage and 18 left of a Cru as of midday Friday. Another boycott of   products has also backfired recently. Ivanka Trump’s line of women’s fragrances soared to the number one spot on Amazon’s  ’s list after retailers chose to stop selling products on their websites or at their    locations, Breitbart News reported.",0
9401,Palestinians Elect a New President (on a Reality TV Show) - The New York Times,"JERUSALEM  —   “Mr. President!” a woman called out to Waad Qannam at a rally last week in East Jerusalem. “We want you to represent us!” The crowd cheered passionately, even though Mr. Qannam was actually running for president on a reality television show. In the United States, a reality television star is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. For Palestinians, it’s the other way around: A candidate chosen on a television show is the closest they have come to an elected leader in more than 10 years. “This is just a show,” acknowledged Mr. Qannam, one of three contestants who made it to Thursday night’s finale of “The President. ” “But people are hungry for a leader. ” The show, now in its second season, began with 24 contestants culled from more than 1, 200 applicants who had to take a series of exams on Palestinian politics, international law, development and gender equality. Each week, contestants shadowed a Palestinian minister or business person, then told a panel of judges what they had learned and how they would improve on the job. They also held election rallies while cameras were rolling and had to campaign for votes from the audience, who voted via text message at 80 cents a pop. A mix of votes from judges and the audience determined who made it to the next rounds, though in the finale only audience votes counted. Because there was no cap on how many times viewers could vote, money played a considerable role, and candidates raised funds to secure votes from viewers. On Thursday night, the three finalists all had similar platforms: Boycott Israel. Designate East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine. Bring about a reconciliation for the bitterly divided Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza. (Six of the candidates in the round of 24 were from Gaza, though none made it to the final round.) Mr. Qannam  —   Muslim, male and from East Jerusalem  —   was the leading candidate. Studying to be a lawyer, Mr. Qannam, 24, is the son of refugees, broadening his appeal in the hardscrabble camps across the West Bank. His mother is a deputy minister of Jerusalem affairs in the Palestinian Authority. And he had a nice smile. The only female finalist, Nemah Adawiah, 22, studies international relations at Birzeit University near Ramallah. She drew some resentment because her wealthy family was bankrolling her campaign, and scrutiny about her appearance when the judges deemed some of her colorful outfits inappropriate. The third finalist, Fadi Khair, a    Christian and pediatric nurse, had backers who felt he needed to broaden his appeal to Muslim voters. “You need a priest and a sheikh to sit in the front row,” mused a friend at a campaign meeting before Thursday’s finale. “The President”  —   broadcast on the Maan satellite network to large audiences in Gaza, the West Bank and elsewhere in the Arab world  —   was funded mostly by a State Department grant to Search for Common Ground, a nongovernmental group that focuses on conflict resolution. Suheir Rasul, the group’s   said the point of the show was to groom young Palestinians to be future leaders. Yet the subtext was aimed at the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, who is now 11 years into what was meant to have been a   term and has offered no signs of handing over power. In an odd twist, many judges on the show were Palestinian officials, and the Palestinian Authority allowed its organizers to use their facilities. Advisers to Mr. Abbas did not respond to requests for comment on the show. The show is “a message for the Palestinian leadership,” said Raed Othman, Maan’s general director. “Elections are the solution. Democracy is the solution. ” Before the finale, Mr. Khair, the pediatric nurse, was deeply worried about how to raise enough funds. “We focus on the rich, not the poor, because they barely have enough for their daily bread,” said his mother, Hannah Khair, before the finale. They were focusing on people in his hometown, Beit Sahour, a village in the West Bank, and Christians excited to see one of their own vie for president. Ahead of the penultimate episode, he spent about $7, 800 to secure nearly 10, 000 votes. As he prepared his speech for the final episode, Mr. Khair estimated he needed to secure at least 20, 000 votes to have a chance at winning. “I want to talk about economic resistance,” he said. “A call for foreign investment and Palestinian investment,” he said, but was interrupted by his wife, Mirna, 25, holding their    son, Jihad, as he vomited on the kitchen floor. Mr. Khair continued while helping his wife. “I’ll talk about diplomacy,” he said. Ms. Adawiah’s family took care of nearly everything. Her father, Bahjat Adawiah, 72, organized her election rally on a recent night in Al Ram, a neighborhood near Jerusalem, tucked behind Israel’s separation barrier, where he owns several properties. “I am the daughter of Jerusalem!” she read, practicing her speech. Her father paced and  . “Speak more forcefully!” he told her. “She wants to win, so I have to support her. She’s our little spoiled girl,” he added, grinning. But the show’s producers noted that Ms. Adawiah had worked extremely hard and impressed the judges. Money alone could not have propelled her to the finale, they said. Her father’s business partners, Al Ram’s mayor and other prominent residents piled into a school hall, where her rally underscored women’s participation: There was a female master of ceremonies, and a women’s folkloric dance troupe entertained guests. “We want you to be the president, and why not?” said Ali Maslamani, the mayor. “Our long Islamic history is filled with female leaders!” But Mr. Qannam was clearly the most popular candidate. In an East Jerusalem soccer club on a recent night, he barely got through his platform before residents began endorsing him. Mustafa Shabani, a    who works two jobs to support his family, said he had spent at least $7 on votes for Mr. Qannam. Mr. Othman, the general director of Maan, said the influence of money made the show more realistic. “You can sit in a cafe and have a great idea  —   but so what?” he said. “Show me the money. ” During Thursday’s finale in a Ramallah studio, Mr. Khair stumbled through his speech. Ms. Adawiah laced hers with religion and nationalism. “It is time to change what is inside ourselves, so we can change our sick reality,” she said. In the end, though, it was Mr. Qannam’s night. “You are standing before an important decision!” he told the audience. He promised his first act as “president” would be to visit Gaza and heal a   rift between Palestinians. “I will reconcile our nation!” “Were it not that I loved this homeland, I would not have done this,” he said. “This is a duty, not an honor!” The audience roared. “Waad Qannam! Waad Qannam! Waad Qannam!” the back rows shouted. Mr. Qannam won with nearly 42, 000 votes, compared with roughly 28, 000 for Ms. Adawiah and about 14, 000 for Mr. Khair. His prize? A car, plus the prominence and political connections that come from being on the show. He struggled to speak over the ecstatic audience. “This is not my victory!” he called out. “It is a victory for Palestine!” Nearby, that victory was hard to stomach. Ms. Adawiah’s family alleged that organizers had falsified the tally, arguing they had receipts for 41, 000 votes they had secured for their daughter. “I bought 24, 000 votes!” shouted one of her relatives. “Where are they?”",0
9402,Israeli troops demolish three Palestinian homes in al-Quds,"Palestine Palestinians inspect the damaged house of Zaid Amer, after it was demolished by the Israeli army, in the West Bank city of Nablus, May 3, 2016. (Photo by AP) 
Israeli troops have razed to the ground at least three houses in the East Jerusalem al-Quds, in the latest demolition of Palestinian property in the occupied territories. 
Local media reported that Israeli forces demolished the buildings in the neighborhoods of Beit Hanina and Silwan on Wednesday without prior notice, displacing at least 44 Palestinians including children. 
The United Nations has documented a dramatic rise in demolitions, saying 124 Palestinians, including 60 children, were left homeless in the occupied West Bank in a single day in April. 
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) also said in August that a total of 726 Palestinian structures had been razed in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem al-Quds since January, and that the demolitions had affected 1,020 Palestinians. 
The world body noted that there were 533 demolitions and 688 displaced Palestinians in the entire 2015, meaning that demolitions so far this year have increased more than 36 percent. This picture taken on March 14, 2011 shows a general view of a construction site in the West Bank settlement of Modiin Illit. (Photo by AP) 
The demolitions have raised alarm among diplomats and human rights groups over Tel Aviv's sustained violation of international law. The demolished structures include houses and schools. 
The Israeli razing of Palestinian homes along with its illegal settlement expansion in the occupied Palestinian territories have dimmed hopes of any peace in the region. 
Over half a million Israelis live in more than 230 illegal settlements built since the 1967 Israeli occupation of the West Bank, including East al-Quds. The settlements are considered by the international community as illegal. 
The occupied territories have witnessed increased tensions ever since Israeli forces imposed restrictions on the entry of Palestinian worshipers into the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in East Jerusalem al-Quds in August 2015. 
Nearly 250 Palestinians have lost their lives at the hands of Israeli forces since the beginning of last October. Loading ...",0
9403,3 Remedies From Medieval Europe To Heal The Common Cold,"Chris Black November 9, 2016 3 Remedies From Medieval Europe To Heal The Common Cold 
I think it was Hippocrates who said something along these lines: “let thy food be thy medicine and thy medicine be thy food”. 
Today’s article is about trying to find a cure for the common cold or, more precisely, reviving ancient remedies from medieval Europe. 
And speaking of cures for cold, there’s another saying in my neck of the woods: if you take cold medicine, you’ll get better in seven days, otherwise you’ll be sick for a week. 
Do you see where this is going? 
Let me tell you another interesting little story: despite the fact that there are only a small number of basic ingredients to be found in OTC (over the counter) cold-medicine—around ten, give or take (ephedrine, ibuprofen, paracetamol, aspirin, pseudo-ephedrine etc.)—the number of cold-related drugs in your pharmacy is in the hundreds. 
Each major pharmaceutical company that has a hand in the cold industry typically has at least 10 different types. Many have 20 or 30 or even more. 
That’s pretty confusing, especially when you’re knocked out by a bad case of flu or cold , you can’t think straight, and you just want something to get you out of your misery. You’ll gladly spend a bunch of money to feel better. 
Little do you know you’re wasting it on pure crap. Do you think I am exaggerating? 
Basically, in the cold medicine racket, the name of the game is making money via marketing and brainwashing. Have you noticed the huge number of drug-ads on TV? 70% of the money a television is making outside an election is from Big Pharma, so let that sink in really well. 
I am writing this article because last week I suffered from a bad case of cold, which rendered me pretty much useless until I started making and drinking an old cold/cough remedy that I learned from my grandmother. 
Onion tea 
It worked from day one, put me back on my feet, allowed me to think straight, to breathe and to write; you know what I mean. 
And then I realized that for us preppers, knowing ancient remedies for a disease that is wreaking havoc this time of the year would make for an interesting article. So, if you’re into staying healthy without taking drugs, keep reading. 
Let me tell you how it all began: awake at 4 AM. Can’t think, can’t write, can’t breathe, stuffy nose , sore throat. Does it sound familiar? 
Well, I managed to crawl to my car and hit a local pharmacy. I bought some stuff pompously titled “cold medicine”, got home, medicated myself, hit the bed, and woke up 3 hours later still feeling horrible. 
Then, it hit me: my grandmother used to make onion tea when I was little and I had a bad case of cold. I remember it smelled awful and tasted like rotten pig guts, but if I was a good boy and drank a lot of it, it worked. 
With these things in mind, I went to the kitchen, gathered 3 onions, washed’em up pretty good, and put them in the kettle to boil. 
The idea is to take 2-3 small onions and boil them slowly in a full kettle until the water is reduced by half via evaporation, then drink the tea as hot as you can stand it . 
Trust me folks, it really works: sore throat-gone, stuffy nose-gone, I was alive again. It does taste hideous, unless you’re a die-hard onion lover, but it’s a small cost to pay. 
Basically, with this magic potion you’ll be able to function, to be active: to be alive, so to speak, from day 1. 
You must drink two 3/4 cups of tea per day, essentially one in the morning and one before bed, that’s important. 
If you manage to squeeze 3 more in during the day, it will work like a Swiss watch. 
If all you have in the house are big-fat onions, you’ll just have to cut them in half before boiling it, but remember: don’t remove the peel. That’s essential; just wash the onion thoroughly. 
How does onion tea work? I really don’t know. There aren’t any “official” studies that I know of, probably because you can’t patent onions and sell them for 5 bucks a pop. It just does, provided you drink it hot as hell and you follow the recipe above. 
Vitamin C 
Besides onion tea, supplementing with vitamin C and D3 is also very important when it comes to mitigating colds and flu (these vitamins play an essential role in immunity overall), but it’s important to take big doses. The RDA is a joke. 
For example, I am talking about 2-3 grams of vitamin C per day, together with eating lots of fruit: oranges, grapefruits, lemons, kiwis, apples and, again very important, raw onions and garlic (natural antibiotics). 
The RDA is the minimal amount of Vitamin C (or whatever) to be taken daily in order to avoid getting scurvy (speaking of vitamin C). To be healthy, it takes for much more than that; remember that. 
Tomato Tea 
Another way of naturally treating a stuffy nose/nasal congestion is tomato tea. 
The recipe is: 1 cup of tomato juice , (but I’d use 2-3 tomatoes cut in half instead of tomato juice) a teaspoon of fresh garlic (basically a clove) half a teaspoon of chili sauce (I’d use a small red hot chilli pepper instead) one teaspoon of lemon juice (again, I’d use a whole fruit instead). 
Add a pinch of salt into the mix and heat them together in the kettle until they start boiling, then drink the tea as hot as you can take it. 
During the day, you can drink a mix of green tea and ginger tea with honey, as these ingredients boost the immune system and they break up phlegm naturally (the drugs are called expectorants). 
Streptococcal pharyngitis or strep throat is a common occurrence when it comes to seasonal colds and flu, and besides my aforementioned magic onion tea recipe, you should try 2 additional tricks if you want to get better ASAP: first, gargle with apple cider vinegar after you dilute it in a glass of warm water (1-3 teaspoons of vinegar in 8 oz of water). 
Second, gargle with salt-water and if you’re hardcore, you can try rubbing your infected tonsils with salt (using your finger that is). It’s not a pleasant experience, but it works amazingly well. You can boost the recipe’s effectiveness by adding powdered cayenne pepper into the mix. 
Add one teaspoon of cayenne pepper plus one teaspoon of salt in an 8 oz. glass, and mix well together, obviously. Gargle vigorously with this formula until you get better. It will definitely break up the bacteria coating in your throat so expect to spit profusely for a couple of minutes afterwards. 
It’s very important to use high-quality, organic salt; not refined/processed stuff. I would recommend Himalayan salt (the pink variety), or salt-mine salt (the one that looks dirty). Processed, refined, snow white salt doesn’t work too great as it’s stripped of its essential trace elements. 
I hope the article helped and I can’t wait to see your comments in the dedicated sections below, AFTER trying my onion tea, obviously. 
Stay healthy folks and click the banner below to discover more ancient secrets that helped our ancestors survive harsh times.

9404,Report: Former Trump National Security Advisor Mike Flynn Offers to Testify for Immunity,"President Donald Trump’s former national security advisor, Ret. Gen. Mike Flynn, has reportedly offered his testimony in the investigation into Russian ties to the president in exchange for immunity, a report says. [Flynn has reportedly asked for immunity should his testimony lead to any finding of wrong doing, according to a Thursday report by the Wall Street Journal.  The Journal claims that Flynn, a retired army general, and Trump campaign adviser, made his offer to the FBI and the House and Senate intelligence committees through his lawyer. Officials have not yet accepted the deal, the paper says. Details of what Flynn might be willing to say to investigators have not been made public. Flynn was appointed as then   Trump’s national security advisor in November of last year but resigned by February after revelations emerged that he had opened communications with Russian officials, communications about which he neglected to fully brief the vice president. In his resignation letter, Flynn apologized for neglecting to fully inform VP Pence about the discussions he had with the Russian ambassador saying the omission was due to the “fast pace of events. ” At the time of the resignation, Trump Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the administration let Flynn go not due to any legal issues but due to “a trust issue. ” Spicer said that the “level of trust between the President and General Flynn had eroded to the point where he felt he had to make a change. ” Flynn is facing pressure from several inquiries into his dealings with Russian officials which include thousands he was paid by a trio of Russian companies for speeches made before he joined Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, as well as his communications with the Russian ambassador. Flynn’s offer to testify comes as Democrats continue to press for investigations into ties Trump may have had with Russia. To date there has been no direct ties proven between Trump or his campaign for president and Russia.

9405,An Unlikely Contender Rises in France as the Antithesis of Trump - The New York Times,"PARIS  —   In the age of Donald J. Trump, “Brexit” and the resurgent French far right, a thin, aging career politician with an ironic smile is being called  —   by him and his supporters  —   France’s best defense against raging global populism. A first test for Alain Juppé, 71, comes Sunday as France’s mainstream   Republican party holds a primary ahead of next spring’s presidential election. Mr. Juppé is favored to come out on top, for now. His ascendance is all the more improbable because, in a previous post, he was considered one of France’s most unpopular prime ministers ever. And he was once convicted in a Paris City Hall corruption scheme. But the election of Mr. Trump has upended French politics and given new momentum to the   leader Marine Le Pen. As a result, mainstream conservatives are far from delighted. The candidacy of the   Mr. Juppé is seen by his supporters as a bulwark at a time when the postelection United States is now routinely depicted as one leg of a global tripartite menace, along with China and Russia, bearing down on fragile Western democracies. Mr. Juppé doesn’t shout, wave his arms or make grandiose promises  —   seen as a plus by his supporters. His professorial bearing stands in contrast to his sometimes bombastic and offending party rival, Nicolas Sarkozy, the former president who has redefined himself as a tough guy for uncertain times. But while other contenders for the presidency are adopting Mr. Trump’s depiction of Muslims as an inherent threat, Mr. Juppé’s soothing message of French unity has, so far, helped him to lead opinion polls. Still, Mr. Juppé’s tenure as prime minister during the 1990s was one of the most divisive in modern French history, marked by proposed cutbacks to generous   pensions that brought thousands into the streets in protest. Mr. Juppé’s plan ultimately failed. This time around, he has promised more   reforms and has vowed not to back down in the face of inevitable protests. In that regard, the technocratic Mr. Juppé, of all the contenders, may present the biggest challenge to France’s social protections and labor rules. The governing Socialists, saddled with a poor economic record and an unpopular incumbent president, François Hollande, are already being written off. The race is considered the right’s to lose. Just behind Mr. Sarkozy in the polls, nipping at his heels, is another former prime minister, François Fillon. The winner of Sunday’s Republican primary  —   there will be a runoff on Nov. 27  —   is considered likely to face Ms. Le Pen in April’s presidential election. If previous patterns hold, Ms. Le Pen will be defeated, which would make Mr. Juppé the likeliest of all those now running to become the next French president. The announcement on Wednesday by Emmanuel Macron, a popular former economy minister in the Socialist government, that he, too, will enter the presidential race is unlikely to change the right and   dynamic, in the eyes of many observers. At 38, Mr. Macron has the image of a youthful reformer, but analysts have noted his thin record, lack of a party base, and absence of heft  —   he has never held elected office  —   in a universe of surging populism. Mr. Juppé, on the other hand, has won and lost numerous elections and has served for many years as the mayor of Bordeaux, where he has been credited with transforming the city. But, with   high unemployment, an injection of energy from Mr. Trump’s victory into Ms. Le Pen’s campaign  —   xenophobic nationalism is her core theme  —   and the same social and economic fractures as in the United States, there are no guarantees. The warning signs from across the Atlantic were evident in a campaign swing through Lower Burgundy on Wednesday, as Mr. Juppé met with disgruntled farmers and rural officials. The French news media has noted that the American election results have colored the former prime minister’s message with concern about the existence of two Frances: one benefiting from globalization, and the other left behind. There are the large, vibrant cities  —   Paris, Lyon, Mr. Juppé’s Bordeaux  —   and then there are the shuttered main streets of sleepy provincial capitals and rural towns like those he visited on Wednesday. Wearing the coat and tie he appears never to shed, Mr. Juppé got his shoes muddy at a grain and dairy farm whose owner complained of crushing debt. “People have talked about suffering,” Mr. Juppé told a roomful in the tiny village of St.  ’Ordon, “and it is true,” he said, speaking in a knowing, weary tone, careful never to exaggerate. With his eyebrows slightly arched, he listened patiently to the complaints. Rural France feels “abandoned” and “disdained” by Paris, Mr. Juppé said. “But we can’t accept this gulf between the big cities and rural France. ” Promising a “strong state,” he had a warning for his audience deep in the Burgundian countryside at St.   : “The world is becoming more and more dangerous. Nationalism is on the rise. ” Similarly, at a rally this week in northern Paris, the perceived menace of rising populism was a common theme in the speeches and comments of Mr. Juppé’s supporters. From Mr. Juppé himself and the other   speakers who preceded him, Mr. Trump’s name came up often. Each time, it was met with loud boos from the crowd of around 6, 000. Mr. Juppé  —   “a man of culture,” one speaker called him  —   was depicted as the antithesis of Mr. Trump. “After the election of Donald Trump, after Brexit, will populism triumph in our country? No!” shouted Patrick Devedjian, a former minister, who introduced Mr. Juppé at the rally. The crowd  —   mostly   or older,   and carefully dressed, like Mr. Juppé  —   roared approval. “We’ve had it up to here with populist baseness!” Mr. Devedjian said. Another supporter,   Lagarde, a prominent centrist politician, told the crowd, “France doesn’t need a   in the Élysée!”  —   referring to the presidential palace in Paris. Valérie Pécresse, president of the Paris region’s council, was equally scathing. “Populism is about not telling the truth,” she said. “Alain,” she added, turning to Mr. Juppé, seated in the front row, “you are the antidote to populism. ” Mr. Juppé, who spoke in pithy bullet points, promised to stand up to enemies and rivals  —   both internal and external. In a brisk speech that reflected his classical education at France’s top schools, he brought up Mr. Trump in the context of threats to France. “I don’t know what Donald Trump’s foreign policy will be,” he told the crowd. “He has said contradictory things. What I know is, there will be an aggressive commercial policy.

9406,Sonny Perdue Is Trump’s Choice for Agriculture Secretary - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —     Donald J. Trump on Wednesday selected Sonny Perdue, the former governor of Georgia, to be his secretary of agriculture, two senior transition officials said, making his final cabinet selection two days before he is to be sworn in as president. Mr. Perdue, a onetime veterinarian who was elected in 2003 as Georgia’s first Republican governor since Reconstruction, campaigned heavily for Mr. Trump in the final months of the presidential race, although he had initially backed a rival, former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas. His selection ensures that Mr. Trump will enter office with a full complement of chosen cabinet officials, although none have been confirmed. Senators are wrangling over how many nominees can be confirmed by the time Mr. Trump is sworn in on Friday, with Republicans insisting on a series of quick votes and Democrats objecting that they have not had adequate time to vet the candidates, many of whom submitted ethics disclosures late. The two officials confirmed the decision on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment on it before the formal announcement. Mr. Perdue has spoken with Mr. Trump in detail about his views on agriculture and trade, including ways to ensure American producers are not placed at a disadvantage in international agreements. In an interview in December, Mr. Perdue said Mr. Trump had quizzed him on what he would do about unfair trade deals. He said the   “believes that we in the U. S. have been sort of patsies over the years in the way we’ve dealt with our foreign competitors and international trade. ” Mr. Perdue, who once ran a grain and fertilizer business, was among the first candidates Mr. Trump interviewed for the post. But the process dragged on for weeks as the  ’s team debated whether it would be better off choosing someone from a different part of the country or selecting an ethnic minority to balance out an overwhelmingly white, male and wealthy cabinet. Mr. Perdue, though, pitched himself as an asset with the business and governmental experience to be successful in the post. He spent much of his career in the agriculture business before being elected governor, he told Mr. Trump, and returned to the field in 2011 after leaving office. “Most people focus on the governor term of eight years, but for me, that was an interruption,” Mr. Perdue said in December. Mr. Trump, he said, “wants people who are experts in the field. ” As governor, amid a   drought in Georgia in 2007, Mr. Perdue led several hundred people at the State Capitol in a prayer for rain, asking God to forgive Georgia for being wasteful with its water. He also called for strict water usage restrictions. Eric Tanenblatt, Mr. Perdue’s former chief of staff, called him highly qualified for the post in a statement on Wednesday night. “As a successful governor, Perdue has the requisite experience to direct a massive bureaucracy of the sort necessary to conduct the department’s many programs,” Mr. Tanenblatt said. He praised Mr. Perdue’s ability to shape agricultural policy and business. Mr. Perdue, he said, “knows the challenges facing today’s farmers. ” Environmental activists condemned Mr. Trump’s choice, saying that Mr. Perdue had received hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal farm subsidies that help chemical companies and large agriculture conglomerates at the expense of small farmers and the environment. “It’s certainly hard to imagine that a former fertilizer salesman will tackle the unregulated farm pollution that poisons our drinking water, turns Lake Erie green, and fouls the Chesapeake Bay and the Gulf of Mexico,” said Scott Faber, senior vice president of government affairs at EWG, an environmental research group. If confirmed, Mr. Perdue would oversee an agency with a $150 billion budget. The Agriculture Department is in charge of farm policy and food safety, and it funds food stamps, other nutrition programs and the Forest Service. A conservative Republican, Mr. Perdue has ties to at least one senator who will vote on his confirmation. Senator David Perdue, Republican of Georgia, is his cousin.",0

9408,Toxic chemicals found in children’s Halloween makeup – study,"Toxic chemicals found in children’s Halloween makeup – study Toxic chemicals found in children’s Halloween makeup – study By 0 73 
Halloween is supposed to make your skin crawl, but not like this. A new study finds the scariest part of the holiday may not be the costumes, but makeup for kids. Out of 48 makeup palettes, almost half contained toxic heavy metals. 
Nearly 20 percent of makeup palettes contain lead and cadmium, according to the newly published study by the Breast Cancer Fund. The study found that some products contained as many as four metals, including arsenic and chromium. 
Nine of the palettes were found to contain lead, a chemical that is unsafe at any level, for children particularly. Parents may have purchased and applied these products to their children unwittingly, as the makeup doesn’t have to list ingredients on their labels. 
The BCF may have been among the first to test the palettes, as the FDA does not regulate this particular product. 
“ The FDA that regulates makeup does not have the power to require pre-market testing ,” Jen Coleman with the Oregon Environmental Council told KGW. 
The cosmetic safety law enacted 75 years ago does not require testing even for products marketed to children. While the FDA cannot do anything about the problem, they have issued guidelines to avoiding “ a rash, swollen eyelids, or other reaction ” this Halloween. 
The guidelines make no mention of potential heavy metal poisoning, but they do offer advice like “ Follow all directions carefully ,” and “ Don’t decorate your face with things that aren’t intended for your skin. ” 
What’s a parent to do in the meantime? Other than use all-natural makeup, the best option is to avoid dark pigments. The BCF study found a correlation between the darkness of the color and the lead content. The darker the color, the more lead it was found to contain.

9410,Lawsuit Clouds Texas Transgender Student Wrestler’s Championship,"A north Texas transgender high school wrestler, transitioning from female to male, won a girls’ regional championship when the female opponent forfeited the match over the weekend. [Euless Trinity High School junior Mack Beggs, 17, triumphed in the girls’   Class 6A Region 2 championship against Coppell high schooler Madeline Rocha, who declined to participate in the wrestling match on Saturday.  The forfeit was expected. The Dallas Morning News reported Coppell attorney Jim Baudhuin filed a lawsuit earlier in February against the University Interscholastic League (UIL) the governing body over Texas high school athletics, music, and academic events. He urged the league to suspend Beggs over steroid use, which is prohibited by UIL rules and the Texas Education Code. Beggs takes testosterone while transitioning from female to male. Baudhuin’s complaint asserted that allowing Beggs to wrestle competitively while using testosterone exposed the other athletes to the “imminent threat of bodily harm. ” Baudhuin is also a wrestling parent, but his daughter does not compete in the same weight class as Beggs. He contended the lawsuit had nothing to do with Beggs being a transgender male but over Coppell coaches concerned that wrestling Beggs would be unsafe for their wrestler. The transgender student’s grandmother and guardian, Nancy Beggs, called the forfeited match “about bias, hatred, and ignorance,” according to the Dallas paper. Chapter 38 of the Texas Education Code forbids steroid and human growth hormone usage in athletics for enhancement purposes, considering it a criminal offense punishable by prison time however, it does permit the use of anabolic steroids for “medical use only” when a doctor prescribes treatment for the individual. Similarly, the UIL allows a “licensed practitioner with prescriptive authority” to administer a steroid for a person. Even though Beggs identifies as male, the wrestler must compete against girls because of a UIL rule that requires   to compete by the gender listed on their birth certificates. In early 2016, Texas public school district superintendents voted   in favor of an amendment requiring state officials to use a  ’s birth certificate to determine gender identification, Breitbart Texas reported. That rule went into effect on August 1, although former Texas Education Commissioner Michael Williams previously approved the amendment as part of an 11 rule packet in November 2015. It codified what the league already advised superintendents do in handling such situations  —   use birth certificates when gender questions arise. The UIL   Wrestling Manual prohibits boys and girls from grappling with each other in Texas. Coupled with the birth certificate rule, it disqualified Beggs from sparring against boys. Nancy Beggs, told the Morning News that her grandchild wants to compete against boys but is willing to follow UIL rules. She said they sent the teen’s medical records to the league before the   and current wrestling seasons. The UIL approved the Euless   to compete. While Beggs and Rocha did not wrestle Saturday, both advanced to the state championships. The night before, Beggs competed against Grand Prairie high school female wrestler Kailyn Clay in a semifinal match, which Beggs won by a pin. Wrestling Texas lists Beggs as undefeated ( ) this year. The UIL maintains a “ ” policy that allows equal opportunity no matter disability, race, color, gender, religion, or national origin, as reported by Breitbart Texas. There are some exceptions to that general policy. The University of Texas at Austin created the UIL in 1910 to assist public school athletic and debate teachers. The league evolved into the largest   organization of its kind in the world. Follow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on Twitter.",0

9412,Hillary admits creation of Mujahedin plague,"Share This: PATRICE GREANVILLE T he problem is that, while helpful to have the empire’s managers show their true sociopathic face, her narrative is a distorted simplification bearing all the vices of her political prejudices and ignorance, the script favored by the US ruling class. 
Consider just one of her major lies, tossed about casually and sure to be swallowed whole by the perennially clueless audience: That The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan… The USSR did not invade Afghanistan . The besieged, progressive and modernising Kabul government—a leftwing government that promptly moved to advance literacy, gave women full and unrestricted civil rights, and in general was trying to bring the nation out of the middle ages (program which Washington could care less), invited the Soviets to come in, as it was meeting stiff resistance to its reforms by the entrenched landlords and reactionary clerics in the countryside. Moscow accepted the invitation because it also suited its valid objective of not allowing the Americans to plant another huge military base on the Central Asia underbelly, part of the encirclement of Russia the US has been carrying out for many decades. The invitation is similar and as genuine as the invitation by the Government of Syria, today, to come in and fight against the Western-sponsored terrorists, an authority to set foot on Syrian soil which the Americans and their multiple sordid accomplices in mayhem in the Middle East, totally lack. Contrast this with Washington’s actions in Vietnam, where it first refused to recognize the right of the newly independent Vietnamese to a free election (since they knew the communists led by Ho Chi Minh would win by a huge margin), and then simply invaded that nation under trumped up pretexts (Gulf of Tonkin, etc.).The closer you inspect the US government narrative, the clearer it becomes it is a tissue of cynical big lies, word-twistings, professional pr.r. spin, and self-serving myths and simplifications—all in the service of sordid and criminal goals the elites can never admit to the American public.

9414,John Podesta: ‘Alt-Right’ Media Like Sean Hannity Colluding with Russia - Breitbart,"Hillary Clinton’s former campaign chief John Podesta attacked the First Amendment rights of the free press as he continued to spin his conspiracy theory of Russia colluding with American news websites to damage Democrats. [During a conversation with the Washington Post’s Karen Tumulty, he cited the “participation and the support of the   media,” naming “guys like Sean Hannity” and “disgusting” Newt Gingrich for helping spread “fake news” to hurt Democrats. He specifically criticized Hannity and Gingrich for asking questions about DNC staffer Seth Rich’s murder and whether or not it had a connection with Wikileaks.  Podesta explained that it was one more example of how the Russians were “very active in propagating and distributing fake news, working with these   sites in conjunction with them. ” He also cited an “echo system” created by the Russians that raised the social media profile of articles that were damaging to Democrats. He pointed out that “legitimate sites” like the Washington Post and the New York Times suffered, as other “ ” websites got more traction during the election. Podesta blamed websites in the United States for publishing emails from Emmanuel Macron during the French presidential election to influence the outcome. “The first reports of them came from U. S.   sites back into France,” he said. “This is a global phenomena. ” He praised the French media for helping censor the information to stop it from damaging Macron’s campaign. “I think unfortunately for us, but maybe fortunately for the world, I think the French press was more sensitive to it,” he said, praising them for helping Macron “win by a landslide” after censoring their reporting on the hacked emails. He suggested that the American media should have done the same things with his leaked emails. “I didn’t feel like that really happened last fall   …     the mainstream U. S. press was much more interested in the gossip,” he said. Podesta warned the media about Russia’s efforts to use the emails to hurt Democrats, pointedly directing them to be more responsible. He suggested that the media should have helped the Clinton campaign fuel the Russian angle, instead of reporting on his emails. “I think if you contextualize it  —   if you say that ‘The Russians are coming,’ and ‘The Russians are here’  —   that can give people a sense of that they need to be more careful in the way they assess what they’re hearing and what they’re seeing and what’s being peddled,” he said. He described the period of leaks as “the Soviet days” and griped that the “low burn” of email stories helped revive questions about Clinton’s own private emails. “We hadn’t put it to bed completely,” he admitted.",0
9415,From Fins Into Hands: Scientists Discover a Deep Evolutionary Link - The New York Times,"To help his readers fathom evolution, Charles Darwin asked them to consider their own hands. “What can be more curious,” he asked, “than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and should include similar bones, in the same relative positions?” Darwin had a straightforward explanation: People, moles, horses, porpoises and bats all shared a common ancestor that grew limbs with digits. Its descendants evolved different kinds of limbs adapted for different tasks. But they never lost the anatomical similarities that revealed their kinship. As a Victorian naturalist, Darwin was limited in the similarities he could find. The most sophisticated equipment he could use for the task was a crude microscope. Today, scientists are carrying on his work with new biological tools. They are uncovering deep similarities that have been overlooked until now. On Wednesday, a team of researchers at the University of Chicago reported that our hands share a deep evolutionary connection not only to bat wings or horse hooves, but also to fish fins. The unexpected discovery will help researchers understand how our own ancestors left the water, transforming fins into limbs that they could use to move around on land. To the naked eye, there is not much similarity between a human hand and the fin of, say, a goldfish. A human hand is at the end of an arm. It has bones that develop from cartilage and contain blood vessels. This type of tissue is called endochondral bone. A goldfish grows just a tiny cluster of endochondral bones at the base of its fin. The rest of the fin is taken up by thin rays, which are made of an entirely different tissue called dermal bone. Dermal bone does not start out as cartilage and does not contain blood vessels. These differences have long puzzled scientists. The fossil record shows that we share a common aquatic ancestor with   fish that lived some 430 million years ago.   creatures with spines  —   known as tetrapods  —   had evolved by 360 million years ago and went on to colonize dry land. For over two decades, Neil H. Shubin, an evolutionary biologist, has investigated this transition in two radically different ways. On the one hand, he has dug up fossils that date back to the transition from sea to land. His discoveries include a 370    fish called Tiktaalik, which had   fins. It developed endochondral bones corresponding to those in our arms, beginning at the shoulder with the humerus, then the radius, ulna and wrist bones. But it lacked fingers, and still had a short fringe of fin rays. When he is not digging for fossils, Dr. Shubin runs a lab at the University of Chicago, where he and his colleagues compare how tetrapods  —   mice, for example  —   and fish develop as embryos. Their embryos start out looking very similar, consisting of heads and tails and not much in between. Two pairs of buds then develop on their flanks. In fish, the buds grow into fins. In tetrapods, they become limbs. In recent decades, researchers have uncovered some of the genes that govern this development. In 1996, a team of French researchers studying mice discovered genes that are essential for the development of their legs. When the scientists shut down two genes, called   and   the mice developed normal long bones in their legs. But their wrist and ankle bones failed to appear, and they did not grow any digits. This discovery suggested that   and   genes tell certain cells in the tetrapod limb bud that they will develop into hands and feet. Dr. Shubin knew that fish have genes related to   and  . He wondered what those genes were doing, if anything, in developing fins. An experiment on fish might give him and his colleagues a clue. “But we didn’t have the means to do it until technology caught up with our aspirations,” Dr. Shubin said. In the 1990s, no one yet knew how to shut down genes in fish embryos. But that has changed in recent years, thanks to a new   technology called Crispr. Scientists can use it to readily alter genes in virtually any species. In 2013, a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Shubin’s lab, Tetsuya Nakamura, started using Crispr to manipulate fish embryos. He chose zebrafish to study, because their transparent embryos make it easy to track their development. Dr. Nakamura inserted bits of DNA into the fish versions of the   and   genes. The inserted DNA garbled the sequence of the genes, so that the fish could not make proteins from them. Zebrafish with defective copies of both Hox genes grew deformed fins, the scientists found. But to their surprise, the fish failed to make fin rays. In the fish, their experiment showed, the Hox genes were controlling cells that became dermal bone rather than the endochondral bone found in our own limbs. Dr. Shubin got a similar surprise when he saw the results of a parallel experiment run by Andrew R. Gehrke, a graduate student. Mr. Gehrke engineered zebrafish so that he could follow individual cells during the development of embryos. In Mr. Gehrke’s altered fish, cells that switched on the Hox genes started to glow. They kept glowing throughout development, until they reached their final location in the fish’s body. Mr. Gehrke observed that a cluster of cells started making the Hox proteins early in the development of fish fins. When the fins were fully developed, Mr. Gehrke found that the fin rays were glowing. In a similar experiment on mice, the digits and wrist bones lit up. “Here we’re finding that the digits and the fin rays have some sort of equivalence at the level of the cells that make them,” Dr. Shubin said. “Honestly, you could have knocked me over with a feather  —   it ran counter to everything that I was expecting after working on this problem for decades. ” The new study was important because it revealed that the development of fins and limbs follows some of the same rules, said Matthew P. Harris, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School. In both cases, the Hox genes tell a clump of embryonic cells that they need to end up at the far end of an appendage. “The molecular address is the same,” said Dr. Harris, who was not involved in the study. In zebrafish, the cells that get that molecular address end up making dermal bone for fin rays. In tetrapods like us, the research indicates, the same cells produce endochondral bone in our hands and feet. The new discovery could help make sense of the intermediate fish with   fins that Dr. Shubin and his colleagues have unearthed. These animals still used the molecular addresses their ancestors used. But when their cells reached their addresses, some of them became endochondral bone instead of fin rays. It may have been a simple matter to shift from one kind of tissue to another. “This is a dial that can be tuned,” Dr. Shubin said.",0
9416,Conservative Split Over Import Tax Imperils Trump’s Overhaul - The New York Times,"One conservative group produced colorful flow charts warning millennials that a “border adjustment” tax proposed by Speaker Paul D. Ryan would raise prices on “the Jose Cuervo tequila that’s in your happy hour margarita. ” Three days later, a second conservative group kicked off a lobbying campaign saying it would amount to a $1. 2 trillion tax on seniors and the working poor. The next day, still another group weighed in, issuing a news release that highlighted how Latinos would be “among those hardest hit” by the new tax on imports. All three organizations share a common lineage: They are part of the political network overseen by Charles D. and David H. Koch, the billionaire conservative businessmen. Now they are among a host of conservative organizations mounting a furious campaign against a new tax on imports proposed by House Republicans, imperiling what is supposed to be a centerpiece of the Republican tax overhaul effort. Their opposition threatens yet another rupture with President Trump, some of whose advisers see the provision as a critical way to bring about tax reform while protecting American manufacturers. The battle could not only jeopardize Mr. Trump’s second major legislative initiative, but also redefine the boundaries of conservative economic policy. Much like the failed repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the import tax is dividing conservatives, the business sector and some of the   groups funding conservative politics. Along the way, it is exposing the broader ideological divide between nationalist policies embraced by Mr. Trump and the traditional   movement that his election ejected from the driver’s seat of Republican  . “Trump ran on a different set of economic issues than traditional conservative Republicans have,” said Stephen Moore, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation who favors the border tax on intellectual grounds, but said he had come to see it as a “poison pill” for broader tax reform. “The baton has been passed on from Reagan to Trump,” Mr. Moore continued, “and there’s no doubt he ran on a much more populist economic message. ” The idea of a border adjustment tax has percolated among academic economists and in think tanks since the 1970s, as the United States has considered ways of harmonizing its tax code with countries that use   taxes. Central to the plan is a provision that would tax imports at a rate of 20 percent while exempting exports from taxation. In theory, this would buttress domestic manufacturing, make American products more competitive with foreign goods and encourage American companies to bring home cash they have been parking overseas. “It is a simple and elegant way to get good tax compliance,” said Douglas   a Republican economist and president of the   American Action Forum, a nonprofit tied to a “super PAC” that backs House Republicans. Some conservatives oppose it for the same reason: In their view, such a tax would be too easy to increase, with the potential costs to Americans hidden behind rising prices. Groups like Americans for Tax Reform  —   headed by Grover Norquist, perhaps Washington’s most famous   crusader  —   have praised the border tax proposal, saying it would put American businesses “on a level playing field” with foreign competitors. Retailers that import many of their goods are lobbying against the idea, while domestic manufacturers like Boeing and Caterpillar  —   whose interests figure heavily in Mr. Trump’s economic thinking  —   are supporting it. The Koch network and groups like the Club for Growth, which for years have targeted what they call “crony capitalism” in Washington, have opposed the border tax as an unnecessary tax increase and a form of favoritism that would hurt the economy. But Mr. Trump and his team have pledged to target what they see as a more insidious kind of cronyism, including unfettered free trade that some Trump advisers say benefits wealthy elites at the expense of American workers. The dispute echoes Mr. Trump’s battles with his party last year, when the Club for Growth, a group of wealthy conservatives that backs   candidates in Republican primary races, financed a   advertising campaign against him. The Koch network, uncomfortable with Mr. Trump’s proposals on trade and immigration, sat out the presidential election entirely, turning its advertising dollars and activists to   races. Both the Club for Growth and the Koch network also played a critical role in killing a proposal backed by Mr. Ryan and Mr. Trump to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. In March, as the repeal vote approached, two   groups pledged to spend upward of $1 million on ads defending any Republican who voted against the replacement legislation. Now, some of the same groups are organizing visits to lawmakers and paying for an online advertising campaign attacking the border tax proposal. The roster includes Americans for Prosperity, the Koch network’s flagship political advocacy group the Libre Initiative, which is aimed at Latinos and Generation Opportunity, which focuses on young adults. In 2015, the most recent year for which tax returns are available, the three groups took in a combined $34 million from Freedom Partners, an umbrella group representing the Kochs and other donors who pool money for political and educational initiatives. Policy experts at think tanks financed by the Koch network have also weighed in against the border tax idea. Veronique de Rugy, a senior fellow at the Mercatus Center, where Charles Koch sits on the board, has clashed with Mr.   and other   policy experts, accusing them of misleading the public about the true effects of the border tax on economic growth. Americans for Prosperity is calling on Mr. Trump to rely more on spending cuts, rather than on a border adjustment tax, to finance the tax overhaul. The group’s list of proposals include indexing Social Security benefits to a different measure of inflation  —   a popular idea in conventional conservative circles but one that could violate Mr. Trump’s campaign pledge to protect the program’s beneficiaries. “When you look at the network broadly, we’re all guided by the same vision,” said James Davis, a spokesman for Freedom Partners. “We’re all going to be active on the major policy decisions that are happening in Washington. ” That campaign has aligned with a vigorous lobbying campaign by Koch Industries, one of the largest private companies in the United States, prompting complaints from some proponents of the tax that the family is chiefly interested in protecting its business. Last fall, after the House plan for a border tax was first unveiled, lobbyists from Koch Industries circulated a study by PricewaterhouseCoopers showing it would lead to huge new taxes on the petroleum and coal products industry, which includes some of Koch Industries’ most profitable subsidiaries. More recently, Koch has circulated studies indicating that the tax would increase the price of gasoline, which the company says would lift its profits in the short term but harm the economy in the long term. Philip Ellender, a top executive at the company, said in an interview that Koch Industries was lobbying against the new tax out of principle, not for profit. “In the short term, Koch would profit handsomely from it,” Mr. Ellender said. His summary of the company’s case against the tax: “It would stifle free trade, it picks winners and losers, and it raises prices on consumers so that corporations can get a tax break. ” The debate has divided the White House, too. In an interview with Reuters in late February, Mr. Trump embraced the notion of a border tax. “I certainly support a form of tax on the border,” he said, arguing that it would encourage companies to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, a critical component of his platform. Mr. Trump’s Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and his top economic adviser, Gary Cohn  —   both former Goldman Sachs bankers  —   are said to be leery of the border tax. Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, the former Breitbart publisher Stephen K. Bannon, has supported it, as has Peter Navarro, a trade skeptic and top White House trade adviser. A profusion of strategic and political motives also divides Republicans on the issue. To enact a tax overhaul that does not increase the federal deficit but delivers rate cuts to wealthy taxpayers and corporations, Mr. Trump and Congress need to find some source of new revenue  —   hence the border tax. For Mr. Ryan, who holds more conventional   views than Mr. Trump, the new tax provides a way to satisfy Mr. Trump’s protectionist impulses without imposing punitive, and potentially even more disruptive, tariffs. But some conservatives are not so sure. In opposing the tax, Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican from Walmart’s home state, Arkansas, finds himself in the position of defending his local corporate giant and the conservatism that he thought he knew. “Most conservatives I know have long believed that tax reform would look at all of the   in the tax code,” Mr. Cotton said, “not introduce a whole new concept of taxation. ”",0

This fancy $10 card (a 30% savings, mind you) comes   with a   pass for unlimited Metrobus and Metrorail rides. What’s even better is you can keep the card: it’s valid both before and after Jan. 20. Add money to it by going online at wmata. com.  Note: A few metro stations will be closed within the security perimeter. For all the metro specifics, click here. For those who choose to use a ride sharing app like Uber or Lyft, be warned: there will be a geofence in place around the security perimeter. According to USA Today, “the security perimeter will go into effect 48 hours before the ceremony and last until Sunday morning in some areas. ” But never fear, “Uber has worked with officials for months to prepare for Inauguration Day, the company said. Its engineers altered its navigation systems to account for road closures and blackout zones and changed dispatch algorithms, so vehicles won’t be matched with riders on the other side of a barrier. ” Bottom line: Leave early and pack patience. Accommodations: If you don’t already have a place to stay, good luck. List of Prohibited Items: Ammunition, explosives, weapons  —   you know, the usuals. But careful,   and balloons also make the long list of “ ’s”. Click here for a complete list of prohibited items. Weather: Latest weather forecast models indicate that Trump’s big day may be warmer than normal, with current predictions of temperatures in the 50s and 60s. One would be wise though to come prepared for a chilly few days. Wear layers and don’t forget comfortable shoes: all public events take place outside. Oh, and don’t forget an umbrella, there’s a chance of rain! Security Measures  —   for the curious: Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has said officials expect from 700, 000 to 900, 000 attendees this week, with 99 groups expected to demonstrate either for or against Donald Trump. With a price tag of tens of millions of dollars, a lot of security measures are coming together, and it’s not just the usual metal detectors and bag checks  —   though there will be plenty of that. Rooftop snipers, boat restrictions in the Anacostia and Potomac rivers, and “multilevel perimeters” along the viewing areas and parade route will be set in place. Manhole covers are being welded shut, and light poles, trash cans, and even mailboxes are being removed from the area. Officials say there will be some 28, 000 security personnel dedicated to keeping spectators safe. In addition to local law enforcement officers, and those being brought in from    this includes help from the Department of Homeland Security, Secret Service, Transportation Security Administration, and Coast Guard, as well as troops from the National Guard. Staying Safe: Despite the beefed up security, there are still some safety precautions one can take. Don’t carry a ton cash, use a purse with zippers (or even better, a cross body bag) and pack photocopies of all your important documents (think ID, credit cards, airline tickets, etc. ). With such an influx of people, its bound someone is going to get lost. Be sure all children, disabled and elderly people carry an information card, including their name, address, emergency contact info, and medical information. There is also the potential that some protests may get violent. If this happens, move away from the action as calmly and quickly as possible. Avoid becoming involved and keep your loved ones close.

9418,The Russian media just loves the campaign to demonize Putin,"250 Views November 03, 2016 1 Comment Analyses The Saker 
Last May I wrote an article entitled Counter-propaganda, Russian style in which I explained that far from banning or censoring the western anti-Putin/anti-Russia campaign, the Russia media reported about it in meticulous detail. Half a year later, not only is this still true, but the level of coverage has now sharply increased. Check out this screenshot from the latest (and most watched) weekly news show: “Painting Putin” on Russian TV 
Remember that roughly 80% plus of the audience watching this are strong supporters of President Putin. You can imagine what they think when they see these reports. The fully understand that the West hates Putin so much precisely because Putin is one of them, a real Russian who cares for the interests of the Russian people. So when the West demonizes Putin, it is really all the Russian people who are demonized and their conclusion is simple: the West does not hate Putin, the West hates *us*. As for “Blame it on Putin”– it has now become a real joke. Source: the (pro-Western) Levada Center 
One of the main effects of this kind of demonization is that the Russian public fully understands that there is no way back. In practical terms, most Russians believe that even if Russia pulled out of Syria, stopped supporting the Donbass or even decided to hand Crimea to the Ukies, the West would still continue to demonize Russia and try to subdue her . Furthermore, the Russians remember that the only time when the West liked Russia was when she was run by the drunken Eltsin and his coterie of Jewish oligarchs who pillaged Russia and whose reign had consequences similar to what a major war would result in. Any other Russia is simply unacceptable to the AngloZionist Empire. 
Seen in this light, the alliance of the West with both the Nazis in Kiev and the “moderate terrorists” in the Middle-East makes sense. This is not fundamentally different from the European’s alliance with the Ottomans during the Crimean War or the USA supported Japan against Russia in 1905 (only to then end up fighting against Japan a few years later). As long as X is anti-Russian, the West support X. It’s that primitive and that stupid. 
The Ukronazi regime in Kiev has understood that it has only one “commodity” left which it can sell to the West: its rabid russophobia. And since they are desperate, they make desperate and, frankly, comical efforts. Check out the new symbol of the Ukie military intelligence service: The Ukies point a dagger at the heart of Russia 
I don’t think I have ever seen the Ukie inferiority complex better illustrated. The Latin sentence “ Sapiens Dominabitur Astra ” (“the wise will rule the stars”) is a nice touch as it combines a non-cyrillic (Latin) alphabet, a reference to European astrology in the Middle Ages and a typically Ukrainian (cosmic) megalomania. Yet another proof, if needed, that all the Ukraine is is an “anti-Russia”. 
Make no mistake though, there is absolutely no fear of the West in Russia. Most Russians believe that the Russian armed forces are more than enough to keep West in check. And they are quite correct. But there is this acute awareness that were in not for the Russian military, Russia would be treated just like Iraq. 
In the meantime, the Russia media is gleefully feeding the Russian public every bit of russophobic propaganda produced in the West. Future generations will probably study this period and wonder at the absolutely mind-boggling stupidity of a western propaganda machine which is apparently completely oblivious at the impact of its propaganda on a nuclear superpower.

An Eerily Similar Replica of the Doomed Ship Will Set Sail in 2018,"Whiten Your Face By Using One Ingredient Wrinkles Will Disappear Ξ [November 2, 2016] BLOG Would You Board the Titanic II? An Eerily Similar Replica of the Doomed Ship Will Set Sail in 2018 posted by Eddie This lavish replica of the ill-fated RMS Titanic is expected to set sail in 2018 – and it will look eerily similar to the most famous ship in the world that sank back in 1912.Staying true to its namesake, the Titanic II will feature Turkish baths, an Edwardian gym and a small swimming pool. Of course, it will also feature the grand staircase which remains one of its most famous features due to its prominence in the 1997 movie about the ship’s sinking.Like the “unsinkable” original, it will also have first, second and third class cabins and dining rooms, as well as a smoking room. With white panelling throughout, the first class dining room was nearly 115 feet long and spanned the entire width of the ship. Blue Star Line says that some of the elements will be retained purely for historic significance but will not be functional.Titanic II will be 13 feet wider than the original ship, but its length, height and weight will be similar, and it will also have nine decks like the original. First class cabins on board Titanic II will feature beds with curtains, wood paneling and his and hers sinks. It will meet modern safety and design requirements, meaning it will have a welded hull instead of a riveted one, a diesel-electric propulsion system instead of steam engines, stabilizers, and high-tech navigational equipment, reports the Daily Mail.And, of course, this time, it will have enough lifeboats for everyone on board – and evacuation systems put in place.

9420,„Es hat sich wie ein Virus verbreitet“: Wie Polizei bei Silvester in Köln versagte,"10 870 0 26 In den teilweise erschütternden Berichten geben die meist jungen Frauen zu Protokoll, wie sie in der Kölner Silvesternacht von Männern eingekreist, an Brüsten, zwischen den Beinen und am Gesäß angefasst wurden. 
Die Tatverdächtigen – größtenteils junge Migranten aus Nordafrika – hätten sich wohl im Bereich um den Hauptbahnhof zum gemeinsamen Feiern verabredet, anders sei nicht zu erklären, warum sich über 1000 dieser jungen Männer gleichzeitig auf dem Platz befunden hätten, so der Kriminologe Prof. Dr. Rudolf Egg, der Aussagen von über 1000 Opfern analysiert hat. © REUTERS/ Benoit Tessier Nach sexuellen Übergriffen: „Wels darf nicht Köln werden“ 
Er gehe aber nicht davon aus, dass sie von vorn herein den Plan verfolgt hätten, Frauen sexuell zu belästigen. Nach einzelnen Vorfällen habe sich vielmehr eine Eigendynamik entwickelt. „Es hat sich wie ein Virus in der Gruppe der Männer verbreitet, sodass ganze Spaliere entstanden – dass man etwa die Brücke, die über den Rhein führt, und den Fußgängerweg blockiert hat und man dort gar nicht mehr passieren konnte“, stellte er in einem Interview für die Sputnik-Korrespondentin Ilona Pfeffer fest. 
Die Einsatzkräfte der Polizei seien auf eine solche Situation nicht vorbereitet gewesen. 
„Die Polizei hat die Lage unterschätzt. Man hat gemeint, mit einer geringen Stärke und mit dem Gewährenlassen von weniger schweren Straftaten die Sache im Griff zu behalten. Das hat hier nicht funktioniert. Die Situation war nur auf den ersten Blick so ähnlich, wie das, was man an Massenbewegungen am Rande eines Fußballspiels kennt oder von politischen Demonstrationen. Man hatte kein Vorbild, es gab kein vergleichbares Ereignis. Das hat dazu geführt, dass man von vornherein zu wenige Polizisten vor Ort hatte und diese auch nicht viel ausrichten konnten.“ 
Ähnlich sieht es Arnold Plickert, Stellvertretender Bundesvorsitzender der Gewerkschaft der Polizei (GdP): © AFP 2016/ DPA/Markus Boehm „Polizisten guckten und taten nichts“: Erkenntnisse zu Kölner Silvesternacht - Studie „Es war für keinen erkennbar, dass es zu Silvester zu solchen Erscheinungen kommt. Das geben übrigens auch die ersten Ergebnisse der SoKo in Köln wieder. Die meisten Personen, die wir als tatverdächtig ermittelt haben, waren erst seit drei bis vier Monaten in Deutschland. Es gab auch keine Absprachen, da hinzugehen, kein koordiniertes Vorgehen.“ 
In einigen Fällen habe man trotz Überforderung den Opfern helfen können, so Plickert gegenüber Sputnik. Eine große Zahl von Frauen hat aber laut dem Gutachten von Prof. Rudolf Egg von der Kriminologischen Zentralstelle in Wiesbaden auf ihre Notrufe hin keine adäquate Unterstützung durch die Beamten erhalten. „Bei der Anhörung im Landtag von NRW wurden auch Notrufe abgespielt, die Frauen und Männer abgegeben hatten, und es klang nicht so, als wenn man hochaufmerksam reagiert hätte. Da sagt eine Frau, sie sei begrapscht worden. Für sie ist es eine dramatische Situation und es heißt bloß„Bleiben Sie mal da, wir schicken jemanden vorbei.“ Das klingt, als wolle man die Person abwimmeln und würde sie nicht ernst nehmen.“ © AFP 2016/ Markus Boehm / dpa Auch direkt vor Ort angesprochene Polizisten hätten den Aussagen der Opfer zufolge die Frauen nicht ernst genommen und keine Hilfe geleistet.
Erklärungsversuche seitens des Polizeigewerkschafters: „Die Kollegen, die dort im Einsatz waren, haben eine äußerst schwierige Situation vorgefunden. Es waren von Anfang an viel zu wenige Kräfte da. Ich kann mir vorstellen, dass Kollegen mit anderen Aufgaben beschäftigt waren und gesagt haben: Ich kann jetzt nicht, gehen Sie zur nächsten Wache. Wenn aber eine Frau, wie es geschildert wurde, von mehreren Personen angegangen wurde, zu zwei Beamten gegangen wäre und die sich nicht gekümmert hätten, weggeguckt hätten, dann wäre das nicht akzeptabel. Man kann die Person nicht mit dem Gefühl stehen lassen: Hier kümmert sich keiner, es ist uninteressant, was ich erlitten habe.“ 
Statt eines aktiven Eingreifens seitens der Polizei sollen die Opfer mehrfach den Ratschlag bekommen haben, sich von den Stellen fernzuhalten, wo sie belästigt worden seien. 
„Manchmal ist der Ratschlag, bestimmte Plätze zu meiden, so falsch nicht. Aber das kann nicht die Lösung des Problems sein. Man kann potentiellen Opfern nicht die Verantwortung dafür übertragen, dass nichts passiert. Die Politik und die Sicherheitsorgane müssen sich auf andere Weise darauf vorbereiten, denn die Schuld liegt nicht bei den Opfern, sondern bei den Tätern.“, kommentiert Egg. 
Mindestens fraglich ist auch, warum die Polizei angesichts der aus der Kontrolle geratenen Situation keine Verstärkung angefordert hatte. Polizeigewerkschafter Plickert bestätigt, dass es für die Silvesternacht Sofortverstärkungskräfte gegeben hätte, aber die hätten erst aus anderen Behörden angefordert werden müssen und wären zu spät gekommen, um an der Lage in Köln etwas ausrichten zu können. © REUTERS/ Wolfgang Rattay Kölner Silvesternacht: Schrecken vieler Frauen wird zu Schreck für Frau Merkel „Um 22:30 hat es eine Besprechung mit dem Polizeiführer und dem Führer der Bundespolizei gegeben und man hat gemerkt, es läuft aus dem Ruder, und sich dazu entschlossen, den Platz zu räumen. Zu dem Zeitpunkt hätte es keinen Sinn mehr gemacht, eine Hundertschaft anzufordern, denn sie wäre erst gegen 1 Uhr da gewesen. Um 23:25 hat man mit der Räumung begonnen und diese ist auch relativ unproblematisch verlaufen.“ 
Nun gelte es, unter anderem in dem Untersuchungsausschuss im Düsseldorfer Landtag, der bereits 49 Sitzungen hinter sich hat, bei denen Zeugen und Gutachter gehört werden, das Geschehene zu analysieren und die richtigen Schlüsse daraus zu ziehen. 
„Wir werden uns zukünftig einsatzmäßig anders aufstellen. Es wird ein gemeinsames Sicherheitskonzept mit der Stadt geben. An solchen Plätzen gibt es eine Videoüberwachung und ich gehe davon aus, dass in solchen Tagen auch die Räume besser ausgeleuchtet werden. Letztes Silvester waren wir mit 130 Landespolizisten in Köln eingesetzt, dieses Jahr gehe ich davon aus, dass wir mit 1000 Polizisten präsent sein werden. Ich glaube, alle Bundesländer werden sich in der kommenden Silvesternacht kräftemäßig besser aufstellen, weil alle diese Szenarien von Köln vor Augen haben“, sagt Polizeigewerkschafter Arnold Plickert.

9421,Tesla Made More Money This Quarter Than All U.S. Oil Companies Made Last Year,"Tesla Made More Money This Quarter Than All U.S. Oil Companies Made Last Year Nov 14, 2016 0 0 
Signs of the times. This past quarter, Elon Musk’s Tesla company made a profit of $22 million, while the entire U.S. oil industry lost a total of $67 billion last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration . This is in part due to the global oil prices falling, as well as humanity’s awakening push for clean, renewable energy. 
According to the Renewable Energy Institute , the price efficiency of solar technology will be better than fossil fuel by 2025 and will continue to get cheaper and cheaper until that time. 
However, the newly elected President of the U.S. says that he wants to “lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion worth of job-producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.” Donald Trump also says he will initiate this action within his first 100 days of being in office. 
While this action is certain to increase jobs for more Americans, we must also take into account the environmental impact this will have as even more carbon will be released into the atmosphere if these now dormant energy reserves begin to be tapped. 
Additionally, the price of oil continues to remain low and even if jobs are created, there is no guarantee these companies in the fossil fuel industry will be able to profit financially. 
The way the world is recognizing the necessity to move away from fossil fuels, as well as the increased technological capability, it appears as though Donald Trump will have a very difficult time putting this part of his plan into action. 
Instead, he is likely to face a wave of opposition if he tries to implement such measures as people know that we can’t keep pumping even more carbon into the atmosphere if we want our world’s atmosphere to return to pristine condition. 
Earlier this year, leaders from Russia, China, Japan and South Korea met to sign an agreement to begin working on a project called the Asian Super-Grid . The project will include wind and solar technologies and will power various parts of the world, including Europe, Southern Africa, South and Southeast Asia, as well as the four countries involved. 
What we are seeing right now in our world is the writing on the wall: We see what destruction and pollution can come from the fossil fuel industry (as well as the political destruction that occurs through war to gain more oil resources from the Middle East) and we see that the solutions to these issues already exist. 
We see more and more that the solutions are being put into place, and now on an even wider scale (Asian Super-Grid). We also are seeing the economic reality of either continuing down the old path of fossil fuels as well as the bright new path being forged with clean and sustainable energy. 
2017 is going to be quite a year. We have the solutions, but will we implement them on a mass scale?

9423,Why Keeping Only the Popular Parts of Obamacare Won’t Work - The New York Times,"Before Obamacare, it could be hard to buy your own insurance if you’d already had a health problem like cancer. An insurance company might have decided not to sell any insurance to someone like you. It might have agreed to cover you, but not cover cancer care. Or it might have offered you a comprehensive policy, but at some incredibly high price that you could never have paid. Donald J. Trump says he wants to do away with much of Obamacare, but he has signaled that parts of the law that banned those practices are good policy he’d want to keep. “I like those very much,” he told The Wall Street Journal last week about the law’s rules that prevent discrimination based on   conditions. The   conditions policies are very popular. Nearly everyone has relatives or friends with illnesses in their past  —   cancer, arthritis, depression, even allergies  —   that could have shut them out of the individual insurance markets before Obamacare, so it’s an issue that hits close to home for many Americans. But keeping those provisions while jettisoning others is most likely no fix at all. Those policies that make the insurance market feel fairer for sick Americans who need it can really throw off the prices for everyone else. That’s why Obamacare also includes less popular policies designed to balance the market with enough young, healthy people. Imagine you’re that patient with cancer. You really want health insurance, and you’re probably willing to pay a lot to get it. If the law requires insurance companies to offer you a policy, you are very likely to buy it. Now imagine you’re a young, healthy person without any health problems. Your budget is tight, and health insurance is expensive. You might decide you’ll be fine without insurance, since you can always buy it later, when you’re the one with a pessimistic diagnosis. Before Obamacare, several states tried policies like this, and required insurance companies to sell insurance to everyone at the same price, regardless of health histories. The results were nearly the same everywhere: Prices went way up enrollment went way down and insurance companies fled the markets. Some states hobbled along with small, expensive markets. Some experienced total market collapse and repealed the policies. Prices in those markets typically became so high that they were really a good deal only for people who knew they’d use a lot of health care services. And the sicker the insurance pool got, the more the companies would charge for their health plans. The health law attempts to broaden the pool by offering financial assistance to   people. By limiting how much people can be asked to pay for insurance, the law’s subsidies help make the purchase more attractive for healthier customers. That’s the law’s carrot. Then there’s the stick: The law says that if you don’t buy insurance, and you could have afforded it, you have to pay a fine. That rule is designed to discourage people from gaming the system by waiting until they’re sick. The mandate remains the law’s least popular provision. New York is a great case study. Before Obamacare, it had the   conditions policy, but without subsidies or a mandate. When the Obamacare rules kicked in, premiums there went down by 50 percent. This year, Obamacare premiums have risen substantially  —   an average of 22 percent around the country  —   leading many experts and politicians to question whether the law’s incentives were strong enough. Some, including Hillary Clinton, have argued that the government should sweeten the carrot, by making the subsidies more generous. Others have said that the stick should sting more by forcing the uninsured to pay a bigger penalty for sitting out of the market. Republican politicians have tended to criticize both of the incentive provisions. The subsidies have been attacked as excessive government spending. The mandate has been criticized as an inappropriate use of government power. Both have been the subject of big Supreme Court cases challenging the law. Both would have been eliminated under a bill passed by Congress but vetoed by President Obama last year. Taking away those unpopular pieces of the law and keeping the popular   conditions piece might seem like a political win. But it would result in a broken system. When Mitt Romney was devising the Massachusetts health reform law that would become the model for Obamacare, he hoped to set up a marketplace for health plans with some financial assistance for   people to buy insurance. What he didn’t want was a mandate. Then Jonathan Gruber, an M. I. T. economist who had calculated the results, showed him the numbers: His plan would cover only a third of the uninsured and cost   as much as an identical plan with a mandate. Mr. Romney embraced the mandate. When Barack Obama ran for president in 2007, he, too, advocated a   health reform system. He, too, said he did not support a mandate. Then he became president, and economists brought him the numbers. By the time the Affordable Care Act passed, he had changed his mind. We’ll see what happens when the economists bring the numbers to Mr. Trump. His transition website suggests that he might develop a different solution to the problem: a special, separate insurance market just for sick people. But that plan is different from the more modest amendments to the Affordable Care Act he described to The Wall Street Journal. It won’t be easy to keep the basic architecture of Obamacare while plucking out its least popular pieces. (Another provision that Mr. Trump says he likes, the requirement that insurers cover young adults on their parents’ policies, would be easier to save.) Last year, I spoke with Mark Hall, a law professor at Wake Forest University who studied the states that had tried   conditions bans before Obamacare. One of the Supreme Court cases threatened to wipe out the mandate and the subsidies, and I asked him what would happen if the litigants succeeded. “It would be a big mess,” he said.",0

9427,Trump Eases Combat Rules in Somalia Intended to Protect Civilians - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump has relaxed some of the rules for preventing civilian casualties when the American military carries out counterterrorism strikes in Somalia, laying the groundwork for an escalating campaign against Islamist militants in the Horn of Africa. The decision, according to officials familiar with internal deliberations, gives commanders at the United States Africa Command greater latitude to carry out offensive airstrikes and raids by ground troops against militants with the   Islamist group Shabab. That sets the stage for an intensified pace of combat there, while increasing the risk that American forces could kill civilians. Mr. Trump signed a directive on Wednesday declaring parts of Somalia an “area of active hostilities,” where   targeting rules will apply for at least 180 days, the officials said. The New York Times reported the Pentagon’s request for the expanded targeting authority on March 12, and Gen. Thomas D. Waldhauser, the top officer at Africa Command, publicly acknowledged that he was seeking it at a news conference last Friday. “It’s very important and very helpful for us to have little more flexibility, a little bit more timeliness, in terms of   process,” General Waldhauser said. “It allows us to prosecute targets in a more rapid fashion. ” In a statement issued several hours after The New York Times first published news of the directive, Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, acknowledged that Mr. Trump had approved the Pentagon’s proposal to expand its targeting authority “to defeat Al Shabab in Somalia” in partnership with African Union and Somali forces. “The additional support provided by this authority will help deny Al Shabab safe havens from which it could attack U. S. citizens or U. S. interests in the region,” he said. Previously, to carry out an airstrike or ground raid in Somalia, the military was generally required to follow standards that President Barack Obama imposed in 2013 for counterterrorism strikes away from conventional war zones, like those in Afghanistan and Iraq. Those rules, known as the Presidential Policy Guidance, required   interagency vetting of proposed strikes. They also said that the target must pose a threat to Americans and that there must be   that no civilian bystanders would die. Under the new guidelines, Africa Command may treat Somalia under   battlefield rules: Without interagency vetting, commanders may strike people thought to be Shabab fighters based only on that status, without any reason to think that the individual target poses a particular and specific threat to Americans. In addition, some civilian bystander deaths would be permitted if deemed necessary and proportionate. Mr. Trump’s decision to exempt much of Somalia from the 2013 rules follows a similar decision he made for parts of Yemen shortly after taking office. The new directive for Somalia is another example of how the American military is accelerating the ways it carries out combat missions under the Trump administration, reducing constraints on the use of force imposed by the Obama administration. As the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has recently moved into the city of Mosul, civilian casualties have spiked. One American strike on March 17 may have killed scores of civilians, and human rights groups have questioned whether the rules of engagement were to blame. While American commanders say the formal rules of engagement have not changed in Iraq, they acknowledge that the system for calling in airstrikes there has been accelerated. Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the commander of United States Central Command, said on Wednesday that the new procedures made it easier for commanders in the field to call in airstrikes without waiting for permission from more senior officers. The loosening of the rules in Somalia comes against the backdrop of a broader, continuing Trump administration policy review about whether to scrap the 2013 rules altogether. The decision was described by officials familiar with the new directive who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss military planning. Luke Hartig, a former senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council during the Obama administration, said greater action could be helpful in dealing with a threat, pointing to the Obama administration’s decision last year to temporarily declare the region around Surt, Libya, an   zone. That decision similarly permitted airstrikes that helped Libyan forces root out Islamic State militants. But it also increases certain risks, he said. “The downside is you risk potentially greater civilian casualties or potentially killing militants who are not part of our enemy,” Mr. Hartig said. He warned that such deaths could make local partners turn against the United States and fuel terrorist recruitment. Mr. Trump’s decision to relax targeting limits in Somalia comes at a time of famine, which has increased the frequency of groups of people moving around, often while armed, in search of food and water  —   increasing the risk of mistaking civilians as Islamist fighters. General Waldhauser said at the news conference that Africa Command had “ ” the “significant” issues raised by that factor. “It’s our responsibility to make sure that we don’t have any catastrophes and we don’t take out a group of people who is moving to find water or food,” he said. “So, we are very, very conscious of that. ” Defense Secretary Jim Mattis first presented the proposal to relax targeting limits in Somalia at a dinner with Mr. Trump about five days after his inauguration, according to officials familiar with internal deliberations. At that same dinner, Mr. Mattis also presented proposals to similarly remove swaths of Yemen from the   targeting limits and carry out a raid against Yemen’s Qaeda branch. Mr. Trump, the officials said, immediately approved the two proposals for Yemen, while the National Security Council began reviewing the Somalia proposal. The review for Somalia was slowed, officials have said, by criticism of the raid in Yemen, which resulted in numerous civilian deaths, the death of a member of the Navy SEALs and the loss of a $75 million aircraft. Still, the Central Command, which oversees military operations in Yemen, has carried out a fierce campaign of airstrikes in Yemen. The United States’ campaign against the Shabab in Somalia has been expanding over the last several years. That Islamist group is complex, with some factions focused on controlling Somalia, while others want to participate in external terrorist operations in line with Al Qaeda’s global war. In 2013, the group carried out the attack at the Westgate mall, in Nairobi, Kenya, that killed more than 60 people and wounded more than 175. Since then, it has adopted more sophisticated forms of terrorism, including nearly bringing down a Somali airliner in February with a bomb hidden in a laptop computer. To counter the Shabab, the United States has increasingly used Special Operations forces, airstrikes, private contractors and African allies. Hundreds of American troops now rotate through makeshift bases in Somalia, the largest military presence since the United States pulled out of the country after the “Black Hawk Down” battle in 1993. They have served as trainers and advisers to African Union and Somali government forces, and have sometimes participated directly in combat. Against that backdrop, Mr. Trump’s escalation is less a break with his predecessor than an intensification of a trend that dates to Mr. Obama’s last year in power. Last year, the Obama White House permitted the military to increase airstrikes in Somalia without always going through the   vetting process detailed in the 2013 rules. Instead, the military justified some strikes under an expansive interpretation of an exception for “ ”  —   including some that defended partner forces combating the Shabab even if no Americans were under direct threat. And as The Times reported in November, the Obama administration  —   after years of internal debate  —   decided to designate the Shabab an “associated force” of Al Qaeda. That shored up the executive branch’s authority to wage war in Somalia by bringing the Shabab under Congress’s authorization to use military force against the perpetrators of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Even before the new relaxations of the rules, 200 to 300 American Special Operations forces have been working with soldiers from Somalia and other African nations like Kenya and Uganda to carry out more than a   raids every month, according to senior American military officials. The Navy’s classified SEAL Team 6 has been heavily involved in many of these operations. The Pentagon has acknowledged only a fraction of these missions. But even the publicly available information shows a marked increase in recent years. The Pentagon announced 13 ground raids and airstrikes in 2016, up from five in 2015, according to data compiled by New America, a Washington think tank. Those strikes killed about 25 civilians and 200 people suspected of being militants, the group found.",0
9428,Sore Loser: Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) to Boycott Inauguration,"Rep. Jared Huffman ( ) has announced that he will boycott   Donald Trump’s inauguration next Friday, becoming the third U. S. representative to do so. [In a Facebook post on Saturday, Huffman announced that he wanted to protest the start of a “dark and dangerous chapter” for America:  Ordinarily, on Inauguration Day I would take my place above the west steps of the Capitol and join colleagues and dignitaries in honoring a great and solemn American tradition: the peaceful transfer of power which must always transcend partisan differences. Ordinarily, I would do that without hesitation for any President, regardless of their politics or personality, as a show of respect for the institution and the will of the voters  —   and as a gesture of goodwill to foster reconciliation and collaboration as we put the election behind us and prepare to work with the new administration. However, there is nothing ordinary about this inauguration or the man that will be   as our next President. I do accept the election results and support the peaceful transfer of power, but it is abundantly clear to me that with Donald Trump as our President, the United States is entering a dark and very dangerous political chapter. I will do everything I can to limit the damage and the duration of this chapter, and I believe we can get through it. But I will not sit passively and politely applaud as it begins. Instead of attending the inauguration, Huffman said that he would spend the day in his district “doing positive things. ” Huffman represents the second congressional district of California, a coastal district that includes liberal Humboldt County,  the state’s most celebrated marijuana cultivation region. As Breitbart News reported last year, Huffman, a Democratic Party “” defied the views of many of his constituents by supporting former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ). Huffman joins Reps. Luis Gutierrez ( ) and Katherine Clark ( ) in boycotting what has traditionally been a bipartisan event, where the country comes together for at least one moment to honor the democratic transition of power. The California Democrat said that he had received support from the district, and that “people are really resonating” with his decision to boycott, although he complained about opposition from “these Republicans from Alabama, Indiana and Oklahoma. ” Joel B.

9429,Obama Knew About Clinton's Server; Lied To American People,"Email 
Hillary Clinton and her close cohorts are not the only ones whose corruption and lies have been revealed by the Podesta e-mails published by WikiLeaks. The e-mails also document that — his protestations to the contrary notwithstanding — President Obama lied to the American people when he claimed that he had been unaware of Hillary Clinton’s use of a private, unsecured e-mail server which she used to conduct official State business, including both sending and receiving classified information. 
In a pre-recorded interview aired on CBS on March 8, 2015, the president said he had learned of Clinton’s server “through news reports” and that he learned of it “the same time everybody else” did. Of course, that was not true, since he had exchanged e-mails with Clinton while she was secretary of state and the e-mail address would clearly have been her private address instead of the state.gov address she should have been using. 
The day after the interview aired on CBS, the White House tried to walk back the president’s remarks. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was asked in a press briefing , “We heard from the President in his interview with CBS about this and he said that he first became aware of it in the reports last week. So I’m wondering if, implicit in that, is that the President and Secretary Clinton never emailed one another when Secretary Clinton was serving at the State Department.” He answered by saying: That may be one conclusion to draw from the President’s remarks, but it would not be an accurate one. The President, as I think many people expected, did over the course of his first several years in office trade emails with his Secretary of State. I would not describe the number of emails as large, but they did have the occasion to email one another. And the point that the President was making is not that he didn’t know Secretary Clinton’s email address — he did — but he was not aware of the details of how that email address and that server had been set up or how Secretary Clinton and her team were planning to comply with the Federal Records Act. 
Earnest was then asked a follow-up question about the specific e-mail address Clinton was using when she and the president exchanged messages. The question, as recorded in the transcript of that briefing, was, “Just to drill down on that a little bit, does that mean that he didn’t know that he was emailing whatever it was, like, This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. , or that...” Earnest cut off the question to say: Well, again, I’m not going to get into a lot of detail here, but I’m not going to — the point is the President did email with Secretary Clinton. I assume that he recognized the email address that he was emailing back to. But, again, the question here is about compliance with the Federal Records Act. And understandably, the kinds of things that a President and his Secretary of State talk about are pretty weighty, national issues. I’m not sure that they drilled all the way down to the Federal Records Act. But what is clear is that, as the President said in his interview, the emails that he sends are properly maintained, consistent with the Presidential Records Act — and that, by the way, would be true of any emails that he received from his Secretary of State. And the reason I raise that is because Secretary Clinton’s team has pointed out, rightfully so, that a large number of the emails that they provided to the State Department in response to a request from her personal email system were already maintained on the State Department agency system. And the reason for that is she was emailing people with — State Department employees with state.gov email addresses, which meant that those email communications had been properly preserved and maintained. The last thing I’ll say about this is that what we know also is that the whole purpose of maintaining these records is to ensure that they can be properly used in responding to legitimate questions and inquiries from Congress and from the public. And I understand that hundreds of documents have already been provided to Congress consistent with their specific request out of these records. 
It’s interesting that within hours of the president’s remarks being broadcast, the White House was already prepared to spin what he had said and try to make it sound like he did not claim that he had first learned of Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server and account “the same time everybody else learned it, through news reports.” 
Remember that the CBS interview was pre-recorded. What is now known — because of the Podesta e-mails published by WikiLeaks — is that in the day between that recording and the press briefing at the White House (even before the interview aired), Team Clinton was already working on how to “clean this up.” 
At 6:33 p.m. on March 7, the day before the CBS interview was seen by the American people, Josh Schwerin, a spokesperson for the Clinton campaign, sent an e-mail to Jennifer Palmieri, director of communications for the campaign, and Kristina Schake, deputy communications director for the campaign, and others. He drew Palmieri’s attention to the problem of the president’s remarks: *From:* Josh Schwerin < This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. > *Date:* March 7, 2015 at 6:33:44 PM EST *To:* Jennifer Palmieri < This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. >, Kristina Schake < This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. >, Nick Merrill < This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. >, Jesse Ferguson < This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. > *Subject:* *POTUS on HRC emails* https://twitter.com/katherinemiller/status/574350749280432129/photo/1 Jen you probably have more on this but it looks like POTUS just said he found out HRC was using her personal email when he saw it in the news. -- Josh Schwerin 
The e-mail resulted in a reply from Cheryl Mills, who received a forward of the e-mail at 6:39 p.m. She replied at 9:41 p.m. in a forward to John Podesta: From: This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. To: This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. Date: 2015-03-07 21:41 Subject: Fwd: POTUS on HRC emails we need to clean this up — he has emails from her — they do not say state.gov 
So, in just over three hours, Team Clinton had verified that Hillary Clinton had e-mailed the president from her private, unsecured server and Cheryl Mills had set into motion an effort to “clean this up.” The interview aired the next day, and by the following day Josh Earnest held the press briefing in which he was already prepared to eat the president’s words and regurgitate something else. That is efficiency. 
If nothing else, the WikiLeaks disclosure of the Podesta e-mails is revealing the collusion and corruption that are part and parcel of the way things are done in Washington. The president attempted to distance himself from the Clinton e-mail scandal by telling the American people a lie. That lie was that he did not know about her private server before the media reported on it. Team Clinton went to work to “clean this up” and made a point of the fact that “he has e-mails from her” which “do not say state.gov” and the next thing you know, the White House is ready to admit that the president knew all along about the server, and — Gosh! We hope the president’s words weren’t taken the wrong way — all the president meant to say was that he is careful to obey the law where e-mail and record-keeping are concerned, and he assumed the same of Secretary Clinton.

9430,Crossing the Line in Democracy,"14 Shares
12 0 0 2 (Taksim Square - Gezi Park Protests, İstanbul. Credit: Alan Hilditch / flickr)
Democracy grants people the right to protest, to show their opinion on matters that affect their lives and their nation’s. Protesting is a universally acknowledged fact belonging to the modern world. It serves to give voice to those who are disturbed by the faulty policies, drawbacks and negligence of their governments and who wish to raise public awareness on these matters. Demonstrations, rallies, strikes, pickets, boycotts and so on are all ways of protesting. As long as they are within the limits defined by the “law,” protests and acts of similar nature are in essence an indisputable part of democracy, freedom of opinion and expression.
However, in some cases protesting is exploited and used as a means of opposing democracy itself. Protests that give way to riots are now methods of staging coups to shut down administrations and overthrow democratically elected governments.
Legitimacy of Protests and Feasibility of Demands
Democratic protests are welcomed by societies and addressed by governments to the extent that their demands are tangible, justified and feasible . Protests lacking those qualities are most likely to fail in having their demands met.
The anti-government movement in Bulgaria in 2013-14 confirmed the validity of these qualities. The protests took place in three separate cycles. January and February witnessed rallies that objected to the high prices of electricity and demanded the government resign. They were successful as the requests were sensible. A later demonstration was against a government officer, and resulted in his resignation. Yet another cycle of protests called for a change of the system, along with some other illegal demands and faced defeat after turning into riots that were not supported by the overall society.
MORE... Gruesome Video Shows Turkish Soldiers Execute Female Kurdish PKK Fighters by Shooting in Their Heads 2 bombers, stopped by police, blew themselves up in Turkey Dispute over Kurds and Coup attempt threatens U.S.-Turkey alliance The attempted coup d’état made Turkey band together The Gezi Park protests in Turkey in the same year followed the same pattern. Set in motion with a good willed and environmentalist approach, it was likely to succeed considering its solid and feasible calls and legitimate ways at first. The government heeded the nature lovers’ voices and took a positive step by postponing a construction project that required the destruction of Gezi Park. Yet the humanist approach of young people changed course in the wake of provocations of separatist and terrorist gangs and turned into a totally different nature. Demonstrations that began in Gezi Park in Istanbul and that demanded the preservation of Gezi Park as a recreational area spread to other cities of the country and transformed into armed and bloody uprising imposing the fall of government. It was a quite clear coup d’etat attempt that did not refrain from using violent methods and openly rejected the validity of a democratically elected government. The protests were contradictory considering people took to streets using their democratic rights, but then appealed to non-democratic methods to lay their claims ignoring the will of the nation.
Though justified at the beginning, these two cases of protests demonstrate that they are open to hostile manipulations and may lose their legitimacy if left at the hands of ill-minded people. Recently some dark powers have been using this latest technique to manage countries’ internal affairs as they see fit and stage coups to overthrow governments. They bring in professional teams of brutal killers amidst peaceful protests, which then lead to violent anti-democratic clashes. These protests sometimes end up in civil wars where fellows of the same nation kill one another. It all happens in the wake of a government’s non-yielding to some dark power’s demands and a democratically elected government faces anti-democratic attempts.
Methods of Provocations and OTPOR
Such dramatic outcomes come by the employment of social media. Social media becomes an instrument for organizing, stirring and agitating the masses that are presumed to join the demonstrations. Various provocative organizations undertake the organization of some agents and provocateurs who take part in demonstrations by inciting them to get violent. These illegal “subcontractors” organize the public relations part of the riots and channel intellectual circles of the country such as its authors, academicians, journalists and members of non-governmental institutions to act against democratically elected government in the name of democracy and to lead the public.
One of the most common groups among these “ professional revolutionary organizations ” is a Serbia-based resistance organization,OTPOR . Independent observers state that OTPOR organizes coup attempts and civil disturbance by providing training and logistic support for the US-backed dissident organizations in many countries such as the former Yugoslavia, Serbia, Georgia, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Egypt, Brazil, and Turkey. There is a consensus that the CIA has been creating riots and social disturbances in fifty countries OTPOR its offshoot CANVAS…
A relevant source puts forward the following interesting findings OTPOR :
The (OTPOR 's ) fist-logo, would turn up 11 years later in the streets of Cairo , illustrating further the preposterous, foreign-backed nature of the Egyptian uprisings... Serbia’s OTPOR would continue receiving funds from the West and become a “CIA-coup college” of sorts under the name of CANVAS (Center for Applied Non-Violent Action and Strategies ).
The research article penned by Carl Gibson and Steve Horn and published on “Occupy.com” deals with the international financial, intelligence and political connections of OTPOR and features the following information based on WikiLeaks documents:
Serbia’s Srdja Popovic is known by many as a leading architect of regime changes in Eastern Europe and elsewhere since the late-1990s , and as one of the co-founders of OTPOR… Popovic and OTPOR's offshoot CANVAS have also maintained close ties with a Goldman Sachs executive and the private intelligence firm Stratfor as well as the U.S. government …
Such examples are easy to find. The internal public opinion on OTPOR is that it is being employed as leverage to overthrow those governments which conflict with the interests of the U.S. No wonder some media organizations that act on behalf of the US administration speak highly of OTPOR at every turn. Moreover, the British media rigorously advocates that the executives of OTPOR have nothing to do with the organization of coups.
Likewise, some Turkish media organizations disseminated similar statements during the 2013 Gezi Park demonstrations. The attempt to occupy the Prime Minister’s residence by armed groups, which is an act of rebellion against the state and treason by law, was orchestrated by OTPOR, according to reports. Yet the media deliberately defined it as “the exercise of legitimate, democratic rights, and freedom of expression by the people,” and thus desired to create misapprehension to display the members of the Marxist and separatist terrorist organizations who are far from representing even a slightest portion of the nation as the representatives of the nation. These media organs called the nation’s security forces who risked their lives to preserve public order and people’s lives as ‘the so-called enemies of freedom and democracy.’
In truth, such mass demonstrations that aim to topple governments, divide countries and organize bloody conflicts - and even civil wars - can no longer be called innocent rallies, but subtle projects of deep states and shadow organizations to take over countries from within.",0
9431,Chelsea Clinton Hired Eric Braverman As CEO Of The Clinton Foundation To Clean House. Now It Is Being Said He Is Asking For Asylum In Russia.,"https://twitter.com/eric_braverman 7. On Doug Band of the Foundation: He was the CEO of Teneo, a global advisory firm which allowed him to mix Clinton donors, foreign companies with Clinton’s work as Secretary of State. Huma Abedin was a paid advisor to the company. The Senate Judiciary Committee is investigating the alliance between Abedin, Teneo, and the Clinton Foundation aides. There are many articles online saying Braverman had fled to the Russian Embassy in New York asking for asylum, but I do not feel comfortable with stating that as a FACT now. 
Now, new WikiLeaks emails reveal additional details behind the the man, Eric Braverman, who was brought in as CEO by Chelsea to change the controversial practices of the Foundation but abruptly resigned a short time later after being pushed out by long-time Clinton loyalists who had apparently grown very comfortable with the status quo. Below is the new email exchange which begins when Neera Tanden warns John Podesta to “keep tabs on Doug Band” who she assumed was the insider who told NBC to “follow the money and find the real HRC scandal.” Interestingly, John Podesta writes back quickly to identify the real source as former Clinton Foundation CEO Eric Braverman which seems to be shocking to Tanden who replies simply, “Holy Moses.”

Eric Braverman – a Yale lawyer – was brought into the Clinton Foundation “to clean it up” . His salary in 2015 was $395K plus bonuses. Of course the Clintons didn’t really want it cleaned up, – just to LOOK cleaned up …. Braverman was dumped after 2 years.

At the Foundation, Braverman led an effort to help ensure long-term sustainability – securing an endowment, transforming the organization’s use of data, establishing governance practices to reflect changing laws and public expectations, consolidating entities, and creating professional development for staff. Previously, Braverman served as a partner at McKinsey & Company, where he advised leaders in the public, private, and non-profit sectors on strategy, organization, and operations. Named by Fortune magazine in 2010 as one of the “40 Most Influential Leaders in Business” worldwide under 40 years old, Braverman co-founded McKinsey’s public sector practice and directed its work on government innovation globally.

9432,"Review: ‘Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates,’ Antics to Not Love nor Cherish - The New York Times","Two idiots need dates they get them. That’s about all you need to know about the aggressively stupid “Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates,” a   comedy about a pair of imbeciles who are best understood as representations of the enduring,   contempt that some moviemakers have always had for their audiences. Witless, soulless, often amateurish and filled with product placements (nice going, Coors) the movie has nothing going for it other than some wasted talent. I hope that the most egregiously squandered  —   the   Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick, as well as the character actors Stephen Root and Sam Richardson  —   were well paid. Somebody needs to come out of this mess ahead. The story is immaterial, and boilerplate. Adam Devine plays Mike Zac Efron plays his brother, Dave. Their parents  —   knowing that their sons tend to ruin family events with their unfunny, often dangerous   (in one flashback, they send their grandfather to the grave)  —   insist that they bring dates to their sister’s nuptials. The brothers put an ad on Craigslist, which is where Ms. Plaza and Ms. Kendrick come in. Anonymously directed by Jake Szymanski, what follows isn’t really a story, just a succession of thuddingly leaden, patchily strung together bits in service to the underlying theme: Mike and Dave’s fear of sexualized women. Oh, there’s also a racist joke pegged to the singer Seal. You could see “Mike and Dave” as the latest manifestation of white heterosexual male panic run amok. A throwaway line about heteronormativity (I’m sure I heard that right) suggests that someone behind the scenes would like viewers to believe that there’s a degree of   to all the desperation and yuks about booze, babes and bros. Perhaps there is whatever. But token reflexivity never got anyone off the hook. It certainly doesn’t obscure the more resonant if completely predictable truth that the movie evinces a profoundly troglodytic worldview toward women. And while that says a lot about Mike and Dave, it says even more about the industry that made this movie. “Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It’s bad for your brain. Running time: 1 hour 45 minutes.",0
9433,Agencies of Fear,"Share This: B y ANDREW COCKBURN T he intrusion of the FBI into the 2016 presidential election may have come as a shock to most people, but it should not have surprised anyone who has spent time in the Oval Office. Stretching back to the days of J. Edgar Hoover, presidents have learned, sooner or later, that while they may revel in the title of “Chief Executive,” their command of coercive bureaucracies, such as the FBI and the intelligence agencies, along with the military services, and others, is limited at best. ABOVE: FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover succeeded in holding power for life by bribing politicians with his knowledge of their sins and crimes. He himself was a reactionary and closet gay man. At worst, presidents may find these powerful institutions actively colluding with their political enemies. Currently, we have credible reports of agents in the New York FBI Field Office defying their nominal superiors in the justice department to dig with zeal into the Clinton Foundation on the basis of nebulous leads from a partisan and largely discredited screed by a former Bush speechwriter. Richard Nixon would have found this a familiar scenario. Early in his presidency, he came to appreciate how little control he exerted over the assorted fiefdoms of the intelligence and law enforcement bureaucracies. His solution was to set up a whole new police agency with extraordinary powers, the Drug Enforcement Administration, using the cover of a war on drugs, that would be under his direct control. Recognizing this for the threat it was, the entrenched institutions struck back, crippling Nixon with media leaks, notably those from “Deep Throat”, deputy FBI director Mark Felt. Sometimes the hobbling of executive power may emanate not from widely recognized instruments of power, such as the FBI, but from more obscure but nonetheless potent corners of the enforcement universe. Thus the Obama Administration’s signature foreign policy achievement, the agreement to limit Iran’s uranium enrichment program, is currently being actively undermined by a little-known branch of the U.S. Treasury, OFAC, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, which supervises the enforcement of US sanctions around the world. Under the agreement hammered out by Secretary of State John Kerry in July 2015, Iran agreed to curtail its nuclear program in return for the lifting of an array of economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other western powers in recent years. The most onerous of these controls were those enjoining banks from doing business with nominated Iranian banks and other entities, with savage penalties levied on anyone who infringed the rules. The effect has been to deter international banks from doing any business of any kind with Iranian banks, for fear of inadvertently triggering a billion dollar fine from the U.S. sanctions police. Recognizing that the Iranians might lose faith in the agreement if promised rewards from the ability to trade freely with the rest of the world do not appear, the Obama Administration has taken steps to remedy the situation, or thinks it has. Speaking recently at a ceremony in London honoring his role in negotiating the deal, Kerry announced that so long as banks make a pro forma effort to ensure they were not dealing with a sanctioned institution (there are still plenty of those) OFAC would not penalize them even if it turned out they were wrong. “OFAC… has made it very, very clear that if you do due diligence in the normal fashion,” said Kerry, “and later it turns out it was some unenforceable entity that pops up, you will not be held accountable for that.” Except that OFAC has different ideas. As detailed by attorney Tyler Cullis, a specialist in sanctions regulations, writing in the blog SanctionLaw, OFAC states on its own website that the “normal” due diligence cited by Kerry is absolutely not “necessarily sufficient.” Instead, Treasury’s Acting Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Adam Szubin, OFAC’s boss, has made it clear that anyone doing banking business with Iran had better exercise “ enhanced (my emphasis) due diligence,” essentially meaning they have to prove their counterparties are pure as the driven snow, or they will get it in the neck. The consequences are predictable; international banks will deem it smart to pay attention to the sanctions cops rather than the diplomat and steer clear of Iranian business, with consequent disillusionment over the deal in Iran and the neutralizing of a key administration success. As Nixon might have said, par for the course.

9435,Assad: Some Syrian Migrants Are ’Definitely’ Terrorists,"Some migrants coming into Western states as Syrian asylum seekers are “definitely” terrorists, the Syrian President Bashar   has said. [Terrorists pictured on the internet “holding machine guns or killing people” have since turned up in photographs of “peaceful refugees in Europe or the West” President Assad told Yahoo News, adding: “That’s true. ”  But he declined to put a figure on how many of the 4. 8 million asylum seekers might be terrorists, saying “nobody has any number. Nobody knows. Because nobody knows all the terrorists. ” He also declined to say whether the figure might be “significant” highlighting that it took only 15 people to bring down the Twin Towers on  . “It’s not about significant because you don’t need a significant number to commit atrocities,” he said. “It’s not about the number, it’s about the quality  —   it’s about the intentions. ” Speaking in his presidential office in Damascus, Syria, Assad would not take a view on whether the U. S. was right to halt the immigration of migrants from seven countries which posed a security threat, Syria included, but said that his priority was rather to ensure that Syrian asylum seekers return home. “For me, the priority is to bring those citizens to their country, not to help them immigrate,” he said. The interview was released as the British prime minister, Theresa May, defended government schemes to resettle 20, 000 Syrians in the UK over five years. At a Downing Street press conference, May told reporters: ‘We have been seeing quite a number of children and families being resettled here in the United Kingdom. “I think what we are doing in terms of refugees is absolutely right, on top of course of the significant financial support and humanitarian aid we are giving to refugees in the region of Syria  —   a commitment of £2. 3 billion, the second biggest bilateral donor. ” In the last few days, the government has come under fire for ending a scheme to bring child migrants from Calais into Britain. Announcing the decision, immigration minister Robert Goodwill told MPs that 200 children had been placed around the country and that councils had indicated they had the capacity for only 150 more. But the Archbishop of Canterbury slammed the move, calling on the government to take in nearly ten times as many children. He added: “I fear that this week’s decision does not meet the spirit of commitment that was given during the passage of the Immigration Act last year. ”",0
9436,"Irving Fields, Composer Who Infused Songs With Latin Rhythms, Dies at 101 - The New York Times","There was a time in the middle of the last century when   children in certain quarters of the Bronx and Brooklyn were often asked to entertain guests with a song called “Miami Beach Rhumba,” an improbable combination of zesty Latin dance rhythms and musical inflections born of the shtetls and ghettos of Eastern Europe. The composer of that song was Irving Fields, who died on Saturday at 101 at his home in Manhattan, and his career was as improbable as his songs. In his younger days, Mr. Fields specialized in Latinizing standards. He and a trio started with an album for Decca Records called “Bagels and Bongos,” which whimsically transformed melancholy Yiddish chestnuts like “Raisins and Almonds” and “My Yiddishe Momme” into   or mambos. When the album sold tens of thousands of copies, he recorded a sequel and then moved on to Latinizing Italian standards (“Pizza and Bongos”) Hawaiian melodies (“Bikinis and Bongos”) and French songs (“Champagne and Bongos”). He also composed songs, the most famous of which was “Miami Beach Rhumba,” a 1946 number about a traveler who starts out for Havana and ends up in the Jewish Riviera of the song’s title. With lyrics by Albert Gamse  —   “I’ll save Havana for mañana” was one line  —   it became a staple of 1950s and ’60s bar mitzvahs. The Latin bandleader Xavier Cugat turned it into a hit in 1947, and Tito Puente recorded it as well. Fifty years later, Woody Allen used it in his film “Deconstructing Harry. ” (John Camacho is also credited with a hand in the composing.) Other Fields collaborations included “Managua, Nicaragua,” a hit for Guy Lombardo, and “Chantez, Chantez,” a sprightly melody that Dinah Shore recorded in 1957. Yet in the last decades of his life he was better known as a New York City lounge pianist, still performing as recently as March at spots near his Central Park South home, like the dining room of the Park Lane Hotel, the Oak Room at the Plaza Hotel and Nino’s Tuscany Steakhouse. Though he sometimes played to   rooms or ones with distracted customers, he was a restless man who could not stop working. “I love what I do, and the piano is my best friend,” he told an interviewer. Though depending on a walker to get around, his fingers hobbled by arthritis, he continued to find his way to the keyboard, stylish in a blue blazer and pocket square, his customary   vodka martini perched on top of the piano. (He also liked to keep a pile of fliers there, with titles like “Secrets for Longevity” and tips like “Eat four hours before bedtime (you’ll digest better). ”) Mr. Fields could play almost any request, especially if it was for a Gershwin, Kern, Rodgers or Porter tune. If a woman said she was from Texas, he would run off a medley that might start with “The Yellow Rose of Texas. ” “People ask me, ‘How do you remember so many notes? ’” he once said. “It just comes to me. It’s like God is in my mind. ” He even became something of a phenomenon among the internet generation, when, by his account, at a fan’s request, he took 15 minutes to compose “YouTube Dot Com Theme Song. ” It has had close to 900, 000 views. Mr. Fields was born Yitzhak Schwartz on Aug. 4, 1915, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, the youngest of six children (all of whom lived into their 90s). He grew up there and in Coney Island and Bensonhurst in Brooklyn. His father, Max, a carpenter who sang in local choirs, was from Pinsk in Belarus, and his mother, Eva, was from Minsk, also in Belarus he once wrote a song playing with the cities’ rhyming names. Pressured to start taking piano lessons at 8 years old, he found repeating scales monotonous but later credited the exercises with sharpening his playing and making it seem more casual. He also sang in a choir behind the famous cantor Yossele Rosenblatt, and began pecking out popular songs and Yiddish vaudeville tunes. While still a teenager, he put together a band that was hired to play parties. He also took piano jobs on cruise ships headed for Havana and San Juan, engendering a passion for Latin music. Mr. Fields and groups of various sizes played the Manhattan clubs that were a hallmark of swank 1940s and ‘50s night life, places like the Copacabana, the Latin Quarter, El Morocco and the Mermaid Room. He remembered Ava Gardner dancing barefoot to his Latin songs and Edward G. Robinson asking him to play Viennese waltzes. As television infiltrated more American households, he appeared on shows hosted by Milton Berle, Jackie Gleason and Kate Smith. In his telling, his    lounge career had many origins. In one story, the hotelier Leona Helmsley, who had heard him play “I’m Just Wild About Harry”  —   she had been married to the real estate magnate Harry Helmsley  —   told him, “I’ll break your fingers if you don’t become my house pianist. ” He soon began playing the Park Lane. Mr. Fields is survived by his wife, Ruth, who confirmed his death, along with a son, Mark a daughter, Diane Shaffran a stepdaughter, Penny Dechowitz a stepson, Peter Dechowitz seven grandchildren and two  . He and Ruth, 14 years his junior, lived for the last half century in a tidy apartment that did not have a piano. On those occasions when he needed to play for a visitor, as he did when a New York Times reporter showed up in May 2015, he would take an elevator upstairs to a neighbor’s apartment. “You think I need to practice  —   at my age?” he said.",0
9437,"Tapper: Buzzfeed Trump Russia Report ’Irresponsible,’ ’I Would Be Upset About It Too’ ’We Did Not Publish It’ - Breitbart","During CNN’s coverage of   Donald Trump’s press conference on Wednesday, anchor Jake Tapper stated that it was “irresponsible” of Buzzfeed “to put uncorroborated information on the Internet. I can understand why   Trump would be upset about that. I would be upset about it too. It’s why we did not publish it, and why we did not detail any specifics from it, because it was uncorroborated, and that’s not what we do. ”  Tapper said, “At the beginning of the press conference, Sean Spicer, who’s going to be the White House Press Secretary, suggested that both Buzzfeed and CNN published this dossier full of uncorroborated rumors. That’s not true. That’s false. CNN never did that. We never provided even one detail from that dossier, except this morning when I said, that there was reason to believe that one detail that had been out there because of Buzzfeed was false, involving Trump’s attorney Michael Cohen. So, that conflation whether it’s because Sean Spicer misunderstood, or some other reason, that’s not true. CNN did not do that. ” He continued, “What we did was, say, in our reporting yesterday that broke the story, that the intelligence chiefs  —   intelligence chiefs of the United States when they briefed President Obama Thursday and   Trump on Friday, provided, in their briefing to these two leaders about Russian into the US 2016 election, two pages of a synopsis, and the synopsis was, in part, based on information in that dossier that was uncorroborated and the intelligence chiefs had not yet run to ground, but they believed that the source of the dossier was credible and his sources were credible. And they believed that: A. The   and the president should know that the Russians were claiming they had compromising information on him, and two, that the Russians were claiming that there were contacts between the Trump camp or Trump orbit and the Russian government or the Russian orbit during the campaign. And that information was provided. No one has disputed that that   dossier was in the presentation, and that  —   I’m sorry that   synopsis was in the presentation by the intelligence chiefs to   Trump, to President Obama. We have been asking now, for more than half a day, for several, several hours before we went with the story, for a comment from the Trump campaign. ” Tapper further stated, “And when Mr. Trump went after our own Jim Acosta, saying he’s fake news and he isn’t going to call for him, what I suspect we are seeing here is an attempt to discredit legitimate, responsible attempts to report on this incoming administration with irresponsible journalism that hurts us all, and the media going forward should keep that in mind. So, that’s one, just to get that out of the way. ” Tapper concluded by saying of Buzzfeed’s story, “It’s irresponsible to put uncorroborated information on the Internet. I can understand why   Trump would be upset about that. I would be upset about it too. It’s why we did not publish it, and why we did not detail any specifics from it, because it was uncorroborated, and that’s not what we do. We are in the business of sussing out what is true and what is false. ” (  Real Clear Politics) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0
9438,‘Hamilton’ and Heartache: Living the Unimaginable - The New York Times,"Oskar Eustis bounded into the middle of the square yellow carpet at the center of the small theater, ready to deliver his welcoming remarks, and stood in the only place he could: next to a coffin. Mr. Eustis, the exuberant    artistic director of the Public Theater and arguably the most admired theater executive in the country, was in his element: It was late September, opening night of a production of “Hamlet” from the branch of the Public that takes dramas to prisons and homeless shelters. The play began. Mr. Eustis’s eyes welled up. There were tears when the ghost of the dead king cries out to his son, Hamlet tears when Hamlet laments that he has “lost all my mirth” tears through “To be or not to be,” the speech in which Hamlet considers ending his life. “Watch ‘Hamlet’ tonight with this in mind,” Mr. Eustis had urged over dinner just before the show, seated at his regular table at the Public’s restaurant, photos of his family arrayed on the shelves overhead. “Three years before he wrote ‘Hamlet,’ Shakespeare’s only son died. ” Mr. Eustis, whose theater oversees Shakespeare in the Park, had long known about the possible connection between the playwright’s grief and his play, but it had new and unwanted resonance. His    son, Jack, took his own life nearly two years ago. Now, Mr. Eustis, with his family, faces the kind of   for which there can be no preparation. How to hold on and move forward at the same time. What it means to be a public figure with a private grief. How he thinks about the work he does and the shows he sees. The tragedy coincided with a time of extraordinary success in Mr. Eustis’s professional life: The Public was the Off Broadway birthplace of two groundbreaking new musicals, “Fun Home” and the     hit “Hamilton. ” Those very shows are propelled by tragic losses. But his is a life of theater, and immersing himself in theatermaking is the only path he knows to take. “It is the way I move in the world,” he said. “It feels like the place for me to work it out. ” SIX WEEKS AFTER HIS SON DIED, Mr. Eustis returned to work. He invited the Public’s employees to meet him in the Library, the theater’s new restaurant space, and began to talk. “You guys all know what happened, and what I’m going to do now is tell you my story,” he recalled saying. “And for 45 minutes, I told them the story. I said: ‘Now this means that you know what I think. It’s not a taboo subject  —   we can talk about it when we need to  —   but you never have to talk about it, because now we have. ’” Mr. Eustis is burly and bearded, with a generous hug and an easy cry. Cheerleader and counselor, impresario and guru  —   he will push and prod in a rehearsal room for greater clarity, deeper character, more truth. And then, come opening night, he will climb atop a bar or a table and dole out praise in poetically turned phrases that are somehow both sincere and superlative. “He cares about theater as deeply as anyone I’ve ever met  —   this idea that you sit in the dark with a group of strangers and something galvanizing happens,” said Thomas Kail, the director of “Hamilton,” who this season will direct his third show at the Public. “That ritual of going to the theater is just part of his ethos and his soul, and you feel like you are a part of that when you sit in the theater with him. ” As deft with Shakespeare as it is with contemporary drama, the nonprofit Public is a magnet for star performers (Anne Hathaway and Daniel Radcliffe, to name two) and laureled writers (coming soon: Stephen Sondheim). Its Astor Place headquarters, renovated under Mr. Eustis’s watch, is alive and aglitter, night after night. Mr. Eustis’s sharp sense of what works onstage and his obvious affection for artists and artistry are why the playwrights affiliated with the Public  —   one of the nation’s most storied theaters  —   have embraced him so ardently since his arrival in 2005. Richard Nelson, whom Mr. Eustis has encouraged to pursue a stunningly intimate series of plays chronicling dinner table conversations at two family homes, describes Mr. Eustis as “a life force” and credits him with “an extraordinary sense of trust and collaboration with a playwright,   in my experience. ”   Parks, the Pulitzer   author of “” lauds Mr. Eustis for “a kind of generosity that is otherworldly, that is enormous, that is spiritual. ” The theater world is an emotional community pain is expressed and discussed and honored. But still, figuring out how to talk about his loss has been difficult for Mr. Eustis, who ultimately agreed to answer questions about his experience, and how it affects his thinking about theater and the challenges facing the Public, in a series of interviews over the last six months. An early test came at Jack’s school, Saint Ann’s in Brooklyn Heights, where Mr. Eustis had been teaching a class about the Public Theater itself. Two weeks after Jack died, he decided to return to the classroom. “I knew it was going to be one thing or the other  —   it was either within five minutes I was going to have to get out of there, or I would find out what I did find out, which is that I loved being there, and I still feel that way,” he said. “The kids  —   you could feel they wanted to be there for me, which was so moving. ” He has leaned heavily for support on his wife, Laurie, and daughter, Kyle. As he has turned to the theater, Laurie has taken up writing poetry, and Kyle, 25, has begun directing. “Laurie and Kyle and I are struggling with this together, and the main thing we have is our support for each other,” he said. The family is often at the theater together all three of them attended that “Hamlet” opening. “It’s extraordinary how they navigated their way,” said Jeanine Tesori, the “Fun Home” composer. “They really are there to bear witness at openings and closings, often with very painful material to sit through, and yet, here they are, part of the circle. ” AN MP3 ARRIVED by email, hours after Jack’s death. It came from   Miranda, a new arrival to the Public fold. It was a demo recording of “It’s Quiet Uptown,” the song from “Hamilton” describing Alexander Hamilton, and his wife, Eliza, as they grieve the death of their    son, Philip: “There is nothing you can say,” Mr. Miranda recalled thinking. “And yet, I had a song about this. So I wrote to him saying, ‘If this is useful, then lean on it, and, if not, delete this email. ’” Mr. Eustis and his wife found it useful. “Every line of ‘Quiet Uptown’ feels like it’s exactly correct to my experience,” Mr. Eustis said. “It was the only music we listened to for a long time, and we listened to it every day, and it became a key thing for the two of us. ” There is a part of “Hamilton” that Mr. Eustis still finds unbearable, in the opening number, when a rapid description of Alexander Hamilton’s childhood includes the lyric “Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide,” which is choreographed with a brief pantomime of the death. “From the moment it happened in rehearsal, I’ve turned away,” he said. “I’ve never looked at it. ” But Mr. Eustis and Mr. Miranda both recall something else, too: The grieving father’s reaction to a line of comic relief that, in the show’s libretto, is uttered by Thomas Jefferson immediately after “It’s Quiet Uptown”: “Can we get back to politics?” “For me, the beautiful thing about ‘Quiet Uptown’ is, it serves a ritualistic function  —   it takes us into the grief, and then it takes us out of it,” Mr. Eustis said. “And there’s nothing, there’s no other ritual that I know of, that can do that for me. ” Mr. Miranda still remembers hearing Mr. Eustis’s instinctive response. “I’ll treasure that laugh forever,” he said. “It was a big belly laugh of getting to stop crying. ” MR. EUSTIS NOW FACES BIG DECISIONS, about his career and his institution, a $41    operation with 170   staff members. He is wise enough to know that making those decisions while in the middle of a   tragedy is not a good idea. But still, they loom. He is midway through a contract with the Public that expires in 2018, so he must decide in the    future whether to ask the board to extend his tenure, or to do something else (he especially loves teaching, which he does regularly at the Bread Loaf School of English in Vermont and at New York University). He has enormous support. “I hope he sticks around forever,” said Arielle Tepper Madover, the chairwoman of the Public’s board. He also has ever more ambitious dreams and is excited about seeing them through. Presenting consistently excellent work and cultivating new voices, yes, but also expanding the Public’s audience. His biggest, craziest idea  —   more a longstanding hope than a plan  —   is to make much of the theater’s programming free, knowing that free shows attract audiences younger and more diverse than those that charge for tickets. “People who tell you that there’s not economic barriers to people participating in the theater are just not telling you the truth,” he said. “There are huge economic barriers. ” The notion of free tickets is not as wild as it sounds the Public, of course, already makes most tickets to its summertime Shakespeare in the Park series available free. And the Public is largely financed by philanthropy, not ticket sales. The Public has begun offering free tickets to the first preview of all of its shows, and it now has plans to expand the experimentation. “We’re going to take another big step next season,” Mr. Eustis said. “And I’m telling you, if we start being able to give away our tickets for free in an indoor space, and balance our budgets, and run financially successful seasons, it will be a big earthquake in American theater. ” He is also pushing to extend the reach of the Public’s programming, and its ethos, beyond Astor Place. He has become an evangelist for Public Works, the Labor Day weekend musicalizations of classic plays that combine a handful of professional actors with hundreds of amateur performers from across the five boroughs. Theaters in Dallas, Detroit and Seattle are adopting the program, often using productions created by the Public, but with their own casts, and Mr. Eustis, enamored of the democratic ideals implicit in the casting, and the diversity of the audiences that result, is eager to see it spread further. Joe’s Pub, the Public’s   nightspot, has begun producing a performance series in Houston and is about to do the same in Seattle. The Public has announced a partnership with the Donmar Warehouse, a highly regarded nonprofit in London, and is talking about what Mr. Eustis calls a possible “multilevel collaboration” with the National Theater in London, which is a pioneer in presenting stage productions on cinema screens. And the Public is taking to festivals in Hong Kong and Australia Mr. Nelson’s latest plays, about an upstate New York family called the Gabriels, dramatic works that Mr. Eustis believes can give global audiences insight into contemporary American life. Next: The theater, which has had considerable financial ups and downs over the years, must decide whether to initiate a major fund drive for new rehearsal facilities and more. “Hamilton” is a help  —   the theater gets 5 percent of the profits and 1 percent of the adjusted gross from the production  —   but not as much as “A Chorus Line” was years ago, and Mr. Eustis is determined that the Public not become dependent on a single show. “What I want to do,” he said, “is make sure that this theater is set up so that not just its existence, but its mission, is permanent. ”  IMPERMANENCE, AS IT HAPPENS, turns out to be an inescapable theme in the work Mr. Eustis oversees. It’s not just in “Hamilton,” but also in “Fun Home,” which closes with the suicide of Alison Bechdel’s father, and Mr. Nelson’s play this fall, “What Did You Expect,” which opens with a story about men debating whether to tell a family that its little girl has drowned. Mr. Eustis is not without a sense of humor about his theatrical appetites. Earlier this year  —   arriving at the   party for “Head of Passes,” a play that ends with a scorching cri de coeur from a mother railing against God after the tragic death of her children  —   Mr. Eustis blurted out, “Get used to seeing plays like this. ” He finds himself marveling at the frequency of heartbreaking loss in the plays he has chosen to present. “Is it just suddenly I’m noticing that all of these plays that I’m trying to do have this quality,” he said, “or have they been there and I’ve just not seen it?” At the same time, Mr. Eustis, who attends theater five or six nights a week, finds himself newly angered by shows that he believes present an overly rosy picture of life  —   particularly on Broadway, where the triumph over tragedy is a staple. He is infuriated, he says, by “narratives that imply that children are always reunited with their parents, that dead people aren’t really dead. ” “What I see over and over is narratives that are absolutely lying to the audience about how life works out, and they are lying to the audience for the sole purpose of making the audience feel good,” he said. “That’s not what art is for. ” “The mission that I feel like I have is to figure out how you can tell the truth about how tragic and unfair life actually is without destroying hope,” he added. As the   anniversary of his son’s death approaches, and a new season at the Public gets underway, Mr. Eustis is seeking hope himself. He is thrilled with the success of “Twelfth Night,” this year’s Public Works endeavor pleased with the audience appetite for Mr. Nelson’s Gabriels plays and looking forward to a revival of “Plenty,” which opens Oct. 20. One sign of change: This past spring, when “Dear Evan Hansen,” a   musical imagining the aftermath of a high school student’s suicide, was playing Off Broadway at Second Stage, the show’s director, Michael Greif, persuaded the Eustises not to come, thinking elements of the show would just be too painful. Now the show is heading to Broadway, and, at the moment, the Eustises are planning to be there opening night. Mr. Eustis said that he has also recently noticed a change in his own behavior: He has found himself straightening up and organizing his office and home. “It feels like the start of a new phase, where we’re actually thinking about the future,” he said. “Not happy. But a step. Almost two years in. ” And then, trying to sum up how he is doing, he turned, as he always does, to theater for words. He quoted “Angels in America,” the Pulitzer   epic by one of his closest friends, Tony Kushner, in which Prior Walter, a character with AIDS, converses with an angel, declaring, toward the play’s end, “I want more life. ” “I didn’t mean to be quite so grandiose, but that’s actually kind of what it’s feeling like,” Mr. Eustis said. “It’s feeling like I want to be alive. ”",0
9439,FBI Sources: INDICTMENT in Hillary Investigation is ‘LIKELY’ | Top Right News,"E-mail 
by Jason DeWitt | Top Right News 
Things just went from bad to much worse for Hillary Clinton as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) expands its investigation of the corrupt Clinton Foundation. 
Fox News Channel’s Bret Baier reported stunning developments about the Foundation investigation from two sources inside the FBI — including that an “indictment” is “likely” is the case. 
Baier reveals five important new pieces of information in these two short clips. 
The details: 
1. The Clinton Foundation investigation is far more expansive than anybody has reported so far and has been going on for more than a year. 
2. The laptops of Clinton aides Cherryl Mills and Heather Samuelson have not been destroyed, and agents are currently combing through them. The investigation has interviewed several people twice, and plans to interview some for a third time. 
3. Agents have found emails believed to have originated on Hillary Clinton’s secret server on Anthony Weiner’s laptop. They say the emails are not duplicates and could potentially be classified in nature. 
4. Sources within the FBI have told Baier that an indictment is “likely” in the case of pay-for-play at the Clinton Foundation, “barring some obstruction in some way” from the Justice Department. 
5. FBI sources say with 99% accuracy that Hillary Clinton’s server has been hacked by at least five foreign intelligence agencies, and that information have been taken from it. 
Transcript: 
BRET BAIER: Breaking news tonight — two separate sources with intimate knowledge of the FBI investigations into the Clinton emails and the Clinton Foundation tell Fox the following: 
The investigation looking into possible pay-for-play interaction between Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Foundation has been going on for more than a year. Led by the white collar crime division, public corruption branch of the criminal investigative division of the FBI. 
The Clinton Foundation investigation is a, quote, “very high priority.” Agents have interviewed and reinterviewed multiple people about the Foundation case, and even before the WikiLeaks dumps, agents say they have collected a great deal of evidence. Pressed on that, one sources said, quote, “a lot of it,” and “there is an avalanche of new information coming every day.” 
Some of it from WikiLeaks, some of it from new emails. The agents are actively and aggressively pursuing this case. They will be going back to interview the same people again, some for the third time. 
As a result of the limited immunity deals to top aides, including Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson, the Justice Department had tentatively agreed that the FBI would destroy those laptops after a narrow review. We are told definitively that has not happened. Those devices are currently in the FBI field office here in Washington, D.C. and are being exploited. 
The source points out that any immunity deal is null and void if any subject lied at any point in the investigation. 
Meantime, the classified e-mail investigation is being run by the National Security division of the FBI. They are currently combing through former Democratic Congressman Anthony Wiener’s laptop and have found e-mails that they believe came from Hillary Clinton’s server that appear to be new, as in not duplicates. 
Whether they contain classified material or not is not yet known. It will likely be known soon. All of this just as we move inside one week until election day. 
Baier gives more details to Fox News Channel’s Brit Hume. 
Transcript: 
BRET BAIER: Here’s the deal: We talked to two separate sources with intimate knowledge of the FBI investigations. One: The Clinton Foundation investigation is far more expansive than anybody has reported so far… Several offices separately have been doing their own investigations. 
Two: The immunity deal that Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson, two top aides to Hillary Clinton, got from the Justice Department in which it was beleived that the laptops they had, after a narrow review for classified materials, were going to be destroyed. We have been told that those have not been destroyed — they are at the FBI field office here on Washington and are being exploited. . 
Three: The Clinton Foundation investigation is so expansive, they have interviewed and re-interviewed many people. They described the evidence they have as ‘a lot of it’ and said there is an ‘avalanche coming in every day.’ WikiLeaks and the new emails. 
They are “actively and aggressively pursuing this case.” Remember the Foundation case is about accusations of pay-for-play… They are taking the new information and some of them are going back to interview people for the third time. As opposed to what has been written about the Clinton Foundation investigation, it is expansive. 
The classified e-mail investigation is being run by the National Security division of the FBI. They are currently combing through Anthony Weiner’s laptop. They are having some success — finding what they believe to be new emaisls, not duplicates, that have been transported through Hillary Clinton’s server. 
Finally, we learned there is a confidence from these sources that her server had been hacked. And that it was a 99% accuracy that it had been hacked by at least five foreign intelligence agencies, and that things had been taken from that… 
There has been some angst about Attorney General Loretta Lynch — what she has done or not done. She obviously did not impanel, or go to a grand jury at the beginning. They also have a problem, these sources do, with what President Obama said today and back in October of 2015… 
I pressed again and again on this very issue… The investigations will continue, there is a lot of evidence. And barring some obstruction in some way, they believe they will continue to likely an indictment. 
Hillary is facing massive consequences for her misdeeds, which voters would do well to consider before electing her president. 
PLEASE SHARE this if you agree Hillary belongs in a prison cell…NOT the Oval Office… ",0

Captagon is the addictive drug used by some of the numerous terrorists, jihadis, mercenaries and Western-backed rebels in Syria – including Al-Nusra and ISIS . Captagon (aka fenethylline, Biocapton or Fitton) was first produced in 1961 as a mix of amphetamine and theophylline. It became illegal in most countries in 1986 due to WHO pressure. Being a stimulant, it fuels feelings of euphoria, fearlessness and power, gives you an energy rush before the crash, and numbs emotions and empathy.These are of course all qualities which are ideal for soldiers who want to kill and not feel the pain. Apparently, captagon is playing a significant role in the Syrian War , both economically and in terms of its mood-altering ability. Multiple drug busts have occurred since 2010. Last year in November 2015, Turkish authorities confiscated 11 million Captagon pills (1800 kg and worth an estimated US$220 million) that were destined for Syria . Last month in October, Lebanese police seized 3.5 million Captagon pills that were headed for Saudi Arabia. Is the drug another avenue by which the Western alliance (NATO-US-UK) is trying to influence and control the outcome of the Syrian War ? Drugs and Soldiers: A Connection Old as Humanity Itself There is long history of tyrants, monarchs, despots, army generals and military leaders feeding drugs to their soldiers to enhance their performance. A very early example is Alexander the Great, whose army relied on the opium poppy plant for its morphine (and from which modern heroin is made). The morphine allowed his soldiers to walk and fight with grave injuries and achieve astonishing feats of endurance. In more recent history, in both world wars, American and German soldiers used amphetamines during battle. Historian Norman Ohler recently released a book “Der totale Rausch” (which literally translates as “Total Rush”) which exposes the Nazi use of drugs during WWII. This article quotes Norman:“… the (German) soldiers used Pervitin, a German product patented in 1937 that contains methamphetamine, which is known today as crystal meth. It was freely available as a medicine until 1939. “In Berlin, it became a drug of choice, like people drink coffee to boost their energy. People took loads of Pervitin, across the board. The company wanted Pervitin to rival Coca Cola. So people took it, it worked and they were euphoric …”The Nazi rise to power was fueled by their military industrial complex (funded by Americans and Wall St.), including IG Farben , their powerful pharmaceutical conglomerate which was the ancestor of Big Pharma today. Hitler himself was said to be addicted to opiates:“The first thing I wanted to see were the personal notes of Hitler’s personal physician Dr Theodor Morell –… these notes were quite elaborate, describing how he treated Hitler over the years, including things like “injection as always” and “Eukodal,” which is a strong opiate.” The opium poppy, source of morphine and heroin, used by Alexander the Great for his soldiers Captagon: The Force Behind Crazed ISIS Fighters Can captagon explain, at least to some degree, the crazed attitude of ISIS fighters? We don’t have definitive proof, but we do have a collation of many anecdotes and quotes indicating that the amphetamine-based drug is a factor. The Washington Post collected these ones:“You can’t sleep or even close your eyes, forget about it,” said a Lebanese user (featured in this BBC documentary ) “and whatever you take to stop it, nothing can stop it.”“I felt like I own the world high.”“Like I have power nobody has. A really nice feeling.”“There was no fear anymore after I took Captagon.”“So the brigade leader came and told us, ‘this pill gives you energy, try it,’” he said. “So we took it the first time. We felt physically fit. And if there were 10 people in front of you, you could catch them and kill them. “You’re awake all the time. You don’t have any problems, you don’t even think about sleeping, you don’t think to leave the checkpoint. “It gives you great courage and power. If the leader told you to go break into a military barracks, I will break in with a brave heart and without any feeling of fear at all — you’re not even tired.”The world was first horrified by the cruelty of mercenaries like ISIS who were defiling historic sites and beheading prisoners. Was some of that barbarism due to drug-induced states? Where is the Captagon Being Made? The Cuban based website Prensa Latina released a short article in 2015 claiming that “according to experts, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) began production of Captagon in 2011 in a laboratory in Bulgaria and it is now manufactured elsewhere in the world. “Part of the profits from the illegal trade in Captagon, experts say, is used to finance armed extremist groups that are trying to overthrow the Syrian government led by President Bashar al-Assad.”The article, however, does not mention which “experts” it got its information from. While this fits in with what we know of NATO – a US-controlled, aggressive military organization which invades sovereign nations like Libya on the flimsiest of pretexts to gain territory and control for the New World Order – there still needs to be more research done to determine the source of captagon. Other sources suggest it is being produced in Sunni rebel areas. Captivated by Captagon The word captagon, coincidentally, is a mix of the words “captivate” and “Pentagon”– interesting given the addictive nature of the drug and the potential US role in providing it. War and drugs have a long history together, whether it be because the soldiers are been fed drugs by their commanders, or because the war itself is being fought over the land and fields that grow the drug-producing plants (Vietnamese and Afghani heroin, Latin American cocaine). In his article CIA Drug Wars Could Explain Why Syrian ‘Rebels’, ISIS Violence Fuelled by Captagon Pills , journalist Patrick Henningsen writes that:“the deliberate strategic dispensing of potent narcotics in a paramilitary, insurgency theater … is a common technique employed by US intelligence agencies … more often than not, these drugs are the X-factor which fuels the extreme violence we see, and it’s used to terrorize local populations and produces more extreme graphic imagery for western media consumption.“The result: it aids in the generation of western fear, and public calls for Washington & Co to “step-up” its military activity in the region – in order to “keep us safe” in cozy America.

9442,Pentagon Seeks Another $6 Billion for Overseas Troop Deployments,"'Budget Amendment' for More Troops in Iraq, Afghanistan   
The Pentagon has announced it will file a “budget amendment” seeking another $6 billion in funding for the current fiscal year to pay for additional overseas troop deployments above and beyond what was already in the budget for this year. 
The $6 billion request comes as an “urgent” request from the Pentagon, and would pay for additional ground troops in Iraq, the additional troops left in Afghanistan by stalling the drawdown, and to pay for escalated airstrikes around the world. 
Pentagon Comptroller Mike McCord says the hope is to get the White House to approve submitting the request to Congress before next week’s election, with an eye at getting it added to the latest emergency spending bill, expected before early December. 
These “emergency” funding bills are the main way to get around spending caps, with Congress deliberately funding the Pentagon only for a portion of the year with money that, by the cap’s reckoning, was the whole year’s budget, then slipping “emergency” bills in afterwards to pay for the rest of the year, while pretending the caps still exist.

9443,"Mike Pence Almost Gets ""Smoked"" in Public","Topics: Politics , Hillary Clinton , Donald Trump , 2016 Presidential Election , tobacco , Mike Pence Friday, 28 October 2016 
Vice-Presidential hopeful Mike Pence, who hails from Indiana, almost got metaphorically ""smoked"" in public the other day, but escaped narrowly. 
As this election season heats up, so does the scrutiny befalling the candidates involved. Tapes have been leaked of Donald Trump claiming he could do whatever he wants to women due to his superstar status, a slew of accusations have been hurled at Hillary Clinton (from e-mails, to bribery, and even intimations of murder). No one has yet to mention Tim Kayne, but I'm sure he'll catch up. 
It was Indiana's Mike Pence who was up on the firing line last Wednesday when a group of journalists began questioning him about the clean-living Christian's stance on tobacco and its place in society. 
Pence was asked how he, given his religious fervor, could align himself with the tobacco industries and lobby for them, knowing full well the illnesses and personal devastation they cause. His response as usual, was articulate and well measured as he gave the crowd a ""quick reality check"" about the real dangers of smoking. The man of faith, and apparently not science, stated that ""despite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn't kill."" 
Pence then went on to explain that ""2 out of every 3 smokers does not die"" from a smoking-related illness and that he was ""satisfied with the fact that a mere 33% of smokers died due to smoking. ""We're big on basketball in Indiana, and any hoops fan,"" he elaborated, ""would be happy with a point guard who could sink 2 out of 3 from three-point range."" 
The Hoosier then stated that ""9 out of 10 smokers do not contract lung cancer,"" another statistic he took pride in. Grinning, Pence offered another sports analogy: ""That's batting .900. Heck the best baseball players in the world can barely hit three hundred. They get paid 'bigly' if I may quote the next president of the country, Donald Trump, to fail 7 out of ten times. We succeed against cancer 9 out of 10 times. To quote Trump once again, I'm not 'unproud' of that."" 
Pence went on to say that he was also not ""unproud"" that his state has the 7th highest smoking rate in the country. ""In fact, only a rugged and durable, pioneering and wholesome state, with such strong people in it could handle such a high proliferation of smoking and second-hand smoke. It says a great deal about the people of Indiana."" 
When asked about the fact that 17% of pregnant women in his state were active smokers (nearly double the national average), Pence responded: ""Studies show that moderate to heavy tobacco intake during pregnancy has a few very positive effects. The first of which is that the size of the child, especially the head, is much smaller. This makes for an easier birth and causes less trauma to the mother. Children who have been exposed to tobacco in utero have much more energy and excitability - not to be confused with ADD or ADHD - and because they do not fixate on things they have an amazing ability to multi-task. In general, they are well-suited to the manual labor and work much longer hours in general due to being unencumbered by weighty intellects."" 
In response to statistics that demonstrate lower birth weights and higher rates of infant mortality, Pence responded by saying, ""I'm a man of faith, a man from a wholesome, small-town background. I grew up with a cornfield in my backyard watching my mother and father build everything together. We had chickens and pigs out back. Every day as I grew up, I saw the harshness of nature: some pigs lived some pigs died. Some chickens lived and some chickens died. One night our dogs gave birth. There was a runt in the litter, badly deformed. My dad, a Korean War veteran knew that the only merciful thing to do was to take it out back and put it down. What kind of life would it have had? I feel as if that applies to us as humans as well. It's all in God's plan, who lives and who doesn't live. As for me, it's God first, politics second and The Republican party third."" 
Then, showing his political rhetoric skills, Pence then shifted gears to conclude. ""After all, the relevant question is, what is more harmful to the nation, second-hand smoke or back-handed big government disguised in do-gooder healthcare rhetoric?"" He ducked into his limousine and left it up to the people to decide. Make Chris Dahl's  ",0

9445,"NY Times Op-Ed: Deport Americans, Invite Migrants - Breitbart","America belongs to immigrants because immigrants make the nation more powerful, says a former Wall Street Journal writer who is now working for the New York Times. [Immigrants produce more babies, work harder, create more jobs, and have more ideas, claims the revealing column by   Bret Stephens:  I speak of Americans whose families have been in this country for a few generations. Complacent, entitled and often shockingly ignorant on basic points of American law and history, they are the stagnant pool in which our national prospects risk drowning  …     Bottom line:   real Americans are screwing up America. Maybe they should leave, so that we can replace them with new and better ones: newcomers who are more appreciative of what the United States has to offer, more ambitious for themselves and their children, and more willing to sacrifice for the future. In other words, just the kind of people we used to be  —   when “we” had just come off the boat  …     Stephens’ article includes several    statistical flubs, plus grotesque generalizations, and regurgitated   agitprop. For example, Stephens says the United States “is a country of immigrants” even though roughly 84 percent of people living in the United States were born in the United States  —   despite the   huge influx of immigrants over the last few decades. Similarly, Stephens treats immigrants as a uniform mass, as if he believes that migrating   gang members are as beneficial as are   inventors. But the article’s main feature is the progressive view that people  —   Americans, foreigners,   whatever  —   should be selected by the   State to serve the State’s   progressive leadership class in D. C. and Wall Street. That view is shared by former President Barack Obama, who told supporters in November 2014 that: Sometimes we get attached to our particular tribe, our particular race, our particular religion, and then we start treating other folks differently. And that, sometimes, has been a bottleneck to how we think about immigration.  If you look at the history of immigration in this country, each successive wave, there have been periods where the folks who were already here suddenly say, ‘Well, I don’t want those folks’  —   even though the only people who have the right to say that are some Native Americans. That   view allows Stephens to ignore the Declaration of Independence which declared that people’s rights came from a higher source than government:  “We hold these truths to be   that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. ” The elitist view also allows Stephens to welcome mass immigration because  —   not despite, but because  —   it hugely distorts the nation’s economy in favor of elite business leaders and major cities. Mass immigration spikes profits and stock values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by   and   employees, drives up real estate prices, reduces   investment, increases state and local tax burdens, and sidelines marginalized Americans and their families.  Mass immigration also imposes the social “diversity” which helps Stephens and his allies as they claim a Darwinian right to fragment, divide and rule Americans without any rude interference by the voters on November 8, 2016. In contrast, President Donald Trump won his 2016 campaign on a promise to put Americans first. He told his inauguration listeners that he would hold to a policy of “Buy American, Hire American,” he has started enforcing immigration laws and is pushing for a “ ” immigration plan that would raise the productivity and wealth of Americans.

9448,"In China, Property Frenzy, Fake Divorces and a Bloating Bubble - The New York Times","SHANGHAI  —   Zheng Ruizhen counted herself among the last holdouts on Lufeng Road. Even as   sprang up in recent years to surround her dilapidated home, Ms. Zheng, a    schoolteacher, and her husband, Sun Guojian, held firm. He grew up there. Her school was a   bicycle ride away. They raised their son there, though he eventually grew so tall that his head grazed the ceiling of his cramped room. When city officials pushed them to sell, they said no. Then came China’s latest property bubble  —   a frothy surge in prices that could have global repercussions if it pops. In August, an unremarkable piece of land around the corner from Ms. Zheng sold for nearly $2, 000 a square foot, a national record and nearly three times the average land price in Manhattan. Local officials grew more insistent and threatened to tear down their bathroom. Finally, they relented, and Ms. Zheng’s husband signed away the home for a price to be determined later. Then, on Oct. 9, Mr. Sun died of a heart attack, something Ms. Zheng said was perhaps influenced by stress over the pending demolition of their home. Now, as she grieves, she is waiting to hear how much the Shanghai government will offer in compensation  —   but however much that is, she knows it will not be enough for her to be able to afford to live anywhere close to Lufeng Road. Said Ms. Zheng: “I never expected housing prices in Shanghai would get this high. ” China is in the midst of a dizzying housing bubble. Shanghai’s average housing price is up nearly   from a year ago, with prices in major cities like Beijing and Guangzhou not far behind. Chinese consumers are rushing to buy homes before the government steps in with restrictions. When rumors swept through Shanghai that the government would require homeowners to pay more in taxes and down payments to buy additional properties, many couples filed for divorce so that one partner could still be treated as an independent buyer. China has experienced housing booms and busts before. And fervor for real estate among the wealthiest Chinese has already spread far beyond the country’s borders, from Long Island mansions to disused ranches in Texas  —   many to get their money out of the country. But economists warn that the current boom on the Chinese mainland could be extra difficult to resolve: It comes with a growing amount of   debt.   household loans  —   mostly mortgages  —   have doubled as a share of total official bank lending this year. They accounted for about 40 percent of all new loans in August, contrasted with just 20 percent at the start of the year. The value of new home loans as a percentage of all housing sales has surged to a record high. The loans  —   largely a byproduct of a flood of Chinese lending to keep the economy growing  —   are helping the affluent, the middle class and low earners who have dreamed of owning a home, while investors and speculators are piling in, too. Underground lenders  —   those who operate outside the formal banking system using a variety of new platforms  —   are also helping to feed the boom. Last month, economists at the Bank of China warned in a report that worsening asset price bubbles were adding to a frothy market that could result in trouble. The day before, Wang Jianlin, a politically connected property and entertainment magnate who is one of the country’s richest people, told CNN that China property was “the biggest bubble in history. ” That could be bad news for the global economy. Many economists estimate that housing and related areas  —   like construction, cement manufacturing or furniture making  —   account for roughly   of China’s economic activity. But if the bubble pops, that support could disappear quickly. Chinese officials, apparently mindful of the 2008 American housing bust, appear to be aware of the risks of a   property bubble. But some economists worry they will be too slow to rein it in. “The risk is that the government is late in cooling the market, the rally spreads to more areas, pushing up household leverage and construction activity, pushing the bubble bigger, which is then followed by a bigger downward correction,” said Tao Wang, the head of China economics at UBS in Hong Kong. Local regulators are already trying to cool things down. In the last few weeks, local authorities have accelerated efforts to tighten housing markets in up to 20 Chinese cities, according to economists at China International Capital Corporation, an investment bank. But in many cases these steps have only added to the rush, as home buyers move in while they can. By her account, Zhang Xia and her husband have enjoyed a happy marriage. Then the rumor swept the city that Shanghai authorities would make it harder for couples with one home to buy more. On a recent Monday, Ms. Zhang, a    resident of Shanghai’s Huangpu area, and her husband sat waiting at a local marriage registry office to file for divorce. Shanghai officials continue to deny that they will limit house buying by couples, but Ms. Zhang is among many who do not believe them. “We know the government said this is a rumor, but they also said that a few times before, when the rumor actually came true,” Ms. Zhang said. “Some people even said the fact that the government said it’s a rumor means it’s going to be true. ” Shanghai, China’s financial capital, is at the heart of the property boom. Demand there is so intense that developers now commonly require sizable deposits of cash just to join a lottery to buy a new apartment. Only holders of winning numbers will be offered the chance to buy a unit. One flashy new development in central Shanghai charges a refundable 200, 000 renminbi, or $30, 000, to enter its lottery. “In Shanghai now,” said Wang Jie, a sales manager there, “it’s not like you can buy an apartment just because you have money. ” Back on Lufeng Road, the recently widowed Ms. Zheng and her neighbors try to go about their lives despite the boom going on around them. Men and women play   near a   house, one of a number of dwellings along the road in various states of disassembly, like a row of rotting teeth. Stray dogs sunbathe and alley cats hunt around piles of red bricks and wooden beams scattered on the street. In recent months, local officials hung red propaganda banners on people’s housing extolling the benefits of selling out. “No more hesitation means no more disappointment,” reads one. Says another: “Requisition and compensation are lawful. Smart alecks will regret it later. ” “Look at those banners,” Ms. Zheng said, shaking her head. “It’s almost like the Cultural Revolution once again. ” Earlier, local officials told Ms. Zheng that the land where her home stands would be used to build supporting facilities for the   complex of   built by China Vanke, the country’s largest property developer. “They said that when people who live in the   in Vanke look down, the view from their windows is our ugly roofs,” she said. “So they have to get rid of us. ”",0
9449,Anxiety and Worry Increase Risk of Heart Disease,"You Are Here: Home » Latest Posts » Anxiety and Worry Increase Risk of Heart Disease Anxiety and Worry Increase Risk of Heart Disease Prev post Next post 
by Ana Sandoiu – MNT 
Anxiety is a serious health concern affecting a large part of the American population. Now, new research indicates that health anxiety might increase the risk of heart disease. 
Health anxiety might increase the risk of heart disease, research finds. In the United States, anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness, affecting 40 million adults, or 18 percent of the population. 
Anxiety is a known risk factor for heart disease . Previous research indicates a connection between depression and anxiety and the risk of coronary heart disease . 
A meta-analysis found that anxious people have a 48 percent higher risk of dying from a heart problem. 
Heart disease is the leading cause of death among Americans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), killing 365,000 people in 2014. New research suggests that the consequences of health anxiety are also serious and the condition should be treated properly. 
Health anxiety describes a patient’s excessive worrying over having a serious illness, and seeking medical advice in the absence of a physical disease. 
Patients with health anxiety misread physical symptoms as serious illnesses, and they often seek repeated medical help for the same issues. In its most intense form, health anxiety becomes hypochondria . Health anxiety and heart disease 
Researchers led by Line Iden Berge, from the Helse Bergen hospital in Bergen, Norway, examined the link between health anxiety and heart disease. The results were published in the online journal BMJ Open . 
Berge and team worked with participants in the Norwegian Hordaland Health Study (HUSK). This long-term study followed participants over a period of 12 years, and it was a collaboration between the National Health Screening Service, the University of Bergen, and local health services. 
The 7,052 participants were born between 1953-1957. For the study, they had to answer questions about their health, lifestyle, and educational achievement. 
Between 1997-1999, they underwent blood tests, weight, height, and blood pressure measurements. Participants were also asked to report their anxiety levels using the Whiteley Index. Scores above 90 percent were considered to be anxiety cases. 
Over the entire study period, 234 participants, or 3.2 percent of the entire cohort, had an ischemic incident – either a heart attack or acute angina . Health anxiety raised heart disease risk by 73 percent 
During follow-up, twice as many participants with health anxiety developed heart disease, compared with those who did not report any anxiety. Around 6.1 percent of health anxiety cases developed ischemic heart disease (IHD), compared with 3 percent of non-cases. 
Because participants had been enrolled in a nationwide research project monitoring heart disease, their heart health was monitored extensively. The national program, entitled “Cardiovascular diseases in Norway,” was carried out between 1994-2009, so the study could track participants using national hospital data and death certificates up to 2009. 
After adjustments for established cardiovascular risk factors, researchers found a 73 percent increased risk of developing IHD among cases with health anxiety. 
Even considering established risk factors for IHD, such as smoking, high cholesterol , and education, health anxiety was a high risk factor for IHD. The risk of IHD also increased proportionally with the level of reported anxiety; the stronger the symptoms of health anxiety, the higher the risk of IHD. 
Regarding gender, a very slight increase in IHD risk was noticed in women with health anxiety over their male counterparts. Trust your heart 
Caveats to the results of the study include the fact that this is an observational study, telling us little about the cause-and-effect relation between anxiety and IHD. 
Also, health anxiety is often associated with other mental health issues, such as general anxiety and depression, so the different types of anxiety and ways in which they increase the risk of heart disease can be difficult to differentiate. “[Our study] further indicates that characteristic behavior among persons with health anxiety, such as monitoring and frequent check-ups of symptoms, does not reduce the risk of [coronary heart disease] events,” the researchers write. 
On the contrary, keeping the body in a constant state of alert might further increase the risk of heart-related incidents. 
This puts both patients with anxiety and doctors in a difficult position. Telling an anxious patient that their anxiety is not a symptom of heart disease might help, but on the other hand, informing them that health anxiety might induce heart disease over time could cause them even more anxiety. 5 Herbs That Relieve Anxiety

9450,Donald Trump's 'New Deal for Black America' Has 3 Points We Should All Be Able to Agree On,"Share on Twitter The Wildfire is an opinion platform and any opinions or information put forth by contributors are exclusive to them and do not represent the views of IJR. 
Donald Trump told an invitation-only audience of 700 supporters in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Wednesday that if elected, he will offer a “new deal for black America.” 
He rolled out the plan wrapped in three promises . 
“I want to talk about how to grow the African American middle class and to provide a new deal for black America. That deal is grounded in three promises — safe communities, great education, and high paying jobs.” 
Of those promises, he said, in part: 
1. Safe Communities 
""Making our communities safe again will be a priority. You walk to the store to buy a loaf of bread maybe with your child and you get shot. We got to stop it. 
[T]he law will be applied fairly, equally and without prejudice. We will also police our streets—have to keep our streets safe. 
The problem is not the presence of police but the absence of police. We need really a great group of people to keep you safe, to keep us all safe."" 
2. Education 
""School choice is at the center of my plan. And by the way we’re going to terminate common core and bring education local. 
My proposal redirects education spending to allow every disadvantaged child to attend the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice."" 
3. Jobs 
""When we stop off-shoring to low wage countries, we raise wages at home meaning rent and bills become instantly more affordable. 
I will also propose tax holidays for inner city investments, a new tax incentive to get foreign companies to relocate in blighted American neighborhoods. 
I will also pursue financial reforms to make it easier for young African Americans to get credit to pursue their dreams in business and create jobs in their communities."" 
Trump has repeatedly asked America's blacks “what do you have to lose?” On Wednesday, he once again explained why minorities should reject Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. 
“We keep electing the same people over and over and over and they keep coming back to the African American community and the Hispanic community and they keep talking about what they’re going to do and they don’t do it and four years later you see them again.” 
Based on a CBS News poll released last week, Trump has a steep hill to climb with less than two weeks to go — he received support from just 4 percent of likely black voters. ",0

In remarks given to the media on Thursday, President Donald Trump said he did not know whether or not if the use of the “mother of all bombs” on an ISIS stronghold in Afghanistan would send a message to North Korea.  He added, however, North Korea would be “taken care of” and emphasized his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping. President Donald Trump said Thursday that he does not know whether the U. S. military’s use of the   “mother of all bombs” in Afghanistan will send a message to North Korea, but he said “the problem” with that country “will be taken care of,” regardless. “I don’t know if this sends a message,” he replied. “It doesn’t make a difference if it does or not. North Korea is a problem. It’s a problem that will be taken care of. I will say this  —   I think China has really been working very hard. I have really gotten to like and respect President Xi.

9453,"Wary of Trump Effect, Republicans Hope for Split Tickets - The New York Times","YORK, Pa.  —   Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, has never met Charles Kress, but he desperately needs him. Mr. Kress, 62, will vote for a Democrat this November for the White House, he said, no matter what. He is also planning to vote for Mr. Toomey’s  . “Sometimes you have to keep in office the ones who make the deals,” Mr. Kress said as he watered the flowers in front of York’s Unitarian church. Republican senators like Mr. Toomey who are running in swing states  —   about six, and enough to tip the balance of power in the Senate  —   need voters who would reject Donald J. Trump to nonetheless pull the levers for the party’s other candidates in November. In some districts, House Republicans will need them, too. Mr. Trump’s convincing sweep of the primaries in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island on Tuesday did little to assuage concerns about his standing with swing voters in November. His victory speech included a bracing broadside against Hillary Clinton’s playing the “woman card. ” And he continues to trail his opponents, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, among Republican women. But   voters in federal races have become increasingly rare over the last two decades, hitting a low in 2012, when only 10 percent of them divided their votes between parties. That was down sharply from 1972. The ranks of   voters have expanded along with the rise in partisanship and its attendant rancor in Congress. “There is no doubt that, over all, the era of polarization and   above and beyond idiosyncratic factors  —   that has to lead to a drop in ticket splitting,” said Richard Born, a professor of political science at Vassar College and an expert on congressional elections. “Democrats and Republicans alike, as part of the polarization phenomenon, are more consistently liberal or conservative across issues,” Mr. Born said, “as are the candidates themselves, meaning less likelihood of ticket splitting. ” Even in Pennsylvania, a state that has elected a senator from a different party than the presidential candidate it chose seven times since World War II, ticket splitting has decreased drastically in recent elections. “That is probably Toomey’s worst problem,” said G. Terry Madonna, the director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin and Marshall College. It is also a problem for the Republican senators Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Mark S. Kirk of Illinois and Rob Portman of Ohio. Republicans in Washington are increasingly worried for them. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and other Republicans are openly urging elected officials in their party to focus largely on local issues and their role in bipartisan legislation, and to refrain from tying themselves to the top of the ticket should the nominee be Mr. Trump. “I think we have to go out and make a case,” said Representative Scott Perry, a Republican who represents the York area. “People don’t split their tickets because they don’t have a choice. It’s because they do. I think those people are going to need to be convinced. ” While a polarizing presidential candidate is considered very difficult for Republican senators to overcome in swing states, there may be a silver lining for them. Some Republican donors are quietly plotting to dismiss Mr. Trump and instead pour their money into Senate races where they believe Republicans can be saved, as a check and balance to a Democrat sitting in the White House for the next four years. “The prospect of Trump at the top of the ticket could create an exodus of donors away from the presidential and toward Senate and House races,” said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist. “The potential is there for a concentration of effort and resources geared toward Senate races that Chuck Schumer and his Senate Democrats may not have been counting on. ” Mr. Schumer, a New Yorker who is poised to become the next leader of the Senate Democrats, says good luck with that. “If there was ever a national election, this is it,” he said. “They can run from their nominee, but they can’t hide. ” Ticket splitting over the last five decades has occurred most often among moderate Democrats who have supported a Republican for president but voted for Democrats for Congress. Some voters have viewed this as a recipe for compromise and balance, while others have been repelled by the Democratic candidates running for the top job. The three strongest years of ticket splitting between presidential and House voting in the last five decades, according to American National Election Studies survey data, were 1972, when 30 percent of voters did it 1980 (28 percent) and 1984 (26 percent). Similar studies show the same trend for Senate races. In all three of those elections, a Republican won the White House by a landslide at a time when registered Democrats significantly outnumbered Republicans in the overall population, and when considerably more incumbent House members were Democrats. The 1928 election provides a history lesson in what can happen when a candidate, rather than the political mood, drives ticket splitting. That year, Al Smith, the governor of New York, became the Democratic nominee. It was not extreme rhetoric like Mr. Trump engages in, which has repelled some Republicans, that held Mr. Smith back with voters. Mr. Smith was a Roman Catholic, opposed Prohibition and was a symbol of modern urbanism. And that combination drove off rural and moderate Southern Democrats, who outnumbered Republicans significantly, contributing to his loss to the Republican Herbert Hoover. While Republicans made a net gain of eight seats in the Senate that year, demonstrating that ticket splitting does not help all senators attached to the party of a wildly unpopular candidate, many Democrats still voted along party lines for the House and Senate. In 1996, when it was clear that Bill Clinton would trounce Bob Dole, Republicans encouraged voters to stick with their party in the down ballot, and Newt Gingrich, then speaker of the House, cautioned his members to distance themselves from Mr. Dole. Mr. Gingrich came up with a parallel House agenda much as Speaker Paul D. Ryan is now doing, and he told members to run on it. “It saved the House and the Senate for them,” said Mr. Born, the Vassar professor. “Trying to localize the campaigns paid off. ” But Republican ticket splitters may make an alternative choice that is equally damaging to Mr. Toomey’s prospects. “I might just skip the whole thing,” said Kristi Peyton, 46, a Toomey fan who offered her views of Mr. Trump  —   “disaster,” “bully” and “unattractive”  —   over crabs at Captain Bob’s in Railroad, a small town near York. “Where Republicans can really get hurt is not so much that people vote Democrat for Congress but that they don’t show up at all,” Mr. Born said. “This is where the Republicans are scared to death. ”",0
9455,BBC Under Fire for ‘Transgender Diaries’ Program Aimed at Children as Young as Six,"October 31, 2016 BBC Under Fire for ‘Transgender Diaries’ Program Aimed at Children as Young as Six 
The BBC has come in for a slew of criticism for broadcasting a program aimed at children as young as six, which tells the story of a school boy as he prepares to transition to a girl. 
The program, broadcast on CBBC, follows a boy as he attempts to access drugs to delay the onset of puberty, as part of the process for having an eventual sex change, the Mail on Sunday has reported. 
MPs and campaigners have questioned the appropriateness of telling such a story to young children, who may be easily confused by what they are watching. One mother, commenting on the program on the parenting site Mumsnet, said her daughter had questioned her gender identity and asked her “anxiously, if that means she was a boy”. 
But the BBC has defended the show, insisting that it was merely trying to “reflect true life”. It said there was enough context for children to understand the theme. 
Norman Wells, a family campaigner disagreed. He said: “It is irresponsible of the BBC to introduce impressionable children as young as six to the idea that they can choose to be something other than their biological sex.”",0
9456,Donald Trump Says His Company Will Do ‘No New Deals’ During His Term - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —     Donald J. Trump said late Monday night that “no new deals will be done” by his real estate business while he is in the Oval Office, a promise that appeared meant to address ethical concerns about conflicts of interest between his elected position and his real estate empire. But the move is unlikely to satisfy critics, including the government’s official ethics office, who have said the only way for Mr. Trump to avoid such conflicts is to entirely divest his stake in the Trump Organization. Mr. Trump said on Twitter just after 11:30 p. m. that he would leave his businesses before his inauguration and that his grown sons, Eric and Donald Jr. along with other executives, would manage them. He added, “No new deals will be done during my term( s) in office,” and promised to hold a news conference soon to discuss the plans. Mr. Trump had originally said, in an earlier Twitter post, that he would announce his business plans during a news conference on Dec. 15. But officials with the transition confirmed on Monday that the news conference had been delayed. Now, he will not hold it until January  —   most likely before his inauguration and after a vacation at his    resort in Florida, officials said, confirming a report in Bloomberg News. The officials said building a cabinet had consumed more of Mr. Trump’s time than expected. And they said he needed more time to decide how to deal with the large, iconic real estate holdings that are part of the global Trump business. Even if Mr. Trump and his children stop making new deals, the Trump Organization already has a large basket of investments and branding deals that present apparent conflicts of interest around the world. In Washington, Mr. Trump and his family recently opened the Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue  —   in a building rented from a federal government agency that Mr. Trump will soon oversee. Mr. Trump is also   of a hotel in Las Vegas, where a dispute with workers is pending before the National Labor Relations Board, which Mr. Trump will also oversee by appointing its members. The Trump Organization has business partners in the Philippines, Brazil, India, Turkey and other nations where Mr. Trump himself has acknowledged a conflict of interest over real estate projects. At the same time, he will need to deal with top officials in Turkey over matters like the fight against the Islamic State and the continued crackdown on dissidents there after an attempted coup. Mr. Trump, at least so far, has not given any hint that he intends to sell these assets or sever ties with business partners he says he will instead turn over management of the operations to his children. His family continues to personally profit from the investments, which ethics experts said could present a conflict of interest even if Mr. Trump and his family do not enter new deals. Richard W. Painter, a White House ethics adviser under President George W. Bush, said Mr. Trump’s latest Twitter posts meant very little in terms of eliminating conflicts. “It makes no sense to say ‘no new deals,’” Mr. Painter said, questioning why the   would make an announcement just before midnight on a Monday. “What is he talking about?” “Is he going to continue to borrow money from foreign banks like Bank of China? That is a deal,” Mr. Painter said. “Or collect rent from foreign   companies? That is a deal. Will he still be hiring people, or having people stay in his hotels?” The news conference this week would have been Mr. Trump’s first since the election. He had announced last week it on Twitter, promising to “discuss the fact that I will be leaving my great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country. ”",0
9457,GOP Rep Jordan: Replacement Plan ’Obamacare In a Different Form’ - ’We Didn’t Tell the Voters’ We Would Do That - Breitbart,"On Wednesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” House Freedom Caucus member Representative Jim Jordan ( ) touted legislation he will be introducing later in the day to just do a clean repeal of Obamacare, and criticized the replacement plan as “Obamacare in a different form. Because we didn’t tell the voters we were going to repeal Obamacare, but keep some of the Obamacare taxes. We didn’t tell the voters we’re going to repeal Obamacare, but keep and extend Medicaid expansion. And we certainly didn’t tell the voters we’re going to repeal Obamacare, but start a new entitlement. ”  Jordan said, “[L]et’s do this right, and, more importantly, let’s do what we told the voters we’re going to do. That’s why today I’ll be introducing legislation which just says clean repeal. Let’s vote on the exact same thing, 15 months ago, every single Republican in the House, every single Republican in the Senate voted on. We put it on President Obama’s desk. Of course, he vetoed it. But let’s put that same legislation on President Trump’s desk, and then work on the replacement model that will actually bring down the cost of insurance. I don’t think the plan they introduced yesterday is going to bring down the cost for working class and middle class families. ” He stated of the current replacement, “Every conservative group out there is opposed to this legislation, because, as I said yesterday and others have said, I think it’s Obamacare in a different form. Because we didn’t tell the voters we were going to repeal Obamacare, but keep some of the Obamacare taxes. We didn’t tell the voters we’re going to repeal Obamacare, but keep and extend Medicaid expansion. And we certainly didn’t tell the voters we’re going to repeal Obamacare, but start a new entitlement. ” He further said that he doesn’t think the current replacement “could pass today.   …     So, this needs to be changed in a dramatic way for it to have a chance to pass, in my judgment. ” Jordan continued his criticism of the current replacement, arguing, “[T]his is what Americans hate. We campaign on one thing, and then we get here and say, oh, we can’t do what we campaigned on. We really can’t do a clean repeal, and then replace it with something that’s going to bring down the costs. We’ve got to mush it all together and do some different form of Obamacare. That’s what the American voters hate. Let’s do what we told them we were going to do. Let’s do what they sent us here to do and what they expect us to do. ” Jordan also stated, “Even if you don’t have the CBO score, look at the four corners of the document and read what it says. I think it’s not going to bring down the cost of premiums for working class and middle class families. That’s why I oppose it. I think it’s Obamacare, as I’ve said, Obamacare in a different form. That’s why I oppose it. But it would also be nice to have a score. I can’t believe the score won’t be high because, when you’re extending and expanding the Medicaid expansion, when you’re starting this new entitlement called advanceable refundable tax credits, when you’re doing all that, I’ve got to believe that’s a cost to the federal government. But apart from that, just look at what it does, it keeps the federal government in control of how this thing works, the exchange and that sort of thing. That’s the wrong approach because we’ve seen how bad Obamacare has been for the American people the last six years. ” Jordan added his replacement plan “would put in place policies that will bring back affordable insurance. That’s the big problem right now. If people can afford the premiums, they can’t afford the deductibles. Fewer choices, higher costs is what Obamacare has given us. We want those policies, like expanded health savings accounts, interstate shopping, easier formation of association health plans, tax deductibility on the individual market side so that you begin to equalize treatment for folks who get their insurance in the individual market with those who get   plan insurance. So, that’s what we want to do. Those kinds of things will bring down the cost. And most importantly, you get out all the regulations which drove up the cost of insurance. Never forget what Obamacare did. It set mandates, taxes, and regulations, drove up the cost of insurance, told every American, you have to buy it, and if you don’t, there’s a penalty. That’s what we have to get away from. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0

9459,"UK Terror Threat Raised to Highest ’Critical’ Rating, Army Could be Deployed to Streets","The British government has raised the country’s terror threat level to “critical” indicating the military may be deployed onto UK streets. [The move  —   following an emergency meeting of Cabinet Office Briefing Room (COBR)  —   takes the UK to its highest terror threat level for the first time in a decade.  In June 2007, the level was raised from ‘Severe’ indicating a “an attack is highly likely” to ‘Critical’ indicating “an attack is expected imminently” following the discovery of multiple car bombs at locations outside nightclubs and airports. The Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC) which in turn reports to security services such as MI5, is responsible for the elevated threat level following the Monday night terrorist attack in Manchester that killed 22 and injured over 100 people. The threat level had previously been downgraded to ‘Substantial’ meaning an attack is a “strong possibility” between July 2011 and August 2014. It was then raised to Severe in response to events in Iraq and Syria, coinciding with a high point of territorial gain by the Islamic State. The United Kingdom has five terror levels: Low, Moderate, Substantial, Severe, and Critical. Since the implementation of the new levels in 2006, the rating has never dropped below Substantial. Reports emerging from the UK press also suggest around 5, 000 members of the UK’s military may be deployed onto British streets in order to deter attacks. Unlike its European counterparts, Britain has little tradition of deploying the military on domestic soil. The last serious deployment was in 2003, when tanks were stationed at Heathrow Airport in an attempt to disrupt a passenger airliner bomb plot. Around 450 troops were also deployed at this time. Prior to that, the last time a major British Army contingent was deployed in Britain was during the Troubles, when Irish Republican terrorists routinely targeted British population centres, one of which included the central Manchester area just five minutes from the arena where Ariana Grande’s concert ended in terror on Monday night. During the Troubles, the British army deployed 21, 000 troops.",0

9461,Jason Chaffetz Just Got Hit With An Ethics Complaint For FBI Hillary Smear Campaign,"Comments 
The Democratic fury at FBI Director James Comey’s frustratingly decision to throw a wrench into election with his obviously partisan decision to reignite the “email” non-scandal keeps growing by the day. 
It’s becoming clear that Republican Congressmen, horrified at the way their candidate slides lower and lower in the polls, put undue pressure on Comey to give them an official, public, and entirely unnecessary “update” on the new emails that are – let’s reiterate – not to or from Hillary Clinton, are not related to her private email server, and were found on a cellphone belonging to Anthony Wiener, as part of a separate investigation into his illicit sexually-charged chats with a minor. 
In light of that, the Democratic Coalition Against Trump has filed an ethics complaint against Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) with the Office of Congressional Ethics: 
“Representative Chaffetz, in an ill-planned partisan attempt, released information that compromised the integrity of the FBI, when he irresponsibly tweeted out that the case investigating Secretary Clinton’s emails had been reopened, when in fact it had not been. 
Members of Congress are elected to make our country a safer, better place- not to use their power to work with leaders such as Comey in a partisan fashion. I hope that both are held accountable for their actions.” 
The complaint refers to this extremely misleading tweet, which fundamentally misrepresents what actually occurred. FBI Dir just informed me, “The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.” Case reopened 
— Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 28, 2016 
Jason Chaffetz and the rest of the self-appointed inquisitors on the House Oversight Committee have wasted millions of dollars in taxpayer funds and Congressional time prosecuting fruitless investigations against the character of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. It’s high time we held them all accountable for abusing their power for undemocratic hit-jobs against their political opponents.",0
9462,An Army Captain Takes Obama to Court Over ISIS Fight - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   A    Army officer on Wednesday sued President Obama over the legality of the war against the Islamic State, setting up a test of Mr. Obama’s disputed claim that he needs no new legal authority from Congress to order the military to wage that deepening mission. The plaintiff, Capt. Nathan Michael Smith, an intelligence officer stationed in Kuwait, voiced strong support for fighting the Islamic State but, citing his “conscience” and his vow to uphold the Constitution, he said he believed that the mission lacked proper authorization from Congress. “To honor my oath, I am asking the court to tell the president that he must get proper authority from Congress, under the War Powers Resolution, to wage the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria,” he wrote. The legal challenge comes after the death of the third American service member fighting the Islamic State and as Mr. Obama has decided to significantly expand the number of Special Operations ground troops he has deployed to Syria aid rebels there. Mr. Obama has argued that he already has the authority he needs to wage the conflict against the Islamic State under the authorization to fight the perpetrators of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, enacted by Congress shortly after the attacks. That argument is controversial because the Islamic State is at odds with the leadership of Al Qaeda and its affiliate in Syria, the Nusra Front. Critics contend that the administration is stretching the Sept. 11 authorization too far by applying it to an organization that did not exist in 2001 and that operates far from Afghanistan. The administration has countered that its position is legitimate because the Islamic State used to be a Qaeda affiliate in Iraq during the Iraq war. In an April 2015 speech, Stephen Preston, then the top Pentagon lawyer, argued that the fact that Al Qaeda splintered after the death of Osama bin Laden did not mean that the authority to keep fighting each successor faction came to an end. Administration officials have also said the fight against the Islamic State is covered separately by the 2002 authorization President George W. Bush obtained from Congress for the invasion of Iraq, although they are not relying on it. The administration has asked Congress to enact new authorization for using military force against the Islamic State, but lawmakers have not acted on that request. They have, however, passed military appropriations bills that earmark funds for the effort against the Islamic State, which could suggest that lawmakers have acquiesced to the executive branch’s theory. Captain Smith’s lawyers are David Remes, who has represented many Guantánamo detainees in habeas corpus lawsuits, and Bruce Ackerman, a Yale Law School professor who published a column in The Atlantic last year arguing that the war against ISIS was illegal and that a serviceman ordered to fight in it would have standing to challenge it in court. “We want to get this back on the agenda,” said Mr. Ackerman, calling the precedent Mr. Obama is setting a “turning point” for whether constitutional checks and balances on a president’s ability to initiate a new war at his own discretion will survive. Current and former administration officials have said that in 2014, when confronted by the Islamic State’s rapid conquest of Iraqi territory, Mr. Obama’s advisers presented him with a choice: he could say that bombing ISIS was part of the existing war, or he could say it was a new war. Each theory, they told him, was defensible, but each had its own downsides. Mr. Obama decided to go with the first one  —   that the Islamic State campaign was part of the existing  . 11 war  —   because he believed that immediate intervention was necessary to halt a disaster but that the   House of Representatives was too dysfunctional to vote on any war authorization within 60 days. That was important because the War Power Resolution, a   law, says presidents must withdraw deployments into “hostilities” after 60 days if Congress has not authorized the operation to continue. In 2011, Mr. Obama’s air war intervention in Libya, which lasted longer than 60 days without congressional authorization, prompted criticism  inside and outside the administration. Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law School professor who has criticized the administration’s use of the 2001 war authorization to cover the Islamic State but is not involved in the suit, said the case was significant because it could overcome a major hurdle to getting a court to review that theory. But Mr. Goldsmith said Captain Smith faced many other hurdles, including precedents that suggest that when Congress appropriates money for a conflict it has implicitly authorized it. He also predicted that if a court did rule that the conflict was illegal, Congress would authorize the fight to continue  —   perhaps giving it broader scope than Mr. Obama has wanted. “We’re in a terrible equilibrium where Congress doesn’t want to step up and play its part in this military campaign and so the president has basically gone forward and done what he thinks he needs to do,” Mr. Goldsmith said. “It would be a lot better for everyone, including the president, if Congress got more involved. ”",0

Trump’s    Jared Kushner, is ceasing its print edition, just shy of its 30th year as a weekly paper. The issue printed this last Wednesday was the paper’s last, Joseph Meyer, chairman and chief executive of Observer Media, the paper’s parent company, said in an interview on Friday. The decision will eliminate the use of New York in the paper’s title  —   its website is Observer. com  —   and signals an end of an era when The Observer served as a fixture of Manhattan reporting and a training ground for scores of journalists now in senior positions in the media world. It also comes as newspaper coverage of New York City is being trimmed. The Wall Street Journal will publish its final Greater New York section on Saturday, a result of widespread cuts at the paper. The Daily News, whose staff has already shrunk, announced a new round of layoffs this week. The New York Times is rethinking its own Metro coverage as the paper seeks to lure global audiences. Mr. Meyer, in the interview, said the decision to close The Observer’s print edition was a natural outgrowth of the paper’s shift toward a national audience and the decline in print advertising that has afflicted the industry. Mr. Meyer, who is Mr. Kushner’s    said the decision had been two years in the making and was not related to Mr. Trump’s election this week. Mr. Kushner, who is aiding Mr. Trump’s presidential transition, was not available to comment. Now focused on real estate coverage and provocative opinion, The Observer’s heyday came during the   tenure of its former editor, Peter W. Kaplan, whose tutelage in   reporting and arch prose became a rite of passage for a generation of prominent newspaper and magazine journalists. Mr. Kaplan died in 2013. The publication was founded in 1987 by the banker Arthur L. Carter. Its early editors included Graydon Carter, now the editor of Vanity Fair, and Susan Morrison, now the articles editor of The New Yorker. Under Mr. Kaplan, the newspaper originated the “Sex and the City” column by Candace Bushnell that later became a hit television series. Mr. Meyer said the Observer’s coverage of New York City politics and culture would continue, adding that the paper had open positions for new reporters and editors. Mr. Meyer said that no journalists would be laid off as part of the change to all digital. But several freelance writers at the newspaper were dismissed on Friday, along with one of the paper’s   editors. Staff members said that several positions, vacated by layoffs or resignations, had remained unfilled. Observer. com received 5. 6 million unique visitors in September, nearly twice its audience from the year before, according to statistics from comScore. Mr. Meyer declined to disclose print circulation figures. Mr. Kushner’s purchase of The Observer in 2006, when he was 25, created tension between him and the paper’s journalists, some of whom later accused Mr. Kushner of interfering in coverage. But Ken Kurson, the Observer’s current editor, wrote on his Facebook page on Friday that he welcomed the move to digital, citing a rise in online readership and advertising. “This has been a week of incredible tumult, for our country, and now for this small business,” Mr. Kurson, who is close to Mr. Kushner, wrote in a post. “Who knows what the future holds, for me or for the USA or for Observer. ” “But I can tell you this much for sure,” Mr. Kurson added. “Observer’s future is brighter than it’s ever been. ”",0
9465,Who Haunts U.K. Ghost Trains? Railway Enthusiasts - The New York Times,"The phrase “ghost train” conjures up eerie, fantastical images: a spectral locomotive barreling through the night, passengers doomed to ride the rails forever. In Britain, ghost trains are real  —   but they’re more of a bureaucratic curiosity than a Halloween nightmare. They are scheduled passenger trains that hardly anyone actually rides, running infrequently at obscure hours and stopping at stations that almost no one uses. They might operate only once a week or in only one direction. Other than a lonely crew member or two, they are often completely empty. Why do they even operate? Believe it or not, to save money. Railway companies would rather not serve these routes at all, because they generate too little traffic. But if the companies discontinued the routes completely, they would be obliged under British law to formally abandon the lines, and that’s a very costly,   and legally complex business. The only way to avoid that trouble and expense is to maintain some passenger service on the line, even if only on the barest of   schedules. So the railways run the ghost trains, officially called parliamentary trains, just to satisfy the law  —   and don’t care whether anyone rides them. And it shows. At the stations where they originate, the railway may not bother to list parliamentary trains on the departure board or announce which platform they will use until the last minute, resulting in a mad dash by the rare intrepid traveler hoping to board. One of the more accessible ghost train experiences leaves at 11:36 a. m. on weekdays from Paddington Station in London, bound for West Ruislip over the    line. Its platform is hidden in a far corner of the station, behind a temporary construction wall. On a recent run, there were just six passengers. One was Steve Hamshere, who had come to London from Berkshire, about 50 miles away, specifically to ride that train. “This line was built by the Great Western Railway and was the main line to Birmingham up until the 1960s,” Mr. Hamshere said. These days the Birmingham trains go a different way, and    is kept open mainly as a quiet place where new drivers can practice away from other traffic. Obscurity and the relative difficulty of catching the parliamentary trains makes them strongly alluring for railway enthusiasts, who make a hobby out of riding as many as they can. Two ghost train fans, Liz Moralee and Tim   even run a website for fellow devotees. “It is great to have a whole train to yourself,” Ms. Moralee wrote in an email. One of her strangest trips, she said, was to the Teesside Airport railway station, one of the   in Britain. The parliamentary train there makes one round trip a week, on Sundays, and only 16 passengers used the station in all of 2015. The   walk from there to the airport terminal it was built to serve may be why. “It is far from convenient for anyone using the airport, unless they fancy a   trek,” Ms. Moralee said.",0

9467,German Parents Taken to Court for Refusing to Send Their Son to a Mosque,"German Parents Taken to Court for Refusing to Send Their Son to a Mosque 
Andrew Anglin Daily Stormer October 28, 2016 
You all thought I was cr y when I started pushing the idea that the women and even some of the liberal cucked men of Europe are actually pushing for forced Islamization of Europe on purpose. 
You were all like “no no no, liberals are just stupid, they think they’ll integrate, or that there can be coexistence somehow – they just don’t get it.” 
Well, where are we now? 
RT : 
Parents of a German teenager may face a trial and fine for âtruancyâ after refusing to allow their son to go to a local mosque on a school field trip out of fear that it would lead to his âindoctrinationâ by Islamic radicals. 
The story broke in mid-June, when parents of a 13-year-old student opposed the idea of their son visiting a mosque in the northern German town of Rendsburg, reportedly organized as part of a geography class. 
In a letter to the class teacher quoted Â by the NDR, the teenâs father argued that his son would be âindoctrinatedâ in the mosque. He went on to say that âfor years we have been hearing reports about religiously-motivated violence connected with Islamic people.â 
A local education authority subsequently fined the couple a total of âŹ300 ($328), referring to school regulations and regional laws which include penalties for truancy. 
When the parents opposed the fine, their case was forwarded to Peter Mueller-Rakow, a local prosecutor, who will decide whether or not to proceed with a court trial, Spiegel reported on Wednesday. 
The parentsâ lawyer, Alexander Heumann, argues that they refused the school trip out of fear for their sonâs âbodily safety.â 
Denying any faith-based motives, he emphasized that the couple do not belong to any religious group, and are of the opinion that ânobody shall be forced into a sacred place against his good will.â 
Heumann himself, however, is a former member of the Alternative for Germany party, an anti-immigrant political group, and was a participant in setting up the âDugida,â a Dusseldorf-based branch of the far-right PEGIDA movement. 
Feminism is the complaint of a woman who doesn’t have a man to tell her what to do. 
The entire goal of feminism is to force an end to feminism. That is why feminists are pushing for Islamization. They want to be told what to do. The immediate goal of their demonstrations is to get manhandled. It is a weird psycho-sexual thing that men couldn’t ever understand and women are unconscious of so incapable of explaining. But I assure you it is there. 
They don’t care about race, because women are incapable of processing philosophical or ideological concepts. The only fact they are able to process – and this is on an emotional, subconscious level – is that their men refused to be men, and have told them to go be men, and that this is causing them extreme distress and blocking their ability to produce children. 
This is what feminism is – women don’t say what they actually want, they express themselves in a way where you’re supposed to interpret their emotional state. When Femen riots naked, what they want is to be physically dominated by men – i.e. raped. 
So they are replacing us with Moslems to fix their current state, which is feminism. 
I told you people this.",0
9468,Oi veh! — New Hitler gets elected,"Other Writers “Racist, misogynist bully.” 
“For Jews, these are worrying times . . . History shows that when bullies take charge, they turn on the Jews.” — The JC Leader, Trump Triumphant. So what now? 
It is not an accusation, merely a statement of fact, to describe Donald Trump as a racist, misogynist bully. That such a man can be elected as President of the United States is deeply chilling. 
For Jews, there is one specific aspect of his ascendency that is so worrying. His campaign was self-consciously antisemitic. 
One of his main themes was that a global elite was conspiring against ordinary Americans. This is not only a classic antisemitic meme; the examples cited by Mr Trump were all – every one of them – Jewish, such as George Soros and the President of the Federal Reserve. Anyone who denies this element to Mr Trump’s campaign is living in a self-deluded fantasy. 
Fantasy may be an apposite word. Perhaps the past few decades, when the US preserved a global order that destroyed prejudice rather than cementing it, was merely a short-lived fantasy. 
With our history, that is a desperate prospect. 
Many of us have always looked to the US as a beacon of freedom. When the Third Reich looked unstoppable and Britain stood alone, it was the US that then sacrificed so many of its sons to defeat the Nazis. 
In the Cold War it was the US, through Nato, that ensured the Soviet Union was held in check. 
And in recent years Nato has helped preserve the long-delayed freedom of Eastern Europe from the Warsaw Pact. 
All that is now threatened. 
Mr Trump cites Vladimir Putin as a role model and believes Nato no longer has a purpose. 
The message is clear: far from standing up to an aggressive tyrant, he will willingly acquiesce in that aggression. 
For Jews, these are worrying times. 
We have already been scapegoated by Mr Trump, so it is no supposition to suggest that worse may be to come. 
History shows that when bullies take charge, they turn on the Jews.   One thought on “ Oi veh! — New Hitler gets elected ” Sardonicus says: November 12, 2016 at 4:44 pm 
Yes, very sad. I am still drying my tears. That Americans should elect such a monster makes me want to renounce my citizenship and emigrate to Israel. 
Only trouble is, they don’t want me. My race as a non-Jewish White person is unacceptable to them. I was actually told by a nice Jew at Ben-Gurion airport: “We don’t like White people and are doing our best to genocide them. That’s why we’re flooding your White homelands with millions of Third Word migrants.” 
Yes, it’s a sad situation.",0
9469,"Gold, Silver Action: The Criminals Are Still In Charge","Financial Markets , Gold , Market Manipulation , Precious Metals , U.S. Economy Comex gold manipulation , GLD , mining stocks , silver eagles admin 
Out with the old, in with the old. Wall Street and the Fed wants to make nice with Trump so as soon as he accepted the next Presidency, the market manipulators went to work on pushing stocks higher and gold lower. 
What happened with the threat issued by the media that if Trump were elected the stock market would crash? Yesterday Stanley Drunkenmiller issued a proclamation that he sold gold because inflation was coming. I do not believe that I have EVER come across any reference to the notion that gold in inversely correlated with inflation. Someone must’ve slipped Drunkenmiller some LSD in his scotch. But, then again, Drunkenmiller is part of the Soros family, which means he’s the enemy of the people and the truth. 
The economic thesis connected to Trump is infrastructure spending and inflation generation. The insanely overvalued, over leveraged “infrastructure” stocks like Caterpiller and Terex screamed higher the last few days. But if Trump has his way with his economic ideas, corporate taxes will be cut and the Government will re-do the work Obama did on the infrastructure. Bridges to nowhere funded by more Government debt. 
I’m sure most market participants with at least two brain cells to rub together – which de facto would exclude Larry Kudlow from this human demographic – have figured out that Trump’s game-plan would widen out the Federal spending deficit and further accelerate the issuance of more Treasury debt. It is likely that the Fed will have to monetize some of this new debt issuance. This is the perfect recipe for higher gold and silver prices. 
What is occurring right now in the markets is nothing more than a knee-jerk response by the hedge fund algos to the overt intervention by the PPT (the Fed + the Working Group on Financial Markets). The PPT steps in to get stock and precious metals futures moving in opposite directions and the hedge fund black box computers pile in. 
The massive take-down in gold is designed to make everyone feel better about Trump as the new president. But the price-smashing can only occur in the fraudulent paper gold markets in NY and London. Drunkenmiller is a fan, not surprisingly, of GLD – the quintessential postcard for fraudulent paper gold derivatives. 
Today gold traded flat to up in the physical gold clearing eastern hemisphere markets. It wasn’t until the Comex opened that the real party for the criminal manipulators began. At one point, from 11:30 to noon EST 48,239 paper gold contracts were dumped on the Comex: 
48,239 contracts represents 4.8 million ozs of paper gold – over 150 tons. Close to $6 billion worth of paper gold in 30 minutes. From 11:30 to the 1:30 Comex close EST, a little over 103,000 contracts were sold, representing 10.3 million ounces of paper gold, or 321.8 tons. The U.S. produces about 200 tons annually. Make no mistake, it is no coincidence that this hit on the price gold was gold timed to occur on a Friday holiday after the rest of the world had shut down their trading systems and went home for the weekend. This is standard modus operandi for the criminals running our system. 
The Comex vaults are reporting a little over 2 million ounces available for delivery. If an imbalance between the futures and the underlying available physical commodity were this wide in any other CME market, the Government regulators would be cracking down on it immediately, no questions asked. Why is gold different? The gold and silver markets are the most manipulated markets in the world and the same people doing the manipulation will kept in place under Trump. 
The good news is that the physical accumulation going on in the eastern hemisphere will accelerate next week with the lower price of gold. This always occurs. This will be the catalyst that will put a floor under the ability of the western elitists to push gold much lower. 
I personally bought some physical gold this morning via Bitgold and reloaded some call options on some high quality large cap mining stocks and added to positions in my existing junior mining stock portfolio. The subscribers to my Mining Stock Journal were given my gameplan last night, including some names of other high quality mining stocks that have been beaten up and are overdue for big bounce.

9470,Trump Officially Wins Michigan Amid Calls for a Recount - The New York Times,"Donald J. Trump was officially declared the winner of the presidential election in Michigan on Monday amid calls for a recount there and in two other states. Mr. Trump, a Republican, defeated Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, by 10, 704 votes in the state, or less than a quarter of a percentage point, the Michigan Board of State Canvassers announced, nearly three weeks after the Nov. 8 election. The results, should they hold, bring his Electoral College vote total to 306, well beyond the 270 needed to win. Mrs. Clinton has 232. Michigan contributed 16 electoral votes to Mr. Trump’s total. News of his victory in Michigan came as Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, said she planned to call for a recount there after pursuing recounts in two other states. Wisconsin officials approved a timeline for a recount on Monday, and Ms. Stein is also suing for a recount in Pennsylvania, according to The Associated Press. Mr. Trump won all three states by a combined total of about 100, 000 votes.",0
9471,Fort Lee Officials Recall Chaos and Turmoil as Lanes to Bridge Were Closed - The New York Times,"NEWARK  —   Almost as soon as Chris Christie was sworn in as governor of New Jersey in 2010, his administration began an elaborate courtship of Mayor Mark Sokolich of Fort Lee. There were private tours of ground zero for the mayor and his cousins, free tickets to the governor’s box at Giants football games, a ceremonial flag from the World Trade Center site, and money for firefighting equipment and shuttle buses in Fort Lee. The governor went to Fort Lee to tape a national television talk show at the town’s high school invited the mayor to his Christmas cocktail party and had him over for an intimate lunch in the private dining room at the governor’s mansion, which Mr. Sokolich called “a   item for a   mayor. ” The wooing continued into 2013, when Mr. Christie was up for   and hoping that a broad victory would propel him to the front of the pack of contenders for the 2016 Republican nomination for president. He was gathering endorsements from Democratic mayors like Mr. Sokolich. The mayor said he could not go that far. It would take a few months, and what federal prosecutors in a courtroom here called an extraordinary act of political retribution, before Mr. Sokolich would begin to suspect that, as he recalled on Tuesday, “someone must be mad at me. ” “There was absolutely no plausible explanation” for what happened, the mayor said. As the first day of school dawned in September 2013, two access lanes to the George Washington Bridge were closed, locking Fort Lee in what Mr. Sokolich would call “concrete gridlock. ” And his onetime friends in the Christie administration would not return his calls, texts or emails. Mr. Sokolich took the stand in United States District Court here on Tuesday to tell the story at the center of the prosecution’s case: that Christie administration officials deliberately closed two of three access lanes to create a traffic jam in Fort Lee, all to punish the mayor for refusing to endorse Mr. Christie. It was the first day of testimony in the trial of the two Christie administration officials: Bridget Anne Kelly, a former deputy chief of staff to Mr. Christie, who ran the office responsible for collecting endorsements and Bill Baroni, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which prosecutors say became an arm of Mr. Christie’s   campaign. Mr. Sokolich’s recollection of gifts and favors underscored just how assiduously Christie administration officials used the levers of power to secure endorsements. And while the broad outlines of the lane closings  —   a scandal that ultimately sank Mr. Christie’s presidential ambitions  —   are well known, testimony from the mayor and his police chief offered dramatic details about the chaos in Fort Lee, and the futile efforts of the officials to get relief. “I was begging for someone to help,” Mr. Sokolich said. On the first morning of the lane closings, the police chief, Keith M. Bendul, had just pulled into a Department of Public Works facility to refuel his Ford Expedition when he received an anxious radio transmission from a traffic officer. He was standing near the access lanes to the bridge, and traffic was at a standstill. “I immediately knew it was not going to be good,” the chief recalled on Tuesday. The Port Authority, the bistate agency that operates the bridge, typically informs the Fort Lee Police Department well in advance of any traffic pattern changes, but this time, Mr. Bendul said, there had been no notice. Confused, he began calling his contacts there. “I reached out to everybody I could think of,” he said. Eventually, Mr. Bendul connected with Robert Durando, the general manager of the George Washington Bridge for the agency. Mr. Durando asked the police chief to talk with him, but not in his Port Authority office. Instead, he wanted to meet in a municipal parking lot next door. “I thought it was very weird,” Mr. Bendul said. “I thought it was cloak and dagger. It just struck me as very, very odd. ” Without bothering to change from his golf shirt and jeans, he drove with a deputy into oncoming traffic on the wrong side of the street, sirens blaring. “I was hot,” he said of his demeanor going into the meeting. “Public safety was being compromised. ” Mr. Durando claimed that the lane closings were part of a traffic study, Mr. Bendul recalled. “I told him it was a miserable failure. End it, stop it,” he said, adding that the gridlock was contributing to series of crises: a missing    a patient in cardiac arrest, a car accident and numerous complaints of road rage, among other problems. “I told him bluntly that if anybody dies, I’m going to tell those people to sue him and everybody at the Port Authority,” said Mr. Bendul, who described Mr. Durando as “very nervous. ” Mr. Durando told Mr. Bendul that Mr. Sokolich should contact Mr. Baroni. Before their meeting ended, though, Mr. Bendul recalled one last comment from Mr. Durando. “He told me if anybody asked if this meeting occurred, he would deny it,” Mr. Bendul testified. Mr. Sokolich called Mr. Baroni, whom he considered a friend by then he had a photo of the two of them on his office credenza. But his call went unanswered. The next day, upon seeing “a repeat performance” of the previous day’s gridlock, Mr. Sokolich began beseeching Mr. Baroni with an increasingly urgent set of messages. “I’ve got to talk to somebody about this new policy at the bridge it’s truly shutting down Fort Lee,” he said in a voice mail message early that morning, which was played for the jury on Tuesday. “We’re in total gridlock. I’m just trying to figure out who’s mad at me. ” His pleas still unheeded, Mr. Sokolich later texted: “Help please. It’s maddening. ” “The town is ready to revolt,” he implored in another voice mail, before asking once more: “Who’s mad at me?”",0
9472,White House Floats 20 Percent Import Tax on Mexico to Pay for the Wall - Breitbart,"President Donald Trump’s administration is floating the idea of a 20 percent import tax on Mexico to help pay for a border wall on the U. S. southern border. [White House press secretary Sean Spicer discussed the tax with reporters on the way back from Philadelphia after Trump spoke to both houses of Congress.  “If you tax that $50 billion at 20 percent of imports  …     we can do $10 billion a year and easily pay for the wall just through that mechanism alone,” he said, pointing out that an import tax would be similar to other countries. The wall would save money, Spicer explained, by slowing down illegal immigration, and reducing the expenses needed for border enforcement. When asked if the American consumer would suffer as a result of such a tax, Spicer argued that the economy would adjust. “I think what its going to do is lift up the wages of American workers as well,” he said. “Right now we have an influx of cheap labor. Its going to put the American consumer back, net net, to make sure the American workers get lifted up as well. ” Spicer clarified afterwards that he was only offering a proposal. “We’ve been asked over and over again ‘how could you possibly do this, there’s now way that Mexico will pay for it,’” he said. “Here’s one way. Boom. Done. ”",0
9473,New York Times: Apologist for Power,"New York Times: Apologist for Power November 7, 2016 
Special Report: Over the past couple of decades, America’s preeminent newspaper, The New York Times, has lost its journalistic way, becoming a propaganda platform and an apologist for the powerful,   
In recent years, The New York Times has behaved as if whatever the Establishment claims is true must be true, failing to show thoughtful skepticism whether the findings are coming from a congressional report, an intelligence assessment, a criminal investigation or even an outfit as disreputable as the National Football League. 
If some powerful institution asserts a conclusion, the Times falls in line and expects everyone else to do so as well. Yet, that is not journalism; it is mindless submission to authority; and it indirectly pushes many people into the swamps of conspiracy theories. After all, if professional journalists simply ratify whatever dubious claims are coming from powerful institutions, inquisitive citizens will try to fill in the blanks themselves and sometimes buy into outlandishly false speculations. New York Times building in New York City. (Photo from Wikipedia) 
In my journalistic career, I have found both extremes troubling: the Times’ assumption that the authorities are almost always right and the conspiracy theorists who follow up some “what I can’t understand” comment with a patently absurd explanation and then get angry when rational people won’t go along. 
Though both attitudes have become dangerous for a functioning democracy, the behavior of the Times deserves the bulk of the blame, since the “newspaper of record” carries far more weight in setting public policy and also is partly to blame for creating this blight of conspiracism. 
Some of the Times’ failures are well known, such as its 2002 front-page acceptance of claims from officials and allies of George W. Bush’s administration that Iraq was reconstituting its nuclear weapons program and had purchased some aluminum tubes to do so. The Times’ bogus story allowed Bush’s top aides to go on Sunday talk shows to warn that “we must not allow the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.” 
But the “aluminum tube” story was only part of a long-developing pattern. As an investigative reporter in Washington since 1980, I had seen the Times engage in similar publications of false stories planted by powerful insiders. 
For instance, based on self-serving information from Ronald Reagan’s Justice Department in the mid-1980s, the Times knocked down the original reporting that my Associated Press colleague Brian Barger and I did on Nicaraguan Contra rebels getting involved in cocaine smuggling. 
And, once the Times got snookered by its official sources, it and other mainstream publications carried on vendettas against anyone who contradicted the accepted wisdom, unwilling to admit that they were wrong even at the expense of historical truth. 
So, when San Jose Mercury News reporter Gary Webb revived the Contra-cocaine story in 1996 — with evidence that some of that cocaine had fed into the “crack epidemic”— the Times (along with other major newspapers) savaged Webb’s articles and destroyed his career. 
Finally, in 1998 when the CIA’s Inspector General Frederick Hitz confirmed that the Contras indeed had engaged in extensive cocaine trafficking, the Times only published a grudging and limited admission that maybe there was a bit more to the story than the vaunted Times had previously accepted. But Webb’s career and life remained in ruins. He eventually committed suicide in 2004 (and please, conspiracists, don’t go on about how he was “murdered” by the CIA). 
[For details,   Sordid Contra-Cocaine Saga .”] 
Hiding Gore’s Victory 
By the time of Webb’s destruction, the Times was neck-deep in a troubling pattern of getting virtually every major story wrong or sitting on important information that some of its own journalists had dug up. President George W. Bush and members of his national security team in Iraq in 2007 
In 2000, after five partisan Republicans on the U.S. Supreme Court shut down the vote count in Florida to ensure George W. Bush’s “election,” Times executives resisted calls from lower-level editors to join in a media counting of the discarded votes, only grumpily agreeing to take part. 
However, when that vote count was completed in November 2001, the Times executives decided to misreport the findings, which revealed that if all legal votes in Florida had been counted Al Gore would have won (because the so-called “over-votes” – when a voter both marks and writes in the same name – broke heavily for Gore and are legal under Florida law which is based on the clear intent of the voter). 
You might have thought that the obvious lede would be that the wrong guy was in the White House, but the 9/11 attacks had intervened between the start and the end of the media recount. So, the Times and other major news organizations buried their own findings so as not to undermine Bush’s authority amid a crisis. The big media focused on various hypotheticals of partial counts that still had Bush “winning.” 
While one might sympathize with the Times’ reasons for misleading the public, what the Times did was not journalism, nor was it a case of treating the American citizens as the true sovereigns of the nation who have a right to know the truth. It was a case of protecting the legitimacy of the Establishment. Those of us who noted the actual vote tabulations were dismissed as “conspiracy theorists,” though we were not. 
[For the details of how a full Florida recount would have given Gore the White House, see Consortiumnews.com’s “ Gore’s Victory ,” “ So Bush Did Steal the White House ,” and “ Bush v. Gore’s Dark American Decade. ”] 
Rationalizing War 
So, when we got to Bush’s plans for invading Iraq in 2002, the Times had already shown its commitment to play ball with whatever the government was saying, no matter how dubious the claims. And, even the humiliation of having been caught publishing a false story about aluminum tubes being evidence of Iraq reconstituting its nuclear weapons program didn’t get the Times to change course. Former New York Times reporter Judith Miller. 
Although one of the reporters on that story, Judy Miller, eventually did leave the newspaper (and landed on her feet at Fox News), the lead author, Michael Gordon, continued as the Times’ national security correspondent. Even more stunning, columnist Bill Keller, who wrote an influential article rallying “liberals” to the cause of invading Iraq, was elevated to the top job of executive editor after his Iraq gullibility had been exposed. 
Even in the rare moments when the Times claimed it was standing up to the Bush administration, such as publishing James Risen’s article in December 2005 exposing the warrantless wiretapping of Americans, the reality was not exactly a new chapter in Profiles in Courage. 
It turned out that the Times had been sitting on Risen’s story for more than a year – it could have been published before the 2004 election – but Bush demanded the story’s suppression. The information was finally shared with the public in late 2005 only because Risen’s book, State of War, was scheduled for publication in January 2006 and included the disclosure, a prospective embarrassment for the Times. 
The pattern of the Times bowing down to the White House continued into the Obama administration. Whenever there has been a dubious claim that the U.S. government directs against some foreign “adversary,” the Times dutifully takes the side of Official Washington, rather than applying the objectivity and impartiality that are supposed to be at the heart of U.S. journalism. 
For instance, on Aug. 21, 2013, when a mysterious sarin gas attack outside Damascus, Syria, killed several hundred people, the Times simply fell in line behind the U.S.-driven rush to judgment blaming the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. 
There were immediate reasons to doubt that conclusion – Assad had just invited in United Nations inspectors to investigate cases of Syrian jihadists using chemical weapons – but the Times and other major Western outlets simply fingered the already demonized Assad. 
Though we now know that U.S. intelligence analysts did not consider Assad’s guilt a “slam dunk” – and later key elements of the case against Assad collapsed , such as the Times’ miscalculation of the maximum range of the sarin-laden rocket – the Assad-did-it stampede almost led to a major U.S. military retaliation against what now appears to have been the wrong people. 
Current evidence points to a likely provocation by radical jihadists trying to trick the West into entering the war in a big way on their side, but the Times has never fully retracted its false claim that the rocket was fired from a Syrian military base, which was four times outside the rocket’s range. 
Indeed, to this day, Times’ columnists and other Western journalists routinely cite Assad’s guilt – and President Obama’s supposed failure to enforce his “red line” against chemical attacks – as flat fact. 
The MH-17 Case 
There has been a similar lack of skepticism toward the propaganda case that has been built around the July 17, 2014 shoot-down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine killing 298 people. We saw another rush to judgment, this time blaming ethnic Russian rebels and Russian President Vladimir Putin, but there were problems with that claim from the start. The Dutch Safety Board’s reconstruction of where it believed the missile exploded near Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 on July 17, 2014. 
I was told by a source briefed by U.S. intelligence analysts that their evidence pointed to a rogue element of the Ukrainian military under the direction of a hard-line, anti-Russian Ukrainian oligarch with the hoped-for goal of shooting down Putin’s plane returning from a state visit to South America. According to this account, MH-17 just became the substitute target. 
But the international investigation was put under the effective control of Ukraine’s unsavory SBU intelligence service, although technically called “Dutch-led.” As the Joint Investigation Team’s own progress report noted this year, the inquiry relied both on the Ukrainian government’s hospitality and “evidence” supplied by the SBU, which has been implicated in concealing Ukrainian torture centers. Far from objective, the investigation became part of the West’s anti-Russian propaganda war. 
So, when the JIT issued its initial findings in September 2016, skepticism should have been in order. Indeed, there wasn’t really a “report” as such, more a brief summary accompanied by several videos that used computer-generated graphics and cryptic telephone intercepts, provided by the SBU, to create the impression of Russian guilt. 
A critical examination of the material revealed that the inquiry ignored evidence that went against the desired conclusion , including intercepts revealing that a Ukrainian convoy was pressing deep inside what was called “rebel-controlled” territory, an important point because it showed that a Ukrainian missile battery could have traveled eastward toward the alleged firing point since rebel forces were mostly massed to the north fighting a government offensive. 
The alleged route of the supposed Russian Buk battery also made no sense because there was a much more direct and discreet route from the Russian border to the alleged firing location in the southeast than the circuitous wandering all the way west to Donetsk before backtracking to the east. But the SBU-dominated investigation needed to explain why all the “social media” photos showed a Buk battery traveling east toward Russia, not westward from Russia. 
And, there was the JIT’s silence on a Dutch intelligence report from October 2015 saying that the only powerful anti-aircraft missiles in eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014, were under the control of the Ukrainian military. Plus, the supposed firing location for the alleged purpose of protecting rebel fighters operating far to the north made no sense from a tactical perspective either. Placing a Buk battery far to the southeast would not help shoot down Ukraine’s military planes firing missiles into the rebel lines. 
Indeed, much of the evidence fit better with what I had been told, second-hand, from those U.S. intelligence analysts – because any scheme to shoot down Putin’s plane would need the deniability that would come from pushing the battery as far into “rebel-controlled” territory as possible so as to manage the political fallout by creating a cover story that Putin was killed by his own supporters. The same cover story also would work for killing the passengers on MH-17 and blaming it on Russia. 
But whatever you might think about who was responsible for the MH-17 atrocity — and I agree that the mystery has not been solved — the job of a professional news organization is to examine skeptically the various accounts and the available pieces of evidence, not just embrace the “official” version. But that is what the Times has done regarding MH-17 and pretty much every other case. 
Concealing History 
The Times’ journalistic negligence does not only affect current issues of war and peace, but how the American people understand their recent history. In effect, the false “group thinks” – accepted by the Times – have a long after-life of decay contaminating the public’s thinking whenever the Times recycles a bogus account as historical narrative. President Lyndon Johnson accompanies President-elect Richard Nixon to his inauguration on Jan. 20, 1969. 
For instance, in a recent summary of “October Surprise” cases, the Times misled its readers on two of the most important incidents, 1968 and 1980. 
Regarding the election of 1968 between Richard Nixon and Hubert Humphrey, the evidence is now overwhelming that Nixon’s operatives went behind President Lyndon Johnson’s back to sabotage the Paris peace talks that Johnson felt could end the Vietnam War, a development that also would likely have helped fellow Democrat Humphrey. 
That evidence now includes declassified FBI wiretaps of Nixon’s conspirators and Johnson’s own taped phone conversations – as well as various admissions and other corroborations from participants – but the Times has always turned up its nose toward this important story. So, the history doesn’t exist in New York Times World. 
Thus, when the Times addressed this 1968 episode in a Nov. 1, 2016 review of past “October Surprise” cases – in the context of FBI Director James Comey telling Congress that the FBI had reopened its investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails – the Times offered this summary: 
“President Lyndon Baines Johnson announced a halt to bombing of North Vietnam, based on his claim that peace talks had ‘entered a new and a very much more hopeful phase,’ and he invited the government of South Vietnam and the Viet Cong to take part in negotiations. Raising hopes that the war might end soon, the announcement appeared to bolster the standing in the polls of Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, the Democratic  , but Humphrey still fell short in the election against former Vice President Richard M. Nixon, the Republican.” 
In other words, the Times treated Johnson’s bombing halt and claim of peace-talk progress as the “October Surprise” to try to influence the election in favor of Humphrey. But the evidence now is clear that a peace agreement was within reach and that the “October Surprise” was Nixon’s sabotage of the negotiations by persuading South Vietnamese President Nguyen van Thieu to boycott the Paris meeting. 
The Times got the story upside-down and inside-out by failing to reexamine this case in light of convincing evidence now available in the declassified record. [For details, see Consortiumnews.com’s “ LBJ’s ‘X-File’ on Nixon’s ‘Treason ’” and “ The Heinous Crime Behind Watergate .”] 
Reagan’s Victory 
The Times botched the 1980 “October Surprise” case even worse. The currently available evidence supports the case that Ronald Reagan’s campaign – mostly through its director (and future CIA Director) William Casey and its vice   (and former CIA Director) George H.W. Bush – went behind President Jimmy Carter’s back and undermined his negotiations to free 52 American hostages then held in Iran. President Ronald Reagan, delivering his Inaugural Address on Jan. 20, 1981, as the 52 U.S. hostages in Iran are simultaneously released. 
Carter’s failure became a central factor in his repudiation for reelection and a core reason for Reagan’s landslide victory – that also carried the Republicans to control of the U.S. Senate. But the later congressional investigation into the 1980 October Surprise case – a follow-on to the Iran-Contra scandal which exposed the Reagan-Bush secret dealings with Iran – was stymied in 1992. 
Naively, the inquiry trusted President George H.W. Bush’s administration to collect the evidence and provide the witnesses for what would amount to Bush’s political suicide. Documents from Bush’s presidential library reveal that his White House quickly set out to “kill/spike this story” in order to protect his reelection chances. 
For instance, a memo by one of Bush’s lawyers revealed that the White House had received confirmation of a key October Surprise allegation – a secret trip by Casey to Madrid – but then withheld that information from congressional investigators. Documents also show the White House frustrating attempts to interview a key witness. 
After I discovered the Madrid confirmation several years ago – and sent the document to former Rep. Lee Hamilton, who had headed the House inquiry which concluded that there was no credible evidence supporting the allegations – he was stunned by the apparent betrayal of his trust. 
“The [Bush-41] White House did not notify us that he [Casey] did make the trip” to Madrid, Hamilton told me in an interview. Asked if knowledge that Casey had traveled to Madrid might have changed the investigation’s dismissive October Surprise conclusion, Hamilton said yes, because the question of the Madrid trip was central to the inquiry. 
So, a great deal is now known about the 1980 October Surprise case since the Times accepted the misguided conclusion of Hamilton’s inquiry. But none of that is reflected in how the Times recounted the history in its review of past October Surprise cases: 
“The Republican nominee, Ronald Reagan, and his aides repeatedly warned that President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat, would try an October surprise, probably in the form of winning the release of American hostages held for more than a year in Iran. The Reagan campaign’s frequent use of the term helped popularize it. Some people have since charged that Reagan aides actually tried to prevent a hostage release before the election, through back-channel communications with Iran, a claim that has been widely refuted. The hostages were freed in January 1981 — on the day Reagan was inaugurated.” 
Yet, rather than being “widely refuted,” the most recent evidence tends to confirm the allegations that have been made by some two dozen witnesses including a detailed account of the Reagan campaign’s interference by then-Iranian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr. But the Times seems more interested in reinforcing the false conventional wisdom than informing the American people. 
[For details, see Robert Parry’s America’s Stolen Narrative or Trick or Treason: The 1980 October Surprise Mystery or Consortiumnews.com’s “ Second Thoughts on October Surprise. ”] 
Crazy Deflategate 
Even on more trivial matters, the Times simply can’t escape its pattern of accepting the word from the powerful, even when those powers-that-be are as disreputable as the executives of National Football League. New England Patriot quarterback Tom Brady. 
When the NFL decided to accuse New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady of cheating in a bizarre scheme to slightly deflate footballs in the January 2015 AFC Championship game, the Times again showed no skepticism despite the flimsiness of the accusations as well as the absence of any direct evidence — and the official denials from Brady (under oath) and two equipment employees. 
The so-called Deflategate case was also marred by the sloppiness of the halftime measurements of the footballs and the ignorance of many NFL executives about the laws of physics and how weather affects the internal air pressure of footballs, as determined by the Ideal Gas Law. 
But the “scandal” took on a life of its own with the NFL leaking exaggerations about the discrepancies in the initial air-pressure measurements and false claims about the proper air pressure in the footballs of the other team, the Indianapolis Colts (the one accurate gauge, used by the NFL officials, showed that the Colts’ footballs were underinflated for both the first half and second half). 
Eventually, even NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell recognized many of the flaws in the case as he concluded that the only game where the footballs could have been deflated was the AFC Championship game when the Patriots’ ball boy carried the footballs to the field unattended (rather than the normal practice of being accompanied by an official) and stopped briefly in a bathroom. 
But this NFL conspiracy theory – that the ball boy used his bathroom break to slightly deflate footballs rather than urinating as he claimed – made no sense because the only reason the ball boy ended up unattended was because the preceding NFC Championship had gone into overtime and the NFL decided to delay the start of the AFC game so the public could see both games. 
The sudden-death ending of the NFC game caused confusion among the officials and the ball boy took it upon himself to take the balls to the field. 
To suggest that Brady somehow anticipated that series of unlikely events so a tiny bit of air could be removed from the footballs, which would have no discernible effect except to make the balls travel slightly slower and thus easier to defend, is absurd on its face. 
But the NFL would have lost face by admitting that it had acted so absurdly – and rival owners saw a chance to damage the Patriots’ ability to compete – so the Deflategate story moved on with Brady suspended for four games and the Patriots stripped of two valuable draft choices. 
A Puff Piece 
While you might say that this “scandal” surely didn’t deserve the attention that it got (and you’d be right), the Times, which treated the NFL claims as fact, didn’t let go even after Brady dropped his appeals and accepted his four-game suspension. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell 
The Times devoted 2½ pages on Sept. 25, 2016, to a puff piece by correspondent John Branch about the “Deflategate Scientists” from the corporate-friendly science firm, Exponent, which was hired by the NFL to produce the “science” to justify Brady’s punishment. 
Though Exponent discovered that all or virtually all the air-pressure drop could be attributable to the cold, wet weather on the night of the game (and the imprecise process of the halftime measurements further muddled the picture), Exponent still composed some scientific-sounding jargon to give the NFL the cover that it needed to go after Brady. 
The firm said, “we conclude that within the range of game characteristics most likely to have occurred on Game Day, we have identified no set of credible environmental or physical factors that completely accounts for the additional loss of air pressure exhibited by the Patriots game balls as compared to the loss in air pressure exhibited by the Colts game balls.” 
But Exponent’s phrasing obscured the fact that an innocent explanation did exist on Exponent’s range of measurements though the firm ruled it out by applying “accepted error margins” and fudging the facts around the sequence of the football testing at halftime (a key point because in a warmer environment, the air pressure would rise naturally). 
Armed with Exponent’s phrasing, NFL investigators then took some unrelated text messages from the two equipment employees describing how NFL officials had over-inflated footballs in a prior game to claim they had the “smoking gun” regarding a plot to under-inflate footballs. 
However, rather than show any skepticism about this “evidence” and the larger absurdity of the Deflategate claims, the Times simply treated the NFL’s case as solid and fawned over Exponent as if it were a temple of noble scientists seeking nothing but the truth. The Times dismissed critics who cited the firm’s reputation as a hired-gun to give powerful industries useful conclusions, such as disparaging the danger from second-hand cigarette smoke. 
Instead of any serious journalism examining Deflategate’s logical flaws and Exponent’s dubious role in the scandal-mongering, the Times presented Exponent as the real martyrs in the case, reporting “Exponent still receives emails from adamant critics, and its role in Deflategate has cost it several prospective clients, the company said.” 
A Troubling Pattern 
Granted, the Deflategate silliness is minor compared to other cases when the Times misrepresented key chapters of U.S. history, concealed government wrongdoing and generated propaganda used to justify wars. But all these examples point to a pattern of journalistic behavior that is not journalistic. 
Today’s Times is not the brave newspaper that published the Pentagon Papers, the secret history of the Vietnam War. It is no longer the place where a Seymour Hersh could expose the CIA’s “crown jewels” of scandals or where a Raymond Bonner could reveal massacres of civilians by U.S.-backed militaries in Central America. 
Not that those earlier days were by any means perfect – and not that there isn’t some quality journalism that still appears in the newspaper – but it is hard to imagine the Times today going against the grain in any significant or consistent way. 
Instead, the Times has become an apologist for the powerful, conveying to its readers and to the world a dangerous and dubious insistence that the Establishment knows best.

9475,Trump Family Say Trump Brand Has NOT Been Damaged,"Fans Thrilled as NFL Team Stands for Anthem… Then Players Unleash Sick Surprise 
“I think the brand is hotter than it’s ever been, but it doesn’t matter to me. I don’t care,” Trump stated in a taped interview that aired Thursday on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” “It doesn’t matter. I don’t care about the brand. I care about the country.” 
His words were echoed by his son Eric, who also felt confident about the survivability of the family’s brand in the face of relentless attacks. 
“I think we have the hottest brand in the world right now, and I think buildings like this are a testament to what we do every day,” Eric Trump said, referring to the hotel that had just opened ahead of schedule and under budget.   
There has been some damage attempted against the family business via negative press and spiteful boycotts, such as the mean-spirited campaign to ruin Ivanka Trump’s clothing and accessories line by tying it to the leaked 2005 tape of Trump making vulgar comments about certain women. 
However, Donald Trump Jr. insisted that in spite of the negative press the brand was doing just fine and was even expanding, proving it was far more than just a real estate development group tied to the New York City and tri-state area. 
“The brand is much more than New York City. This is a global brand,” Trump Jr. said. “I mean, when you look at the people he’s touching on a daily basis, the presidency, fixing America is so much bigger than any of that regardless.” 
Granted, it is entirely possible that the Trump brand will suffer long-term from the unceasing onslaught of negative coverage, though it is also just as likely that the brand could even grow in popularity, depending upon how the 2016 election ultimately plays out.  ",0

General William Neil McCasland, former head of the WPAFB lab where it is believed the Roswell wreckage went, makes comments on how to deal with UFO disclosure.
“I was thinking a bit more about what a White House memo should say. Something like these points to all Federal Agencies: – In light of the President’s policy on STEM (citing official policy encouraging the study of science, technology, engineering and math) – some back ground on your project – the Administration encourages a favorable Public Affairs position by all Agencies – appointes NASA to lead (this kind of public outreach is in NASA’s job jar, and if no Agency is appointed all will simply note and file the memo and likely do nothing) – and to coordinate with DoD, DNI and NOAA (the other major space actors, putting a bit of light on them)”

In late September 2015, John Podesta posted a tweet asking actress Lena Dunham to ask Hillary Clinton about the aliens the next time she did an interview. This led to a situation where the Clinton campaign was waiting for some reporter to ask about aliens.Nothing would happen until late December when New Hampshire reporter Daymond Steer asked, but on November 5th Hillary was on the late night Jerry Kimmel show. One leaked email points out that Hillary was waiting for the UFO question and had practised an answer. The question didn’t happen and Hillary was very disappointed. In a reply to a query by Podesta asking how the Kimmel show went Kristina Schake, who job in the Clinton campaign is to remake Hillary’s image as she had done for Michelle Obama, told Podesta,
She was charming, got lots of laughs and worked in a lot of message, including climate change. He didn’t end up asking her about UFOs! She was very disappointed. She practiced UAPs for 5 minutes beforehand. 
Hillary would appear again on the Kimmel show in March 2016 and did get the UFO question during that appearance. Unfortunately, the five minutes practise did not help as she called UAPs “unexplained aerial phenomena” instead of “unidentified aerial phenomena.”

New Names Dragged Down the UFO Rabbit HoleIn Late December 2015 reporter Daymond Steer in Conway, New Hampshire took up John Podesta’s challenge to ask Hillary Clinton about the aliens. It created a story that went around the world.Now we are seeing the first reaction to that news story in the Podesta emails. In a WikiLeaks email on January 7, 2016 Ann M. O’Leary, a senior policy advisor in Hillary Clinton’s 2016 Presidential Campaign writes Podesta; “Judge Tatel & John – This article on Hillary’s comments about extraterrestrial life made me think of you two and remind me to connect you. 
Judge David Tatel
John – As I was telling David the last time I saw him, the two of you are the biggest believers in ET life who I know and I think you’d enjoy talking with one another. I know that neither of you have much time, but I think you’d have a fascinating time discussing it if you ever get together! Warmly, Ann”

On April 30, 2015 Terri Mansfield wrote John Podesta. There are two significant things to nhttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/29385ote,
1. Terri is requesting a meeting between Astronaut Edgar Mitchell and President Obama after the planned one on one meeting with John Podesta (arrangements were being made for this meeting but it never took place).
2. More importantly, Terri tells Podesta “Edgar has consulted on consciousness matters for American presidents in the past.” This is significant because consciousness is the key to the UFO mystery. There are some hints that the main man behind the present “group” working to disclose knew the “holographic consciousness” connection.
https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/27026 
After Podesta made his now infamous tweet that his biggest disappointment of 2014 was not getting disclosure of the UFO files he started to receive some email inquiries for interviews.
In one leaked email he tells his assistant to tell the reporter from NPR in Wisconsin that he can’t do the interview, and ignore the rest of the requests.
One of the emails he gets ins from Robert Fish who wrote a book on the recovery of the Apollo 11 capsule in the Pacific Ocean. It was originally sent to researcher Leslie Ken. When she did not reply, Fish sent it to Podesta. Fish indicated that everyone is looking in the wrong location for the UFO In a second email from Bob Fish, who wrote the book on the recovery of the Apollo 11 capsule in the pacific, he tells Podesta of things he had heard such as

“No one could get into the cafeteria without TS/SCI clearances, so this was not a “’lightweight group of gossipers.’ One of these times, a member of that group was really excited – said they’d just picked up Fastwalker…” 
Fish wrote more of the reality of UFOs that he had experienced in his career in a March 6, 2015 email;
“In that same TS/SCI building cafeteria in El Segundo, I had lunch with a senior USAF NCO who had worked for Project Blue Book in the 1970s (after it had been “officially disbanded). He was an ELINT technician (electronic intelligence) who flew in RC-135s from MacDill AFB in Florida. The “normal” target was Cuba where they did lots of snooping and sometimes challenging the Cubans to turn on radar and other systems. He said there were times when they were diverted from these missions to track UFOs off the east coast of Florida. His claim was they UFOs had a landing and takeoff spot in the ocean east of Miami, north of Bermuda. 
He also claimed there was a specific electronic signature (frequency) emanating from them when they were going into or coming out of the water, so they were easy to track. On several occasions, they filmed the UFO as it transitioned from water to air or vice versa. One last item is he was occasionally assigned to fly in a USAF weather aircraft (WC-135) when they had a hurricane hunting mission over the usual UFO area, where his specific assignment was kept secret from the other crew members. He would always report back to a dedicated USAF intelligence officer on base when they returned from a mission. He did not know where the intel that he collected was sent for processing or storage (WPAFB in Dayton would be the obvious choice). High quality film of UFOs is “out there” somewhere!

One thing that has been overlooked in the coverage of the Podesta/Hillary WikiLeaks UFO story is the people who are being copied by John Podesta.
In the emails where John has received UFO questions, he has either copied or asked for input from the following people from the presidential campaign or from the Institute for American Progress that Podesta founded. (One estimate stated that 40% of the high-level officials in the Obama administration came from this institute). Take a close at the names. These are not people off the street.
JPalmieri@americanprogress.org – She left the Obama administration with Podesta in February 2015.
She previously served as White House Communications Director for U.S. President Barack Obama. Prior to her service at the White House, she served as the President of the Center for American Progress Action Fund.
Jennifer Palmieri is Director of Communications for the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential
campaign where she handles she manages candidate message, media relations–and trouble-shooting.
FShakir@americanprogress.org – Faiz Shakir is the vice-president of the Center for American Progress (CAP). Shakir, in fact, sent Podesta an article about UFO secrecy already back in 2008.
Daniella Leger is a Senior Vice President for Communications and
Strategy at Center for American Progress
sara.latham@ptt.gov – Sarah Latham is the Chief of Staff to the Chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign – Special Assistant to White House Chief of Staff John Podesta and Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy Director of Presidential Scheduling from 1996 to 2000

As of October 26, there are 14 emails to and from John Podesta attempting to arrange a meeting between astronaut Edgar Mitchell with Podesta and/or President Obama. The topic of the proposed meeting would be Zero-point energy and UFO disclosure. The two latest released emails were sent by Terri Mansfield on January 21, 2015.
Terri Mansfield
The first letter (sent through Podesta assistant Eyrn Sepp) mentioned an article just published by USA Today which pointed out that nearly 130,000 pages of declassified UFO records from Project Blue Book had just been put on-line. Edgar’s letter stated,
I grew up in Roswell, my family knew Oppenheimer. Let’s get our meeting time and date set up ASAP so we can move forward on our unprecedented discussion concerning disclosure of our ETI from a contiguous universe and their connection to zero-point energy for humanity.
https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32937
The second letter written later in the day was a more specific request for a meeting. Although the email mentions Podesta “no longer with the White House” Podesta was still at the White House for almost another month when he produced his famous tweet saying he had “once again” not been able to release the UFO documents. It may have been that he had given notice to leave and Edgar had become aware of this,
Now that you are no longer serving in the White House, I write to you and Eryn requesting our face to face meeting to discuss zero-point energy and Disclosure. Our Quantrek science intuitive has provided us with a few facts about our nonviolent contiguous universe ETI who promote PACIFISM among humans and with whom we work:
1. All true ETI do not inhabit this universe.
2. So-called ETIs inhabit this universe and are in fact just celestials. They are higher in rank then discarnate spirits, even those who are evolved, HOWEVER, THEY JUST MIRROR VIOLENCE ON EARTH, FEELING THREATENED BY CONTAMINATION OF THEIR ABODE.
3. Extrauinversal ETIs on the other hand have long ago evolved past violence, relying on spiritual intelligence to avert destruction.
4. The Phoenix Lights and other sightings have provided ample evidence that Earth has been visited by beings whose intention is purely peace and who have nonviolently hovered over Phoenix and other sites, waiting to be asked to help, when they could most easily have destroyed the city with their uses of consciousness. These sightings have been witnessed by thousands of people in Phoenix alone, including my colleague Terri Mansfield, who will accompany me on our meeting with you.
Please let me now three dates and times that would work for your schedule.

This followed an email that had been sent by Mitchell, and again sent by Terri Mansfield a week earlier. In that email Mitchell requested a meeting on zero-point energy and UFO disclosure with Podesta after he leaves in February 2015.
That letter was also significant in that Edgar bring up meeting a childhood friend of President Obama. Edgar wrote,
I met with President Obama’s Honolulu childhood friend, US Ambassador Pamela Hamamoto on July 4 at the US Mission in Geneva, when I was able to tell her briefly about zero-point energy. I believe we can enlist her as a confidante and resource in our presentation for President Obama.

On March 5, 2016 Eric Brys wrote an email to John Podesta titled “Extraterrestrial Disclosure.” It was written two days after Podesta granted an interview to KLAS-TV in Las Vegas Nevada where he talked about the fact that unlike Bill Clinton and Obama he had convinced Hillary to disclose information being withheld about UFOs. In that interview Podesta stated,
I’ve talked to Hillary about that. There are still classified files that could be declassified. I think I’ve convinced her that we need an effort to kind of go look at that and declassify as much as we can, so that people have their legitimate questions answered. More attention and more discussion about unexplained aerial phenomena can happen without people — who are in public life, who are serious about this — being ridiculed. 
In his email Brys complimented Podesta on his disclosure effort,
I am proud of your continued efforts to disclose the truth of secret UFO files hidden from the public. I will be voting for Hillary Clinton to help get you the authority you need to obtain disclosure. I hope history remembers your undaunting efforts to informing the American public about extraterrestrial visitation. 
Unlike most of the UFO emails from ordinary citizens that were not responded to Podesta took the time to answer. He stated,
Thanks for your support. We will keep at it.

There is correspondence today between John Podesta and his aide Milia Fisher that took place the day before the big January 25, 2016 google hangout meeting where Podesta talked UFO disclosure with the following three men: Major General Neil McCasland, former head of the foreign technology back-engineering laboratory at Wright-Patterson AFB, Robert F. Weiss, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Aeronautics Advanced Development Programs, Lockheed Martin Corporation (Skunkworks), and Major General Michael J. Carey, USAF, the Special Assistant to the Commander, Air Force Space Command, Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado.
The correspondence the day before the meeting indicated that they were expecting Tom DeLonge but his flight had been cancelled. It appears then that DeLonge was scheduled to be with Podesta in and around the time of the meeting. New emails may clear this up.

9477,Soros-Funded Group Schemes to Stop Trump’s Latest Temporary Visa Ban,"A lawsuit brought before a Maryland appeals court seeking to stop President Trump’s temporary ban on new visas from six Middle Eastern countries was filed by a   group financed by billionaire George Soros. [The second group behind the lawsuit was massively funded by the federal government under the Obama administration to resettle refugees within the U. S.  On Monday, Bloomberg reported on the status of the lawsuit: The   appeals court on Monday offered to accelerate its review of the case, which would speed it along to the U. S. Supreme Court by skipping the traditional oral argument before three judges in favor of an initial   hearing. The parties have until March 30 to decide if they want that accelerated schedule. The suit before the appeals court was filed by the International Refugee Assistance Project, HIAS, a refugee resettlement group established in the 19th century to aid Eastern European Jews, the Middle East Studies Association of North America and six individuals. Similar to the current suit, the International Refugee Assistance Project was also a signatory to a lawsuit filed last January attempting to block Trump’s original executive order halting visas for 90 days for “immigrants and  ” from Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, Yemen, Iran and Iraq. The International Refugee Assistance Project is located at the Urban Justice Center. The Urban Justice Center is also the recipient of an Open Society grant. Taryn Higashi, executive director of the Center’s International Refugee Assistance Project listed in the Trump lawsuit, currently serves on the Advisory Board of the International Migration Initiative of Soros’s Open Society Foundations. The other group signed on to the lawsuit is the nonprofit HIAS, which describes itself as standing “for a world in which refugees find welcome, safety and freedom. ” Unmentioned in much of the news media coverage about the lawsuit is that HIAS has taken large sums in federal grants to help resettle refugees, as this reporter previously documented. HIAS specializes in refugee resettlement and in 2015 received 65. 3 percent of its annual $25 million budget from government grants. Annual grants include funds from the State Department and the Office of Refugee Resettlement in the Department of Health and Human Services.  Another major donor is the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In 2015, the State Department provided $17, 663, 704 and the Department of Health and Human Services gave another $2, 765, 195. The fiscal year 2014 saw a $16, 959, 850 State Department grant and $2, 546, 469 in funds from the Department of Health and Human Services. Guidestar documented that in 2013, HIAS received $16, 261, 661 from government and intergovernmental agencies and took in a total of $31, 218, 870 in revenue. In 2012, $14, 707, 399 in government grants were donated to HIAS and the organization produced $27, 677, 240 in revenue. In 2008, the Committee on   Organizations, a division of the UN Economic and Social Council, officially accepted HIAS as an accredited NGO. HIAS openly states on its website that it is the “only Jewish organization designated by the federal government to undertake” refugee resettlement, which “lies at the heart of HIAS’ work. ” The group is partners with local Refugee Assistance Organizations around the country to “ensure successful integration. ” “Although this can be a long process requiring the participation of many actors, refugees bring the resilience and resourcefulness that saved their lives at home,” HIAS relates. HIAS was an acronym that previously stood for the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society and it originally worked to resettle Jewish emigrants from Russia.  It dropped the full title and only goes by the acronym now.  Mark Hetfield, HIAS president and CEO, told the Washington Jewish Week in December 2014 the word “Hebrew” was exclusionary and outdated, comparing it with the use of the word “colored” to refer to African Americans. Soros, meanwhile, has reportedly provided some $76 million for immigrant issues over the last decade alone. In 2014, the New York Times credited “immigrant rights groups” financed by Soros and a handful of other donors with influencing President Obama’s immigration policy. The newspaper reported: When President Obama announces major changes to the nation’s immigration enforcement system as early as next week, his decision will partly be a result of a   campaign of pressure by immigrant rights groups, which have grown from a cluster of lobbying organizations into a national force. A vital part of that expansion has involved money: major donations from some of the nation’s wealthiest liberal foundations, including the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Open Society Foundations of the financier George Soros, and the Atlantic Philanthropies. Over the past decade those donors have invested more than $300 million in immigrant organizations, including many fighting for a pathway to citizenship for immigrants here illegally. In August, Breitbart Jerusalem first reported hacked documents from Soros’s Open Society Institute boasted that the billionaire and his foundation helped to successfully press the Obama administration into increasing to 100, 000 the total number of refugees taken in by the U. S. annually. The documents revealed that the billionaire personally sent President Obama a letter on the issue of accepting refugees. Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

9478,Margaret Flowers’ Retrospective on Running as a Green for the U.S. Senate,"2016 elections by BAR editor and columnist Dr. Marsha Adebayo 
The major parties are more concerned with preserving their duopoly than with defeating each other. So-called “progressives” help preserve duopoly rule, failing “to understand that as long as they are complicit with the Democrats, they have no power.” Most people are actually more Green than Democratic in their views, but “have a hard time comprehending that there are more than two parties,” according to Green candidate Dr. Flowers. Margaret Flowers’ Retrospective on Running as a Green for the U.S. Senate by BAR editor and columnist Dr. Marsha Adebayo 
“ The message of the Green Party resonates with people because we talk about real issues that they experience in their lives and solutions that they want to see.” 
The Democratic and Republican parties’ attempt to monopolize the presidential media cycle was challenged by candidates like Dr. Margaret Flowers, who ran for the US Senate on the Green Party ticket in Maryland. She used the electoral platform to speak directly to working class communities. Dr Flowers was profiled in a recent BAR article regarding the decision of the Maryland League of Women Voters to deny her the right to participate in the only televised senatorial debate. Undaunted, Dr. Flowers took to the stage and demanded to be recognized as an equal participate in the electoral process. She was escorted off stage by security forces under protest with audience members shouting: “Let her speak!” 
Margaret is a Maryland pediatrician and mother of three. In 2007, she made the decision to stop practicing clinical medicine, which she viewed as antithetical to the welfare of working class and front line communities. Instead, she decided to “practice political medicine.” The class dynamics of health care is evident to her. “The wealth divide is one of our biggest health care problems” and is the cause of “the greatest disparity” in health outcomes. In 2009, she joined Physicians for a National Health Program, becoming a Congressional Fellow and opening a chapter in Maryland. She was arrested at a Senate Roundtable on Health Insurance for speaking on behalf of the single payer option. Margaret said in an interview: “our first goal was to have a seat at the table….If we couldn’t get a seat, at least we could expose the insincerity of the current attempt at healthcare reform and show that single payer was actively being excluded.” 
Margaret views the struggle for health care as “part of a broader social, racial, economic and environmental justice movement.” She has organized campaigns to fight for state and federal single payer health care systems. In addition, Margaret provided leadership and took on corporations focusing on the issue of net neutrality, the concept that everyone should have equal access to the Internet regardless of their usage or ability to pay. 
I met Margaret during the Freedom Plaza Occupy Movement in Washington, DC where she helped me organize the Occupy EPA demonstrations. 
Below, Margaret provides her reflections and analysis on running as the 2016 Green Party candidate for the US Senate in Maryland. 
Adebayo: What political and cultural lessons did you learn from running against the Democratic and Republican machines? 
Flowers: Running for office in Maryland taught me that the major political party machines, especially the Democratic Party, are pervasive in our state. Their tentacles reach deep into the non-profit organizations, the media, the polling organizations and the universities. 
There is a culture in the state that is trapped in the duopoly. People are so used to thinking in terms of just Democrats and Republicans that they have a hard time comprehending that there are more than two parties. It is almost like a habit. When confronted with the reality that the media, non-profits, polls and universities were excluding our campaign, the most common responses were that this is how it has always been or that they excluded us because they could. 
It was disappointing that the Maryland League of Women Voters, which is supposed to be nonpartisan and educate voters about their choices on the ballot, imposed an arbitrary high polling criterion that was used to keep me out of debates. It was disappointing that a public university, the University of Baltimore, which sponsored the only televised senate debate in Maryland, shut down political discourse by excluding me even though I would have provided a perspective that was not heard in the debate. 
It was interesting to see how the media and polling organizations create a Catch-22 situation for alternative party candidates. Early on in my campaign, when public pressure was applied, the Baltimore Sun published one article on my campaign that mostly argued that I had no chance of winning and that I was mostly like a Democrat. Their failure to cover my campaign early on, or to even mention that I was running when they covered the other candidates, made it less likely that I would reach potential donors and volunteers. This made it less likely that I would poll well, especially since there were few polls that included me and they were done in September. As a result, my low polling numbers were used to justify my exclusion from events. 
When our campaign did reach people, we received a very welcoming response. People are interested in a broader discussion of the crises we are facing and solutions to them. The solutions that I support are widely supported by the public. 
And finally, it was interesting to see how so-called progressive organizations are trapped inside the Democratic Party and fail to understand that as long as they are complicit with the Democrats, they have no power. They fail to understand that their undying support for Democrats basically means that they are taken for granted. Unfortunately, “progressive” organizations endorsed Van Hollen and Clinton, even though their platforms include support for fracking and war and only partial solutions to the crises in education, healthcare and other human rights violations. This support and undying commitment of so-called “progressive” organizations to the Democratic Party defies logic. 
Adebayo: In your opinion, how can the Green Party use the momentum of your state campaign as well as the national Stein/Baraka campaign to create a more effective popular grass-roots movement? 
Flowers: It is already happening. New Green Party locals are forming around the state of Maryland. The current locals are growing. Many of the people who are involved in the locals are also involved in advocacy and activism, so there is a natural synergy. It is our task now to continue to nurture and grow that for the next election and to encourage greater collaboration and visibility of the Green Party with local movements. 
Personally, my next focus will be to stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). We are organizing to stop it from being ratified by Congress after the election. If we stop that, it will be a huge victory of popular power over corporate power. We can build off that to encourage more people to rise up and demand that the political agenda protect people and the planet. 
Adebayo: How do third party organizations, such as the Green Party, fight the political, financial and media dominance of the two major corporate parties? 
Flowers: This is a David and Goliath fight, but we have truth and justice on our side. The message of the Green Party resonates with people because we talk about real issues that they experience in their lives and solutions that they want to see. We are working to expose the media blackout and to encourage people to demand that the media and debates are more inclusive. And we are learning to use social media platforms to reach people. One aspect of the campaign that is very heartening is the commitment of the volunteers. People are donating their skills in filmmaking and graphic design. People are doing regular outreach and visibility actions across the state. It is truly amazing and it energizes me to see it. 
Adebayo: As you reflect on your Senate campaign, what strategies worked best to encourage activism and what stratagems could you have employed to elicit more public support? 
Flowers: Running a statewide campaign is a challenge. Some of the best experiences that I had were doing one-on-one outreach around the state. I would definitely do more of that if I ran again. And holding volunteer training sessions is critical for people to develop comfort with outreach strategies. I am sure that there is more that I could do, but at this point I am still focused on completing this campaign. Then we will debrief more.

9479,Superdelegates Sink Bernie Sanders. Will He Sink Them? - The New York Times,"Each week, Nate Cohn, The Upshot’s elections analyst, and Toni Monkovic, an Upshot editor, will discuss the 2016 race and post a lightly edited transcript of their written exchange. In trying to stop Donald Trump, Republicans could not turn to their superdelegates  —   because they didn’t exist. That may be the best argument for Democrats to keep such a body, and yet superdelegates have never seemed in so much danger. Bernie Sanders says he will campaign to win over superdelegates, despite their verdict against him on Monday night, then hopes to eliminate them in future elections. But first up in this week’s conversation, the big news from Monday: Hillary Clinton, with the help of those superdelegates, was declared the presumptive Democratic nominee. Toni According to your article late tonight (Monday) the Clinton team didn’t seem to want to have the clinching occur with the help of superdelegates. They would have preferred to win with votes in Tuesday’s elections. Nate Yeah, it’s hard to think of many worse ways for Hillary Clinton to get here. Here’s this historic moment  —   the first woman to win a major party nomination  —   and it catches everyone by surprise, and they have to downplay it. It feeds into the notion that the whole thing is rigged. Toni Bernie Sanders is going to feel enormous pressure to end this race. But a victory in California and maybe a few other states would be the ultimate rejoinder. It’s still possible. Besides California, he could easily win in North Dakota and South Dakota. And Montana, too? Nate I think he’s a very clear favorite in North Dakota, a caucus, and Montana, an open primary in the Mountain West. He’s a somewhat more modest favorite in South Dakota, but Clinton overperformed a bit in caucuses in neighboring Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota and Wyoming, so I wouldn’t completely write off a Clinton win in a primary there. Next up would be New Mexico, but that’s both a diverse state and a closed primary. It’s a lot harder for him. Toni Any victory would be extra sweet for him, particularly California. After Tuesday, President Obama will lean on him. Others will lean on him. It’s purely a guess, but I think he keeps going to the convention. Nate I don’t think so, Toni. Did you see what he said tonight after the networks called the race for Clinton? Toni No. Too busy editing. I’ll look it up now. Nate You didn’t miss anything! He said nothing about it. That doesn’t sound like a candidate who is going to vigorously contest the outcome. Toni This is what I found, a news release. Nate Yes, but he gave a whole speech, and he didn’t mention it once. Toni So you think he’ll drop out. How does it play out? Nate To be clear, I have no inside information. I’m just saying that, if I had to bet, I’d say that he’ll concede sometime this week or at least before the D. C. primary (June 14). Update I just think there’s a lot of evidence coming together. Jeff Merkley’s comment. Sanders having his event at 1 a. m. which is after the California polls close and after Clinton clinches pledged delegates, but before he could plausibly lead in California, given the early vote. Toni Do you think a lot of his supporters would be ready for that? Nate Not the ones that tweet at me. Toni Ha. But they’re the ones who could vote for Jill Stein and help Trump win the election. Or maybe just vote for Trump? Nate They could. They say they will, at least on Twitter. I do think that some of them will be swayed by the likes of Barack Obama, Elizabeth Warren and perhaps even Bernie himself. But not all  —   though I wonder how many of them would have voted for Obama. Toni I think almost all of them in 2008, but fewer in 2012 and fewer still as time went on and disillusionment set in. That’s one of the big questions remaining for this election: whether Sanders supporters put it behind them and eventually accept Clinton. The way it happened tonight may not help, but in the end, it may not matter. Trump could persuade Bernie supporters all by himself, and this week he seems to be doing a heck of a job. Nate Yeah, I think that’s probably right. And it is very hard to imagine how Trump is supposed to make inroads anywhere if he keeps up this pace, let alone among people who supported a Democratic socialist. Toni I still believe Bernie will fight at the convention about superdelegates. Let’s imagine that there were no superdelegates to start the campaign. That would have still left Sanders with his biggest problem. It wasn’t closed primaries, it wasn’t the media, it wasn’t superdelegates. (Not saying those played no role). It was that he was routed among black voters, who have played a hugely influential role in recent presidential campaigns. Nate I think that’s right. It’s not too much of an exaggeration to say that Clinton and Sanders were basically tied among nonblack voters, and that Clinton then built her lead on a huge margin among black voters. It allowed her to sweep the South by a huge margin  —   margins that Sanders never really countered. Toni Some Sanders supporters have been asking for proportional representation of superdelegates tied to the popular vote in each state. But that essentially gets him nowhere, right? Nate Nowhere. In fact, I’d argue it would set him back: It would lock superdelegates into the results of the primaries. Keeping the superdelegates unbound gives him a case that he’s not completely eliminated until they’ve voted. There are all sorts of arguments about how the Democratic nominating process is problematic. The superdelegates have taken a lot of flak, and there’s a solid argument for it. But this race was not close, and it was not decided by technicalities in the rules. Toni Let me defend the concept of superdelegates for a moment. It’s also, in a way, a defense of expertise. If you’re a political pro, you’re more likely to know, for example, that Sanders’s edge over Clinton in    polls against Donald Trump may not mean much. You’re also more likely to know the nuances of policy than the average person. A lot of people don’t realize this, but some    are allowed to vote in primaries. Is it elitist to think that it’s more meaningful if Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon and the Minnesota congressman Keith Ellison support Sanders  —   they are two of his superdelegates  —   than if most    do? (I have no problem with    voting, by the way). Nate Haha, well, why have elections at all then, Toni? Toni The bottom line is: Is there any value at all in having superdelegates? Nate I think so, and there are two big reasons. One is that they’re helpful in the event of a contested convention  —   say, a   race where no candidate reached 50 percent of pledged delegates, something like what the Republicans would have faced if they had used proportional delegate rules like the Democrats. My instinct is that superdelegates probably have a better chance of coordinating a solution than a bunch of unaccountable and unacquainted delegates. The other is that they’re helpful if there’s good reason to believe the dynamics of the race have fundamentally changed. Imagine, for instance, that Barack Obama had been a badly damaged candidate after the Reverend Wright tapes were released  —   say he fell far behind in national polls, or he didn’t win any remaining contests, including the ones he was supposed to win, like North Carolina or Oregon. I think superdelegates would have been justified in siding with the results of the latter primaries. Toni Yes, superdelegates are more flexible than a lot of people might think. And an indictment of Hillary Clinton is not an impossibility. But now let me play devil’s advocate. I can also envision how the superdelegate system could become untenable. If Sanders had edged Clinton by, say, two pledged delegates, it’s conceivable that the superdelegates would have overturned that verdict by the voters. They could have cited things like popular vote totals or his reliance on caucus victories. In that event, you would have had an extraordinary mess (you think Sanders supporters are upset now? ). And it makes you wonder if the idea of superdelegates is sustainable in the long run. If something like that happened, it’s easy to imagine that superdelegates would be abolished for future elections. Nate So yes, I think that’s totally possible. But you could imagine ways around this problem. Maybe superdelegates need to be “triggered”  —   say, if no candidate earns a majority of delegates, or 52 percent of delegates, or something like that. Although that wouldn’t help in the event that there’s reason to think that the race had fundamentally changed since the early contests. But as it was, it was a little ridiculous that superdelegates still loomed over a race where a candidate was winning the popular vote by 14 or so percentage points. Toni Yes, it left Sanders in the awkward position of having railed against superdelegates and then basing the entire rest of his campaign on them. What’s your feeling on the possibility of a change in the superdelegate system at the convention? A compromise to cut them significantly could be a tool for Clinton to make peace with Sanders and his supporters. Elizabeth Warren, who is a superdelegate, has come out against superdelegates, so momentum seems to be building. But getting rid of them entirely wouldn’t be easy, right? Nate I don’t have a great sense of how likely it is that they’ll change the superdelegates, but they’ve probably been more trouble than they’ve been worth to the Democrats so far. It wouldn’t surprise me if people were willing to cut or reform them in some way. Toni Staying with California, Donald Trump has spent time campaigning there (in a   state) instead of in battleground states. Is there a strategy buried in there somewhere? Or should it be called strategery? Nate I don’t think so. Can you even think of anything? Toni Not a thing. What does that say about his campaign advisers? Or probably he doesn’t listen to them. Nate Well, the reporting  —   including from The Times  —   indicates that the campaign is something of a mess right now, and that’s exactly how I’d describe their travel schedule. In recent weeks, Nate and Toni discussed claims from Sanders supporters that elections were rigged surveys showing Sanders outperforming Clinton in polling against Donald Trump and whether Elizabeth Warren could have defeated Clinton.

In a further blow to the BBC, the hippos swimming in a circle who appear before the BBC news today confirmed they had signed a deal with the National Geographic channel. 
“I know some will see this as a betrayal,” said Edna, spokeshippo for the group. “But you have to realise, the career of a performing hippo isn’t long, and we have to think of our futures.” 
It’s thought their new role will focus less on synchronised swimming and more on traditional hippo behaviours, such as wallowing in mud and gaping angrily at each other in disputes over mating rights and territory. 
“It’s all a bit vulgar, really,” Edna continued. “We’re the best of friends in real life. But it’s what the public want, so what can you do?” 
Meanwhile Rex, spokesdog for the sheepdogs who run round a circular slalom course before the news, shifted uneasily when asked if he could ever be tempted away from the BBC by people offering him biscuits or telling him he was a good boy.

9482,"Orlando Gunman Was Shot at Least 8 Times, Autopsy Finds - The New York Times","The authorities in Florida said Friday that Omar Mateen, whose June 12 rampage  at an Orlando nightclub left 49 other people dead, was shot at least eight times by police officers who responded to the deadly mass shooting. The Orange County medical examiner’s office released its report of Mr. Mateen’s autopsy on Friday, the same day local officials began to distribute their   findings about the victims of the attack, during which Mr. Mateen pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State. The 32 death reports released on Friday were the first time that the authorities so publicly cataloged and detailed the injuries of the dead. The medical examiner’s office said in a statement that it had begun notifying family members on Thursday that the reports would be released under the state’s public records law. The office said it expected to publish all of its assessments by Wednesday night. Officials reported their findings about the deaths of 28 men, including Mr. Mateen, and four women. The youngest victim whose autopsy was published was an    woman the oldest was a    man. Most of those who were killed died of multiple gunshot wounds, the autopsies showed. The placing of the shots varied some people were wounded in the head, while others were shot in the torso, and still others were struck in their arms, neck or lower extremities. It was not clear on Friday whether anyone besides Mr. Mateen had been killed from police gunfire. Citing the continuing inquiry, a spokeswoman for the Orlando police referred a request for comment to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which did not respond to a message. But Orlando’s police chief, John Mina, left open the possibility in June, when he said, “That’s part of the investigation, but here’s what I will tell you: Those killings are on the suspect. ” The reports had a certain uniformity  —   each person’s death, for instance, was declared a homicide  —   but the scores of pages also carried small hints about individual lives. One man had been wearing two beaded bracelets when he was gunned down, while another young woman had worn “an elaborate yellow metal necklace” to Pulse. Another person had carried his photo identification from the Y. M. C. A. Mr. Mateen, his autopsy report noted, had been dressed in tan pants, a holster attached to a black belt. He was struck by gunfire in several places, including the chest, the abdomen and the foot. Mr. Mateen died after a protracted standoff with the police, who feared that he would set off explosives, as he had threatened to do. Once the authorities gained access to the nightclub with the aid of an armored vehicle, officials traded gunfire with Mr. Mateen, who was 29. The medical examiner’s office said Friday that it would not discuss individual cases. But in an interview in June, the county’s chief medical examiner, Dr. Joshua D. Stephany, said it appeared that all of the victims had died quickly. “It doesn’t appear anyone suffered,” he said. “Everyone went down where they were. I don’t think anyone had prolonged suffering. ”",0
9483,Was Hillary Clinton’s Nomination Legitimate? Six Reasons to Say No - Breitbart,"Democrats are consoling themselves by claiming Donald Trump’s election is illegitimate, but they’ll do themselves and the nation a favor if they consider their own faults  —   including the    corruption in their own party and political strategy. [1. The Democrats’ rigged primary: Democrats should begin by accepting the obvious truth of a rigged primary revealed by WikiLeaks. The party’s key leaders  —   not the party’s voters  —   picked and promoted Hillary Clinton, meaning she was secretly coronated before the primary ever began. Her rival Bernie Sanders never had a chance. The “nomination” contest was theater designed to make Sanders voters accept Clinton. His voters ought to be furious at Sanders for playing along with this farce, which he most certainly did.  When Party elders shriek about nefarious Russian interference in the election process, they’re trying to distract from what the leaked DNC emails actually said, and the fact that we now know those emails are 100 percent genuine, despite early Democrat statements to the contrary. One of those shrieking claims came from Donna Brazile, who was directly involved in doctoring a primary debate by leaking questions to Clinton, not to Sanders. 2. The Democrat superdelegate system: Then there’s the openly rigged element of the Democratic primary, the superdelegate system. It is a political instrument specifically designed to shut down insurgencies and make the interests of Democrat voters secondary to the judgment of party elites, and the powerful lobbyists who manipulate them. Hillary Clinton was chosen by   donors who had already spent a fortune currying favor with her, as demonstrated by the instantaneous collapse of the Clinton “charities” the instant the Clintons had no more favors to sell. 3. The Democrat money machine: Building a titanic campaign war chest was the paramount concern of the Democrats in 2016, because they thought it  —   and their media allies  —   would give them an unbreakable headlock over the public debate. So Joe Biden was told he could not afford to get into the race. Same for Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, who barely raised enough cash to pay for a Philly cheese sandwich. Their financial kneecapping allowed Clinton to suck up hundreds of millions in campaign cash, sometimes in legally questionable ways, even as she railed against the influence of money in politics. 4. The media was part of Clinton’s campaign: It’s fun to watch Democrats wail about Russian spies using WikiLeaks to influence the election, when it’s clear the mainstream media was able to downplay the actual contents of those emails enough to keep most voters in the dark. Sure, outfits like Breitbart News did everything we could to report those revelations, but that’s nothing compared to the influence wielded by the establishment media when it gets a “narrative” avalanche rolling.  Of course the establishment media was an active participant in the rigged primary scandal. Those leaked emails from the DNC and Clinton campaign chief John Podesta reflected very, very poorly on the press. That’s something Democrats could fix  —   there’s no reason for illegitimate    coordination between their candidates and the media.  Democrat voters also should demand an end to the incestuous relationship between the media and Democratic politics because it has become as much a liability. Sure, it’s helpful to have the media in your hip pocket, but the value of that advantage is severely degraded when the public knows about it, and has lost faith in the establishment press as a result. Worse, the media enabled a weak,    candidates like Clinton to capture the Party nomination.  5. The law was bent and broken to keep Clinton in the game: Democrat voters also should be questioning the legitimacy of Clinton’s nomination because the rule of law was corrupted to preserve her political viability. Her candidacy should have ended when the email server story broke. (Really, it should have ended with the publication of Clinton Cash, but the Democrats incorrectly believed their controlled media could insulate her from the fallout of those astounding revelations.) The politicized Obama Justice Department did Democrats no favors by staving off indictments that would have taken Clinton out of the game, or by   the email investigation until her replacement became prohibitively difficult. The Obama administration perfected tactics for dragging scandal investigations out until they became “old news,” but they miscalculated and prolonged Clinton’s email scandal until it blew up like a string of demolition charges throughout the 2016 election. Before they began howling about Russian espionage, Democrats were pushing the narrative that FBI Director James Comey sabotaged Clinton’s election hopes by speaking at length about her “extremely careless” actions when he announced no charges would be recommended, and then kneecapped her again by reviving the Clinton investigation briefly during the last days of the presidential campaign. As with their narrative about WikiLeaks, Democrats are complaining that Clinton was “sabotaged” because people revealed the truth about her. They’re saying their presidential candidate could only win if damaging facts were concealed, false media narratives were perpetuated, and special exemptions from the law were granted to her. That sounds like the very definition of an illegitimate candidacy. 6. Democrats try to hack the electorate: We might also challenge the legitimacy of a political strategy that relies so heavily upon using immigration to hack the demographics of the American electorate. Before Clinton’s defeat shocked them into silence, liberal analysts were beginning to churn out a fresh wave of “Emerging Democratic Majority” pieces about how   GOP voters would never win a national election again. One of the reasons Democrats subjected the Electoral College to one of their   tantrums is that the EC makes it harder for them to hack the presidential vote with mass immigration. That’s the true significance of the observation that Clinton’s   “victory” came entirely from California.  Before the 2016 election went down, it was commonly observed that Republicans might have won the previous two presidential contests if they were still running with Ronald Reagan’s electorate this observation was used to mock Trump as foolish for pursuing an obsolete electoral strategy that could never work in the new,   America. That observation also lies behind the Democrats’ decision to downplay the economic concerns of struggling Americans, and to largely ignore the distastefully   electorates of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania in favor of outreach to immigrants, racial subgroups, gays, professionals, unmarried women, and other element of the   ‘Emerging Democratic Majority.’ If Democrats didn’t believe they had a reserve army of immigrant voters for Clinton, they might have nominated Biden or Sanders to instead win ordinary Americans to their side. Amusingly, if those immigrants didn’t exist, American voters’ incomes would be higher  —   and fewer would have been angry enough to shift their votes to the GOP’s candidate.  To sum it all up, everything about Clinton’s nomination and campaign stinks to high heaven. That’s why Democrats should try to reform their own corrupt party before they lose again in 2020, if only because they can’t overthrow the Constitution or persuade the military to install their next candidate. As President Barack Obama would say if the shoe was on the other foot, reform of the Democratic Party is the legitimate thing to do. As for Republicans,  they know that there are many other techniques that Democrats use to hack the electorate, including the Democrats’ control over the media and education systems. That’s why Republicans should work hard and fast to disable all of them, permanently, because they have a sworn duty to protect the legitimacy of our voting system.  ",0

On Saturday, the press began to figure out that they had been conned by Republicans again, but not before the Clinton email news lead in swing state newspapers. 
The “Clinton email” news leads in “almost every single one of the big swing state papers this morning,” observes Politico reporter Gabriel Debenedetti. The Clinton email news leads almost every single one of the big swing state papers this morning … pic.twitter.com/t3rEOwHNmM

The “FBI investigation!!!!” spread like wildfire last night. This is the result of the press, once again, taking Republican smoke and claiming there’s fire. 
This observation isn’t mine along. The Washington Post’s Greg Sargent pointed out that there is only an upside and no penalty for doing this — for both Republicans and the press: This is how GOP hype-ahead-of-the-facts gets rewarded by media's willful perpetuation of smoke/fire effect. Zero penalty. Only upside. https://t.co/vm0ZLTrACL

Even though early polling shows there hasn’t been an impact in swing states , and even though the majority of Americans have already made up their minds, each time her emails are brought up Hillary Clinton falls in the polls. 
A Gallup poll showed that “emails” are the most Americans have heard about Clinton. Not that she is the most qualified candidate in modern history or how her policy on paid family leave might impact them — but the emails that she was already cleared on. 
Even though one result of the Comey letter has been to energize Clinton supporters , at a time when she was facing a likely win that can create complacency, this still isn’t an acceptable practice. 
Republican FBI Director James Comey finds himself in the hot seat today after sending a letter that has no precedent, obviously would impact an election that was then just 11 days out and is now 10 days out, and actually bore no information– well, that’s inaccurate. The letter bore inaccurate smoke and innuendo that has already been cleared, but the damage has already been done. 
While Ron Fournier and others suggested that Democratic objections to this unprecedented violation of the rules by Comey was just more partisan folly, the truth is even more disturbing. 
By even suggesting that objecting to violating a longstanding rule is partisan, we are allowing the press to enable Republicans to continue pretending there is no reality. 
In reality, no matter which side of the aisle you are on, it’s a rule not to comment on ongoing investigations that could impact an election. The reasons for this are obvious and the potential ramifications for abuse are terrifying for both parties — for instance, it’s obvious that the FBI is investigating the Trump campaign for coordination with Russia, but we don’t headline that because the FBI hasn’t commented on that, because… 
To do so would violate the rule not to interfere with elections. 
So it’s really quite frightening to hear people claim objecting to violating this rule is partisan, even as the Trump campaign is benefiting from the adherence to said rule. If the rule applies to Donald Trump, it should apply to Hillary Clinton. 
Asking that this value be applied to both sides is not partisan. 
We must stick to reality. We must not allow our need to appear objective cause us to fall so far down the rabbit hole that we enable Republicans to keep drinking the no-fact Kool-Aid. 
The press did the Republican smoke is a real fire thing all through President Obama’s terms, at one point claiming he was implicated in Benghazi emails because a reporter allowed a Republican aide to read him said emails — and of course, it turned out that the emails didn’t say what the aide told the reporter. But that was learned much later and as everyone knows, a lie travels faster than the truth. 
And now American voters in swing states who read papers will think the FBI is investigating Clinton. 
So Comey’s letter did damage Hillary Clinton. Even if she wins the election, the letter damaged her and down ballot Democrats. 
The media never learns. They take Republican smoke and innuendo and treat it as fact, every time. They look like fools to those who know there was no there in the Comey letter, but the average voter doesn’t live for political updates. 
The irresponsible damage is done.

9485,"How an Iranian’s Spy Saga Ends, 6 Years Later: He’s Executed - The New York Times","When Shahram Amiri emerged from the shadows into the spotlight six years ago, he was a young Iranian scientist who suddenly appeared on YouTube from a safe house, telling a bizarre story of having been kidnapped by the Central Intelligence Agency. Then, in another video that quickly followed, his story changed: He had come to the United States voluntarily to study, but desperately missed his son back in Tehran. Soon, father and son were reunited in Iran, in a joyous scene broadcast by the Iranian government. Then Mr. Amiri disappeared, amid rumors that he had been imprisoned. Questions, of course, went unanswered: Was he a spy, recruited by the United States for his insider knowledge of the Iranian nuclear program? Or a double agent, sent by Tehran to spread disinformation, or to learn what the Americans knew? On Sunday the case took what appears to be its final turn. “Shahram Amiri was hanged for revealing the country’s top secrets to the enemy,” Gholam Hossein Mohseni Ejei, a spokesman for Iran’s Justice Ministry, told reporters in Tehran, according to international news services and the country’s state news agency. Those stories confirmed initial reports from Saturday that quoted his mother saying she had seen his body. The American, Israeli and European search to understand the scope of Iran’s nuclear program  —   an intelligence effort that continues to this day  —   has taken many bizarre turns that have already become the stuff of books and film. And the drama of Mr. Amiri’s apparent double defection came in a summer of espionage efforts against Iran gone wrong. The Stuxnet computer virus was then replicating itself around the world, which ultimately revealed the sophisticated   cyberattack on Iran’s nuclear facilities that many today see as a turning point in the use of digital attacks. But few stories were as confusing, and at moments   as Mr. Amiri’s. Among the side players was Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state, who said as Mr. Amiri was returning to Iran: “He’s free to go. He was free to come. Those decisions are his alone to make. ” Some of her emails, made public last year during the controversy over her private email server, show that her top foreign policy aide warned her that the story was about to break, but they give little insight into what happened behind the scenes. Weeks after Mr. Amiri returned to Iran, American intelligence officials described the events on conditions of anonymity to a small group of reporters. Their story was that Mr. Amiri had been a voluntary recruit, interviewed and then placed in the agency’s equivalent of a witness protection program. When he first told his C. I. A. handlers that he planned to return, they warned him, according to the intelligence agency’s account, that it would probably end with his head in a noose. Mr. Amiri was 32 years old in 2009 when he left a university post to go on what he declared was a pilgrimage to Mecca. He disappeared when he got to Medina, in Saudi Arabia. He had left his shaving kit in an empty hotel room, and the Iranians guessed that he was with the Americans  —   and they accused the United States of kidnapping. He was an unlikely spy, a bit bumbling and nervous. By all accounts, Mr. Amiri was not in the inner circle around Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, the scientist who had run the weapons side of the Iranian nuclear program. But Mr. Amiri had seen a lot he worked at the academic center of research for the Iranian program. It now appears he may have begun work as an American source while he was still in Iran. As a specialist in measuring nuclear radiation, he had been to a number of sensitive Iranian sites, all of great interest to intelligence officials. According to officials familiar with his debriefing, he was among the sources who told the Americans about the internal Iranian debate over whether the country needed a nuclear weapon or just a “threshold capability” to build one on short notice without violating the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and inviting a military backlash. By 2009, the C. I. A. had apparently decided that the chances he would be detected were rising, and offered to get him out of the country. The agency promised him $5 million and a new identity. Mr. Amiri believed his estranged wife would never leave Iran, and he decided to go alone, without his son. After he was interviewed in Washington, he ended up near Tucson, under the agency’s national resettlement program, which provides cover and protection for cooperative foreign spies. But he immediately missed his young son, and began calling home. Iranian intelligence agencies pressured his family, and by one account threatened to harm his son. They told Mr. Amiri to make a videotape claiming he had been kidnapped. He did, using a webcam to declare that he had been kidnapped in Medina “in a joint operation by the terror and abduction units” of the C. I. A. and Saudi Arabia’s intelligence service. ” He said he had been drugged and tortured. Two months later, in 2010, the video showed up on Iranian state television. The C. I. A. made its own video with Mr. Amiri, filmed in the friendly setting of a study. In that one, Mr. Amiri contradicted what he had said in the first. “I am free here,” he said, “and I assure everyone that I am quite safe. ” His estranged wife told Iranian television that the second video must have been faked. “He was reading text,” she said. A few weeks later the Iranians broadcast a third video, in which Mr. Amiri returned to the story that he had been kidnapped, but had escaped his captors. Behind the scenes, Mr. Amiri was telling his handlers that he had made a mistake by defecting, and only wanted to return to see his son. He was warned of what had happened to Soviet defectors  —   prison and potentially execution  —   who had returned. The C. I. A. ’s resettlement program has clear rules that if a defector wants to return home, there is no legal basis for the United States to force him to stay. So in July 2010, Mr. Amiri ended up in a taxi to a side office of the Pakistani Embassy in Northwest Washington, near the vice president’s residence. (In the absence of diplomatic relations between Iran and the United States, Pakistan represents Iran’s interests.) He landed in Tehran on July 15, 2010, and his young son was there to embrace him. The heartwarming picture was broadcast throughout the country. Mr. Amiri told Iranian journalists that he had been offered millions of dollars to stay in the United States and reveal all he knew about the nuclear program, but had not done so. He told interviewers that he had never been in the two most sensitive Iranian nuclear sites, at Natanz and Fordo. Weeks later, he disappeared. His mother said on the BBC Persian service over the weekend that he had initially been sentenced to 10 years in prison, though Iranian officials had never announced that. Last month, she said, that punishment was changed to a death sentence. She said he had tried to console her, saying he would finally be free and at peace.",0
9486,E.U. Leaders Chart Future as David Cameron Leaves Brussels - The New York Times,"BRUSSELS  —   With Britain’s prime minister omitted for the first time, European Union leaders at a summit meeting wrestled on Wednesday with an existential question: how to salvage a venture that has provided peace and relative prosperity to 500 million people but has lost public support. “We all need to wake up and smell the coffee,” President Dalia Grybauskaite of Lithuania said at the start of private talks in Brussels on how to relaunch the European Union after the shock of Britain’s vote last week to leave. In the absence of Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, who was already back in London after attending an initial day of talks, the group’s remaining 27 leaders all agreed that the European Union needs to change the way it works if it is to curb a rising tide of populism driven in large part by hostility toward Brussels. Presenting the leaders with his own analysis of why 52 percent of Britons had voted to withdraw from the European Union, Mr. Cameron, at a somber dinner late Tuesday, said the main reason was immigration. Polls in other countries show deep opposition to an influx of foreigners. But reducing immigration, or at least the right of European Union citizens to move wherever they want in the bloc, is currently impossible, because the free movement of citizens is an inviolable principle of the whole European project. At the same time, slowing the flow of migrants from outside Europe is something that officials in Brussels consider a notable success. It took a long time and many meetings, but, under a controversial deal with Turkey, last year’s flood of nearly a million people into Europe through Greek islands has slowed to a trickle. Migrants are still arriving in Europe after hazardous journeys across the Mediterranean from North Africa, but they are far fewer than the number who arrived last year through Greece  —   the people used by campaigners in Britain to rally opposition to the European Union. With no easy fixes to Europe’s public image and no consensus on what a reformed union might look like, the main agreement reached on Wednesday was familiar: to hold another meeting in Bratislava, Slovakia, in September. In a final statement, the leaders acknowledged that the British referendum “creates a new situation for the European Union,” and that “many people express dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs. ” Europeans, they added, “expect us to do better when it comes to providing security, jobs and growth, as well as hope for a better future. ” Changing a complicated system that has three presidents, two seats of Parliament in cities hundreds of miles apart and, at least until Britain formally departs, 28 member countries, was never going to be decided in a few hours. “The response to this new challenge for Europe will take time to find,” Frans Timmermans, a former foreign minister of the Netherlands and the first vice president of the union’s executive arm, the European Commission, cautioned earlier this week. “We must be brutally honest with ourselves as we debate the path forward. Today, there are more questions than answers. ” François Lafond, a professor of European integration at Sciences Po, the Paris university, said the task of finding answers was so big that it should be entrusted to a special convention of experts and officials who would be given at least six months to create a new approach. Otherwise, “the populists will continue to grow,” he said. “We have to give a clear signal of change. ” A critical issue, Mr. Lafond said, is which functions should be returned to individual nations and which should fall within the powers of the union. Arguments over this division of labor have dogged the   European project since it began more than six decades ago in response to World War II, and have caused numerous crises. One of the most serious came in 1965, when President Charles de Gaulle of France objected to proposals from Brussels that he saw as weakening national sovereignty and pushing Europe toward becoming a giant state. Infuriated by what he viewed as an intolerable infringement, he pulled French officials from the Brussels institutions of what was then the European Economic Community. Their departure, a narrow, bureaucratic version of Britain’s, became known as the empty chair crisis. It was resolved, as most European crises have been, through   haggling and an elaborate compromise ensuring that France would retain its national   prerogatives on major issues. The crisis unleashed by the British vote, however, offers no bureaucratic fix, as it involves what have long been the European project’s most vulnerable points: its remoteness from ordinary people and lack of democratic legitimacy. The European Parliament, elected by popular vote since 1979, was meant to fill this gap. But given no power to actually introduce legislation, it is mostly seen as a noisy, expensive forum that merely approves measures proposed by the Commission. Perhaps the most significant role played by the European Parliament has been to provide a megaphone for some of the union’s most impassioned enemies, notably politicians from the U. K. Independence Party, or UKIP. The party  —   whose leader, Nigel Farage, and 23 followers hold seats in the assembly  —   campaigned fervently for Britain’s exit from the European Union. They and allies like Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London, call the European Union a meddling and alien force, a message that has resounded elsewhere, particularly France. Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s   National Front party, wants the nation to hold its own referendum. France’s deeply unpopular Socialist president, François Hollande, who is struggling to rescue his own political future as well as Europe’s, said on Wednesday that drastic change was needed. “Keeping the status quo would be the worst,” he said, “because populists would continue to challenge Europe. ” But many of the things Mr. Hollande and   European politicians want to see, such as more pooling of resources from shared European funds  —   are anathema to Germany, the dominant power on the Continent, which wants to enforce fiscal prudence but resists moving toward a federal state. Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany shut the door on any overhaul involving the revision of European treaties, a laborious process that requires referendums and has often stoked   sentiment. Ms. Merkel said Europe needed to recover its élan and inspire ordinary citizens with an ambitious vision, as the United States did with its space program. “When Russia, many years ago, sent the first people into space, America said, ‘Now we have to send someone to the moon,’” Ms. Merkel said, citing an observation she said a fellow leader had made in private discussions. “So we have to set a positive agenda, positive goals, and try to show we have an ambition, an aspiration to produce prosperity for our people. ”",0
9487,Demonic Possession Today (Part 1),"Part 1 : The Six Stages of the Exorcism Process By LOBRO VAN HELSING PART 1 of this article is authored entirely by Lobro van Helsing and consists largely of graphic details about the exorcism process as described by Malachi Martin in his controversial book, Hostage to the Devil . PART 2 of the article, entitled ‘The Deceiver of the World’, is by Lasha Darkmoon and continues where Part 1 leaves off. This reflects on various apocalyptic issues, such as Armageddon and the Last Days, the problem of good and evil, and the role of the Jews in human history. 
“The Devil’s finest trick is to persuade you that he does not exist.” — Charles Baudelaire 
Why is it so hard to accept, at least hypothetically, that in the words of observant thinkers like Baudelaire, the Devil’s finest trick is to convince us that he does not exist? 
It is generally accepted that the Devil preys on human souls. And what do predators do in all the settings, natural, political, online? They all use disguise and it shouldn’t be beyond comprehension that the Devil, if he existed, would use whichever cloak of invisibility was the most effective for the occasion. Therefore, not seeing the Devil or sensing his presence, proves absolutely nothing. 
For those who are interested, the material here comes from a book, Hostage To The Devil , by Father Malachi Martin, a trained exorcist in the Roman Catholic tradition. 
Fr Malachi’s material, featuring several cases of authentic demonic possession and their accompanying exorcisms in modern day America, was carefully vetted through use of tape recorders and reinforced later on by lengthy interviews with the participants in the exorcism process. — § — 
In 1906 in South Africa , Clara Germana Cele, age 16, reportedly made a pact with the Devil. As a result, her behavior suddenly took a bizarre turn for the worse. In August of that year, the startled nuns at the convent school where Clara was a student witnessed her tearing at her clothes, growling like an animal, and engaging in conversation with unseen entities. 
Nuns reported that the girl’s skin would burn when sprinkled with holy water. She would lash out violently when crosses or other sacred objects entered her presence.She also reportedly developed clairvoyant powers and was able to describe personal details of other people’s lives that she couldn’t possibly have known ab out. 
The accounts of several nuns also reported that Clara possessed the ability to speak and understand several different foreign languages to which she had never been exposed, including Polish, German, French, and several others. It was said that Clara had been imbued with superhuman strength as well, easily overpowering authority figures at the school when they attempted to restrain her. 
Another seemingly far-fetched assertion from many witnesses was that Clara began levitating up to five feet in the air on a regular basis, her clothes sticking to her body as if they too had managed to defy the laws of gravity. It was claimed that only after being sprinkled with holy water could she be brought back down, during which time she would also temporarily snap out of her possessed state. 
Most outlandish of all were the claims that the young woman had the ability to transform into a sort of snakelike creature, her body becoming as flexible as rubber as she slithered across the floor. At one point she was said to have bitten a nun on the arm and left puncture marks like those of a serpent’s fangs. 
(See here ) 
Note. This case history is not to be found in Malachi Martin’s Hostage to the Devil. I have added it to the article as an afterthought, since it contains within it many of the typical features found in demonic possession. Before you read any further, please watch this 2-minute video in Spanish with English subtitles. WARNING. This article contains material that is deeply disturbing. Those of sensitive disposition are advised to refrain from further reading. 
Apart from the quoted extracts, randomly chosen among many to illustrate various aspect of possession or exorcism, I wish to make the following points: Although the book deals only with cases in the Catholic community, demonic possession is a universal phenomenon and has been noted and researched in countries all over the world. The Possessor (often referring to itself as “the Kingdom” or in plural as “We”) selects victims gripped in some spiritual, emotional and intellectual conflict with the accepted mores of family, society and church, inserting itself undetected into these fault lines and exploiting them with catastrophic consequences. Loss of self identity, soul, or personality follows as a result. There is invariably an element of guilt on the part of the victim who has initially invited possession by his or her aberrant behavior and life style. In extreme cases, the possessed individual has actually made a formal request for possession in order to gain some advantage, e.g., worldly wealth or fame. The process of expelling the possessing malignancy moves through identifiable stages. 
“One of the most experienced exorcists I have known,” Malachi Martin notes, “who was in fact the mentor of the exorcist in the first case related in this book, gave names to the various general stages of an exorcism. These names reflect the general meaning or effect or intent of what is happening, but not the specific means used by the evil spirit or by the exorcist. Conor, as I call him, spoke of six stages: Presence, Pretense, Breakpoint, Voice, Clash, and Expulsion . Exorcism exacts practically intolerable toll on the priest in charge, not infrequently resulting in his death, at which point the junior helper must take over the task. Demonic possession is not an isolated or freak phenomenon. It seems to be on the rise, especially in the United States. Perhaps this has something to do with the demise of religious authority, the proliferation of Satanist covens, child abuse and sacrifice, the prevalence and glorification of Satanist elements in pop culture, and, finally, the wide acceptance and promotion of sexual perversion as a new norm. 
“The incidence of Exorcism,” Fr. Martin begins by pointing out, “has been on a steady rise. There has been a 750 percent increase in the number of Exorcisms performed between the early 1960s and the mid-1970s. Over the same period, there has been an alarming increase in the number of requested Possessions – that is, cases in which the Possessed formally request Satan to possess them — in comparison to the cases of incurred Possessions, which result from other sorts of activities of the Possessed that facilitate Possession. 
Each year, some 800 to 1,300 major Exorcisms and some thousands of minor Exorcisms are performed. For experts in the field, this is a sobering barometer of the increase in known cases of Possession. But it is still more sobering to realize how many more cases of Possession cannot be addressed at all. The thousands of letters I receive from people who are desperate for help — Catholic, Protestant, Evangelical, and unchurched — are eloquent, anguished, and a steadily mounting testimony to the crisis. 
Law officers, meanwhile, are increasingly confronted on every side by the incontrovertible signs of crimes committed in the course of ritualistic Satanism, or as a grisly result of an individual’s participation in such rituals. They are very often left out of the shrunken loop of expert advice and assistance. Advice and assistance that was once routinely to be found. 
To those who are active in the field of Exorcism, and who therefore acquire a greater than usual ability to uncover and recognize the marks of ritualistic Satanism for what they are, it is clear that in many police precincts the Satanist character of a crime is either relegated to the background or not mentioned at all — at least not in public reports. 
By and large, the police have no other choice. They have neither competence nor authority in the rarefied and dangerous field of Satanist behavior.” Most of the above points were made on numerous occasions in mythology and folklore, e.g., vampires, werewolves, and the tale of Dr Faustus adapted by Marlowe and Goethe. Jesus Christ was of course the Grand Exorcist, not only in the Gadarene swine incident but his opus seems to me to have been focused on confronting the Devil in Judaism for which he paid with his life … the tale does not end there in my view but I leave these speculative elements to the reader. — § — THE SIX STAGES OF DEMONIC POSSESSION 
From the moment the exorcist enters the room, a peculiar feeling seems to hang in the very air. From that moment in any genuine exorcism and onward through its duration, everyone in the room is aware of some alien Presence . This indubitable sign of possession is as unexplainable and unmistakable as it is inescapable. All the signs of possession, however blatant or grotesque, however subtle or debatable, seem both to pale before and to be marshaled in the face of this Presence. 
There is no sure physical trace of the Presence, but everyone feels it. You have to experience it to know it; you cannot locate it spatially- beside or above or within the possessed, or over in the corner or under the bed or hovering in midair. 
In one sense, the Presence is nowhere, and this magnifies the terror, because there is a presence, an other present. Not a “he” or a “she” or an “it.” Sometimes, you think that what is present is singular, sometimes plural. When it speaks, as the exorcism goes on, it will sometimes refer to itself as “I” and sometimes as “WE.” 
This is reminiscent of the possessing entity in the Gospel who, when asked his name by Jesus, replied: “I am Legion.” ‘I AM LEGION.’ 
Invisible and intangible, the Presence claws at the humanness of those gathered in the room. You can exercise logic and expel any mental image of it. You can say to yourself: “I am only imagining this. Careful! Don’t panic!” And there may be a momentary relief. But then, after a time lag of bare seconds, the Presence returns as an inaudible hiss in the brain, as a wordless threat to the self you are. Its name and essence seem to be compounded of threat, to be only and intensely baleful, concentratedly intent on hate for hate’s sake and on destruction for destruction’s sake. — § — 
In the early stages of an exorcism , the evil spirit will make every attempt to “hide behind” the possessed, so to speak-to appear to be one and the same person and personality with its victim. This is the Pretense . 
The first task of the priest is to break that Pretense, to force the spirit to reveal itself openly as separate from the possessed-and to name itself, for all possessing spirits are called by a name that generally (though not always) has to do with the way that spirit works on its victim. 
As the exorcist sets about his task, the evil spirit may remain silent altogether; or it may speak with the voice of the possessed, and use past experiences and recollections of the possessed. This is often done skillfully, using details no one but the possessed could know. It can be very disarming, even pitiful. It can make everyone, including the priest, feel that it is the priest who is the villain, subjecting an innocent person to terrible rigors. Even the mannerisms and characteristics of the possessed are used by the spirit as its own camouflage. 
Sometimes the exorcist cannot shatter the Pretense for days. But until he does, he cannot bring matters to a head. If he fails to shatter it at all, he has lost. Perhaps another exorcist replacing him will succeed. But he himself has been beaten. Every exorcist learns during Pretense that he is dealing with some force or power that is at times intensely cunning, sometimes supremely intelligent, and at other times capable of crass stupidity (which makes one wonder further about the problem of singular or plural); and it is both highly dangerous and terribly vulnerable. 
Oddly, while this spirit or power or force knows some of the most secret and intimate details of the lives of everyone in the room, at the same time it also displays gaps in knowledge of things that may be happening at any given moment of the present. 
But the priest must not be lulled by small victories or take chances on hoped-for stupidities. He must be ready to have his own sins and blunders and weaknesses put into his mind or shouted in ugliness for all to hear. He must not make excuses for his past, or wither as even his loveliest memories are fingered by ultimate filth and contempt; he must not be sidetracked in any way from his primary intention of freeing the possessed person before him. And he must at all costs avoid trading abuse or getting into any logical arguments with the possessed. The temptation to do so is more frequent than one might think, and must be regarded as a potentially fatal trap that can shatter not only the exorcism, but quite literally shatter the exorcist as well. 
Accordingly, as the Pretense begins to break down, the behavior of the possessed usually increases in violence and repulsiveness. It is as though an invisible manhole opens, and out of it pours the unmentionably inhuman and the humanly unacceptable. There is a stream of filth and unrestrained abuse, accompanied often by physical violence, writhing, gnashing of teeth, jumping around, sometimes physical attacks on the exorcist. — § — 
A new hallmark of the proceedings enters as the Breakpoint nears, and ushers in one of the more subtle sufferings the exorcist must undergo: confusion. Complete and dreadful confusion. Rare is the exorcist who does not falter here for at least a moment, enmeshed in the peculiar pain of apparent contradiction of all sense. 
His ears seem to smell foul words. His eyes seem to hear offensive sounds and obscene screams. His nose seems to taste a high-decibel cacophony. Each sense seems to be recording what another sense should be recording. Each nerve and sinew of onlookers and participants becomes rigid as they strive for control. Panic-the fear of being dissolved into insanity-runs in quick jabs through everyone there. All present experience this increasingly violent and confusing assault. But the exorcist is the one who rides the storm. He is the direct target of it all. 
The Breakpoint is reached at that moment when the Pretense has finally collapsed altogether. The voice of the possessed is no longer used by the spirit, though the new, strange voice may or may not issue from the mouth of the victim. In Thomas Wu’s case, the alien voice did come from the possessed’s mouth; and that was why the police captain was so startled. The sound produced is often not even remotely like any human sound. 
At the Breakpoint, for the first time, the spirit speaks of the possessed in the third person, as a separate being. For the first time, the possessing spirit acts personally and speaks of “I” or “we,” usually interchangeably, and of “my” and “our” or “mine” and “ours.” 
Another very frequent sign that the Breakpoint has been reached is the appearance of what Father Conor called the Voice . 
The Voice is an inordinately disturbing and humanly distressing babel. The first few syllables seem to be those of some word pronounced slowly and thickly-somewhat like a tape recording played at a subnormal speed. You are just straining to pick up the word and a layer of cold fear has already gripped you-you know this sound is alien. But your concentration is shattered and frustrated by an immediate gamut of echoes, of tiny, prickly voices echoing each syllable, screaming it, whispering it, laughing it, sneering it, groaning it, following it. They all hit your ear, while the alien voice is going on unhurriedly to the next syllable, which you then try to catch, while guessing at the first one you lost. By then, the tiny, jabbing voices have caught up with that second syllable; and the voice has proceeded to the third syllable; and so on. 
If the exorcism is to proceed, the Voice must be silenced. It takes an enormous effort of will on the part of the exorcist, in direct confrontation with the alien will of evil, to silence the Voice. The priest must get himself under control and challenge the spirit first to silence and then to identify itself intelligibly. 
As in all things to do with Exorcism of Evil Spirit, the priest makes this challenge with his own will, but always in the name and by the authority of Jesus and his Church. To do so in his own name or by some fancied authority of his own would be to invite personal disaster. Merely human power unadorned and without aid cannot cope with the preternatural. (It is to be remembered that when we speak of the preternatural, we are not speaking about what are known as poltergeists.) 
Usually, at this point and as the Voice dies out, a tremendous pressure of an obscure kind affects the exorcist. This is the first and outermost edge of a direct and personal collision with the “will of the Kingdom,” the Clash . 
We all know from our personal experience that there can be no struggle of single personal wills without that felt and intuitive contact between two persons. There is a two-way communication that is as real as a conversation using words. The Clash is the heart of a special and dreadful communication, the nucleus of this singular battle of wills between exorcist and Evil Spirit. — § — 
Painful as it will be for him, the priest must look for the Clash. He must provoke it. If he cannot lock wills with the evil thing and force that thing to lock its will in opposition to his own, then again the exorcist is defeated. 
The issue between the two, the exorcist and the possessing spirit, is simple. Will the totally antihuman invade and take over? Will it, noisome and merciless, seep over that narrow rim where the exorcist would hold his ground alone, and engulf him? Or will it, unwillingly, protestingly, under a duress greater than its single-track will, stop, identify itself, cede, retire, disappear, and be volatilized back into an unknown pit of being where no man wants to go ever? 
Even with all the pressure on him, and in fullest human agony, if the exorcist has got this far, he must press home. He has gained an advantage. He has already forced the evil spirit to come out on its own. If he has not been able to until now, he must finally force it to give its name. And then, some exorcists feel, the exorcist must pursue for as much information as he can. For in some peculiar way, as exorcists find, the more an evil spirit can be forced to reveal in the Clash and its aftermath, the surer and easier will be the Expulsion when that moment comes. To force as complete an identification as possible is perhaps a mark of domination of one will over another. 
It is of crucial interest to speculate about the violence provoked by Exorcism-the physical and mental struggles that are so extreme they can bring on death. Why would spirit battle so? Why not leave and waft off invisibly to someone or someplace else? For spirit itself seems to suffer in these battles. 
Time and again, in exorcism after exorcism, there occurs that curious thing to do with spirit and place, the strange puzzle mentioned previously in connection with the room chosen for the exorcism. When Jesus expelled the unclean spirits, those spirits showed concern for where they might go. In record after record, as well as in several exorcisms recounted in this book, the possessing spirits wail in lament and questioning pain: “Where shall we go?”“We too have to possess our habitation.”“Even the Anointed One gave us a place with the swine.”“Here . . . we can’t stay here any longer.” 
Evil Spirit, having found a home with a consenting host, does not appear to give up its place easily. It claws and fights and deceives and even risks killing its host before it will be expelled. How violent the struggle probably depends on many things; the intelligence of the spirit being dealt with and the degree of possession achieved over the victim are perhaps two one could speculate about. 
Whatever determines the actual pitch of violence, once the exorcist has forced the invading spirit to identify itself, and sustained the first wordless bout of the Clash, and then invoked its formal condemnation and expulsion by the Exorcism rite, the immediate result is generally a struggle tortuous beyond/imagining, an open violence that leaves all subtlety behind. 
The person possessed is by now obviously aware in one way or another of what possessed him. Frequently he becomes a true battleground for much of the remainder of the exorcism, enduring unbelievable punishment and strain. 
It is sometimes possible for the exorcist to appeal directly to the possessed person, urging him to use some part of his own will still free of the spirit’s influence and control, and engage directly in the fight, aiding the exorcist. And at such moments no animal pinned helplessly to the ground struggles more pathetically against the drinking of its life’s blood by a voracious and superior cruelty. The very nauseous character of the possessed person’s appearance and behavior appears to be a sign of his desire for deliverance, a desperate sign of struggle, evidence of a revolt where once he had consented. 
Increasingly what had possessed him is being forced into the open, all the while protesting its victim’s revolt and its own expulsion. The violence of the contortions and the physical disfigurement of the possessed can reach a degree one would think he could not possibly withstand. 
The exorcist, too, comes in for full attack now. Once cornered, the evil spirit seems able to call on a superior intelligence, and will try to lure the exorcist on to a field boobytrapped and mined with situations from which no human can extricate himself. 
Any weakness in the religious faith that alone sustains the exorcist or any fatigue will allow the exorcist’s mind to be flooded with a terrible light he cannot fend off-a light that can burn the very roots of his reason and turn him emotionally into the most servile of slaves desperate to be liberated from all bodily life. 
These are only some of the dangers and traps that face every exorcist. His pain is physical, emotional, mental. He has to deal with what is eerie but not enthralling; with something askew, but intelligently so; with a quality that is upside down and inside out, but significantly so. The mordant traits of nightmare are there in full regalia, but this is no dream and permits him no thankful remission. 
He is attacked by a stench so powerful that many exorcists start vomiting uncontrollably. He is made to bear physical pain, and he feels anguish over his very soul. He is made to know he is touching the completely unclean, the totally unhuman . “THE TOTALLY UNHUMAN” ( CLICK TO EXPAND ) 
All sense may suddenly seem nonsense. Hopelessness is confirmed as the only hope. Death and cruelty and contempt are normal. Anything comely or beautiful is an illusion. Nothing, it seems, was ever right in the world of man. Here is an atmosphere as bizarre as Bedlam. 
If, in spite of his emotions and his imagination and his body—all trapped at once in pain and anguish—if, in spite of all this, the will of the exorcist holds in the Clash, what he does is to approach his final function in this situation as an authorized human witness for Jesus. 
By no power of his, on account of no privilege of his own, he calls finally on the evil spirit TO DESIST, TO BE DISPOSSESSED, TO DEPART! — AND TO LEAVE THE PERSON POSSESSED. 
And, if the exorcism is successful, this is what happens. The possession ends. 
All present become aware of a change around them. The sense of Presence is totally, suddenly absent. 
Sometimes there are receding voices or other noises, sometimes only dead silence. 
The recently possessed will wake up as if from a dream, a nightmare, a coma. Sometimes he will remember much of what he has been through; sometimes he will remember nothing at all. — § — Many people could be demonically possessed without knowing it. Here are two individuals who, in my opinion, might benefit from the ministrations of a good exorcist: IS THIS WOMAN DEMONICALLY POSSESSED? Who knows? . . . but many have said so. (Click here for a spooky 2-minute video) IS THIS WOMAN DEMONICALLY POSSESSED? Who knows? . . . but many have thought so. Apart from the demonic expression that disfigures her face, this woman preaches White genocide—the total destruction of the European race. What more do you have to do to qualify for demonic possession? (See HERE for more details on Barbara Spectre’s psychopathy and compare the expression on her face with Figure 1 of this illustration from a medical textbook on demonic possession ) . As I wrote in a recent email to Lasha Darkmoon: “I feel that the entire tribe of Judah is demonically possessed. They always have been for centuries. Jesus made that point over and over again in his homilies. And clearly the Jews’ works bear that out. They are now the Devil’s agents on Earth to promote his policies and spread contagion into the body of the goyim. History bears me out on this.” 
I will not quote Dr Darkmoon’s response here. It is too long and would require a separate article of its own. Suffice to say that she disagreed with me on several counts, though she accepted my general premise that demonic possession was an authentic and veridical phenomenon and not just a superstitious relic of the Dark Ages.

9489,New York Democrat Pressures CUNY over Hosting Pro-Sharia BDS Activist Linda Sarsour,"A leading New York City Democrat is calling on fellow progressives to recognize Sharia law advocate and CUNY commencement speaker Linda Sarsour as a bigot. [“I want to emphasize that Linda’s statements on social media and at rallies are Linda’s —   she owns them,” Rory Lancman  —   a member of the New York City Council from Queens  —   told the Algemeiner. “They have a history of antisemitism, of    —   if you can believe that is something someone would still traffic in, in 2017  —   and of hostility and threats towards people who disagree with her. ”  Lancman told the Algemeiner that it was “inappropriate” for CUNY’s Graduate School of Public Health to host Sarsour, a Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions activist (BDS) given her statements against Jews and other women. In the past, Sarsour has tweeted that “nothing is creepier than Zionism” and said that   writers Brigitte Gabriel and Ayaan Hirsi Ali deserve an “a$$ whipping” and that she wishes she could have their “vaginas taken away” for their opposition to Sharia law, which she supports: Twitter is forever: Women’s March leader Linda Sarsour wants to grab Ayaan Hirsi Ali by the p*ssy. pic. twitter.   —   SHIREEN QUDOSI (@ShireenQudosi) January 26, 2017,  Yet Sarsour has many progressive supporters who reportedly insist she is the victim of   advocates. Despite her   rhetoric, the TAlgemeiner reported that, at a small rally organized by progressive groups in Lower Manhattan on Monday, speakers rejected the allegation that Sarsour is an antisemite. In an   for the Daily News, leftist Rabbis Barat Ellman and Ellen Lippmann argued, “Linda Sarsour is a friend to Jews. ” They wrote, “Yes, Sarsour is an ardent critic of Zionism  —   which should come as no surprise for a   with relatives in Palestine. But she has been clear that it is   Zionism  —   Zionism that dismisses Palestinian claims to a national identity or for statehood  —   that she vehemently opposes. ” Zionism is the belief that Israel is the established and rightful homeland of the Jews. The rabbi duo then goes on to suggest, “Sarsour’s retort  —   that Ali and others she disagrees with ‘don’t deserve to be women,’ so she wishes she could ‘take their vaginas away’  —   was written in anger, and we agree it wasn’t nice,” adding, “But it was not meant to be taken literally, and is hardly proof that she wants to assault Muslims who disagree with her or surgically strike women’s bodies. ” In conclusion, Ellman and Lippmann said, “CUNY wants to honor a leader at commencement. We say amen. ” Lancman told the Algemeiner, “That whole   was an absurd whitewash, and that sentence in particular. It was embarrassing for anyone who purports to be involved with women’s rights. ” Democrat New York Assemblyman Dov Hikind ( ) has also been critical of Sarsour. He created a video asking her to answer questions about her troubling statements and associations. In addition to the noted statements, he asked Sarsour, “You think this is a courageous act to pick up rocks and throw them at cars?” in response to Sarsour’s tweet: The definition of courage. #Palestine pic. twitter.   —   Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) October 12, 2015,  Hikind noted that those rocks have seriously injured people and killed people in cars. In 2013, a    girl died after the car she was in was attacked by rocks. Adele Biton was in a coma for two years before succumbing to her injuries and developing pneumonia.

9490,"Hampton Creek, Maker of Just Mayo, Is Said to Be Under Inquiry - The New York Times","Hampton Creek, a prominent   that is trying to bring tech industry panache to the world of mayonnaise, ranch dressing and other food products, has come under scrutiny by regulators for its business practices. The Securities and Exchange Commission has opened a preliminary inquiry into Hampton Creek, according to a person briefed on the situation who asked not to be named because it had not been announced publicly. The S. E. C. inquiry is a response to a recent report from Bloomberg News that described an organized effort by Hampton Creek to buy large quantities of its Just Mayo product  —   a mayonnaise that uses a   ingredient instead of eggs  —   by sending undercover contractors into stores. Kevin J. Callahan, a spokesman for the S. E. C. declined to comment. Bloomberg earlier reported the S. E. C. inquiry. Hampton Creek’s chief executive, Joshua Tetrick, said he had heard from the S. E. C. about the informal inquiry but declined to give further details. Bloomberg’s report said the product buyback effort, which took place in 2014, made Just Mayo seem more popular than it was, not long before Hampton Creek raised $90 million from venture capitalists and other private investors. The basic details of the program were confirmed by a former Hampton Creek employee, who asked for anonymity because of confidentiality restrictions with his onetime employer. After the report, Mr. Tetrick wrote in a blog post that the mayonnaise shopping spree was part of a quality control program that had minimal impact on overall sales. The inquiry puts a cloud over Hampton Creek, which has described itself as the   food company in the world. It has promised to tackle the food industry with the gusto of a technology   using some of the same big data tools to do so. One of its goals is to identify healthy,   ingredients that can substitute for common foods like eggs, with less of a negative impact on the environment. Hampton Creek, based in San Francisco, has been praised by the likes of Bill Gates received financial backing from prominent Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and investors like Marc Benioff and Vinod Khosla and succeeded in getting its products widely distributed at Walmart, Costco, Whole Foods and other retailers. The inquiry may be only the start of tougher questions facing Hampton Creek. The company is believed to be losing significant amounts of money. It is raising up to $220 million from investors, according to a Delaware filing provided by Equidate, which tracks private company shares. It’s not uncommon, of course, for   to bleed red ink in their early days. But Hampton Creek, founded in 2011, faces some basic challenges with the manufacturing costs for its products. According to one former employee, in 2014 the company had negative gross margins of about 20 percent on Just Mayo, meaning that the raw cost to the company for every $1 it got in sales was about $1. 20. The issue arises from Hampton Creek’s use of premium ingredients in its products without charging shoppers the often   prices attached to such food products. The vegetable oil used in Just Mayo, for example, does not come from genetically modified organism sources, which adds significant cost, according to the former employee. But on Walmart. com on Friday, a   jar of Just Mayo was selling for $3. 66  —   32 cents less than a jar of Hellmann’s mayonnaise of the same size. In an interview on Friday, Mr. Tetrick said the company planned to break even by the end of next year. “We are fortunate to be well capitalized,” he said, declining to disclose how much the company had in the bank. He added that some of Hampton Creek’s dressings, mayonnaise and food service cookie products were    meaning they generated more revenue than they cost to make. “We’re not trying to optimize at every turn, thinking, ‘What’s the margin? ’” he said. “It’s about solving the bigger food problem. You know what we do about it? We attack it. ” The company’s program to buy its own mayonnaise has raised eyebrows among retail analysts. Food makers typically do quality checks through every step of production until the product lands on grocery shelves. Kurt Jetta, chief executive of TABS Analytics, a research firm, said that while he had heard of companies buying their own products off retail shelves, in most of those cases, “it’s to jack up the sales numbers, not for quality assurance. ” He also said paying retail prices to buy products for quality assurance made “zero financial sense. ” When food companies want to move a product off a grocery shelf to replace it with a reformulated or newly packaged version or because it has passed its expiration date, they issue a credit to the store manager  —   and then only to cover the price the retailer paid, not the consumer price. Some food industry consultants, though, said it was not   for companies to buy their food products off shelves. Stericycle is a company that helps manufacturers with “audits” of their products for quality assurance purposes. “Manufacturers and retailers may need help with   resolution, including handling consumer complaints, product quality evaluation and much more, but they may not have the internal staff to handle those things quickly and efficiently,” said Kevin Pollack, vice president and general manager at Stericycle. Word of the program was mentioned briefly in a lawsuit against Hampton Creek filed this year on behalf of two former contractors for the company who were seeking unpaid wages. The contractors worked in stores in 2014 and 2015, representing Hampton Creek and handing out samples of Just Mayo to spread word of the product. But according to the lawsuit, Hampton Creek required the contractors to also “buy out shelves of Defendant’s products. ”",0

9492,Illinois House Passes Automatic Voter Registration Bill,"The Illinois House passed a bill allowing the state to register eligible voters automatically, the Associated Press (AP) reported. [The AP reports that bill passed unanimously in the House   and is now headed to the Senate to review the changes made since it passed the Senate the first time.  The bill, SB1933, would automatically register eligible voters if they visit the secretary of state’s offices or other state agencies. The bill also allows people to opt out of registering to vote. State Rep. Robyn Gabel ( ) who sponsored the bill in the House, says the bill would increase voter participation and bring the voter registration system in Illinois up to date. Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner vetoed a similar bill that passed both chambers of the legislature in 2016 because it did not go far enough to prevent voter fraud. Seven states and the District of Columbia have already passed automatic voter registration laws, according to the National Conference on State Legislatures. An analysis from the Brennan Center for Justice also notes that 32 states introduced bills aimed at implementing automatic voter registration in 2017.",0
9493,Steve Bannon Cited Italian Thinker Who Inspired Fascists - The New York Times,"ROME  —   Those trying to divine the roots of Stephen K. Bannon’s dark and at times apocalyptic worldview have repeatedly combed over a speech that Mr. Bannon, President Trump’s ideological guru, made in 2014 to a Vatican conference, where he expounded on Islam, populism and capitalism. But for all the examination of those remarks, a passing reference by Mr. Bannon to an esoteric Italian philosopher has gone little noticed, except perhaps by scholars and followers of the deeply taboo,   thinker, Julius Evola. “The fact that Bannon even knows Evola is significant,” said Mark Sedgwick, a leading scholar of Traditionalists at Aarhus University in Denmark. Evola, who died in 1974, wrote on everything from Eastern religions to the metaphysics of sex to alchemy. But he is best known as a leading proponent of Traditionalism, a worldview popular in   and alternative religious circles that believes progress and equality are poisonous illusions. Evola became a darling of Italian Fascists, and Italy’s   terrorists of the 1960s and 1970s looked to him as a spiritual and intellectual godfather. They called themselves Children of the Sun after Evola’s vision of a   new order that he called the Solar Civilization. Today, the Greek   party Golden Dawn includes his works on its suggested reading list, and the leader of Jobbik, the Hungarian nationalist party, admires Evola and wrote an introduction to his works. More important for the current American administration, Evola also caught on in the United States with leaders of the   movement, which Mr. Bannon nurtured as the head of Breitbart News and then helped harness for Mr. Trump. “Julius Evola is one of the most fascinating men of the 20th century,” said Richard Spencer, the white nationalist leader who is a top figure in the   movement, which has attracted white supremacists, racists and   elements. In the days after the election, Mr. Spencer led a Washington   conference in chants of “Hail Trump!” But he also invoked Evola’s idea of a prehistoric and   spirituality  —   referring to the awakening of whites, whom he called the Children of the Sun. Mr. Spencer said “it means a tremendous amount” that Mr. Bannon was aware of Evola and other Traditionalist thinkers. “Even if he hasn’t fully imbibed them and been changed by them, he is at least open to them,” he said. “He at least recognizes that they are there. That is a stark difference to the American conservative movement that either was ignorant of them or attempted to suppress them. ” Mr. Bannon, who did not return a request for comment for this article, is an avid and   reader. He has spoken enthusiastically about everything from Sun Tzu’s “The Art of War” to “The Fourth Turning” by William Strauss and Neil Howe, which sees history in cycles of cataclysmic and   change. His awareness of and reference to Evola in itself only reflects that reading. But some on the   consider Mr. Bannon a door through which Evola’s ideas of a hierarchical society run by a spiritually superior caste can enter in a period of crisis. “Evolists view his ship as coming in,” said Prof. Richard Drake at the University of Montana, who wrote about Evola in his book “The Revolutionary Mystique and Terrorism in Contemporary Italy. ” For some of them, it has been a long time coming. “It’s the first time that an adviser to the American president knows Evola, or maybe has a Traditionalist formation,” said Gianfranco De Turris, an Evola biographer and apologist based in Rome who runs the Evola Foundation out of his apartment. “If Bannon has these ideas, we have to see how he influences the politics of Trump,” he said. A March article titled “An Establishment Conservative’s Guide to the  ” in Breitbart, the website then run by Mr. Bannon, included Evola as one of the thinkers in whose writings the “origins of the alternative right” could be found. The article was   by Milo Yiannopoulos, the   provocateur who is wildly popular with conservatives on college campuses. Mr. Trump recently defended Mr. Yiannopoulos as a symbol of free speech after demonstrators violently protested his planned speech at the University of California, Berkeley. The article celebrated the youthful internet trolls who give the   movement its energy and who, motivated by a common and questionable sense of humor, use   and racially charged memes “in typically juvenile but undeniably hysterical fashion. ” “It’s hard to imagine them reading Evola,” the article continued. “They may be inclined to sympathize to those causes, but mainly because it annoys the right people. ” Evola, who has more than annoyed people for nearly a century, seems to be having a moment. “When I started working on Evola, you had to plow through Italian,” said Mr. Sedgwick, who keeps track of Traditionalist movements and thought on his blog, Traditionalists. “Now he’s available in English, German, Russian, Serbian, Greek, Hungarian. First I saw Evola boom, and then I realized the number of people interested in that sort of idea was booming. ” Born in 1898, Evola liked to call himself a baron and in later life sported a monocle in his left eye. A brilliant student and talented artist, he came home after fighting in World War I and became a leading exponent in Italy of the Dada movement, which, like Evola, rejected the church and bourgeois institutions. Evola’s early artistic endeavors gave way to his love of the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, and he developed a worldview with an overriding animosity toward the decadence of modernity. Influenced by mystical works and the occult, Evola began developing an idea of the individual’s ability to transcend his reality and “be unconditionally whatever one wants. ” Under the influence of René Guénon, a French metaphysicist and convert to Islam, Evola in 1934 published his most influential work, “The Revolt Against the Modern World,” which cast materialism as an eroding influence on ancient values. It viewed humanism, the Renaissance, the Protestant Reformation and the French Revolution all as historical disasters that took man further away from a transcendental perennial truth. Changing the system, Evola argued, was “not a question of contesting and polemicizing, but of blowing everything up. ” Evola’s ideal order, Professor Drake wrote, was based on “hierarchy, caste, monarchy, race, myth, religion and ritual. ” That made a fan out of Benito Mussolini. The dictator already admired Evola’s early writings on race, which influenced the 1938 Racial Laws restricting the rights of Jews in Italy. Mussolini so liked Evola’s 1941 book, “Synthesis on the Doctrine of Race,” which advocated a form of spiritual, and not merely biological, racism, that he invited Evola to meet him in September of that year. Evola eventually broke with Mussolini and the Italian Fascists because he considered them overly tame and corrupted by compromise. Instead he preferred the Nazi SS officers, seeing in them something closer to a mythic ideal. They also shared his  . Mr. Bannon suggested in his Vatican remarks that the Fascist movement had come out of Evola’s ideas. As Mr. Bannon expounded on the intellectual motivations of the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, he mentioned “Julius Evola and different writers of the early 20th century who are really the supporters of what’s called the Traditionalist movement, which really eventually metastasized into Italian Fascism. ” The reality, historians say, is that Evola sought to “infiltrate and influence” the Fascists, as Mr. Sedgwick put it, as a powerful vehicle to spread his ideas. In his Vatican talk, Mr. Bannon suggested that although Mr. Putin represented a “kleptocracy,” the Russian president understood the existential danger posed by “a potential new caliphate” and the importance of using nationalism to stand up for traditional institutions. “We, the   West,” Mr. Bannon added, “really have to look at what he’s talking about as far as Traditionalism goes  —   particularly the sense of where it supports the underpinnings of nationalism. ” As Mr. Bannon suggested in his speech, Mr. Putin’s most influential thinker is Aleksandr Dugin, the ultranationalist Russian Traditionalist and   writer sometimes called “Putin’s Rasputin. ” An intellectual descendant of Evola, Mr. Dugin has called for a “genuine, true, radically revolutionary, and consistent fascist fascism” and advocated a   theory of “Eurasianism”  —   which has provided a philosophical framework for Mr. Putin’s expansionism and meddling in Western European politics. Mr. Dugin sees European Traditionalists as needing Russia, and Mr. Putin, to defend them from the onslaught of Western liberal democracy, individual liberty, and materialism  —   all Evolian bêtes noires. This appeal of traditional values on populist voters and against    elites, the “  Union” and “centralized government in the United States,” as Mr. Bannon put it, was not lost on Mr. Trump’s ideological guru. “A lot of people that are Traditionalists,” he said in his Vatican remarks, “are attracted to that. ”",0
9494,Wife of Muslim jihadist who killed and wounded over 100 in Orlando nightclub massacre says she “knew nothing”,"BNI Store Nov 4 2016 Wife of Muslim jihadist who killed and wounded over 100 in Orlando nightclub massacre says she “knew nothing” “I was unaware of everything,” says Omar Mateen’s wife, 30-year-old Noor Salman (whose whereabouts were a matter of controversy for some time after the massacre), has given her first interview since the Pulse Nightclub massacre to the New York Times. The New York Times piece does not go into detail about her movements since the FBI seemingly lost track of her, although it suggests she is still a person of interest to law enforcement. Her lawyers pop up early in the article to insist she “did nothing wrong” and to forbid questions about her discussions with federal agents. Salman said she had no idea what Mateen was up to on the day of the attack. She knew her husband watched jihadist videos, but she did not think much of it. But how could she have not suspected what her husband was planning – she knew he had the weapons, she drove him to the nightclub and dropped him off: Noor Salman, wife of Orlando shooter Omar Mateen, had all the hallmarks of a willing accomplice to her husband’s jihadist slaughter. Georgia State University professor Mia Bloom told The Times that studies show relatives and friends are aware of budding terrorist activities about 64% of the time and argued that Mateen’s abusive relationship with Salman “doesn’t give her a free pass as a bystander to not come forward.” Salman insists she had no dark suspicions about several trips she took with Mateen that have been viewed as preparation for his terrorist career, although the lawyers notably intervened to prevent her from discussing the most notorious of these incidents – the April 2015 trip to Disneyworld that Mateen may have used to case the park for an attack. Salman did nothing to warn the police of her husband’s intentions. When the FBI first questioned Salman, she admitted to bringing Mateen ammunition and a holster. The piece describes her as “shattered and afraid,” to the point that she sometimes has trouble getting out of bed. (Awww…I bet those 49 people her husband slaughtered in cold blood in Orlando would love to have that problem)",0
9495,"For Navajo Team, a Season of Change and Challenge - The New York Times","HOLBROOK, Ariz.  —   The teenage boys amble off the school bus like so many old souls, knees and backs stiff, eyes puffy and hollowed. The previous evening this Navajo basketball troop from Chinle High School had played a rollicking game against the Monument Valley Mustangs, on the northern edge of the Navajo Nation. The boys from Chinle went on a late run and won the game. Their trip back home took three hours, their school bus rolling through moonlit mountain passes and mesas, and plains. The boys fell into bed well past midnight. Then they woke up and boarded the bus again, this time riding two hours south for a Saturday afternoon game here in Holbrook, a high prairie crossroads. These Navajo teenagers are practitioners of “rez ball,” a       style of hoops. They deeply desire a state championship. They also are perched on that precarious cliff wall between adolescence and manhood, and that brings other questions and yearnings. The seniors study college catalogs and wonder if they should leave their starkly beautiful land of family and clans, a reservation that is bigger than West Virginia. Hope and fear jostle. Nachae Nez, a    shooting guard, a senior and a fine student, sits in the bleachers and talks of a future that feels as alive as a snake in his hands. He lives in a small town tucked against the red sandstone flanks of the Chuska Mountains. He dreams of attending a   college. “They say it’s hard for natives to leave the rez,” he says. “Your favorite place if you’re a Navajo, it’s your grandmother’s hogan,” he adds, using the Navajo word for a house built in a traditional and sacred style. He pauses. “I know I need to leave if I want to be of service to my people. ” He peers at me. “These choices are painful, right?” Cooper Burbank is the youngest Chinle player, a preternaturally calm and talented freshman who deals with his own dislocation. He grew up in the red mesa northlands and attended a    middle school of 108 students. His parents  —   his mom is a teacher and his father a custodian  —   wanted him to attend a bigger school, with more course offerings, to prepare for college. So they took a hard swallow and left grandmother and cousins and clans behind and moved to Chinle, where the high school has more than 1, 000 students and the family, Cooper and parents, are outsiders. Many weekends, the Burbanks travel back to their village. “I like to go home and clear my head,” Cooper says. He adds, softly: “My life needs challenges. I know that. ” Several months ago Raul Mendoza, 69, the widely admired coach of the Wildcats, invited me to watch him try to revive the Chinle team. Last season, before he took over, the Wildcats finished   this year, the Wildcats will finish  . My wife, Evelyn, and I lived in a trailer on the Navajo Nation years ago. She was a midwife and delivered babies. We wandered this land with our young sons, and Navajo sank its hook deep into us. The chance to return and explore the passions that drive this coach and his Navajo teenagers proved irresistible. After my trip in December, I wrote of Mendoza’s story. Half Mexican and half Tohono O’odham, a child who picked cotton in the   fields of Arizona, he is a lifelong wanderer. I’ve returned to explore the lives of his teenage players. Chinle sits 5, 500 feet above sea level, west of Canyon de Chelly, where in the 1860s the Navajo held out against Kit Carson and federal troops who had come to destroy their crops and burn their homes. Basketball is a passion here. Chinle has 4, 500 residents, and its high school arena, the Wildcat Den, seats 7, 000. Fans drive and hitchhike 50, 60, 80 miles to games. Coaches are regularly tossed aside after a single losing season. Most of the teenage players observe traditional beliefs: They bow to the four sacred mountain peaks of Navajo they carry corn pollen in case their path crosses that of the coyote, a notorious trickster they swallow a bitter herb before games to guard against envy, jealousy and witchcraft. One senior wears his unshorn hair in a woven pony tail. He will cut it at age 18 and present the locks to his grandfather. As they wander canyons, they listen for the voices of ancestors. Before each game, a girl sings the national anthem in Navajo. Harsh winds blow through as well. Some parents are racked by hunger for booze and disappear others lose jobs and are evicted. The median annual income in Chinle is $27, 000. In surrounding villages, it is half that. Marcus Litson, a    senior forward with a shaggy mane and easy smile, grew up in the same town as Nachae, who is the team captain. They roamed forests and climbed sandstone buttes. In his telling, his boyhood sounds like an idyll. He also lived four years on the distant New Mexico side of the reservation. Why? “My mom and dad split, and Mom won me in seventh grade,” he says. “When I got to 16, the court made me choose who to live with. ” Marcus missed his cousins and clans, and he chose to go back to Tsaile with his father. What did his mom say? “I haven’t heard from her in a year,” he says. He turns away and whispers, “I think she took it hard. ” Darrian Yeahquo, a   junior, wanders by. His father disappeared when he was a toddler, and his mother moved the family to Albuquerque. He found city high schools tough and scary. Last spring, his grandfather, a Vietnam veteran crippled by broken knees and lingering war shock, could no longer care for his ranch and asked for help. Darrian hopped the bus to Navajo. All summer long he and a favorite cousin rode horses and tended sheep and cattle. His grandmother made sandwiches for her teenage herders and tied their lunch to a gnarled pine tree. Darrian   himself in a dream. “If I have to leave the rez to go to college, to learn irrigation to help my family and people, I will,” he says. “This time I know I am coming back. ” Nachae and Cooper remain the team pillars. Nachae feels the urgency to win that comes with a senior’s sense of time fleeting Cooper is the team’s future. After practice, they remain in the darkened arena: Cooper shoots at one end of the court Nachae shoots at the other. Mendoza walks me out of the gym. “Natives, we’re not expected to be successful, and sometimes I worry that my kids feel that way,” he says. “There’s nothing wrong with not achieving your goal, but you have to fight. ” He nods at Nachae and Cooper. “Those boys are intelligent and fight hard. ” The Wildcats remain a team half formed and maddeningly inconsistent. Sometimes forwards toss up errant   and point guards tumble toward the hoop with no discernible plan. Mendoza enjoys a tortured relationship with rez ball. He appreciates that generations of natives grew up on this   style of play. At its best, it is artful and breathtaking. He prefers when his players settle into defensive crouches, or when they pass and pass until they find an open man. “Are we going to play rez ball or are we going to play this game the right way?” he told his teenagers. “It bothers me when you can’t see the open man. ” Before I arrived, the Wildcats scored an upset of Ganado, which had been the only undefeated team on the reservation. Then they ran Monument Valley’s team off the court. They swell with confidence in Holbrook. This gym, however, is freighted with history. Mendoza once was Holbrook’s coach. He won a championship here, and Arizona coach of the year honors, and his departure still upsets some fans. Nachae played here as a freshman, and he has former teammates and friends here, and that brings pressure, too. The Wildcats begin strongly. Nachae hits a jumper and tosses down a   and drives to the basket. Cooper wrestles rebounds and hits that soft dagger of a jumper. Just as suddenly, the tempo shifts: The Wildcats throw up   jumpers. Nachae misses layups and grows frustrated. The Wildcat players stop swinging the ball to Cooper, who remains reluctant to impose his will. The game gallops away, and the Wildcats lose,  . Mendoza does not hide his displeasure. You came in here laughing, he tells his team. Your play was embarrassing. Nachae pulls his jersey up over his face. Failure pierces deeply he wants to lead. He raises his hand and says, “We’re a really good team, but we have trouble connecting with each other. ” Cooper listens, his face opaque. On Sunday morning, a photographer and I drive north to Rock Point. We join Cooper and his family at a God’s Grace Fellowship church on a rutted dirt road two miles north of the general store. The congregation numbers a few dozen, the men wearing cowboy boots and hats, jeans and dress shirts, the women in dresses and Navajo turquoise jewelry. The Bible is written in Navajo. In a kind nod to their visitors, the female pastors translate the service into English. At the end, Cooper walks up to a pastor and holds his palms out. She grasps his hands, and they pray together for the strength to face down his challenges. Afterward, we drive with the Burbank family to a tiny   restaurant, the only joint for many miles. Cooper’s mother, Joni, explains that she and her husband became fast friends in elementary school they began dating in high school. Both of their fathers died because of drunken driving. “I came from a   home he was raised by his grandmother,” Joni says. “We were magnets attracting. ” Joni attended high school and college in Flagstaff. Her husband, Darrick, worked construction and rode rodeo bulls. One night they drove to San Francisco just to smell the salt air. They married, and when Cooper, the first of their four children, arrived they agreed: no drinking, an intact family. Darrick gave up good construction dollars in the boom towns of Las Vegas and Phoenix to work maintenance at the local school. “I had a hard time with that at first,” he says. “But I didn’t have a dad. My job is to give these kids a dad. ” Joni taught at the elementary school twice she had Cooper as her student. They joined a church and stayed close to cousins and elders. They are building a hogan atop a mesa with a Navajo name that they say is too long to translate into English. Change beckoned as Cooper reached eighth grade. Within the context of a   reservation of 175, 000 Navajo, Chinle is a bustling town. The Burbanks now live in an apartment there. “Cooper needed the challenge I needed professional growth,” Joni says. “I prayed and did a lot of searching. Then I said to myself: ‘Joni, Cooper, it’s time to push yourselves. ’” They bade goodbye to Joni’s mother, Virginia Tsosie, whose trailer sits 25 yards from their own in Rock Point, near the smooth folds of   cliffs. Tsosie misses them greatly. When Cooper arrives back each weekend he walks into Grandma’s trailer and flops on her couch, and she massages his legs and tells him stories. Talk of distant schools stirs trepidation in those of Tsosie’s generation. When she was very young, the Bureau of Indian Affairs sent her to an    boarding school. She went many months without seeing her parents. Tribal culture was treated as backward, a skin to be shed in pursuit of assimilation. When Tsosie spoke Navajo to a friend, a teacher washed out her mouth with soap. “I gagged,” she recalls. “Now I talk to my grandchildren in Navajo all the time. They know the survival words. ” The winter sun sinks toward the buttes. Cooper excuses himself, grabs a basketball and walks outside, followed by his younger brothers. He dribbles on the red dirt and shoots at a backboard with a hoop twisted like broken foot. Swish, and swish, and swish. We say goodbyes and drive south to the high country village of Tsaile, which in Navajo means water flowing into a canyon. Nachae, the team captain, meets us by the gas station. We clamber into his pickup truck and bounce up an icy and rutted track to his family’s trailer. He hops out and points to the trailers next door. That one is my grandma. And that one, too. And that one, that’s my auntie. His mom, Andrea Nez, comes to the door and smiles. “No secrets around here,” she says. Nachae attended three high schools in four years. After his freshman year in Holbrook, he spun to the hoop and tore up his knee. He had surgery and needed six months before he could walk unaided. That, he figured, was that for hoops. He enrolled in Navajo Prep, a private school in Farmington, N. M. where academics are king. “I figured books were my way out,” he says. A physical therapist helped him rebuild his knee. He played as a junior and led Prep in scoring. Then a flour plant laid off his mother, and the money dried up. He left Navajo Prep and returned to Tsaile, where he enrolled at Chinle for his senior year. Nachae’s Navajo name is Napi. He tells me it means Old Man in Navajo and in Blackfoot, which is his mother’s tribe. That means you are wise, I reply. He smiles, wistful, and points to the knee he ices after every game and his sore shoulder. “Maybe it just means I have an old body. ” Like so many Navajo, he occupies several worlds. As a child he danced powwow, shot bow and arrow and dreamed of following his father, Felix, who rode serious rodeo bulls. He sees a world alive with spirits. He also has fine grades, serves on the student council and has an auntie who graduated from Cornell as a guide star. He is aware of the world outside the reservation. He has eyes on New Mexico State and its agriculture program. Last summer, he traveled the Navajo Nation reservation helping with a wool buyback program, aimed at reinvigorating the sheep industry. “I want to get educated to help my people,” he says. He drops us by our car. Tsaile sits at 7, 100 feet, adrift in snow. The night sky is kaleidoscopic with stars. The next night the Wildcats drop a fierce game to Page. They are limping into the playoffs. As suddenly, the Wildcats kick into gear. Their playoff opener is against Holbrook, and their defense goes taut. Chinle wins by a basket. Next up is Blue Ridge High School, a powerhouse with a record of  . The Wildcats should be an afterthought. Nachae, in his final high school game, has perhaps his finest performance. He scores 28 points, a whirlwind. Cooper scores 12 and plays fierce defense. The Wildcats lose only in the final minute,  . Mendoza is   taciturn compliments fall sparing as bread crumbs from his mouth. “I told the kids that we were just a few possessions from advancing,” he says. “They finally learned to compete and battle. I’m very proud of our efforts. ” Now Nachae pivots. He must spend his days deciphering college dreams. Cooper must prepare himself for a new leadership role next year. As for me, I drive out of Navajo, past buttes and cliffs under a frozen dawn sky scraped clean of clouds. The sensation is of doors opening.",0
9496,Re: Huma Abedin Emails Probe will be Headed by John Podesta’s Best Friend,"Tin pot rule and corruption in the United States — it’s like Sodom and Gomorrah: there is not one honest man in the party of treason and treachery. 
Podesta brags DOJ’s Huma “investigation” spokesman Peter Kadzik “kept me out of jail” see WikiLeaks here. 
“John Podesta’s Best Friend At The DOJ Will Be In Charge Of The DOJ’s Probe Into Huma Abedin Emails,” Zero Hedge , October 31, 2016: 
Now that the FBI has obtained the needed warrant to start poring over the 650,000 or so emails uncovered in Anthony Weiner’s notebook, among which thousands of emails sent from Huma Abedin using Hillary Clinton’s personal server, moments ago the Us Justice Department decided to also finally join the probe, and as AP reported moments ago, it vowed to dedicate all needed resources to quickly review the over half a million emails in the Clinton case. 
https://twitter.com/AP/status/793184986832769025 

In the letter to Congress, the DOJ writes that it “will continue to work closely with the FBI and together, dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible,” assistant attorney General Peter J. Kadzik writes in letters to House and Senate lawmakers. #BREAKING Senior DOJ official sends letter to lawmakers responding to request for more information about email review. #8days pic.twitter.com/PCgT2ODkQd 
— Just the Facts (@JTF_News) October 31, 2016 
So far so good, even if one wonders just how active the DOJ will be in a case that has shown an unprecedented schism between the politically influenced Department of Justice and the FBI. 
And yet, something felt odd about this. 
Kadzik… Kadzik… where have we heard that name? 
Oh yes. Recall our post from last week, “ Clinton Campaign Chair Had Dinner With Top DOJ Official One Day After Hillary’s Benghazi Hearing ” in which we reported that John Podesta had dinner with one of the highest ranked DOJ officials the very day after Hillary Clinton’s Benghazi testimony? 
It was Peter Kadzik. 
In other words, the best friend of John Podesta, Clinton’s Campaign char, at the DOJ will be in charge of a probe that could potentially sink Hillary Clinton. 
For those who missed it, this is what we reported: 
The day after Hillary Clinton testified in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October, John Podesta, Hillary’s campaign chairman met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends, including Peter Kadzik, who is currently a top official at the US Justice Department serving as Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs. 
The post-Benghazi dinner was attended by Podesta, Kadzik, superlobbyist Vincent Roberti and other well-placed Beltway fixtures. The first mention of personal contact between Podesta and Kadzik in the Wikileaks dump is in an Oct. 23, 2015 email sent out by Vincent Roberti, a lobbyist who is close to Podesta and his superlobbyist brother, Tony Podesta. In it, Roberti refers to a dinner reservation at Posto, a Washington D.C. restaurant. The dinner was set for 7:30 that evening, just one day after Clinton gave 11 hours of testimony to the Benghazi Committee. 
Podesta and Kadzik met several months later for dinner at Podesta’s home, another email shows. Another email sent on May 5, 2015, Kadzik’s son asked Podesta for a job on the Clinton campaign. 
As the Daily Caller noted , the dinner arrangement “is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the Clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of state’s email practices.” As one former U.S. Attorney tells told the DC, the exchanges are another example of the Clinton campaign’s “cozy relationship” with the Obama Justice Department. 
The hacked emails confirm that Podesta and Kadzik were in frequent contact. In one email from January, Kadzik and Podesta, who were classmates at Georgetown Law School in the 1970s, discussed plans to celebrate Podesta’s birthday. And in another sent last May, Kadzik’s son emailed Podesta asking for a job on the Clinton campaign. 
“The political appointees in the Obama administration, especially in the Department of Justice, appear to be very partisan in nature and I don’t think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server,” says Matthew Whitaker, the executive director of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a government watchdog group. 
“It’s the kind of thing the American people are frustrated about is that the politically powerful have insider access and have these kind of relationships that ultimately appear to always break to the benefit of Hillary Clinton,” he added, comparing the Podesta-Kadzik meetings to the revelation that Attorney General Loretta Lynch met in private with Bill Clinton at the airport in Phoenix days before the FBI and DOJ investigating Hillary Clinton. 
Kadzik’s role at the DOJ, where he started in 2013, is particularly notable Kadzik, as helped spearhead the effort to nominate Lynch, who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president. 
It gets better because, as we further revealed, if there is one person in the DOJ who is John Podesta’s, and thus the Clinton Foundation’s inside man, it is Peter Kadzik. 
Kadzik represented Podesta during the Monica Lewinsky investigation. And in the waning days of the Bill Clinton administration, Kadzik lobbied Podesta on behalf of Marc Rich, the fugitive who Bill Clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office. That history is cited by Podesta in another email hacked from his Gmail account. In a Sept. 2008 email , which the Washington Free Beacon flagged last week, Podesta emailed an Obama campaign official to recommend Kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign. Podesta, who would later head up the Obama White House transition effort, wrote that Kadzik was a “fantastic lawyer” who “kept me out of jail.” 
Podesta was caught in a sticky situation in both the Lewinsky affair and the Rich pardon scandal. As deputy chief of staff to Clinton in 1996, Podesta asked then-United Nations ambassador Bill Richardson to hire the 23-year-old Lewinsky . In April 1996, the White House transferred Lewinsky from her job as a White House intern to the Pentagon in order to keep her and Bill Clinton separate. But the Clinton team also wanted to keep Lewinsky happy so that she would not spill the beans about her sexual relationship with Clinton. 
Richardson later recounted in his autobiography that he offered Lewinsky the position but that she declined it. 
Podesta made false statements to a grand jury impaneled by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for the investigation . But he defended the falsehoods, saying later that he was merely relaying false information from Clinton that he did not know was inaccurate at the time. “He did lie to me,” Podesta said about Clinton in a National Public Radio interview in 1998. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in Feb. 1999 of perjury and obstruction of justice charges related to the Lewinsky probe. Kadzik, then a lawyer with the firm Dickstein Shapiro Morin & Oshinsky, represented Podesta through the fiasco. 
Podesta had been promoted to Clinton’s chief of staff when he and Kadzik became embroiled in another scandal. 
Kadzik was then representing Marc Rich, a billionaire financier who was wanted by the U.S. government for evading a $48 million tax bill. The fugitive, who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism, had been living in Switzerland for 17 years when he sought the pardon. To help Rich, Kadzik lobbied Podesta heavily in the weeks before Clinton left office on Jan. 20, 2001. A House Oversight Committee report released in May 2002 stated that “Kadzik was recruited into Marc Rich’s lobbying campaign because he was a long-time friend of White House Chief of Staff John Podesta.” 
The report noted that Kadzik contacted Podesta at least seven times regarding Rich’s pardon. On top of the all-hands-on-deck lobbying effort, Rich’s ex-wife, Denise Rich, had doled out more than $1 million to the Clintons and other Democrats prior to the pardon . She gave $100,000 to Hillary Clinton’s New York Senate campaign and another $450,000 to the Clinton presidential library. 
Kadzik’s current role 
In his current role as head of the Office of Legislative Affairs, Kadzik handles inquiries from Congress on a variety of issues. In that role he was not in the direct chain of command on the Clinton investigation. The Justice Department and FBI have insisted that career investigators oversaw the investigation, which concluded in July with no charges filed against Clinton. 
But Kadzik worked on other Clinton email issues in his dealings with Congress. Last November, he denied a request from Republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation. 
In a Feb. 1, 2016 letter in response to Kadzik, Florida Rep. Ron DeSantis noted that Kadzik had explained “that special counsel may be appointed at the discretion of the Attorney General when an investigation or prosecution by the Department of Justice would create a potential conflict of interest.” 
DeSantis, a Republican, suggested that Lynch’s appointment by Bill Clinton in 1999 as U.S. Attorney in New York may be considered a conflict of interest. He also asserted that Obama’s political appointees — a list which includes Kadzik — “are being asked to impartially execute their respective duties as Department of Justice officials that may involve an investigation into the activities of the forerunner for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States.” 
It is unknown if Kadzik responded to DeSantis’ questions. 
Kadzik’s first involvement in the Clinton email brouhaha came in a Sept. 24, 2015 response letter to Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley in which he declined to confirm or deny whether the DOJ was investigating Clinton. Last month, Politico reported that Kadzik angered Republican lawmakers when, in a classified briefing, he declined to say whether Clinton aides who received DOJ immunity were required to cooperate with congressional probes. 
Kadzik also testified at a House Oversight Committee hearing last month on the issue of classifications and redactions in the FBI’s files of the Clinton email investigation. 
* * * 
And now it seems that Kadzik will be in charge of the DOJ’s “probe” into Huma Abedin’s emails. Which is why we are a little skeptical the DOJ will find “anything” of note.

9497,"His Tone Dark, Donald Trump Takes G.O.P. Mantle - The New York Times","CLEVELAND  —   Donald John Trump accepted the Republican presidential nomination on Thursday night with an unusually vehement appeal to Americans who feel that their country is spiraling out of control and yearn for a leader who will take aggressive, even extreme, actions to protect them. Mr. Trump, 70, a New York real estate developer and reality television star who leveraged his fame and forceful persona to become the rare political outsider to lead the ticket of a major party, drew exuberant cheers from Republican convention delegates as he strode onto the stage of the Quicken Loans Arena and delivered a speech as fiery as his candidacy. With dark imagery and an almost angry tone, Mr. Trump portrayed the United States as a diminished and even humiliated nation, and offered himself as an   savior who could resurrect the country’s standing in the eyes of both enemies and   Americans. “Our convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation,” an   Mr. Trump said, standing against a backdrop of American flags. “The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country. ” Mr. Trump nearly shouted the names of states where police officers had been killed recently, as the crowd erupted in applause, and returned repeatedly to the major theme of the speech: “Law and order,” he said four times, each time drawing out the syllables. Evoking the tumult of the 1960s and the uncertainty that followed the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Mr. Trump made a sharp departure from the optimistic talk about American possibility that has characterized Republican presidential candidates since Ronald Reagan redefined the party over 30 years ago. In promoting his   views on crime, immigration and hostile nations, Mr. Trump was wagering that voters would embrace his style of populism and his promises of safety if they feel even less secure by Election Day. But his speech  —   the longest, at an hour and 15 minutes, since at least 1972  —   had relatively little new to offer women, Hispanics, blacks and others who have been turned off by Mr. Trump’s incendiary brand of politics. He did sound like a different sort of Republican at times, though, making no mention of abortion  —   a core issue for many Republicans  —   and saying of his support among evangelical voters, “I’m not sure I totally deserve it. ” Mr. Trump also challenged Republican orthodoxy as he promised to end multilateral trade deals and limit American intervention in global crises. He denounced “15 years of wars in the Middle East”  —   a rebuke of his party’s last president, George W. Bush  —   and pledged to help union members, coal miners and other   Americans who have historically supported Democrats. “These are the forgotten men and women of our country,” said Mr. Trump, a billionaire with a mixed record of job creation and layoffs. “People who work hard but no longer have a voice  —   I am your voice. ” He even vowed “to do everything in my power to protect our L. G. B. T. Q. citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology. ’’ As the audience applauded, Mr. Trump made a deviation from his prepared text, observing: “I have to say, that as a Republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said. ”’ Facing a restive party on the final night of a convention that has been unusually turbulent and divided, Mr. Trump seemed to make headway in galvanizing and unifying at least those Republicans gathered in the hall. The nearly full arena was rapt as Mr. Trump spoke, and when he began discussing illegal immigration, a familiar chant quickly broke out in the arena: “Build the wall, build the wall!” And when he vowed to tell the truth “plainly and honestly,” a delegate cried from the floor: “Bring it, Donald!” Mr. Trump dwelled at length on illegal immigrants and lawless Americans, saying they are as dangerous for the nation’s security as the Islamic State and Syrian refugees. In doing so, Trump advisers said, he sought to win over undecided voters who are sickened by the recent violence against police officers and worried about safety yet are unsure if Mr. Trump has the temperament and abilities to be commander in chief. “I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: When I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country. ” While nomination speeches are traditionally optimistic and personal, full of hope and revelations that cast candidates in the best possible light for voters, Mr. Trump sounded like a wartime president, using the word “threat” seven times and promising to “defeat the barbarians of ISIS. ” He also recited homicide rates in American cities and the thousands of illegal immigrants with criminal records, promising to control violence at home and abroad. “It is time to show the whole world that America is back  —   bigger, and better and stronger than ever before,” Mr. Trump said. He was blistering about Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, and her tenure as secretary of state, arguing that her diplomatic strategy in Syria, Iraq, Egypt, Libya and other countries had led to civil unrest and political chaos and rendered her unfit to be president. “America is far less safe  —   and the world is far less stable  —   than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America’s foreign policy,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump said Americans had “lived through one international humiliation after another” under President Obama: the Navy sailors “being forced to their knees” by Iranian captors in January the destruction of the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya and Mr. Obama’s decision not to defend his “red line” on Syria. Mrs. Clinton shared the blame, too, he added. “This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness,” Mr. Trump said. In a bid to appeal to Democrats unhappy with their party’s embrace of Mrs. Clinton, he invoked the political message of her chief rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, and suggested that Mr. Sanders shared Republicans’ critique of her record. Mr. Trump’s elder daughter, Ivanka, also sought to reach out to Democrats and moderates, extolling him as a champion of women in the workplace, and a leader who would “take on the bold and worthy fights, who will be unafraid to set lofty goals and relentless in his determination to achieve them. ” This week’s convention, which typically would have been choreographed carefully, was itself a departure from the norm. But if Mr. Trump injected drama and even spontaneity back into the formulaic gathering, he also tested the limits of improvisation over the last week. The operatic quality of the first three days of the convention worried some Republicans. Presidential candidates have two major issues to deal with over the summer, their   selection and their convention, and they felt he had bungled both. Mr. Trump chose his running mate haphazardly and then overshadowed the announcement of Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana by indulging in a rambling speech that revived questions about his seriousness. The party staged a convention that reflected just how fractured it is. There were, to be sure, effective attacks on the character and record of Mrs. Clinton, whose unpopularity among modern presidential nominees is exceeded only by Mr. Trump’s. But some of the   language spilled into ugliness and catcalls. The party at times seemed unified only around a shared determination to imprison the former secretary of state. But the speeches dedicated to promoting Mr. Trump and the party’s governing vision were hazy and at times collided with the candidate’s own beliefs. Many of the elected officials who spoke extolled a traditional conservative platform that bears little relation to the nationalist agenda on which Mr. Trump is basing his campaign. For example, just hours before Mr. Pence, a committed internationalist, assured delegates and millions of voters that America would defend its allies, Mr. Trump gave an interview in which he balked at defending NATO countries, a policy that has been the cornerstone of the alliance for 70 years. Even as Republicans prepared to leave Cleveland, they were still straining to come to terms with the views and personality of their newly minted nominee. “I’m going to vote for Mike Pence,” said Gov. Gary Herbert of Utah, pausing for effect: “And Donald Trump comes along with the package. ” Candidates who are trailing  —   as Mr. Trump is, according to national polling averages  —   must maximize the bump they typically enjoy in the polls after their conventions. Mr. Trump may see his standing improve after he leaves Cleveland on Friday, even though he did not fully seize the opportunity he was afforded after Mrs. Clinton was upbraided by the F. B. I. director over her private email server. In many ways, the convention’s formality was an awkward fit for Mr. Trump, who soared in the primaries by energizing voters at freewheeling rallies with his    and frequently entertaining remarks. Instead, for Thursday night, he relied on a teleprompter and a speech heavy with familiar Republican themes like cutting taxes, creating jobs, and pushing for education reforms to give parents more choice in schools for their children. Yet he also made more personal promises as well, like being the ultimate safeguard for the younger generations of Americans. “To every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I’m with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you,” Mr. Trump said.",0
9498,"From Paris to Bavaria, Heavy Rains Cause Deadly Floods - The New York Times","PARIS  —   Torrential rains have caused deadly flooding in central and northeastern France this week, forcing the evacuation of thousands of people, some on boats or kayaks, and threatening works of art stored in Paris’s most celebrated museums. A man on horseback was swept away by floodwaters on Thursday and found dead in     30 miles southeast of Paris, the authorities in the    administrative department, where the town is located, said. In Germany, heavy rains claimed the lives of nine people. The heavy rains caused the Seine in Paris to rise to 18 feet by Thursday evening, flooding the lower embankments and shutting several roads but causing no significant damage. The level is still far from the record of 1910, however, when the river rose to 26 feet. Nonetheless, the city authorities advised people to stay away from the banks of the river and part of Paris’s commuter train system that runs below ground along the Seine was shut as a preventive measure. The Louvre announced that it would be closed on Friday to move, as a precautionary measure, works of art in areas vulnerable to flooding. The Musée d’Orsay, in a former train station on the Left Bank near the Seine, closed early to put in place a   plan that provides for swift evacuation of the museum’s Impressionist masterpieces and other works of art in the event of flooding. The museum will also be closed on Friday. The rainfall also disrupted the French Open, where several tennis matches have been postponed. Officials in France and Germany were bracing for even more rain this week. The Loing River, a tributary of the Seine, has risen to levels not seen since 1910, and the    region, which includes Paris, got more rainfall last month than in any May since 1960. President François Hollande said Thursday that the rainfall and floods were “very serious” and linked them to global warming. “When there are climatic phenomena of this seriousness, we must all be aware that we must act globally,” he said. He later added that the government would declare a state of disaster for affected areas, enabling residents and businesses to receive special insurance compensation. About 19, 000 homes in France were still without power on Thursday evening, and the interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said that an estimated 20, 000 people had been evacuated. Meteorologists attribute the recent deluge to a dip in the jet stream that has trapped   air over much of France and Germany, where the air is then warmed by the sun. This occurrence often leads to heat waves, and to thunderstorms as the hot air rises. The recent thunderstorms have been more intense than usual because the hot air rises to encounter colder air in the upper atmosphere. Generally, the greater the difference between the rising hot air and the colder high air, the bigger the storms. Forecasters say there could be a few more days of rain before the   air moves on. Speaking from the government’s crisis center in Paris on Thursday, Prime Minister Manuel Valls said that the situation was still “tense” and “difficult” in certain areas. More than 3, 000 people were evacuated from Nemours, about 50 miles south of Paris, after the Loing overflowed, flooding businesses and homes. The surrounding    area was on high alert for floods on Thursday, and 12 other departments in the    and   de Loire regions were on the   level of flood alert. In addition to the man found dead in     an    woman was also found dead Wednesday at her flooded home in    a town just south of Nemours. But the cause of her death was unknown on Thursday and the local authorities said an autopsy would be conducted on Friday. Traffic around Orléans, about 75 miles south of Paris, was blocked, and on Tuesday, 217 inmates had to be evacuated from a prison near Orléans. The Château de Chambord, a landmark in the Loire Valley, about 30 miles southwest of Orléans, was surrounded by water. In Germany, the rains have claimed nine lives. On Monday, in the southwestern state of   two people, including a firefighter, were sucked into a drainpipe in the town of Schwäbisch Gmünd a    man was found dead in a flooded basement garage in Weissbach and a    girl, seeking shelter under a railway bridge, was struck by a train and killed in Schorndorf. On Thursday, five people were found dead in the southern German state of Bavaria. They included three women from one family, in a home in the town of Simbach am Inn a    man in the same town and an    woman in the neighboring village of Julbach. Three others were missing, and the death toll could rise, Michael Emmer, a spokesman for the police in the Lower Bavaria region, told the German news agency DPA. Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann said the intensity of the flooding had taken officials by surprise. “Within a few minutes, the water level rose about several meters,” he said. Officials said they were preparing for additional storms and strong rains in western and southern Germany. At a news conference, Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed condolences to the families of the victims. In the village of Bad   in the state of   the Ahr River rose nearly 13 feet to a level that officials said was unprecedented. Several campers in the region sought refuge on the roofs of vehicles and were rescued by helicopter. In the nearby Eifel mountain range, which is popular with tourists and hikers, flooding was also reported. Thousands of homes in Bavaria were without power, officials said.",0
9499,"After Gingrich Attacks Megyn Kelly Over 'Sex,' Trump Advisor's 'Threat' Against Her Blows Up Online","Share on Twitter 
On Tuesday night, an interview between Fox News host Megyn Kelly and Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich got intense in a hurry. 
After Kelly referenced Trump as a “sexual predator,” Gingrich fiercely accused her of “using language that’s inflammatory that’s not true,” adding : 
“You are fascinated with sex and you don’t care about public policy! That’s what I get out of watching you tonight!” 
If viewers were fired up by the heated exchange, a tweet sent out by the Trump campaign's social media director Dan Scavino only poured fuel onto that fire: . @MegynKelly made a total fool out of herself tonight- attacking @realDonaldTrump . Watch what happens to her after this election is over. — Dan Scavino Jr. (@DanScavino) October 26, 2016 
While it's not explicitly clear what Scavino meant by “watch what happens,” the implications of his comment certainly didn't go unnoticed. 
Americans quickly came down on both sides of the issue, with many rushing to Kelly's defense in the face of the “threat”: @DanScavino ""Watch what happens to her?"" I'm no Kelly fan, but your campaign really isn't learning from the whole ""threats vs women"" thing. — Dennis Perkins (@DennisPerkins5) October 26, 2016 . @DanScavino She does just fine after the election, I'm guessing. You vanish into obscurity. — Trey Graham (@treygraham) October 26, 2016 @DanScavino @megynkelly @realDonaldTrump You want to be a little more specific about that? Punk. — HarleyPeyton (@HarleyPeyton) October 26, 2016 
Still, there were plenty who agreed with Gingrich's suggestion that Kelly was being biased: @DanScavino @megynkelly @realDonaldTrump I used to be a huge fan of Megyn Kelly but no more. Totally unfair to the frmr Speaker. — Scott Schulze (@payshel) October 26, 2016 @DanScavino @megynkelly @realDonaldTrump Send her to CNN. They need more Crooked dishonest journalists! — Trump Revolution (@DonaldTrump_Rev) October 26, 2016 @DanScavino @megynkelly @realDonaldTrump Why surprised?Kelly is a dumb puppet paid millions (thro that book deal?) just to attack DJT.Tragic — Maya Varma (@swargcoming) October 26, 2016 
Since early in the 2016 election cycle, there's no doubt that Kelly and the Trump campaign haven't seen eye-to-eye. 
More recently, it seemed that tensions had cooled between the GOP nominee and the Fox News host. If Scavino's tweet is any indication, however, that may no longer be the story. ",0
9500,After the US elections – World Exit! | New Eastern Outlook,"Region: USA in the World Only citizens can vote in the US Presidential elections, yet the impact is global. The world is suddenly in disarray, in panic. A man notorious for his bigoted rhetoric, a man who believes in American exceptionalism, who wants to build the walls and to ‘restore order’, has been elected the 45 th President of the mightiest nation on Earth. His nation is doubtlessly in decline; it is indebted and some would even argue, hopelessly bankrupt, but it is still the Empire, the sole one to this day. Below the surface, Mr. Trump may not be any viler than the Democratic candidate Mrs. Clinton and her clan has been for years. The establishment with which she has been inseparably intertwined for years and decades has been murdering millions all over the world, looting entire continents, and brutally guaranteeing that the Western world would always stay firmly in control of the entire Planet. Throughout the years, Mrs. Clinton has been using ‘politically correct’ rhetoric, mainly (and often in a twisted way) in order to silence those who dared to criticize her deeds. Still, no matter what her words were stating, millions of people have been vanishing, worldwide, as a result of the policies introduced by her and by her former boss, President Barack Obama. Donald Trump is brusque, aggressive, narcissistic and most likely, brutally honest. What he says is often pure trash, but whatever it is, he is not embarrassed to parade it in public. He has been giving many advanced warnings to both his supporters (including his voters) and to his adversaries. Objectively speaking, he is not any more or any less dangerous than Mrs. Clinton. Both candidates come from the moneyed, pro-establishment milieu. Yet Mr. Trump evokes much greater fear all over the world than his rival, from Asia and Africa to Latin America. It is at least partially because the mainstream Western propaganda rallied determinedly behind the well-tested and ‘reliable’ Mrs. Clinton (she has proven to be subservient to the Western imperialist regime and to market fundamentalist dogmas), and the Western mainstream media is exactly what is giving ‘marching orders’ to the local press, particularly in ‘client’ states in all parts of the world. * Nonetheless, Mr. Trump is definitely frightening on his own account, and just because he ran against (and defeated) the establishment candidate, does not make him less so. Rowan Wolf, Managing Editor at The Greanville Post and publisher of Uncommon Thought , recently summarized what I felt about the recent elections, when she wrote to me (it was right after the results were announced): “ I am frightened over the election of Trump. Things were going to be bad here even without that because his position as the candidate for president legitimated the ugliest bigotry and violence. His election, legitimates and institutionalizes it at the highest levels possible. It is not as if this ugliness was not present in the US as it certainly was, but it was not celebrated. His racism extends outside the US and he has already stated numerous times that he would use nukes in the Middle East and just take the oil. He also hates the Earth. He plans to reverse or remove all environmental protections and regulations, and he doesn’t “believe” in global warming. His presidency could not happen at a worse time for our planet.” * I had the extremely bad fortune of spending ‘the day after’ in the den of the Western pro-establishment mainstream media based in Asia Pacific – the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Thailand (FCCT). Or perhaps it was not only ‘bad fortune’ but also some type of perverse desire to witness the great and genuine desperation of those who have, for years and decades, been serving the Empire and its ‘liberal’ dogmas, twisting the truth and manufacturing hyper-reality. Even before my arrival at the FCCT, the results of elections were finalized. I expected a great mess, and mess it was. I witnessed depressed glances, nervous laughter, small talk, and an excessive consumption of booze. Speeches soon followed: made by the members of Western human rights organizations, of several NGO’s, and press corps. Some Iranian exile began trashing Iran, somehow loosely connecting it to the US elections. Someone else had a go at the Philippine’s anti-imperialist President Duterte. And of course, China was hit on several occasions, and so was Russia, particularly that ‘evil’ Putin. One after another, speakers mimicked Ms. Clinton’s derogatory pronunciation of Russian President’s name. No one mentioned Thailand or Indonesia even once. It was all grotesque and endlessly sad. Then the chest beating and insulting the voters slowly began… a slow masochistic public orgy. In the end, several well-behaved members of the public began queuing in front of the microphone, asking polite questions. Not sending the panelists to hell, not insulting them directly to their faces… Nothing like that! People were just asking non-confrontational questions, and then, patiently and politely waiting for replies. The ‘client’ states of the West were still very far from the rebellion. * Then my phone became extremely active, as I began receiving messages from all corners of the globe. From Sudan: “I never thought Donald would win! The Sudanese are making fun of Trump saying that he looks like our President Al-Basheer.” From Italy: “Better than Killary, but still disgusting”. From Uganda: “Our government is acting as if it didn’t back Hillary before the elections.” From Argentina: “Now in the US they will have to eat their own crap… as they made others eat it for decades.” From Indonesia: “Trump said that he would increase tariffs on imported products. In that case he’ll have to pay more for his suits, as he apparently wears some that are made in Indonesia”. * “Where were you on the 9-11?” Or now: “Where were you on 11-8?” Some people compare these two events. On both occasions (or before), no one bothered to listen, to face reality, and as a result, some terrible events took place. On 11-8 I was in Bangkok. On 9-11 in Hanoi, Vietnam, sipping coffee, and looking out of my window. The apartment was on a higher floor of the “Hanoi Tower”. The building was literally growing out from the old French prison, where Vietnamese patriots used to be tortured, raped and executed by the French colonialists. If I were to walk all the way towards the very glass panel, I would be able to see, far below, two shiny guillotines, preserved for people to remember the ‘great enlightened rule of the West over Asia’. Suddenly on the horizon, the sky lit up in a tremendous explosion of colors. The villages surrounding Hanoi were shooting firecrackers and makeshift rockets up to the sky. It was a great fireworks display, something I had never seen before. I turned my television set on. On the BBC coverage, two airplanes were flying, in slow motion, towards the towers of the World Trade Center. A few minutes later I received a phone call from my best friend in Santiago de Chile. “You would not believe what is happening here,” he reported to me, breathless. “People, total strangers, are stopping here, in the middle of the street. They are crying, falling into each other’s arms, and whispering: “Justice takes time, but it always comes!” They were referring to 9-11-1973, when the United States overthrew one of the oldest and greatest democracies on Earth. Chile was raped, its people murdered, its form of government and its economic model were shattered. A few hours after the “event”, both the Vietnamese and Chilean governments expressed their shock and support for the American people. In Vietnam, the celebrations were not reported. But they took place. Everyone knew it. The great anger against the Empire could be felt, and is still felt, not only in those two great nations, but also all over the world. People are outraged. Those in the United States are… and also those in the rest of the world are… although they are outraged for totally different reasons… but outraged they all are nevertheless! “Democracy” is the rule of people. It does not mean the ‘Western multi-party system’. It only means the ‘rule of the people’, in Greek. It can be based on the ancient ‘heavenly mandate’ on which the Chinese system is based even now. It can be the modern Latin American form of participatory democracy… as long as people are ruling. However, they are not ruling. Not in the West, nor in most of the countries of the rest of the world, where the governments are forced upon them by Western imperialism to defend their states and to often adopt very tough measures to do so. People in the United States had spoken, expressing their frustration and anger. People in the rest of the world were not asked who should be leading the world. The next, the most logical step for the world should now be, immediately to reject the leadership of both the United States and Europe. Brexit and 11-8 should be followed by the WORLD-EXIT. What does it mean? Simple: ‘Let the West eat its own shit, alone, finally’! And let the world be free from those governments and economic and colonialist concepts, which no one here (in Asia, Africa, Latin America or the Middle East) really elected and wants! Once we are at exiting, rejecting and defending, let’s also build huge protective walls around all non-Western countries. To defend them from the Crusaders and hordes that have been looting and plundering the entire Planet for centuries. The citizens of the United States have spoken. Oh yes! So let the rest of the world do the same! Let them vote on WORLD EXIT! It is clear what the result will be!

9501,California’s Drive-Thru Tree Falls over During Winter Storm,"The Pioneer Cabin, a famous giant sequoia tree that visitors could once drive through, toppled on Sunday after succumbing to the winter storms that hit Northern California this past weekend. [The tree, located in the Calaveras Big Trees State Park, was once celebrated by “Weird Al” Yankovic in his song, “The Biggest Ball Of Twine In Minnesota. ” The song lyric referring to Pioneer Cabin goes: “And a place where you can drive through the middle of a tree. ”  The tunnel had been carved into the tree’s base 137 years ago. To residents and people who also had the chance to visit the California landmark, the loss was heartily felt. “We lost an old friend today,” Calaveras County resident Jim Allday wrote on his Facebook page.  According to the San Francisco Chronicle, Allday is volunteer at the park and was working there Sunday when the tree fell. He reportedly said it went down about 2 p. m. and “shattered” on impact. The Calaveras Big Trees Association posted about the loss on its Facebook page. “The Pioneer Cabin tree has fallen! This iconic and still living tree  —   the tunnel tree  —   enchanted many visitors. The storm was just too much for it,” they wrote.  Many reactions could be found on social media.

9502,ESPN’s Jemele Hill Insists Colin Kaepernick Won’t Recover from Anti-American Label - Breitbart,"The hot topic for sports media is still that NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick has not yet signed anywhere as a free agent, and at least one commentator now says that Kaepernick will never shake the accusation that he hates America. [ESPN’s Jemele Hill made an interesting point in a recent tweet saying that the NFL can excuse a lot of bad behavior by players, but Kaepernick’s perceived   is one that can’t be ignored.  No, he won’t. In the NFL you can   an abuser, a drunk driver and a multitude of sins. But an ” ?” Nope. https:  .   —   Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) March 22, 2017,  That is a solid point, for sure. The league has allowed wife abusers, drug users, past gang members, and tax cheats continue playing, but Colin Kaepernick’s transgression was against the whole country and seems far more than a mere personal failing, especially for a sport that wants to be considered as America’s game. Hill added another thought to the discussion after President Donald Trump took some measure of credit for Kaepernick’s troubles. Think we’ve seen the last of Kaep as an NFL player. There was a limited market before but after Trump’s comments, it’s a wrap. https:  .   —   Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) March 22, 2017,  The ESPNer is referring to Trump’s March 20 rally in Louisville, Kentucky, where the president slammed Kaepernick, broaching the subject by assuring the audience that no one wants a “nasty tweet from Donald Trump. ” As the crowd roared, the president continued, saying, “I said, if I remember that one, I’m going to the people of Kentucky because they like when people actually stand for the American flag. ” This is far from the first time Trump has criticized Kaepernick. Last August he told The Hill newspaper that maybe Kaepernick “should find a country that works better for him. ” The news that the 49ers   quarterback can’t find a new birth in the NFL is on the tongue of nearly every sports commentator, as Sporting News noted. To mention a few, Los Angeles Times sports columnist Bill Plaschke says Kaepernick is “clearly” being blackballed for his   protests, Mike Golic of ESPN2’s “Mike  Mike in the Morning” also noted that team executives and owners are wary about bringing Kaepernick’s sort of trouble to their teams, and Mike Freeman of Bleacher Report exclaimed that Kaepernick is being punished “for the crime of speaking his mind. ” Sports reporters aren’t the only ones claiming Kaepernick is being mistreated.

9507,PUTIN ISSUES INTERNATIONAL ARREST WARRANT FOR GEORGE SOROS … DEAD OR ALIVE,"Share on Facebook Share 
Russia have officially declared that Billionaire George Soros is a wanted man in their country, citing him and his organizations as a “threat to Russian national security”. 
Putin banned Soros from Russia last year due to the fact that Soros helped to nearly destroy the Russian economy in the early 1990’s. 
Veteranstoday.com reports: 
Matt Taibbi of the Rolling Stone said of Goldman Sachs six years ago: 
“The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it’s everywhere. The world’s most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. 
“In fact, the history of the recent financial crisis, which doubles as a history of the rapid decline and fall of the suddenly swindled dry American empire, reads like a Who’s Who of Goldman Sachs graduates.” 
Obviously Soros wants to be like Goldman Sachs. Phil Butler puts it well when he says: “George Soros has a finger in every political pie there is. If there is a crisis on our world, it’s a safe bet he’s had a hand in it.” 
One can say that Soros and Goldman Sachs are ideologically part of the same brotherhood. Their strategy is a little different, but the end result is the destruction of lives via the economic system (be it capitalism or socialism) and political manipulation. 
That’s why Soros seems to think that he is invincible. He thinks he can move the political and economic planet in a few blinks of an eye and no one can tell him to stop. In fact, he writes books such as The Alchemy of Finance. Soros thinks he can kill political stability throughout Europe and indeed in America with no challenge. 
Soros is certainly old, but he doesn’t want to be obsolete. His organization has recently been caught conducting covert operations designed to destabilize Russia. Here is an interesting quote from the leaked files of Soros’ Open Society Foundation: 
“Our inclination is to engage in activities and with actors that will understand and counter Russian support to movements defending traditional values…Naming and shaming from us is problematic: we are also in the business of channeling money into other countries for political purposes.” ",0

9510,‘I’m Resigned to Having a Terrible President’ - The New York Times,"Here are the top 10 comments of the week on our digital platforms, as selected by our readers and the journalists who moderate nearly every comment. To see how our readers reacted to Donald Trump’s request that Russian intelligence hack Hillary Clinton’s email, our   on story ever, go here. 1. I am thinking about my mother tonight, the child of immigrants, born in 1919 just when women were given the right to vote. I am remembering all the times she dragged me into the voting booth to show me what a privilege it was to be an American and to live in this country. I can’t talk to her about this historic night, but I can talk to my daughter who can see that her future is limitless. Almost 100 years in the making. It’s been a long time coming.  —   Ann in Connecticut, reacting to an article about Hillary Clinton accepting her party’s presidential nomination, the first woman from a major party to do so. This comment received more than 900 reader recommendations.  2. I think we don’t remember how recently women weren’t allowed to wear pants, or couldn’t attend Ivy League schools. Somehow we failed to pass these stories on to our daughters as we sought to give them all the opportunities of their male counterparts. Now the sexism is often more subtle, more hidden and our daughters take their opportunities for granted. “I’d like a woman, just not this woman. ” There isn’t a mythical, perfect woman running. There is a human woman running, sometimes making mistakes, sometime enduring private pain publicly, sometimes soaring to the highest levels of achievement. Let’s not hold her to a standard of perfection we wouldn’t apply to a man running for president, let’s honor her humanity and success as the first woman to achieve the nomination of a major party.  —   Ellie in Boston. 3. One of the best things to come of this election is the fact that the G. O. P. has been forced to examine the monster which has been allowed to grow in its midst. I firmly believe that something similar is required on the Left. Hillary Clinton is no monster like Trump, but she is the calcification of a   version of what is wrong with politics today: the intransigence and pandering, the corruption and secrecy, the influence of big money, and a    the     approach to an entitled sense of rulership. The Democratic Party has a chance to see what its Bernie contingent is pointing out to party leadership. Were the G. O. P. candidate any better than a buffoon, it would be easier for the mainstream Left to see what is wrong with Hillary. It has nothing whatsoever to do with her gender. The D. N. C. ’s treatment of Bernie Sanders and his supporters has alienated me to a degree I didn’t think possible.  —   Kelvin F. in the Pacific Northwest. This comment received more than 970 reader recommendations and more than 300 reader responses. 4. As a Sanders supporter, I will not be voting for Hillary. At this point, I’m left deciding between Gary Johnson and Jill Stein, who, like Bernie, were both actually against the Iraq war before it started. Or, perhaps, just staying home. I am not alone. The two major candidates are the least popular in history, and the biggest reason their supporters give for voting for them is that they aren’t the other one. I’m resigned to having a terrible president starting next January, but there’s no way I’ll be responsible for electing him or her.  —   Mike in New York. This comment had more than 320 reader recommendations. 5. I love the fact that people are outraged not because the White House was built by slaves, but because someone dared to bring it up.  —   Molly Maxine on The Times’s Facebook page, responding to an article about Michelle Obama’s speech at the Democratic convention, in which she said of the White House, “I wake up every morning in a house built by slaves. ”  This comment received 60 likes. 6. To those morally outraged commenters who are threatening to not vote  —   or to vote for Jill Stein, or Barney Fife, or whomever they imagine will represent some kind of integrity on their part  —   because they’re shocked and dismayed at the revelation that somehow the D. N. C. is “rigged,” I say the following: Everything is rigged! Life is rigged! You will encounter it in every endeavor. Sometimes, it will serve you unfairly, sometimes it will discriminate against you unfairly  —   but it’ll always be there. There is no pure, sterile laboratory environment when it comes to human beings and their comings and goings. Clinton and Sanders are subject to exactly the same dynamics as you and I are as far as that goes. To assume any higher order is  —   sorry  —   to be naive. One of the first lessons a child learns is that life isn’t fair. If they don’t learn it, if they don’t accept it and move forward knowing it, they’ll be disappointed at almost every turn.  —   Sean in New Orleans, reacting to an article about Debbie Wasserman Schultz stepping down as chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee after an email leak revealed party leaders seeking to damage Senator Sanders’s campaign.  7. You know, I’ve often wondered how people who are falsely accused feel after the truth comes to light. Relieved? Vindicated? Righteous? At peace? Supporters of Bernie Sanders have spent close to half a year being told we’re conspiracy theorists, that we’re paranoid, unhinged, entitled whiners unable to face the reality that “all is well, our guy’s just a loser. ” Learning that the D. N. C. did indeed actively collude to deny Bernie Sanders the nomination should make me feel something, shouldn’t it? The evidence is there for even the most stubborn of skeptics to behold: the odds were never in Bernie’s favor and his supporters were right to question the D. N. C. ’s impartiality. But I don’t feel anything. I just feel empty. There are so many days left in this election. There’s a monstrous creature that must be defeated at all costs. I just wish it felt like my party was one of the good guys.  —   Danielle in Seattle. This comment received more than 1, 900 reader recommendations and more than 70 reader responses. 8. Once again, no one is held responsible for the death of an innocent black man. Society and the justice system [are] more ready to find excuses to exonerate when a black life is involved, because somehow he is seen as less valuable. Then, a society without equal empathy for all is surprised to see protests and violence in the streets. In the long term, injustice and peace are not mutually inclusive in any society, as history repeatedly teaches.  —   Merlin in Atlanta, reacting to an article about the state’s attorney dropping all remaining charges against the three Baltimore police officers awaiting trial in the death of Freddie Gray. This comment received more than 80 reader recommendations. 9. Addiction is a disease. Naloxone was no more invented to “cure” it than insulin was invented to “cure” diabetes. The key, and unexamined, phrase in this article is “seek treatment”: where are all those sick people supposed to take their illness when states like mine (with the money to make better choices) are closing rehab clinics like the one that saved my friend when she began her recovery six years ago? Today she is a vibrant counselor to young people. If anyone ever gave YOU a second chance, you ought to reopen your closed mind when it comes to addiction.  —   Megan Macomber in New Haven, reacting to an article about naloxone, a drug that revives someone who has overdosed on opioids. Critics of the drug say it offers addicts a safety net advocates say it offers a path to treatment and recovery. 10. Based on my experience in marketing management at Verizon, I’d say this will be a case of the blind leading the blind. Verizon has so much money to burn  —   but no real strategy in the consumer space. They’ve never really “gotten” the   thing and this is not a company that takes a lot of risk. By the time they got FiOS up and running, the business model for TV consumption was already changing. My guess is that will be a few years of   efforts to launch new “products,” and then they’ll sell the entire consumer side of the business.  —   Pat B. in Blue Bell, Pa. reacting to an article about Verizon’s purchase of Yahoo’s core internet business for $4. 8 billion.

9511,Russian Olympic Chief to Step Down Putin Hints at Other Changes - The New York Times,"President Vladimir V. Putin laid the groundwork this week for a possible   of Russian sports leadership in the wake of a doping controversy that has implicated government officials. At a state sports meeting in Kovrov, Russia, Mr. Putin outlined a broad strategy to redeem the country with global Olympic officials five months after a former director of Russia’s antidoping laboratory detailed a cheating scheme executed by the Russian state. Mr. Putin said that Alexander Zhukov, head of the Russian Olympic Committee since 2010, would step down two years before his term was set to expire, to focus on a new role in the Russian parliament. Before naming his successor, Mr. Putin said, the government would consult with the International Olympic Committee, which has established a disciplinary commission that is set to consider penalties for Russia ahead of the next Winter Games, in 2018. Pointing to Russia’s   finish in the medal standings at this year’s Rio Games  —   behind the United States, China and Britain  —   Mr. Zhukov and Mr. Putin on Tuesday praised Russia’s Olympic delegation for its “ability to take a punch” amid “an aggressive information campaign against Russian athletes. ” Noting that Russia won no medals in diving in Rio, Mr. Zhukov suggested the country recruit specialists from China, given its dominance in the sport. Mr. Putin also hinted at possible changes in Russian sports leadership, announcing a new government position to oversee sports, tourism and youth policy. It was not immediately clear whether that expanded portfolio would be taken on by Vitaly Mutko, Russia’s sports minister. “Importantly, these are the first steps on the path of reform in the sports sector,” Mr. Putin said, denouncing the “prejudice against our athletes” and doping in sports while assuming hazy responsibility for “a number of errors and miscalculations in this important and very sensitive area. ” He said government authorities and a newly created antidoping commission were focused on redeeming Russia’s standing in global sports. Russia’s track and field team remains barred from global competition, its Paralympic team suspended and its national antidoping agency decertified by the global antidoping regulator. Mr. Putin emphasized the government’s financial support of Russia’s antidoping activities, including its annual contributions to the World   Agency, which has made Russia the subject of several investigations over the last year. He suggested a change in the structure of Russia’s antidoping system, proposing to distance it from the sports ministry and instead have it managed by Russia’s Olympic committee. Since the country’s former lab director, Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, outlined in May the precise contours of a   doping system in an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Putin and the country’s top sports officials, including Mr. Zhukov and Mr. Mutko, have been publicly defiant. They called Dr. Rodchenkov, who fled to the United States, a traitor and insisted that his account was fabricated while obliquely acknowledging doping was a “black spot” on the country. But an investigation commissioned by WADA produced proof of Dr. Rodchenkov’s claims, along with evidence establishing Mr. Mutko’s deputy minister, Yuri Nagornykh, as critical in covering up the use of   drugs by top athletes at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, as well as in the years before and after. Mr. Nagornykh disputed The Times’s report in May. After the antidoping regulator published the results of its inquiry in July, Mr. Putin suspended him. Although Mr. Mutko was named in the report as having been complicit in the system, his status as minister has remained steady. Still, the revelations left Russian sports officials scrambling to defend the country’s participation in the Rio Olympics mere weeks before they began. Mr. Zhukov was a key ambassador in that crusade, maintaining that the Russian Olympic Committee was independent of the government and unaffected by any shadows cast on the country’s sports ministry. (Mr. Nagornykh, however, had occupied overlapping roles as deputy minister and a Russian Olympic Committee official.) In the days before Russia’s Olympic roster was completed, Mr. Zhukov politicked at a hotel in Rio and pledged that his country’s delegation would be the purest of any at the Games, given the level of scrutiny applied to it. Mr. Mutko, however, was refused admittance to the Olympics and did not travel to Rio with Russia’s team, which was cut by nearly a third after sports officials deemed athletes tainted unless they proved a rigorous history of drug tests. Now, with Olympic officials anticipating the results of a second investigation this fall  —   which is expected to identify Russian athletes who benefited from the doping system  —   Russia is bracing itself for disciplinary action. Beyond jeopardizing the 33 medals Russia won at the Sochi Games  —   at least 15 of which Dr. Rodchenkov said were won by athletes who had used his   cocktail of anabolic steroids  —   possible penalties could extend to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in February 2018. Some antidoping authorities who lobbied that the Russian flag not fly in Rio have called on Olympic officials to penalize Russia more severely. Joseph de Pencier, chief executive of the Institute of National   Organizations, said last week that he hoped “the reception of Russian athletes in Pyeongchang is very different than the one in Rio,” adding, “The I. O. C. can redeem itself. ” Mr. Putin also publicly waded into the nuances of antidoping protocols in sports this week, criticizing the practice of allowing athletes to use prohibited drugs for legitimate medical reasons. That topic has received global attention this fall, after Russian hackers breached WADA’s athlete database and published the private medical records of top athletes. Of the records the hackers have chosen to release, roughly half relate to American, British and Canadian athletes. The hackers identified themselves as Fancy Bear, a Russian cyberespionage group that forensics specialists have tied to breaches against government agencies, nonprofit organizations and corporations. The I. O. C. and WADA have denounced the hacks, which law enforcement authorities are investigating.",0
9512,"Patti LuPone, Christine Ebersole and Broadway’s Friendliest Feud - The New York Times","“You’ve got lovely beds. Good beds,” the actress Patti LuPone said. She was referring not to furniture, but fingernails: the unvarnished ones on the hands of her current   Christine Ebersole. They contrasted markedly with Ms. LuPone’s nails, which she herself had lacquered in shiny maroon, after years observing professional manicurists. “I watch how they depress the fluid,” Ms. LuPone said, pantomiming bottle and brush. “The problem is, when I put nail polish on it really weakens my nails,” Ms. Ebersole said in a sisterly way. “They just flake off. ” The talons were out, in other words, but this was not a catfight. More a chat ’n’ chew between Tony   actresses getting the chance to share a Broadway stage for the first time in “War Paint,” one of a   new musicals debuting in a mad cram before the season ends. Dressed in a confusion of stretchy black clothing and scarves, the two women were sharing a sofa in the upper half of a sleek duplex at 663 Fifth Avenue, where the flagship of Elizabeth Arden’s signature spa, the Red Door, moved five years ago from the florid former Aeolian Building two blocks north. They had refused treatments and were instead efficiently slurping vegetarian soups. In “War Paint,” which is now in previews and opens at the Nederlander Theater on April 6, Ms. Ebersole, 64, plays Miss Arden, née Florence Nightingale Graham: the entrepreneur who made cosmetics, long associated with prostitutes, acceptable and desirable to the American middle and upper classes starting in the 1910s. Ms. LuPone, 67, plays Arden’s   but equally esteemed competitor, Helena Rubinstein, who imparted both artistic and clinical prestige to the pursuit of beauty, and who is credited with the phrase “there are no ugly women, only lazy ones. ” Bette Davis vs. Joan Crawford Alexis Colby vs. Krystle Carrington: Female rivalries have long meant boffo box office and Nielsen ratings points. But theatergoers hoping for Ms. Ebersole and Ms. LuPone to whack each other with pocketbooks or hurl drinks like Anne Bancroft and Shirley MacLaine in “The Turning Point” are due for disappointment. Rather, their characters fight by issuing new products, raiding staff and investing in premium real estate: penthouses and country spreads for Rubinstein, who donated millions of dollars to arts education and other causes through her foundation an Irish castle and Lexington, Ky. breeding stable for Arden, who was passionately devoted to horses and marched with suffragists. “We should really look at them as role models,” Ms. LuPone said of the two tycoons. “They were really inspiring,” Ms. Ebersole said. “My God,” Ms LuPone said. “Regardless of what their personal flaws were, or what drove them  —   nothing that they achieved for themselves and then in the name of woman has ever been matched!” Ms. Ebersole, more gently: “They paved the way, and started before women had the vote. ” Ms. LuPone was incensed by news reports about the departing C. E. O. of Yahoo, Marissa Mayer. “Her male replacement is getting twice as much as she is,” she said. “Twice as much!” The gender pay inequity common in the film industry is not an issue for “War Paint,” which is capitalized at $11 million and carried by its leading ladies, one or both of whom appear in all but four of the show’s numbers. But the fact that its principal creators are all men might arch an eyebrow. The musical takes its title and basic premise from a dual biography by Lindy Woodhead published in 2004 that a few years later inspired a documentary, “The Powder  the Glory,” to which David Stone, a producer, was introduced by the director James Lapine. Mr. Stone has had tremendous success with “Wicked,” another musical centered on female foes, and, among other projects, worked on “The Vagina Monologues” by Eve Ensler. He called her for advice before proceeding. “Eve said, ‘This can’t be about makeup.’ And it’s not,” Mr. Stone said. “It’s about women and beauty and power and how women treat each other. ” Mr. Stone and Ms. LuPone both wrinkle their noses at the word “diva,” a description cribbed from Italian opera that is now often applied to any commanding female presence in the entertainment industry, inevitably also suggesting an excess of temperament. “I just can’t stand it,” Mr. Stone said. “Diva implies difficult. ” At a talk about the show a few months ago, Ms. LuPone proposed “dame” as an alternative, to approving whoops from the audience. After securing rights to the material, Mr. Stone hired Michael Greif, with whom he had worked on “Next to Normal” and “” to direct. They brought in the composer Scott Frankel, the lyricist Michael Korie and the book writer Doug Wright, Mr. Greif’s collaborators on the musical “Grey Gardens,” inspired by the Maysles brothers’ cult documentary about the eccentric aristocrats “Big Edie” Beale and her daughter, “Little Edie. ” Some early workshops of “War Paint” featured Donna Murphy in the Arden role but she withdrew for family reasons, and Ms. Ebersole, who had won a 2007 Tony for portraying both Beales at different stages of their lives, assumed the part. She and Ms. LuPone, for whom this is the first musical since the   “Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown” (2010) were not shy about participating in the creative process. “Both of them were very excited to play against the obvious  —   feuding,    stars and that kind of energy  —   and actually find ways where the competition between them was nourishing,” Mr. Frankel said a few hours before curtain on a recent evening. “These women were enormously sophisticated and tasteful and   in corporate weaponry,” Mr. Wright said. “They didn’t have to reduce things to an insult they could actually wage business warfare against one another and did so very effectively for 50 years. ” Anything “that felt cheap or easy,” he said, the actresses “instantly rejected. ” Criticism of an    tryout in Chicago last summer focused on relentless   between its two subjects, who supposedly never met in real life. About a third of the show has been revised, the creators said, both to fortify the solo appearances and to find novel ways of bringing the characters together onstage. “There was some tightening,” Mr. Frankel said, slipping into   patois. “Because it’s the two of them, there’s a little bit of inherent    that’s intrinsic in the proposition of the evening, but I think we tried to find ways to mix that up in more unexpected ways. ” He and his colleagues were adamant that “War Paint” is not purely ladies’ entertainment, though the Broadway audience is disproportionately female, a demographic that has helped make shows like “Waitress” into hits. “There are metaphors inherent in the idea of makeup that I think transcend gender,” Mr. Wright said. “It offers a potential mask where you can pretend to be someone you aren’t it offers a disguise if you don’t wish to be recognized it offers an avenue toward a certain kind of perceived   it is a kind of lure to attract someone else. ” But with its   costume changes designed by Catherine Zuber, including   hats and piles of glittering jewelry, and makeup by Angelina Avallone, “War Paint” has been an occasion for the two stars to reflect on how cosmetics and other trappings have been integral to their long careers. “Once I put on the wig it’s like ‘O. K. badda bing, badda boom,’” Ms. LuPone said. “I’m not the type of actress that goes into a corner and meditates for 20 minutes on the bones of Helena Rubinstein. Do you know what I mean?” Ms. Ebersole said that for performers backstage as well as for many people in real life, “putting on makeup is a really great centering device. It’s a way of having you focus on what you’re doing. As you put on the mask, then the other things come through. ” She recalled her work in the 2001 revival of “42nd Street,” for which she won her first Tony with the help of 1930s regalia by Roger Kirk: “The costumes just informed everything. ” This inspired Ms. LuPone to reminisce about “Evita,” for which she got her first Tony, at 31. “The amount of  —   for lack of a better word  —   gack that we’re putting on!” she said. “I also harken back to that time in ‘Anything Goes’ when I was in those   gowns. Oy, I can’t wear a   gown now to save my life, unless I’m strapped in. ” The two actresses were “babies in the city together,” as Ms. LuPone put it. She arrived in 1968 to attend Juilliard, where she studied with Marian Seldes, having known she wanted to perform since she was 4, standing downstage right in a tap recital. Ms. Ebersole, who had gone to MacMurray College in Jacksonville, Ill. before enrolling at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in 1973, had had other plans. “I was going to be a nurse,” she said. “Of course you were,” Ms. LuPone said. “Look at her!” Instead Ms. Ebersole served customers at the Lion’s Rock, a restaurant on the Upper East Side with water splashing down a   slab of red granite. “It’s condominiums now, I think,” she said. Ms. LuPone, meanwhile, worked at a “wannabe mobster” hangout run by a man who imported cages for dancing girls in nightclubs. “My roommate was one of the dancers, and I wasn’t pretty enough, tall enough or thin enough to be a dancer, so I was a waitress in a   lace ” she said. Both women bemoaned a lost era when actors (and stagehands) were recognized and welcomed in the theater district at places like Jimmy Ray’s and Charlie O. ’s, and spent time after the show socializing rather than cultivating followings on Twitter and YouTube. “I think we have fewer showmen,” Ms. LuPone said. “Like the Irving Thalbergs and the Alex Cohens and the Robert Whiteheads and the people that loved the theater or loved making movies. It’s such a cliché, but it’s all bean counters. It’s statistics. Polling. ” This was a reminder that the unexpected foil in the   showdown was Charles Revson, the founder of Revlon, rendered in “War Paint” by Erik Liberman as “a   carnival barker in an Italian suit. ” It’s a line that for some involved with the production took on new resonance after Donald J. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton. Overnight, in their view, the musical went from celebration to cautionary tale. After Rubinstein died in 1965, Revson bought her Park Avenue triplex. But that wasn’t the final indignity. Last year, the company he founded, which had brought sex back into the midcentury cosmetics marketplace with suggestive ad copy and flashy layouts, took over Elizabeth Arden. “Everybody’s rolling over in their grave!” Ms. LuPone said. Not that any of these brands make her particularly nostalgic. “I used to be a Georgette Klinger girl. For years,” she said, after the two women packed up a gift of exfoliating face pads and descended nine floors to the lobby. “Oh my gosh, Georgette Klinger, I completely forgot that name,” Ms. Ebersole said, blinking her blue eyes on the sunny sidewalk. “That was a salon,” Ms. LuPone said. “You’d go in, and close the door, and they were all about getting into your face. They don’t get into your face anymore. ”",0
9513,Senior Preparedness: What Types Of Food To Store?,"Theresa Crouse November 2, 2016 Senior Preparedness: What Types Of Food To Store? 
The great thing about modern technology and food industrialization is that there are now all types of food commercially available. 
That’s great news for those of us who aren’t exactly spring chickens anymore because it makes building a diverse stockpile extremely simple. 
What to Stock? 
When you’re making your list, be sure that you include the following groups in order to have a full supply of foods that will meet your dietary needs: Vegetables: These are most easily bought canned. If you have high blood pressure, watch out for the sodium content because salt is often used as a preservative. Be sure to get a variety of colors because each one offers different nutrients. For example, oranges and reds are high in vitamins A and C and greens offer iron, vitamin C and, often, the B vitamins. Veggies also offer protein as well as fiber that will keep your digestive tract healthy. Fruits: Fruits can be purchased canned, freeze-dried or dehydrated. All forms of preservation maintain high levels of the nutritional value of the fresh fruits. Be sure to buy ones canned in juice instead of ones canned in syrup. Again, go for different colors for the nutritional range that the offer. Fibrous fruits such as peaches are great for long-term energy because the fiber slows the absorption of the natural sugars in the fruit. Meats: Thanks to modern technology, well-preserved meat can be purchased dehydrated, smoked, or canned. Each way is nutritious and delicious. Again, watch the sodium levels if you have blood pressure issues and shoot for nutritious meats such as jerky and canned tuna and chicken instead of fatty, processed meats such as Spam or potted meat. Beans: You can purchase beans canned or dry. They’re a great source of protein and B-vitamins as well as carbohydrates. If you have digestive problems with beans, try soaking them first and cooking them with an onion. That sometimes helps get rid of the “gassy” properties. Dry Goods: Flour, sugar, pastas, rice and other dried goods will be good for two reasons: they’ll help round out your meals with delicious, filling sides and sauces and they’ll make great barter items. Spices: Dried spices last for years and are easy to store. You can also opt to grow your own indoor herb garden, which we’ll discuss in a bit. Spices will make a great barter item as well as help you add flavor to meals. Desserts and Treats: Sometimes eating is about more than nutrition. A nice piece of apple pie can boost morale and give people the mental boost that they need to get through tough times. Adding some pie filling or some chocolate chips to your stockpile will add a welcome burst of comfort to life if SHTF. Don’t depend on treats for nutrition, but storing some for treats or trading is a good idea if you have the room. Fats and Oils: Healthy fats such as olive oil and coconut oil deliver nutrition and a good backup source of energy. They also help flavor meats and are necessary if you want to make such dishes as biscuits or sauces. Your body needs omega-3’s in order to function and since it can’t make them on its own, you need to eat them. Fish and olive oil are both good sources but olive oil doesn’t have the risk of mercury poisoning that you may encounter by eating too much canned fish. Energy Bars: Because they’re portable and often contain all of the nutrition that you need for an entire day, energy or protein bars make great additions to your stockpile. Since they’re lightweight and take up very little space, you should toss a few into your bug-out bag so that you have some quick energy and nutrition should you need to evacuate. 
Stocking Up with Store-Bought Foods 
Though growing your own food and being completely independent of outside food sources is great, it’s also extremely difficult to do if you live in an urban area or have physical limitations. There are numerous reasons why purchasing your food supplies from the store may be your best option, especially as you get older. Here are just a few: The food is safely preserved. You can buy a wide variety all at the same place. There’s no manual labor involved. You don’t have to learn any special food growing or preservation techniques (though we recommend that you learn how to do it in case you need to in a long-term survival situation!) You don’t need garden space or special equipment. Purchasing your food is by far the easiest way to build your stockpile. If you watch for sales and use coupons, it’s extremely affordable as well. Even just taking advantage of BOGO sales will save you a tremendous amount of money. 
Not only can store-bought foods save you time, many of us don’t have the space or the physical strength to manage a large garden anymore. Growing a small one for fresh foods is fabulous but growing one large enough to produce extra for canning can be taxing when you get older. Heat stroke is no fun at all, and picking beans sure is hard on the back muscles. 
If you’re nodding your head in understanding and agreement, store-bought supplies may be the way to go. 
A Bit About the Types of Foods Available Commercially 
You’ve been buying commercially prepared foods all of your life but you probably haven’t ventured far beyond the standard canned foods aisle in your local supermarket. A trip to a hunting goods store or a military surplus store will open up the doors to a few more options. Here’s a brief rundown on the major preservation methods available to you: Canned Food: This one doesn’t need much of a description because unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ve eaten it in mass quantities throughout your life. Food is sealed in plastic or glass jars or in steel or aluminum cans in such a way that air can’t get in to cause spoilage. Dehydrated Food: Again, this one doesn’t need much of an explanation because you’ve surely had jerky or dried fruits. Food is seasoned and cooked in an oven or a dehydrator to remove the liquid. It’s then typically sealed in a bag or jar in order to keep out moisture that will cause spoilage. With the moisture removed, dehydrated food is lightweight, takes up very little space, retains nearly all of its nutritional value and is good practically indefinitely as long as no moisture gets to it. Great for your bug-out bag. You can add water to dehydrated foods to rehydrate them and cook with them. Freeze-Dried Foods: This is a method that you may not be so familiar with. Freeze-drying is a 3-step process sort of similar to dehydrating, except the food is first frozen. Then it goes into a warm vacuum chamber where it remains for several hours. Instead of turning to liquid, the vacuum causes the liquid to leave the food in a frozen form that vaporizes. Finally, the food is dried to remove the rest of the water and sealed to keep moisture out. Most freeze-dried foods have a recommended shelf-life of 25 years. It’s also extremely light and can be eaten as-is or rehydrated and cooked. You can buy single products such as fruits or complete freeze-dried meals. Meals Ready to Eat (MREs): These are meals created originally by the military to provide nutrition to soldiers in the field. Nowadays, they’re available from military surplus stores if you want the real thing. Companies also produce them for the private sector and you can buy them at sporting goods stores. As with freeze-dried or dehydrated foods, MREs are available as single foods or entire meals. Dried Foods: Spices and beans are great examples of foods preserved by drying. It simply involves allowing the product to hang and dry naturally. Unlike dehydrated foods, the process doesn’t involve heat. Otherwise, it’s the same idea; remove the water and bacteria can’t grow. 
With all of these options available, there’s no reason why you can’t stock your pantry and eat well even if disaster strikes. 
Here are a few tips for buying supplies that will help you store what you need while getting the most mileage for your buck: 
Buy foods that you eat. Yes, canned asparagus may be on sale but if you hate it, don’t buy it. There’s a reason that you still have 2 cans of it in your pantry from 1972 – you think it’s gross and would rather go hungry than open that can and ingest the contents. Not a great way to stay in good spirits in a tough situation. 
Buy in bulk. Food is often cheaper if you buy large quantities of it. For instance, a 50lb bag of flour is going to cost much less per pound than a 5lb bag will. You can always separate it out into manageable proportions. Since a bag that large is difficult to handle, check to see if any of your local grocers deliver. Many of them do today and that will make it easier and safer for you to buy items that are difficult to handle. 
Buy extra when you can. This is a great way to build your stockpile with foods that you enjoy. If you’re buying a can of clam chowder, buy two instead. If they’re BOGO, buy four! You’re accomplishing two things here; you’re building your stockpile and you’re ensuring that what you stock is what you like. Plus, you’ll have an extra can of soup on hand if you feel like sharing or if you forget to get it the next time. 
Seal your dried goods. Just because your flour may be good for a year or more, it’s not going to be that appealing with bugs in it. When you get it home, store it in plastic containers or bags that bugs can’t get into so easily. This will keep it fresh longer, too. 
Don’t buy damaged cans. If a can has a dent, don’t buy it. It’s entirely probable that the safety of the food has been compromised because if the can’s damaged, air could get in. Also, cans have a protective lining that keeps the steel or aluminum from seeping into your foods but if they’re dented, that protective lining could be damaged. Don’t risk it even if you’re going to eat it that night . 
Building your stockpile with purchased food offers a safe, simple way to ensure that you’ll have what you need to get you through a survival situation. 
It’s time to go back in time and learn valuable survival secrets and skills from our ancestors.

9514,Arrested Protester of Baton Rouge Police Shooting Files Suit - The New York Times,"NEW ORLEANS  —   DeRay Mckesson is a prominent voice of the Black Lives Matter movement who was arrested in July while protesting the fatal police shooting of a Baton Rouge man selling CDs outside a convenience store. On Thursday, he filed a proposed   lawsuit against the city of Baton Rouge and several law enforcement agencies. The suit, in which Mr. Mckesson is joined as a named plaintiff by two other protesters who were also arrested, says that the police “employed unconstitutional tactics to disturb, disrupt, infringe upon and criminalize” the constitutional rights of assembly and free speech. Mr. Mckesson was arrested July 9, four days after the shooting of the man, Alton Sterling, and as demonstrations had been growing in Baton Rouge. The night he was arrested, on the grounds of “simple obstruction of a highway of commerce,” more than 100 people were also arrested, mostly on the same charge. Mr. Mckesson was held overnight and released the next day. About a week later, the parish prosecutor announced that he would drop charges against Mr. Mckesson and about 100 of the 185 people who had been arrested during the protests. Like Mr. Mckesson, the two other named plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Gloria La Riva of San Francisco and Kira Marrero of Louisiana, were arrested on the   charge, which was later dropped. The suit, which seeks to represent all those arrested on this charge during the July protests, demands the removal of the arrests from criminal records and the reimbursement of bond payments, lawyers’ fees and other costs paid by the plaintiffs. The defendants include Mayor Kip Holden of Baton Rouge the city’s police chief, Carl Dabadie Jr. the parish sheriff and the superintendent of the Louisiana State Police. A spokesman for the mayor’s office could not be reached for comment, and a Baton Rouge Police Department spokesman would not comment. Mr. Mckesson’s lawsuit followed another one concerning the Baton Rouge protests, by the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana. That suit seeks a court order to change the way police respond to protests. Responding to the July protests, which were nearly all peaceful,   officers in Baton Rouge wore riot gear, carried long guns and made arrests on private property. Their tactics have drawn intense criticism, but city officials defended them, citing suspected violent plots against the police. On July 17, a former Marine angered over police shootings traveled to Baton Rouge from Missouri and shot six law enforcement officers, killing three.",0
9515,"Re: Former Congressman Joe Walsh: “If Trump Loses, I’m Grabbing My Musket”","Print 
This election remains more heated than any other in modern history – and for many, it has become a call to arms, even if only metaphorically. 
Despite the fact that DNC operatives have been exposed as the ones inciting violence at rallies – Robert Creamer and Scott Foval for example – and working overtime to bus in illegal voters and rig the vote – the media is going out of its way to paint Trump supporters and grassroots Americans as the ones plotting violence. 
Most recently, they are latching onto comments made by former congressman Joe Walsh, now a conservative radio host, who suggested he would ‘pick up a musket’ if Trump loses the election. On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump. 
On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket. 
You in? 
— Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 
Did Walsh mean to imply violence? That is certainly how the media is portraying it, as his comments spark controversy and fuel fire to the debate over the nearing election. 
The irony that his commentary drew from the imagery of founding-era patriots who stood up to tyranny was deeply lost on the left, who see opponents to Hillary in black and white terms – racist, xenophobic, utterly deplorable and inherently violent. 
CNN followed up, asking Walsh what he meant by statement. 
via CNN : 
Former Rep. Joe Walsh appeared to call for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. 
[…] 
Walsh … did respond to CNN’s Jake Tapper via Twitter when he asked: “What exactly does that mean?” 
“It means protesting. Participating in acts of civil disobedience. Doing what it takes to get our country back,” he responded to Tapper. https://twitter.com/WalshFreedom/status/791382994783133696 https://twitter.com/WalshFreedom/status/791382994783133696 
His heated rhetoric is a response to the endless episodes of fraud, dirty trick and foul play by the Hillary campaign, as it seems that she will stop at nothing to become the first female POTUS – just the sort of abuse of power that the founders warned about. 
1775-76 erupted in response to a long train of abuses – acts of oppression and hostility listed in the Declaration of Independence that is being largely repeated in modern day America. 
Could Hillary’s reported election victory – or Donald Trump’s defeat – signal civil unrest and a new wave of resistance, particularly if the results are widely viewed as fraudulent or “rigged”? Trump, for one, has certainly been talking up the possibility of a stolen election. 
The scenario is plausible enough that the Pentagon and Homeland Security have been carrying out secret drills in the lead up to the election to prepare for the possibility of a martial law response to violence or civil unrest. 
As SHTF detailed in an exclusive report, a whistleblower has come forward on the ominous contingency plan to keep and/or restore order if the populace revolt against the establishment’s “selection” for president: 
If there is any truth to it, the 2016 election could be a kick-off for total tyranny. 
According to an unnamed source – who has provided accurate intel in the past – an unannounced military drill is scheduled to take place during a period leading up to the election and throughout the month after. 
Date: October 30th – 30 days after the election Suspected Region: Northeast, specifically New York 
1st Phase: NROL (No Rule of Law) – drill involving combat arms in metro areas (active and reserve). Source says active duty and reserve service members are being vaccinated as if they are being deployed in theatre. 
2nd Phase: LROL (Limited Rule of Law) – Military/FEMA consolidating resources, controlling water supply, handing out to public as needed. 
3rd Phase: AROL (Authoritarian Rule of Law) – Possible new acronym or term for “Martial Law”. Curfew, restricted movements, basically martial law scenario. 
Source said exercise involves FEMA/DHS/Military 
At this point, no one can say for certain what will happen in the aftermath of November 8, but it is clear that millions and millions of Americans are dissatisfied with the status quo, troubled about the economic realities perpetuated by the Fed and angry that Hillary may be put in the Oval Office rather than a jail cell, despite a trail of corruption with virtually no end. 
How far will things go? 
And will things ever be reset without a new American Revolution?

9518,Rio Olympics: Here’s What Happened Wednesday - The New York Times,"Katie Ledecky and the U. S. 4x200 relay team won the gold medal Wednesday, to the surprise of no one. Since the event became a part of the Olympics in 1996, the Americans have won five of six. Ledecky anchored a squad that included Allison Schmitt, Leah Smith and Maya DiRado to a 1. 84 second victory over Australia, the only other country to triumph in the event at the Summer Games. Canada was third. The Americans were trailing by   of a second when Ledecky hit the water. She split 1 minute 53. 74 seconds, to stop the clock at 7:43. 03. Read Karen Crouse’s story on the race. Daryl Homer of the United States won the silver medal in men’s saber, missing a chance to become the first American man to win an Olympics fencing gold medal in more than a century. Homer, who fences out of the Manhattan Fencing Center and was seeded 10th, beat fencers from Kazakhstan, Germany and Iran on the way to the final. The gold medal match was aggressive and quick, like most saber matchups. Homer quickly fell behind Aron Szilagyi of Hungary and lost,  . With the silver, Homer became the first American medalist in individual saber since Peter Westbrook won a bronze in 1984. The last American gold medal for a man in fencing came at the 1904 St. Louis Games in the single sticks event, in which combatants belted each other with long wooden sticks. The winner, Albertson van zo Post, prevailed over a field of three, all of them Americans.  —   VICTOR MATHER The American cyclist Kristin Armstrong won her third consecutive gold medal in the individual road time trial on Wednesday, becoming the first person to win the same Olympic cycling event three times in a row. What’s more, Armstrong  —   no relation to Lance  —   accomplished the feat one day shy of her 43rd birthday, which also makes her the oldest woman to have won an Olympic cycling gold medal. “We’ve been told we should be finished at a certain age, but there are a lot of athletes out there who are showing that’s not true,” said Armstrong, who overcame a nose bleed at the   mark. Armstrong completed the 29.  (18. ) course in 44 minutes 26. 42 seconds, just ahead of Olga Zabelinskaya of Russia, who finished in 44:31. 97. Anna van der Breggen of the Netherlands won the bronze medal. Soon after her win, Armstrong got a pat on the back from another athlete who seemed to defy age: Barry Bonds. A cycling enthusiast, Bonds posted an image from the race and wrote, “Congratulations Kristin Armstrong 3 time gold medalist,” on his Instagram account. Remarkably, Armstrong almost did not make it to Rio. She came out of retirement in 2015, three years after calling it quits. Her latest gold medal was “the most gratifying,” she said. “It was the hardest of my Olympic journeys. ”  —   KEN BELSON Men’s basketball: The United States had an unaccustomed scare in men’s basketball, beating Australia by only  . The U. S. trailed by 5 at the half and needed some big 3’s late by Carmelo Anthony to win. Patty Mills of the San Antonio Spurs led Australia with 30 points Anthony had 31 for the United States. Men’s gymnastics  : Kohei Uchimura of Japan, often called the greatest gymnast ever, retained his title. He delivered a 15. 8 with a difficult high bar routine to overtake Oleg Verniaiev of Ukraine on the final apparatus. The practically unbeatable Uchimura has also won the last six world championship   titles. No Medal for U. S. Rugby Sevens: The American men lost to Fiji,   and were eliminated from the competition. The United States missed by the narrowest of margins: Its point differential,   was just 1 short of that of New Zealand, which grabbed the last spot in the quarterfinals. Different sports require different body types, right? Volleyball players are usually long and lean. Weight lifters, not so much. So we asked a bunch of Olympians and Paralympians to strip down to their underwear (or whatever they felt comfortable with) so you could try to guess which sport they compete in. How many can you guess correctly? More Gold for U. S. Swimmers: Katie Ledecky picked up her second gold medal of the Rio Games, and Michael Phelps racked up the 20th and 21st of his career Tuesday. Ledecky won the 200 freestyle, expected to be the toughest of her individual races. Here’s how the race went down. Phelps won his signature event, the 200 butterfly, and exulted afterward, gesturing as if to say he would take on all comers. To top it off, he later swam the anchor of the men’s 4x200 freestyle relay, which the United States won easily. Here’s a look at Phelps’s night. Green Pool? An unsettling thing happened at the Olympic diving pool on Tuesday: The water inexplicably turned green, just in time for the women’s synchronized   platform diving competition. Officials said they did not know what had caused the trouble, exactly. But they declared the water had been tested and was not dangerous. It was an unsettling sight, appearing to become greener and murkier as the day went on, having been a lovely light blue on Monday. The British diver Tom Daley, who won a bronze medal in the same pool the day before, posted a photograph on Twitter showing the contrast between the colors of the pools. “Ermmm. ..what happened? !” he wrote. Here is the full article, including an interview with a pool repairman in California who has some ideas about what might be causing the greenness. U. S. Gymnasts Dominate: Simone Biles, Laurie Hernandez, Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas and Madison Kocian lived up to expectations as prohibitive favorites by putting up the highest total score in every apparatus.

THE HSE has forwarded a warning to hospitals across the country to be vigilant as they enter the winter months, as patients are dying off and are more likely to lash out in anger. 
As the weather gets colder and resources become scarce, the death rate in older and more vulnerable patients tends to skyrocket, leaving just the younger and more capable workers and drones to survive until the spring. 
Although plenty of patients die on trolleys and on waiting lists during the summer, it has been proven that they tend to kick up more of a fuss during the winter, and will launch stinging attacks on those around them; sometimes doctors and nurses, but mostly at the HSE itself. 
“I thought it was just that the numbers of patients increases during the winter, made it seem like they were more vicious… but no, they actually do get angrier as they die,” said Minister for Health Simon Harris. 
“Anyways, be careful if you’re visiting a hospital for any reason, or if you’re a TD working in an area where cuts have closed hospitals or undermined services. I personally won’t be going near a hospital until April at the earliest”. 
Harris went on to add that if a member of the public should see a patient dying in a hospital, to try and give them a saucer of sugary water or something. 
“It couldn’t hurt”, said Harris.",0

Coincidiendo con el fin del primer episodio de alta contaminación del otoño, el Ayuntamiento de Madrid ha presentado este miércoles el borrador de su Plan de Calidad del Aire y Cambio Climático. La propuesta más ambiciosa del plan es la de crear una gran Área de Prioridad Residencial (APR) que obligará a los coches que quieran circular por el centro de Madrid a hacerlo montados en autobuses públicos. 
“Los ciudadanos que insisten en coger el coche pese a las recomendaciones oficiales tendrán que coger también el autobús. Irán en coche si es lo que quieren, pero el coche tendrá que usar el transporte público”, ha explicado hoy la alcaldesa de la capital, Manuela Carmena. 
Las primeras pruebas han sido un poco caóticas, aunque el consistorio achaca las dificultades a la falta de costumbre. “¿Te puedes creer que había dos Smarts sentados al lado de la puerta del bus y han mirado hacia otro lado para no dejar que me sentara yo, que conduzco un Seiscientos viejo que apenas se tiene en pie?”, protestaba uno de los conductores, molesto por la falta de civismo de algunos ciudadanos. 
Otros conductores se han negado a bajar el volúmen de la música, motivando las protestas del resto del pasaje. “Por culpa del hortera ese del BMW no se oía nada cuando se anunciaban las paradas. Suerte que se ha bajado enseguida”, relata otro viajero, que se queja también de que muchos “ponen las ruedas encima de los asientos, sin reparo alguno”. 
El Ayuntamiento recuerda que las normas de uso del transporte público valen también para los coches que vayan en autobús. “No pueden solicitar la rampa de minusválidos a no ser que el conductor sea minusválido y las conductoras embarazadas tienen prioridad al sentar sus coches, pero no sobre las peatonas embarazadas, que ni siquiera tienen el asiento del coche para sentarse”, aclaraba Carmena esta mañana.",0
9527,In His Own Words: Gorsuch’s Lively Writings at Columbia - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Decades before he began writing legal opinions, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, President Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court, was a student columnist at Columbia University. And he had no shortage of opinions. His topics ranged broadly, from life on campus to the   affair. His conservatism was a constant. And he had a lively writing style that persists to this day. He and his collaborators seemed to sense that their writings would survive the years. “We ought not forget,” they wrote in an unsigned 1987 editorial for The Federalist Paper, which Judge Gorsuch helped start, “there is something vital and useful in the curious, if imperfect youth  —   something that shall not be stifled. ” Here is a selection of that youthful curiosity. While mounting an ultimately unsuccessful bid for a seat on the university Senate as a freshman in 1986, Judge Gorsuch was asked by The Columbia Daily Spectator for his views on   issues, including the question of whether the Marines should be allowed to recruit on campus. The Spectator commissioned a series of columns on the lessons that should be learned from the   affair. Judge Gorsuch, whose mother had served in the Reagan administration, saw a need for a more decisive American foreign policy. In a February 1987 column, he took the university to task for what he called its failure to promote diversity (“that cherished buzzword”) of thought. In March 1987, Judge Gorsuch argued against making Columbia’s fraternity system coed as the university more fully integrated women. Writing with his friend Michael Behringer in The Federalist Paper, Judge Gorsuch, a member of Phi Gamma Delta, once more cited freedom of association. In 1988, Columbia was embroiled in debates about its fraternities, new university rules governing protests, and a student council election. Judge Gorsuch, never a fan of student protesters, derided “progressives” in a Spectator   column as being anything but progressive as they claimed “a monopoly on righteousness. ”",0

Donald Trump is not very popular in New York City. Obviously, he lives in his big tower with his name in gold on the city’s famed Fifth Avenue, but if the images of him walking into his polling place to vote for himself are any indication, what he thinks of himself isn’t what the people of New York City think of him. 
As Trump went to vote with his wife Melania and daughter Ivanka, flanked by Secret Service agents, he was booed loudly by voters waiting in line. This isn’t surprising if you’ve lived in New York, as I have. It is always a blue state, and it is also extraordinarily accepting of all people. Trump, however, throughout his travesty of a campaign run on hatred, fear, ignorance, and bigotry, has shown himself to be the exact opposite of most New Yorkers. 
If this video is any indication, it seems that the start of Election Day does not bode well for how it will end for Trump and his hateful supporters.

9529,FAKE NEWS: CNN Ties MILO to White Nationalists Despite Explicit Rejection of Racism - Breitbart,"CNN published an article and video about Breitbart Senior editor MILO Thursday which associated MILO with the   and “white nationalist” and “ ” activists despite his explicit rejection of them. [In a video piece accompanying an article headlined, “Milo Yiannopoulos is trying to convince colleges that hate speech is cool,” CNN states that MILO is on a mission to “take on the liberal college establishment, and he’s not the only one” before cutting to an interview with white nationalist Nathan Damigo. The video then shows clips from white nationalist Richard Spencer’s rallies and claims that Spencer’s planned college tour is inspired directly by MILO.  “Why are you seeking to associate me with these people?” MILO asked the CNN interviewer, who replied, “They associate themselves with you. ” “What you are seeking to do, by associating me with people who have odious and disgusting opinions, is suggest that I somehow in some way tacitly enable these people,” MILO replied. “I don’t. I don’t have unsavory opinions about skin color. F*ck you. ” CNN asked some of the students that invited MILO to UC Berkeley about their opinion on what MILO is doing in trying to “take down the ivory tower” of   college campuses, “they’re finally learning from the Democrats. ” One student added, “it’s been years and years that they’ve controlled the university. ” Unlike the protesters at UC Berkeley, MILO has stated multiple times that skin colour and race do not matter, ideas and values do. Last week while speaking at UC Colorado Springs, MILO explicitly denounced racism: “White pride, white nationalism, white supremacy isn’t the way to go,” he continued. “The way to go is reminding them and yourselves that you should be aspiring to values and to ideas. ” “You should be focusing on what unites people and not what drives them apart,” MILO concluded. “You shouldn’t give a shit about skin color, a shit about sexuality  …     You shouldn’t give a shit about gender, and you should be deeply suspicious of the people who do. ” CNN did not include those statements in their story, but they were sure to include this analysis from the   League’s Oren Segal: “Whether Milo considers himself actually   or not, clearly those who represent the   see what he’s doing as an opportunity for them as well. ”",0
9530,"After Searching the World for a Cure, a Mother Seeks Normalcy - The New York Times","When a Russian oncologist called her    daughter’s brain tumor “untreatable,” Elena Romanova researched alternatives through the night. A young mother of three, Ms. Romanova had spent a year and a half in a Moscow hospital as her daughter Ksenia Subbotina went through radiation, chemotherapy and two brain operations. Despite all of the treatment, the cancer had spread to her spine, and the doctor said Ms. Romanova should prepare    care for Ksenia. “I knew there was no cure in Russia,” Ms. Romanova said. “So the question was where to go next. ” That July night in 2012 she emailed doctors around the world about additional treatments. A doctor in London offered a screening for $32, 000 that included an M. R. I. and a pathology analysis to determine the next steps. Ms. Romanova did not have that much money. The Russian government had paid for hospital stays and general medication during Ksenia’s years there, but in order to secure better care, the family had slipped money to doctors and nurses, spending all of their meager savings. Her husband worked as a furniture builder to help pay expenses and to care for Ms. Romanova’s other children. She said they would have sold their car but needed it to get to the hospital. They eventually applied to The Russian Aid Foundation, or Rusfond, a charity providing financial help to families with critically ill children. In January 2013 Ms. Romanova and her daughter began a      journey that would take them to hospitals in cities around the world, where Ksenia received chemotherapy and proton radiation therapy, participated in clinical trials and underwent three additional brain operations. Rusfond provided money for six cycles of aggressive chemotherapy and two cycles of targeted chemotherapy in London. During that time, Ms. Romanova became fluent in English by reading medical reports and discussing treatments with British doctors. Eventually doctors in London suggested that they go to a proton therapy center in Prague for additional treatment. Since the aid covered only the treatments in London, she started a   website and Facebook page, hosted dinners to raise money and sold dried fruits on the street. In total, she said she paid another $180, 000 for treatments abroad. “We went where there was hope,” she said. “We had to keep fighting. If we fought long enough, maybe one day, they’d find something that worked. ” The fight continued into a new year, 2014, and in a new city, Houston. That January, Ksenia received a targeted chemotherapy treatment that caused excessive internal bleeding. It seemed she would not survive, until a doctor  —   “I will never forget his hands,” Ms. Romanova said  —   stopped the bleeding and removed part of the tumor. Her daughter healed, but could not continue the risky therapy. By then, Ms. Romanova had already secured an offer from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan for a chemotherapy treatment in clinical trials, which began that February. So mother and daughter moved again, and the rest of the family joined them several months later. There, doctors found a cyst developing in her brain near problematic lesions, and decided to operate. The surgery left Ksenia’s left side weak and she was no longer able to walk. After another round of chemotherapy, her brain bled again. This time, doctors could not stop it. Ms. Romanova’s voice cracked recalling Ksenia’s final weeks, holding her daughter’s hand and praying for a miracle that did not come. She died on July 7, 2014. Unable to bear the thought of cremating her body to take her back to Russia, the family buried Ksenia in a cemetery in Rockland County, New York. They returned to Moscow in August, and Ms. Romanova said she sank into depression and had suicidal thoughts. “I didn’t feel anything at all,” she said. “I kept waiting for her to come back. I knew I had to live for my other kids. But without my youngest, every day was not right. ” Just two months after Ksenia’s death, her oldest daughter, Anna, then 13, lost feeling on her left side. Doctors in Russia said she had multiple sclerosis, but Ms. Romanova had doubts. She sent Anna’s medical records to friends in the United States, who shared them with doctors. Those doctors, she said, also questioned the diagnosis. Ms. Romanova took her children to Long Island on tourist visas in October 2014 for Anna to get treatment, and she improved. Her doctors, Ms. Romanova said, told her the ailments were most likely  . On a cold December night inside the family’s dimly lit Brooklyn apartment, Ms. Romanova, 34, spoke in soft tones about the daughter she lost. Splayed at her feet, her son, Artem, 11, shuttled a silver marble across the floor, sending the cat flying. Anna, now 15, huddled protectively over her mother as she recounted the story. Being in New York, Ms. Romanova said, reminds her of hopeful times, of Saturdays riding horses at Riverdale Stables in the Bronx and walks along the East River. “In New York, I felt closer to her,” Ms. Romanova said of Ksenia. Now, she hopes to make the city her permanent home. She applied for political asylum in March 2015, outlining the persecution she faced living as a practicing Baptist in Russia. She is still waiting for an interview for asylum. She works as a billing assistant at a medical office, earning $1, 400 a month. Unable to meet her family’s living expenses and $   rent, she took a second job in September as a home attendant, earning an extra $900 a month. She receives no public assistance, and her pending immigration status excludes her from receiving food stamps. She said that her marriage fell apart shortly after Ksenia’s death, and that she has no family in the United States to whom she could ask for support. Six months behind on bills, she eventually contacted Edith and Carl Marks Jewish Community House of Bensonhurst, a beneficiary agency of   of New York, one of eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The Marks JCH provided her with a $550 grant in November to pay for cooking gas and electricity. Ms. Romanova also enrolled in a job placement program there. Taped to the kitchen wall is a reminder to her children: “The most important thing in life is to be brave and follow your heart and intuition. ” She said she wanted Artem to excel in math and chess and Anna in singing and musical composition. As for herself, “I want to start over again,” Ms. Romanova said. “I just want to get a normal job and live a normal life with my kids. ”",0
9531,Scientists Baffled To Find Melanesians Carry DNA Of An Unknown Human Species,"Share on Facebook Hints of an unidentified, extinct human species have been found in the DNA of modern Melanesians – those living in a region of the South Pacific, northeast of Australia. According to new genetic modelling, the species is unlikely to be Neanderthal or Denisovan – two ancient species that are represented in the fossil record – but could represent a third, unknown human relative that has so far eluded archaeologists. “We're missing a population, or we're misunderstanding something about the relationships,” Ryan Bohlender, a statistical geneticist from the University of Texas, told Tina Hesman Saey at Science News . Bohlender and his team have been investigating the percentages of extinct hominid DNA that modern humans still carry today, and say they've found discrepancies in previous analyses that suggest our mingling with Neanderthals and Denisovans isn't the whole story. It's thought that between 100,000 and 60,000 years ago, our early ancestors migrated out of Africa, and first made contact with other hominid species living on the Eurasian landmass. This contact left a mark on our species that can still be found today, with Europeans and Asians carrying distinct genetic variants of Neanderthal DNA in their own genomes. And that's not all they've given us. Earlier this year , researchers investigated certain genetic variants that people of European descent inherited from Neanderthals, and found that they're associated with several health problems, including a slightly increased risk of depression , heart attack , and a number of skin disorders. And a separate study published earlier this month found evidence that modern genital warts – otherwise known as the human papillomavirus (HPV) – were sexually transmitted to Homo sapiens after our ancestors slept with Neanderthals and Denisovans once they left Africa. While our relationship with Neanderthals has been widely researched, how we interacted with the Denisovans – the distant cousins of Neanderthals – is less clear. The problem is that Neanderthals are well represented in the fossil record, with many remains having been uncovered across Europe and Asia, but all we have of the Denisovans is a lone finger bone and a couple of teeth that were found in a Siberian cave in 2008 . Using a new computer model to figure out the amount of Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA carried by modern humans, Bohlender and his colleague found that Europeans and Chinese people carry a similar amount of Neanderthal DNA: about 2.8 percent. That result is pretty similar to previous studies have estimated that Europeans and Asians carry, on average, between 1.5 and 4 percent Neanderthal DNA. But when they got to Denisovan DNA, things were a bit more complicated, particularly when it came to modern populations living in Melanesia – a region of the South Pacific that includes Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia, West Papua, and the Maluku Islands. As Hesman Saey explains for Science News: “Europeans have no hint of Denisovan ancestry, and people in China have a tiny amount – 0.1 percent, according to Bohlender's calculations. But 2.74 percent of the DNA in people in Papua New Guinea comes from Neanderthals. And Bohlender estimates the amount of Denisovan DNA in Melanesians is about 1.11 percent, not the 3 to 6 percent estimated by other researchers. While investigating the Denisovan discrepancy, Bohlender and colleagues came to the conclusion that a third group of hominids may have bred with the ancestors of Melanesians.”“Human history is a lot more complicated than we thought it was,” he told her. This find is supported by a separate study by researchers from the Natural History Museum of Denmark, who analysed DNA from 83 Aboriginal Australians and 25 locals from the Papua New Guinea highlands. As we reported last month, this was the most comprehensive genetic study of Indigenous Australians to date, and it indicated that they are the oldest continuous civilization on Earth, dating back more than 50,000 years ago. But the results revealed something else – DNA that was very similar to that of the Denisovans, but distinct enough for the researchers to suggest that it could have come from a third, unidentified hominid . “Who this group is we don't know,” lead researcher Eske Willerslev told Hesman Saey. Until we have more concrete evidence of this hypothesized third human species (some fossils would be nice), we can't prove this, and we should point out that Bohlender's estimates have yet to be formally peer-reviewed , so they might shift with further scrutiny. And it could be that our identification of Denisovan DNA is more ambiguous than we think, given that our only source is a finger bone and a couple of teeth. But the evidence is mounting that our interactions with ancient humans were far more complex than we'd assumed, which shouldn't be much of a surprise, when you think about it. Just because we don't see them in the fossil record doesn't mean they didn't exist – preserving the remains of something for tens of thousands of years isn't easy, and then someone has to be in the right place at the right time to dig them up. Hopefully, the more we investigate the genetic make-up of our most ancient societies, the more hints we'll get of the rich and complicated history our species shared with those that didn't make it to modern times. So much incredible findings of an unknown DNA surface , we may need to think twice before saying that we are ‘alone’ in the universe. The results of Bohlender's analysis were presented last week at the 2016 American Society of Human Genetics meeting in Canada. Related:",0
9532,Flu Shot Hoax Admitted: 'No Controlled Trials Demonstrating a Decrease in Influenza',"Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/flu-shot-hoax-admitted-no-controlled.html The flu shot is a fraud. But it’s a fraud that’s so deeply embedded in the delusional pro-vaccine culture of the pharma-controlled medical industry that even well-meaning doctors and pharmacists (who are otherwise very intelligent) fail to realize flu shots don’t work. In fact, flu shot vaccine inserts openly admit there is no scientific evidence demonstrating flu shots work . See the vaccine insert photos below for proof.This is probably why people who receive the flu shot almost never receive the insert sheet. It’s not handed out by doctors and pharmacists because they don’t want people to realize the extent of the pseudoscience behind the flu shot scam.It’s so much easier to demand blind obedience while screaming “SCIENCE!” than to actually allow people to read the science and realize the science conclusively states there is “… no decrease in influenza disease after vaccination.”In fact, most people who have taken flu shots aren’t even aware that an insert sheet exists at all.Ever wonder what it says?NOTE: Every photo in this article is 100% factual and true. Ask your pharmacist for a vaccine insert sheet to see one of these for yourself. Insert sheet acquired for GlaxoSmithKline’s FLULAVAL flu shot In the interests of public safety and journalistic inquiry — I’m a multiple award-winning journalist, after all — I acquired a FLULAVAL flu shot vial and insert sheet for the 2014 flu shot, and I read through the microscopic insert text using a magnifier.Here’s a photo of the FLULAVAL vial and box in which the insert was found. Note that this photo clearly shows the flu shot label admitting the shot contains “thimerosal as a preservative.” Thimerosal is made from toxic mercury. But there’s much more in this insert… “No decrease in influenza disease” after vaccination Read the language in the following photo of the FLULAVAL vaccine insert very carefully.It says:FLULAVAL is a vaccine indicated for active immunization against influenza disease… but doesn’t ever claim the vaccine actually works.In the very next bullet point, the vaccine insert admits: …there have been no controlled trials adequately demonstrating a decrease in influenza disease after vaccination with FLULAVAL. In other words, GlaxoSmithKline confirms there is no evidence to back this flu shot .Got that? Amazing, isn’t it? Especially given how many people scream about flu shots being “SCIENTIFIC!” and backed by “EVIDENCE!”It turns out that if you want protection from the flu, you might get the very same results by rubbing a lucky rabbit’s foot or hopping around your living room in some sort of “anti-flu dance.”All of these — the flu shot, the rabbit’s foot and the anti-flu dance — are backed by the same amount of scientific evidence. “Safety and effectiveness not established” There’s even more. If you keep reading the FLULAVAL insert, it says in black and white text, “Safety and effectiveness of FLULAVAL in pediatric patients have not been established.”The same insert also says, “FLULAVAL has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or for impairment of fertility.”As you can also see, this same insert also explains that when you’re being injected with a flu shot, you’re also being injected with mercury, formaldehyde and other toxic ingredients: “Thimerosal, a mercury derivative, is added as a preservative. Each … dose contains 50 mcg thimerosal. Each dose may also contain residual amounts of ovalbumin, formaldehyde, and sodium deoxycholate from the manufacturing process.” Toxic side effects include facial paralysis and more If you keep reading the FLULAVAL vaccine insert, you’ll eventually get to a section called “Postmarketing Experience.”This subhead means here are all the side effects reported by actual users after being vaccinated . In other words, these are the results of turning the human population into vaccine guinea pigs.Just some of the adverse effects experienced after flu shot vaccines include:• Eye pain and chest pain• Arthritis• Dizziness, tremors and losing consciousness (syncope)• Convulsions and seizures• Cranial nerve paralysis or limb paralysis• Swelling of the brain• Partial facial paralysis… and much more. See the text yourself:Here’s a more complete list of some of the adverse effects typically listed on flu shot vaccine insert sheets:Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Lymphadenopathy.Eye Disorders: Eye pain, photophobia.Gastrointestinal Disorders: Dysphagia.General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Chest pain, injection site inflammation, asthenia, injection site rash, abnormal gait, injection site bruising, injection site sterile abscess.Immune System Disorders: Allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema.Infections and Infestations: Rhinitis, laryngitis, cellulitis.Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Muscle weakness, arthritis.Nervous System Disorders: Dizziness, paresthesia, hypoesthesia, hypokinesia, tremor, somnolence, syncope, Guillain-Barre syndrome, convulsions/seizures, facial or cranial nerve paralysis, encephalopathy, limb paralysis.Psychiatric Disorders: Insomnia.Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders: Dyspnea, dysphonia, bronchospasm, throat tightness.Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Urticaria, pruritus, sweating.Vascular Disorders: Flushing, pallor.“Do not administer FLULAVAL to anyone…”If you go on to read this entire insert, which is quite lengthy and very difficult for any normal person to read, here’s what else it says:“Safety and effectiveness of Flulaval have not been established in pregnant women, nursing mothers or children.”“Do not administer Flulaval to anyone… following previous administration of any influenza vaccine.”You can confirm all this for yourself by going to any pharmacy and asking for a flu shot insert sheet . While the language printed on the sheet will vary from one manufacturer to another, they all reveal fascinating things like: Flu shot ingredients Documented flu shot side effects (which always include neurological problems such as seizures) Warnings not to give them to children or pregnant women (in most cases) “No adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women” One of the FLULAVAL vaccine insert sheets I looked at said the following: “There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, FLULAVAL should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.” What this paragraph says is, essentially, “We have no evidence this is safe in pregnant women, but it’s okay to inject pregnant women with this anyway, as long as they need it.”And of course the pseudoscience mainstream media is happy to loudly and repeatedly proclaim that all pregnant women “need” the flu shot, a claim founded in nothing but wishy washy junk science and corporate profit motives. So doctors, who obediently inject almost anything into pregnant women as long as Big Pharma tells them it’s okay, are happy to keep poisoning women’s bodies with mercury and formaldehyde even though, as the insert openly admits: “There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women.” How to transform a quack vaccine into “evidence-based medicine” Keep in mind these vaccine inserts are directly telling you the vaccine isn’t backed by clinical evidence of safety or efficacy . It’s practically claiming, “This vaccine is based on voodoo. Take it at your own risk…”You may be wondering, then, if a vaccine openly admits it doesn’t work and hasn’t been adequantely tested and contains toxic chemicals, how exactly does this vaccine get sold to the public as “evidence-based medicine” that’s loudly proclaimed to be good for children, infants, pregnant women, senior citizens and everyone else?It’s simple: THEY LIE.A medical lie repeated often enough by people in high enough positions of apparent authority will be obediently accepted by the gullible masses. This devious art of lying to the public about vaccines is deeply embedded in the culture thanks to the incessant pro-vaccine propaganda of the mainstream media which asks no question at all about vaccine safety and refuses to discuss vaccine ingredients or neurological side effects, even when they’re printed directly on the vaccine insert.Most people assume something like:“Well, if it wasn’t proven safe and effective, it wouldn’t be allowed on the market, because the FDA protects us all, right?”And so they line up their kids to be injected with mercury and formaldehyde and sometimes even stealth cancer viruses which have contaminated vaccines throughout history .Some of those kids have seizures, go into comas or suffer severe neurological damage that turns them into autistic children. CDC scientist openly admits to vaccine-autism cover-up This was openly admitted by the CDC’s own top scientist in one of the most aggressively censored medical stories of 2014, where Dr. William Thompson publicly wrote the following admission:“My name is William Thompson. I am a Senior Scientist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where I have worked since 1998. I regret that my coauthors and I omitted statistically significant information in our 2004 article published in the journal Pediatrics. “The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased risk for autism. Decisions were made regarding which findings to report after the data were collected, and I believe that the final study protocol was not followed.”This story was wholly and dutifully blacked out by the entire national press, by the way. The fact that the CDC committed scientific fraud related to links between vaccines and autism is something they never want you to learn.And yet it’s all right in front of you if you’re willing to read the vaccine insert, read the CDC scientist’s own confession and learn a little about the toxicity of mercury. Chemical-laced vaccine advocates clearly desire to bring harm to children It’s clear from all this that the vaccine industry really does want to harm and destroy children. If vaccine advocates didn’t want to harm children, they would call for the immediate removal of mercury, formaldehyde and other toxic chemicals from all vaccines.If they wanted, they could advocate “clean vaccines” which contain no toxic chemicals. But they consciously choose not to do this. They really do want the toxic chemicals to be injected into pregnant women and children , and that’s exactly why they demand blind vaccine obedience from the masses. No questions allowed. No rational thinking tolerated. No skepticism of vaccines is “politically correct.”In fact, the CDC openly admits that mercury, formaldehyde, MSG, aluminum, antibiotics and other chemicals are still used in vaccines . Here’s a screen shot from the CDC website’s vaccine additives page which openly states this:The same CDC that committed scientific fraud and covered up links between vaccines and autism predictably claims all these toxic chemicals are perfectly safe to be injected into children.That’s how you know they’re truly evil: When they knowingly commit fraud in order to continue the practice of poisoning human bodies with toxic chemicals, that’s an admission that they actively desire to harm health and destroy lives.When I once confronted a vaccine pusher with the fact that flu shots contain mercury and that if the same concentration of mercury was found in a vitamin it would be banned by the FDA , that person told me, “Mercury in vitamins makes them dangerous. But mercury in vaccines makes them work better.”That’s the kind of insane logic you’ll frequently encounter among vaccine pushers / poisoners. For those who reject pseudoscience vaccines, the state points a gun in your face When people come to their senses and realize they probably shouldn’t inject themselves and their children with mercury, formaldehyde, aluminum and other toxic vaccine ingredients, they are quickly met with a belligerent medical police state that shoves guns in their faces and demands they comply.As reported by Police State USA [4]:“A state bureaucracy is threatening a mother with removal of an infant unless her entire family subjects themselves to flu shots. “The Washington Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) is giving the Tacoma family until February to comply with the mandated regimen of influenza vaccines — imposed on every member of the family — or else they will lose their youngest child, a 2-week-old foster infant that was born on Christmas.”The medical police state, you see, is threatening to carry out yet another medical kidnapping of a foster infant if the entire family doesn’t agree to be obediently injected with toxic chemicals. Click here to read a recent list of medical kidnappings happening in America, many over vaccine issues.Yes, this is all happening in America… even though it sounds like a story out of a North Korea gulag. Make sure you understand this has nothing whatsoever to do with protecting the foster child. This is about a militant health agency “teaching that woman a lesson” and demanding she sacrifice the health of her entire family as a sign of loyalty.The Aztecs used to demand families give up their firstborn sons to have their hearts cut out in ritualistic sacrifices to appease their gods. Today, modern medicine follows the same pattern, demanding families sacrifice their health in order to appease the pharma-corrupted bureaucrats, many of whom are pedophiles and child rapists to begin with. Just recently, a top U.S. Health and Human Services executive was sentenced to 25 years in prison after he “accessed child pornography, solicited child pornography from other members, and exchanged private messages with other members in which he expressed an interest in the violent rape and murder of children,” reports Mediaite.com .As Mac Slavo explains on SHTFplan.com : “Whether you agree with yearly flu vaccines or not, the following report from Tacoma, Washington should scare the hell out of you because if the government moves forward with their threats then every child in America will effectively become a ward of the state. ” A quick summary of the flu shot fraud • Flu shot vaccine inserts openly admit there is no evidence that flu shots work.• Flu shots still contain toxic mercury, a potent neurotoxin.• Flu shot vaccine inserts openly admit flu shots caused seizures, paralysis and other neurological disorders, which is not surprising given that they still contain mercury, a potent neurotoxin.• Vaccine propaganda is so mindless and aggressive that anyone who merely cites the printed vaccine insert is immediately condemned as “anti-science,” even though the science is perfectly clear that many vaccines are backed by no scientific evidence at all.• The CDC has altered vaccine safety data in a conspiracy to hide truthful facts about vaccine risks from the public.• Informed parents who consciously choose to avoid having their children injected with medically useless (but dangerous) vaccines are increasingly criminalized while their children are subjected to medical kidnapping .• For publishing truthful photos of printed vaccine inserts, Natural News is subjected to heavy censorship in an attempt to make sure the public never learns this information.

9533,Clinton Campaign Questions Release Of FBI's Marc Rich Pardon Records,"Clinton Campaign Questions Release Of FBI's Marc Rich Pardon Records   Source: Zero Hedge 
As reported moments ago, in what appears to have been a surprise release, the FBI's Vault twitter account released 129 pages of files related to the FBI's 2001 prove into Bill Clinton's 2001 pardon of Marc Rich. And while NBC reported that the files were releases as part of a normal subpoena, the increasingly paranoid (not without reason) Clinton campaign immediately had questions. According to Politico , ""Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign raised questions about the timing of the FBI’s release Tuesday of records on a 15-year-old investigation into President Bill Clinton’s pardon to fugitive financier Marc Rich."" 
The FBI posted the 129 pages of records in its online Freedom of Information Act reading room in apparent response to a FOIA request seeking information on FBI inquiries into the Clinton Foundation. On the website, the release was dated Monday, but an FBI Twitter account flagged the new posting at noon on Tuesday. 
As Politico adds, the Clinton campaign, which is already at odds with FBI Director James Comey over his disclosure of new evidence in the Clinton email probe, immediately questioned why Clinton-related records were being released just a week before the election. 
“Absent a FOIA litigation deadline, this is odd. Will FBI be posting docs on Trump’s housing discrimination in ’70s?” Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon asked on Twitter. Absent a FOIA litigation deadline, this is odd. Will FBI be posting docs on Trump's housing discrimination in '70s? https://t.co/uJMMzX6rtI 
— Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) November 1, 2016 
When reached by Politico, spokespeople for the FBI and the Justice Department did not immediately respond to questions about whether there were any lawsuits seeking the newly posted material or whether a judge had set a deadline for its disclosure. 
Despite the lack of major revelations in the documents, which constitute only a part of the FBI’s files on the inquiry, the atmospherics in the records are unhelpful to the Clinton campaign. The records repeatedly refer to the probe being handled by the “Public Corruption Unit” and make clear that the FBI was examining claims that Denise Rich’s Democratic Party “donations may have been intended to influence the fugitive’s pardon.” 
“It appears that the required pardon standards and procedures were not followed,” the internal FBI memos said. 
Indeed, the request for a pardon for Marc Rich and his business partner, Pincus Green, did not go through normal channels at the Justice Department but was sent directly to the White House. However, presidents are free to grant executive clemency outside the Justice Department channel and many presidents have done so. 

The investigation was eventually handed off to Comey, who was White's successor as U.S. attorney. Comey elected not to seek any charges in the case. 
So purely a coincidence? Or an internal message sent from FBI staffers, and if so addressed to whom: Clinton or Comey?  ",0

9535,Trump a Working-Class Hero? A Blue-Collar Town Debates His Credentials - The New York Times,"YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio  —   “Is this idiot for Trump?” Mark Wasko asked, his voice booming across the parking lot of an    supermarket. It was a late weekday morning in a troubled, shrinking Rust Belt city that is fed up with being known as a troubled, shrinking Rust Belt city. The man Mr. Wasko was calling an idiot  —   perhaps seriously, or playfully, or both  —   was his friend Vincent Archangelo Strines. Mr. Wasko, 48, had seen Mr. Strines, 55, a beefy blond man with a pack of cigarillos in his breast pocket, sitting behind a folding table and selling raffle tickets to support his nonprofit addiction recovery organization. So Mr. Wasko had parked his big soda truck in the lot and hopped out. He was appalled to learn that his friend, normally a Democratic voter, was now supporting Donald J. Trump. He looked Mr. Strines in the eye. “You’re an idiot,” he declared. So began a particularly spirited variant of the big argument currently consuming Youngstown: Does Mr. Trump, a Manhattan billionaire, really deserve to be the voice of the beleaguered American working class? It is a question of almost existential importance in a city where the steel industry’s demise was so dramatic that Bruce Springsteen wrote a bitter ballad about it. To many, Mr. Trump’s blunt language and swaggering persona feel familiar and welcome, and ring true. Youngstown is the kind of   Midwestern stronghold where Mr. Trump’s struggling campaign must make a strong showing, particularly among white voters, if he is to have any chance of winning the presidential election. Broaching the topic of Mr. Trump on a street corner or bar stool here  —   and thus delving into matters of race, economics, immigration and the   matter of the city’s disintegration  —   can be a volatile business. “If you want to punch me in the face, do it,” Mr. Strines dared Mr. Wasko casually, after about 15 minutes of debate that played out under a billboard for a nearby adult novelty store called Sassy Sensations and touched on all of those issues. Cars whooshed up and down Mahoning Avenue, past businesses shuttered or struggling, and past tired residential side streets now considered “food deserts” since the grocery store, a Sparkle Market, closed down about four years ago. Youngstown, a city of about 65, 000 people, is about 60 percent smaller than it was in 1960. Decades ago, blacks, Irish, Italians and Eastern Europeans came to work among the great blast furnaces of the old mills. When those businesses closed between 1977 and 1982, tens of thousands lost their jobs. Youngstown, as Mr. Springsteen noted in his 1995 song of the same name, once produced the iron and steel to fight America’s wars. It has also produced the boxing great Ray “Boom Boom” Mancini, a passion for high school football that rivals West Texas’ a tradition of political corruption  —   mostly the work of Democrats  —   and a long history, recently somewhat diminished, of mafia control. It is the rare small city whose past is dotted with car bombings, mob hits and characters with names like Moosey, Fats, Big Ernie and Brier Hill Jimmy. Today there are still some metal industry and manufacturing jobs. There is a big General Motors plant north of town that produces the small Chevrolet Cruze sedan. There is a   prison that opened in 1998. There is a business incubator, focused on reimagining Youngstown as a hub for software and   printing. In addition, there are signs of recovery from the Great Recession: The unemployment rate, which peaked at nearly 17 percent in January 2010, stood at 7. 6 percent in June. There is also a widespread belief that Mr. Trump is right when he says that the United States must renegotiate the terms of its trade with the world. Mr. Strines said that he worked for years as a quality assurance superintendent in the aluminum business, making good money until health issues related to his drinking problem forced him to retire. In that time, he said, he saw many businesses go under because China could produce aluminum for a fraction of what it cost American companies. He is hoping Mr. Trump will institute more protective tariffs. “I think he could bring the economy back,” he said. “He’s a   kind of guy. ” Mr. Wasko huffed. He doubted that Mr. Trump would follow through on any of his promises. What about the border wall? Mr. Trump was never going to get Mexico to pay for that, he said. And anyhow, wasn’t America great already? Mr. Strines said: “You think America is great? Come look for a job in Youngstown. ’’ On a Monday earlier this month, Mr. Trump visited Youngstown State University, where he delivered a foreign policy address in which he promised a more forceful response to what he called “radical Islamic terrorism. ” Among those in the   crowd was Donald J. Skowron, a retired police officer active in the local Republican Party. On his phone, Mr. Skowron showed off photos in which he stood beside the road with big signs, meant for Democrats, that read, “CROSS OVER” and “VOTE TRUMP. ” He said 19 of 20 drivers responded with a  . “The last one,” he said, extending his middle finger  —   “I get those. ” Wendy Aron, 58, emerged from the speech energized. She was once a supporter of President Obama but was dismayed by the weakness of the   recovery. Her housecleaning business in the Youngstown suburb of Boardman has shrunk, going from a dozen employees to a   operation: her and her daughter. Working people, she said, don’t have the money to pay for maid service anymore. Many of her close friends remain Democrats. “They just put me down,” she said. “I don’t want to even talk to them. ” Gayle Hite, an employee at a hospital, and her husband, Joseph, were not invited to the speech, but got as close to it as they could, waiting outside a campus building with her wearing a “Make America Great Again”  . She is a longtime Republican, but her husband, who usually votes Democrat, was planning to vote for Mr. Trump this year. They had watched Mr. Trump slog through a tough couple of weeks, taking criticism for, among other things, his feud with the family of a slain Muslim American soldier. But what some saw as gaffes were, to Mr. Hite, proof that Mr. Trump was a true change agent. “He’s not bought or sold by anybody,” said Mr. Hite, a retired corrections officer. “He can say what he wants. ” These days Mr. Hite, 64, receives a Social Security check, but he said he worried about the ways in which a volatile world might bankrupt the government. What would it cost to absorb Syrian refugees? And the immigrants coming across the Mexican border? The couple had watched “Conspiracy Theory,” the cable television show hosted by the onetime professional wrestler and governor of Minnesota,  Jesse Ventura. They were worried about the Bilderberg conference, the yearly, secretive meeting of bankers and policy makers. “It shows we’re not really running our country,” Ms. Hite said. “Sometimes I don’t believe our vote counts. ” In Mr. Springsteen’s song “Youngstown,” the narrator, a   mill worker, wishes for a future not in heaven but in “the fiery furnaces of hell. ” The character was inspired, in part, by a real steelworker, Joe Marshall Jr. whom Mr. Springsteen had read about in a book. Today Mr. Marshall, a small, sturdy man, who turns 63 on Saturday, can be found in Columbus, living in a $500 apartment and drawing a full state pension. After the steel industry fell apart, he pursued a life in law enforcement. He is an ardent Trump supporter. “He says what the average person is afraid to say because it’s politically incorrect,” Mr. Marshall said about Mr. Trump. Mr. Marshall worked at the Mahoning County Sheriff’s Office for 23 years, at the jail and on patrol  —   a   seat, he said, to the city’s dramatic decline. He watched as the professional classes emptied out, and as the city’s complexion changed: Youngstown, 74 percent white in 1970, is now about evenly divided between blacks and whites. Drugs came in, he said. The murder rate soared. Young people were dropping out of school at 15 years of age, Mr. Marshall said, because they didn’t see what kinds of work a degree would get them. “Where are they going to go, Taco Bell?” he asked. “That’s   jobs. ” Seven years ago, he moved away, taking a job as a corrections officer. Today, his political views are eclectic. The Democrats, he said, “failed Youngstown”: During the steel days, they were the party of overbearing regulations, the ones who told management that they couldn’t open a second blast furnace. “That’s jobs they took away,” he said. But Mr. Marshall also had harsh words for Gov. John R. Kasich, a Republican. During Mr. Kasich’s tenure, he said, “it’s just been cuts and cuts and cuts and cuts” to the benefits of state employees like him. “He tried to take away our collective bargaining rights,” he said. On Facebook, Mr. Marshall’s posts extol the beauty of   families, and the contributions of   to the country’s culture. But he is wary of the big mosque in his neighborhood and suspects Muslims there of planning an attack. The Democrats, he said, seem indifferent to whites. “Believe me, as Jesus Christ is my lord and savior, I’m not prejudiced or anything,” he said. “But it seems if you’re a minority, they help you out a lot more than if you’re white. ” In Mr. Trump, Mr. Marshall sees echoes of the man who hired him to be a deputy, James A. Traficant Jr. the sheriff at the time. Mr. Traficant would later become a Democratic congressman and Northeast Ohio’s most emblematic politician, until his expulsion from Congress in 2002 after a bribery conviction. (Mr. Traficant died in 2014 after a tractor fell on him.) “He was a good guy,” Mr. Marshall said of Mr. Traficant, who had hired him personally. “I remember he told me, ‘You screw up, Marshall, I’ll kill you. ’” Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Traficant, who went by the nickname Jimbo, annoyed and defied members of both parties, dished out scathing personal insults, blasted Washington insiders and purported to speak for the average Joe. He proposed sending troops to secure the Mexican border and criticized free trade. He even sported a flamboyant and   hairdo, though it proved to be a toupee. Back in Youngstown, the fondness for Mr. Traficant lingers despite allegations that he was tied to the mob. “Well, the whole city was like that,” said Kathy Miller, the Trump campaign coordinator for Mahoning County. She said it was difficult to agree with everything Mr. Traficant did, just as it is with Mr. Trump. But she said that Mr. Traficant’s constituent services were unparalleled. “Jimbo got it taken care of,” she said. Out in the parking lot, Mr. Strines seconded the praise. “He just told it the way it was, and I think Trump is the same type of guy as Traficant,” he said. Mr. Strines even asserted that Youngstown had been a better, safer place when the mob was in control. So it would be, he said, in Mr. Trump’s America. Once upon a time, he said, everybody in Youngstown knew that if someone messed up and failed to follow certain rules, “that’s where the mob would step in. ” “That’s where Trump would step in,” he said. “Once somebody’s got fear, like Iraq will have, like China will have,” he said, the world will grow calmer. “All of those illegal aliens better pack up their toothbrushes and start running. ” Mr. Wasko wasn’t buying it: “So let’s instill fear in everyone in America,” he said sarcastically. “No,” Mr. Strines said, “only the bad ones, man. ”",0

9537,Texas Mayor Announces That She Is Transgender - The New York Times,"Just days before a public town meeting on Tuesday night, Jess Herbst, the mayor of New Hope, Tex. had an official announcement. “I am transgender. ” The statement said that she had transitioned and would no longer use the name Jeff. The message was  a few hundred words long and appeared on the home screen of the official website of New Hope, a town of more than 630 residents about 40 miles north of Dallas. But she appeared to break barriers for the state. “As far as I know, I am the first openly transgender mayor on record in the state of Texas there could be others who never came out,” Ms. Herbst said in an interview on Wednesday. “But I am the first to say, ‘Yes I am transgender and a seated mayor.’ ” Ms. Herbst informed residents in a statement on the town’s website about the change, and the joys of her life as a woman, including her preference in pronouns and the endurance of her marriage. “As your mayor I must tell you about something that has been with me since my earliest memories,” Ms. Herbst wrote. “I am Transgender. Two years ago, with the support of my wife, daughters and    I began hormone replacement therapy (HRT). “At the time, I did not imagine I would hold the mayor’s position, but here I am. ” Ms. Herbst has been active in local government since 2003 as an elected alderman, road commissioner and mayor pro tempore. In 2016, she was appointed New Hope’s mayor after the previous official in that post died. As of Wednesday morning, the New Hope town website was still referring to her as Mayor Jeff Herbst. But Ms. Herbst implied in her statement that she was patient: “I’m not especially sensitive to the pronoun I’m called, and I expect people to take time to make the change. I use the name Jess, a simple change from Jeff. ” “I live my life as a female now, and I will be performing my duties to the town as such,” she wrote. On the town website, she also invited the public to make comments in the town’s public meeting on Jan 31. Ms. Herbst, 58, said in a telephone interview that after posting her statement on Jan. 23, she attended the council meeting for the first time dressed as a woman.’ ”“It was phenomenally positive everyone was supportive,” she said. “We had a fairly packed crowd for a tiny town  —   there were 15 or 20 people there. I explained to the people who had not just had a chance to see the website, and everybody said, ‘O. K.,’ and we went on and had a meeting. ”” ’But as an elected official who was later appointed as mayor, Ms. Herbst said that she was given a “very stern lecture” by the town attorney about laws that govern elections and canvassing, and that she was told not to change her name before the coming election cycle. Ms. Herbst also said she has received thousands of messages of support, and three negative ones. Replies to announcements on her Facebook page and the town’s website appear to be supportive, with residents praising her for coming forward in a state where, in most parts, it is legal to discriminate against people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. In January, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, one of the most powerful Republican officials in the state, put Texas on the front lines of the nation’s culture wars when he announced the filing of a bill that would require people in government buildings and public schools to use the bathroom that corresponds with their “biological sex. ” Critics said the bill discriminated against transgender people. Terri Burke, the executive director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, said Mayor Herbst was showing “tremendous courage in discussing her identity with the public. “We applaud Mayor Herbst’s decision to serve her community openly in public office and take a stand against hateful rhetoric coming from some of our legislators,” Ms. Burke said in an email. “Some Texas lawmakers are attempting to exclude transgender Texans from public spaces with legislation like SB6, but we should be making it easier for them to share their skills and talents with us, not pushing them out of public restrooms and public life. ” Ms. Herbst suggested on the city’s website that the culture was changing in the United States and directed constituents to her personal website, where she has kept a diary over the years. It included a gallery of photos titled, “Who I am now,” juxtaposed with a section called who “I used to be,” with images of her life as Jeff. Ms. Herbst said that she had the support of her family. Her wife grew up in New Hope, and the couple have lived in the town with their two daughters since 1999. “It is gender identity, not sexual preference that applies to me,” the mayor wrote. “I love my wife, and she loves me. We have no intention of change. My daughters have been adamant supporters of me and are proud to tell people their father is transgender. ” In the interview Wednesday, Ms. Herbst said she began living full time as Jess toward the end of September, and gradually broke the news to friends, family and  . Finally, there was no one left to tell but the wider town population, and that was when she made the announcement. “I am being who I am and doing what I have to do,” she said. “I am not trying to make some sort of big statement. ”",0

9539,"YouTube Channels Must Now Reach 10,000 Views Before Earning Ad Revenue - Breitbart","YouTube channels will now be required to reach 10, 000 views before the creator’s videos will be able to include  and earn money, according to a new blog post from the company. [“For millions of creators, making videos on YouTube isn’t just a creative outlet, it’s a source of income  …     Today, more creators are making a living on YouTube than ever before,” declared YouTube in the official blog post. “However, with this growth we’ve started seeing cases of abuse where great, original content is   by others who try to earn revenue from it. ”  “Starting today, we will no longer serve ads on YPP [YouTube Partner Program] videos until the channel reaches 10k lifetime views,” they continued. “This new threshold gives us enough information to determine the validity of a channel. It also allows us to confirm if a channel is following our community guidelines and advertiser policies. By keeping the threshold to 10k views, we also ensure that there will be minimal impact on our aspiring creators. And, of course, any revenue earned on channels with under 10k views up until today will not be impacted. ” “In a few weeks, we’ll also be adding a review process for new creators who apply to be in the YouTube Partner Program. After a creator hits 10k lifetime views on their channel, we’ll review their activity against our policies,” the company concluded. “If everything looks good, we’ll bring this channel into YPP and begin serving ads against their content. Together these new thresholds will help ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules. ” The move appears to be a part of YouTube’s response to   withdrawal from the site and an attempt to bring companies back to the platform.",0
9540,"Macy’s Will Cut 10,000 Jobs After Poor Holiday Sales - The New York Times","Struggling with sagging sales over another crucial holiday shopping season, Macy’s announced on Wednesday that it was eliminating more than 10, 000 jobs as part of a continuing plan to cut costs and close 100 stores. Macy’s, the country’s largest department store chain, said sales at its stores had fallen 2. 1 percent in November and December compared with the same period in 2015. Terry J. Lundgren, the company’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement that while the trend was “consistent with the lower end of our guidance, we had anticipated sales would be stronger. ” He attributed the decline to “broader challenges” facing much of the retail industry. Consumers, who endured a long recession, have turned to   chains like T. J. Maxx and shifted their spending away from    stores for the convenience of online shopping with the retail giant Amazon. The announcement on Wednesday continued a trend for Macy’s, which announced last January that it was eliminating about 4, 500 jobs in a major restructuring. Then, too, it said slumping holiday season sales had hurt its bottom line. The company, which now has 730 stores, announced in August that it would close 100 of them. On Wednesday, it identified 68 stores to be closed. The    store in the Douglaston neighborhood of Queens, which opened in 1981, will close. Stores at the Marketplace Mall in Rochester at the Oakdale Mall in Johnson City, N. Y. near Binghamton and at the Preakness Shopping Center in Wayne, N. J. will close, the company said. Of the 68, three were closed by the middle of 2016, 63 will close in the spring and two will be closed by the middle of 2017. Three other locations were sold or are to be sold. The company said it planned to close about 30 other stores over the next few years. Some employees may be offered positions at nearby stores, but Macy’s estimated that 3, 900 workers would be affected by the closings. It also said it planned to restructure parts of its business, leading to a reduction of an additional 6, 200 jobs. Over all, the job cuts represent about 7 percent of its work force. The company estimated that the changes would save about $550 million a year, starting in 2017. Mr. Lundgren said the company was closing stores that were “unproductive or are no longer robust shopping destinations because of changes in the local retail shopping landscape. ” Other sites were being targeted for closing to take advantage of their highly valued real estate. The company, which owns the Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s brands, has been struggling with declining traffic in its stores, where the bulk of its business is still conducted. It plans to invest some of its savings in expanding its digital business. Macy’s said it now expected to earn $2. 95 to $3. 10 per share on an adjusted basis for its 2016 fiscal year, compared with its prior forecast of $3. 15 to $3. 40 per share. Shares in Macy’s fell nearly 10 percent to $32. 30 in   trading on Wednesday.",0
9541,Chinese spies steal from USA $100 billion a year,"Chinese spies steal from USA $100 billion a year 31.10.2016 Print version Font Size The Chinese intelligence has challenged the US national security system. China recruits senior military officials and conducts cyber attacks against the United States. What is worse, the Chinese intelligence has stolen Pentagon's plans for the future conflict with China, a recent report to US Congress said. The annual report from the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission has sounded the alarm with regard to the activities of Chinese security forces. The report said that despite extensive ties between Beijing and Washington, the US-China relations have remained tense during the current year, the Washington Free Beacon said. The relations between China and the United States have worsened primarily because of China's territorial claims in the South China Sea, permission from the United States to sell weapons to Taiwan, the deployment of the missile defense system in South Korea, Chinese cyber attacks and the US-led policy to ""restore balance"" in Asia.As for most serious threats, the report highlights cybercrime and the ""involvement of the human factor"" to gain access to objects of national security. The activities of the Chinese intelligence have increased significantly over the past 15 years. The work is carried out through the Ministry of State Security, the People's Liberation Army of China and military departments of the Communist Party, the report said. As for the ""human factor"", the report refers to the story of the recruitment of US Pacific Command Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Pierce Bishop. The man was in an intimate relationship with a Chinese woman, who eventually recruited him. Thus, the information about US military secrets in the field of nuclear weapons, secrets of the Reaper MQ-9 UAV and the secret US report about the Strategy of the Ministry of Defense of China was compromised. The report also mentions a few other recruited gentlemen: another senior official of the Pacific Command - James Fondren, who delivered ""The National Defense Strategy of the USA"" to China in 2010. Another man, Greg Bergerssen, delivered state secrets to China before he was arrested in 2008. US naval officer Edward Lin was caught for selling secrets of the US Navy to China. All this information may undermine the military superiority of the United States by promoting China's military modernization and providing China with understanding of the tactics of military operations and other operational approaches of the United States to potential developments in the region, the report said. Noteworthy, China spies even on members of government delegations. For example, British officials, before going to the G20 summit in Hangzhou, were instructed to avoid contacts with ""Chinese spies who offer sex"", The Irish Times said. The officials were instructed not to take any gifts, especially electronic devices containing memory cards, SIM-cards or chargers as they could serve as a basis for video and audio surveillance. All the members of the British delegation were given temporary mobile phones and e-mail addresses. The officials were even recommended to change their clothes under blankets to avoid any chance of taking their nude pictures. ""Chinese intelligence has repeatedly infiltrated U.S. national security entities and extracted information with serious consequences for U.S. national security, including information on the plans and operations of U.S. military forces and the designs of U.S. weapons and weapons systems,"" the report said. ""Among the information extracted were 5.6 million fingerprints, some of which could be used to identify undercover U.S. government agents or to create duplicates of biometric data to obtain access to classified areas,"" it continued. China uses a variety of ""actors"" for its cyber espionage - from ""government contractor"" to independent ""patriotic hackers"" and ""criminal entities."" These groups often interact with each other. The US Department of Justice paid attention to the arrest of US citizen Allen Ho, who was accused of stealing nuclear technology for China General Group. Ho enlisted as many as six American engineers for the purpose. In addition, the DoJ and the FBI accused Chinese nationals of the theft of know-how technology for the production of carbon fiber for submarines and compounds for bleaching materials.The FBI evaluated losses from industrial espionage at 19 billion dollars a year. In one outstanding incidence, former Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez had his laptop hacked into and copied in Beijing, even though Gutierrez was one of the key figures in international trade negotiations. The information from his laptop was subsequently used to break into US government computers.James Andrew Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington said that the stolen intellectual property of the USA brings China the profit of up to 100 billion a year. Interestingly, only a few Chinese spies have been arrested so far, John R. Schindler wrote for The Observer. The potential of the Chinese intelligence is high: 300,000 Chinese students studying in American universities.

9542,California Today: Is the Drought Over? - The New York Times,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) Let’s turn it over to Adam Nagourney, our Los Angeles bureau chief, for today’s introduction. LOS ANGELES  —   And on Thursday, it rained. Again. The arrival of another winter rain here, a wet end to a week that began with heavy snows in the Sierra Nevada, has begged a welcome question: Is the drought that punished California for six years over? No question California has turned a corner. There was more rain in Los Angeles in December than since the drought began for better and worse. The rain this week shut down Laurel Canyon Boulevard after the waterlogged porch of a house collapsed into the roadway, and flash flood warnings were issued in Los Angeles as storms swept back and forth across the area on Thursday evening. In Northern California, the storms produced extensive flooding in Sonoma County and around Sacramento  —   among the   parts of the state. Ski resorts reported that 12 feet of snow fell in Tahoe. Mudslides closed Interstate 80 as the storm passed through Sierra Nevada. At least five people have died, officials said. Reservoirs that were parched last year are close to capacity. The snowpack  —   which keeps the water flowing into the early summer as the snow melts  —   is 161 percent of normal. The United States Drought Monitor for this week reported that 42 percent of the state was out of drought conditions, compared with 3 percent last year. “In terms of surface water, most of California is no longer in drought,” wrote Jay Lund, the director of the Center for Watershed Sciences at the University of California in Davis. Still, winter is not even half over. Many years have started off wet and gone completely dry. Climate change has produced higher temperatures, which could melt away the snowpack before summer. And parts of the state remain dry. But after six years of mandatory conservation orders, there seems reason for celebration. “This series of storms has done more than make a dent in the drought, which is a huge relief,” said Felicia Marcus, the head of the State Water Resources Control Board. “But it’s a little early to have a drought’s over party. ” (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.) • Congratulations, Los Angeles, on getting the Chargers.

[KPCC] “Hello, I’m Johnny Cash. ” That opening line, as if the assembled audience needed any introduction, gave way to a giddy roar and then, one of country music’s great performances. It was on this day in 1968 that Johnny Cash played his “At Folsom Prison” concert. The event was meant to revive Mr. Cash’s career, which had flagged since the 1950s thanks to an    amphetamine habit. Executives at Mr. Cash’s record label, Columbia Records, saw him as so unreliable that they kept the planning of the Folsom show a secret from the press, said Robert Hilburn, author of “Johnny Cash: The Life. ” They weren’t certain he would show. Thankfully, he did. “And he was incredible. It was like he sensed this was a moment,” said Mr. Hilburn, who himself attended the concert after hearing about it from a disc jockey. Mr. Cash tailored his song choices along themes of longing, sin and misfortune, including, of course, his 1955 hit “Folsom Prison Blues. ” Assembled in the heavily guarded Dining Room 2, the inmates couldn’t get enough. “You could just sense their spirit rising,” said Mr. Hilburn. “It was just electrifying. ” The band actually performed twice, in the morning and afternoon, to ensure a good recording. “At Folsom Prison” drew largely from the first show and was released four months later. It was a huge success and kicked off a resurgence in Mr. Cash’s popularity. A year later, he did another prison record, “At San Quentin,” which was also successful. In the wake of the performances, he became a prominent voice for prisoner rights. California Today goes live at 6 a. m. Pacific time weekdays. Tell us what you want to see: CAtoday@nytimes. com.

Here’s the latest. 1. It’s official. Simone Biles, the gymnast some call the best in history, was crowned the   gymnastics champion at the Rio Olympics. Her teammate Aly Raisman came in second. Here’s a   of two of Biles’s signature moves. With a win in the   individual medley, Michael Phelps earned his thirteenth individual gold medal, surpassing Leonidas of Rhodes, who won 12 gold medals in the ancient Olympics. Another achievement for the books: Simone Manuel became the first   woman to win an individual event in Olympic swimming. Our full coverage of the Games is here  —   including the odd version of the U. S. national anthem being played at medal ceremonies. _____ 2. Hillary Clinton rejected the economic agenda Donald Trump laid out this week, calling him an enemy of “the little guy. ” He wants to “give trillions in tax cuts to people like himself,” she said, while deepening the financial pain of the middle and working classes. Neither candidate, however, has said much about helping people who are not working  —   many of them living in abject poverty. _____ 3. Mr. Trump faced down critics of his unorthodox campaign style, telling an interviewer, “It’s either going to work or I’m going to, you know, I’m going to have a very, very nice long vacation. ” After weeks of hearing detractors saying a Trump presidency would be a grave threat to national security, Mr. Trump has begun portraying Mrs. Clinton and President Obama as   of the Islamic State. He held a rally in Kissimmee, Fla. in the evening. _____ 4. The F. B. I. has widened its investigation into what officials believe was a Russian cyberattack directed against the Democratic Party. The attack appears to have been far larger than first thought, raising the possibility of more damaging disclosures like the emails published recently by WikiLeaks. After a   impasse that has kept the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, Sweden has agreed to question him there over rape accusations. _____ 5. Almost 55 miles a gallon  —   that’s what U. S. regulators say automakers’ fleets must average by 2025. Engineers, racing to meet the mark, are working with new batteries for hybrids.

The animated “Sausage Party,” opening nationwide this weekend, sends   foodstuffs ranging through the supermarket for 89 minutes of bawdy, silly humor  —   and a deeper layer. Characters voiced by Seth Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Edward Norton, Michael Cera, Bill Hader and others end up in a classic confrontation between comforting religious beliefs (weekend shoppers are gods who will liberate them) and scientific thought (their actual fate). Our reviewer saluted “the intellectual rigor of a project that probably didn’t require it” and called the movie “fun pretty much all the way through. ” _____ 7. Fox News has not managed to put a   scandal behind it, despite rapidly forcing out its chairman, Roger Ailes. More women have come forward to describe a culture of intimidation and misogyny, including a former Fox host, Andrea Tantaros, above. Top Ailes deputies who remain are being accused of abetting Mr. Ailes’s behavior. _____ 8. “I found the numbers heartbreaking. ” That was a senior U. S. health official, commenting on a new study that found high rates of rape, bullying, depression and other harms suffered by gay, lesbian and bisexual teenagers. The survey found that they make up about 8 percent of the high school population, or 1. 3 million students. Future studies are likely to include an option for students to identify as transgender. Above, a youth contingent at Miami’s gay pride march in April. _____ 9. U. S.  forces seized most of the coastal Libyan city of Surt, a stronghold of the Islamic State. But in Syria, the battle between government forces and rebels has left two million people in the city of Aleppo  with critical shortages of food and water.

9544,How the Sitcom ‘Speechless’ Understands Families Like Mine - The New York Times,"If you live in a household like mine  —   one with a nonverbal child  —   you’re anticipating one television show above all others this fall: “Speechless,” which begins Sept. 21 on ABC. A   series on a major network about “us”? It’s occasion for excitement, and for reflection. What, exactly, do we who live in the “Speechless” universe hope this series will accomplish? “Speechless” is a classic domestic comedy  —   yes, a comedy  —   centered on a    named JJ DiMeo who has cerebral palsy, can’t speak and uses an   device to express himself. He’s the eldest of three children, and he’s played by Micah Fowler, who himself has cerebral palsy, a casting decision that alone makes this series stand out. Minnie Driver portrays his mother, Maya, who like a lot of parents of children with disabilities sometimes turns into a      warrior for her son. JJ has two siblings (Mason Cook and Kyla Kenedy) whose own needs tend to get overlooked, a common thing in such households. John Ross Bowie plays the father, Jimmy, who struggles to keep Maya from sailing off the edge. When ABC picked up this show last spring, word spread quickly through the chat rooms and Facebook pages where nonverbal people and their parents hang out. The YouTube trailer has had about 1. 5 million views. I watched the pilot episode over the summer at Camp Communicate in Maine, which is for children who use   devices. Staff members and campers watching with me agreed: Whoever’s behind this show “gets it. ” There’s a reason for that: The show’s creator, Scott Silveri, grew up in a home much like the one in “Speechless,” with a nonverbal brother with cerebral palsy and other health issues. “It’s a story that I’ve been wanting to tell as long as I’ve been writing,” said Mr. Silveri, who has written and been a producer for “Friends” and other shows. “Not so much focused on doing a story about disability I was really interested in doing a family show and exploring how one family member with a disability affects everybody else and turns them into the specific kind of weirdos that they become. ” It is largely unexplored territory. For decades, enduring TV characters with a disability were rare. Name one from the medium’s first 50 years. “Ironside,” says practically everyone. Name five more? Not so easy. When such characters did turn up, they were frequently used as objects of pity or as catalysts that allowed   characters to learn an obvious lesson or feel better about themselves. Making matters worse was that often,   actors would tackle these roles with embarrassing gusto. People who saw Rosie O’Donnell playing a mentally challenged woman in the 2005 TV movie “Riding the Bus With My Sister” still haven’t stopped cringing. Things have improved in recent years. Characters with disabilities are still underrepresented on TV (the Census Bureau says one in five Americans have a disability, with half of those describing the condition as severe) but credible ones have been built into “The Wire,” “Switched at Birth,” “Legit,” “Breaking Bad” and more. Yet here is a blunt truth: Some disabilities are more telegenic than others. Who doesn’t love a high school kid singing in perfect harmony and   to “Proud Mary”? Sure, Artie of “Glee” was a delight. Now take away his singing ability and his wheelchair dexterity and make him able to communicate only by laboriously aiming a   laser pointer at a communication board. That’s JJ. That is a difficult character to make appealing, and putting him in network prime time in a central role is as bold, in its way, as television’s first single mother or black lead or transgender story line was. A   ago, ABC took a similar risk with “Life Goes On,” about a family with a Down syndrome child, a role played by Chris Burke, who has Down syndrome. That show, though, was a drama, which is what “outsiders” might expect: Disability equals struggle equals nothing but pain and misery. We “insiders” hate that. Yes, having a serious disability or caring for someone who does is hard, but hardship doesn’t define that life. Just the other day, I laughed a couple of times, and so did my daughter, who has Rett syndrome. Mr. Silveri said the No. 1 reaction he has had from “inside” families when they hear about the show has been, “Please tell me it’s a comedy. ” The casting of an actor with a disability has caused its own buzz, but Mr. Fowler won’t merely be playing himself. He has a milder form of cerebral palsy than his character (he can speak, for instance) and had to study up on how JJ would move and use his device. Could an actor without a disability have done the same as credibly? For Mr. Fowler, there’s no question. “Living every day with the challenges of a disability allows me to bring a rawness to the character and bring him to life with my unique perspectives,” he said in an email interview. If actors with special needs will be pulling for the show, so will a lot of parents of children with disabilities. Ms. Driver is keenly aware of carrying those hopes. “It gives me goose bumps thinking that,” she said. “To actually represent a body of people whose story hasn’t been told  —   that’s very gratifying. ” Though I’ve been writing as “us,” one thing you learn quickly when you have a child with a disability is that there is no “disability community” the opinions, aspirations and beliefs within that world are as wildly divergent as in the population at large. So I won’t presume to say what “we” want “Speechless” to accomplish only what I’d like. I hope it gives another, especially hard, kick to the door that has made characters and actors with disabilities so scarce on TV. And I hope it helps break down the sense of isolation that envelops families like the DiMeos. Many people still either stare or look away when they see someone like JJ. I don’t expect that those reactions will ever disappear. Maybe “Speechless” will make them a little less common.",0
9545,"Distracted by Election 2016, No-one Resisted the Deep State’s Patriot Act 2","Waking Times – by Nathaniel Mauka 
Congress overwhelmingly voted for the Patriot Act nearly 16 years ago, and our civil liberties have never been the same since. As if this singular bill, passed by George W. Bush, wasn’t invasive enough, allowing big banks to demand our internet data, and more — the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act ( CISA ) makes cyber-spying by the shadow government and the financial entities controlling it, a forgone conclusion. 
As with most shadow government legislation, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act is packed with hidden surveillance allowances. CISA was quietly passed to allow government to demand that private companies hand over personal information to them at will. It also allows companies to mine data, under the auspices of government-created urgency. 
The mere fact that this act passed in late 2015 is monumental, since it has been before Congress in different forms for over a decade . The election seems to have offered the perfect cover, as Americans and activists were too busy arguing over Trump vs. Hillary. 
Scott Talbott, senior vice president of government relations at the Electronic Transactions Association believes the value of sharing our personal data as a means to be alerted of ‘cyber threats’ outweighs any hazard to our civil liberties. Talbott states , 
“The value is that everyone can be alerted to cyber threats and take precautionary countermeasures before they materialize and spread,” he said. “Before CISA, corrective measures could be taken only after the cyber threat had done its damage. CISA allows each company to serve as an early warning system to the entire economy.” 
Who exactly would be determining if someone is a ‘threat’ is the meat of the sandwich, though. CISA is ripe for abuse, just as the Patriot Act has been. 
The Patriot Act has made it legal for law enforcement to spy on people, without probable cause – to enter their homes, or even to strip search them before they’ve been to court, had the opportunity to argue a case, or given ‘authorities’ a motive for this type of interrogation. 
The stated purpose of the Patriot Act was to deter terrorist acts in the United States, but what do you do when the terrorists have already taken over your country? CISA simply expands the reach of a shadow government which has already been proven to reach beyond the boundaries of constitutional law. 
More importantly, who specifically is CISA targeting? After multiple hack­ers have in­filt­rated com­puter sys­tems at the White House , the State De­part­ment , the Pentagon , and the Of­fice of Per­son­nel Man­age­ment, along with the Democratic National Committee , and numerous multinational banks run by the cabal, is the shadow government simply trying to create a stop-gap before their most elusive, yet damning information is made public? 
CISA certainly will expand the reach of government surveillance on citizens as it has been conducted by the the National Security Agency (NSA) before former NSA contractor Edward Snowden exposed it. 
“I think this bill was meant to be a surveillance bill from the start,” said Justin Harvey, CSO of Fidelis Cybersecurity, adding that he is dubious that the stated intent of the bill – to use collective intelligence to warn of potential cyber attacks and possibly stop them before they occur – will result. 
Under the guise of ‘sharing cyber threats’ CISA allows companies to wholesale-collect information that may not even be a threat – and then pass it along for government bodies to determine if it is, indeed a threat. If this sounds like circular logic – it is just the beginning of the odd verbiage within the bill. It’s justifications for entering every possible orifice for data-gathering are more confounded than an octopus in a straight jacket. 
The government can already enter your personal property including your home, your body , your cell, and your computer , but now they will have a legal in-roads to declare you a cyber-threat, simply for sending an email . This begs the question – who is the real cyber-bully? CISA seems to be nothing more than a prevarication, covering the acts of an elite few who don’t want their secrets exposed. About the Author

9546,"In Muhammad Ali, an Example of a Truer Kind of Bravery in Sports - The New York Times","I was not yet a teenager when I wandered into the living room of our   apartment on the Upper West Side. I saw my parents sitting silently by our    television, listening as a young black boxer, Muhammad Ali, talked. He was saying he would not serve in the Army and he would not fight those Vietcong. “My conscience won’t let me go and shoot them,” Ali said in that        style of his. “They never called me nigger, they never lynched me, they didn’t put no dogs on me. ” “How can I shoot those poor people?” he added. “Just take me to jail. ” Just take me to jail. Those words registered as astonishing. Here was this great, sexy fighter on the cusp of fame and fortune, a physically pretty man who recited doggerel and who graced the covers of magazines. And he was willing to march off to prison to protest an unjust war. We celebrate athletic courage. Watch a hoopster hit a spinning,   jumper in the last seconds, see a center fielder race toward a fence heedless of the possible injury, applaud a fullback who catapults into the end zone, and we talk of courage. Such feats are athletic and wonderful and memorable. Courage is being 24 years old and risking all, the anger of newspaper and television reporters and millions of white Americans who see you as a public enemy, to say no to a war. Channing Frye, a tall and lithe Cleveland Cavalier, stepped onto the practice court in Oakland for an interview on the intricacies of the N. B. A. finals. He’s thoughtful on his chosen vocation first, though, he spoke of the septuagenarian Ali. “He just gave the black community a lot of courage and changed our  : ‘Hey, you can be a superstar and not be quiet,’ ” Frye said. “You can voice your opinion and be controversial and still be a champion. ” Frye didn’t go there, but Ali ruined some part of the great athlete Michael Jordan for me. Years ago, at the height of his popularity and given a chance to support Harvey Gantt, the black progressive mayor of Charlotte, N. C. against that old racemonger Senator Jesse Helms, Jordan declined. Republicans, he reportedly said, buy sneakers too. Others spoke and acted in the Ali tradition. Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised their fists in the   sign at the Olympics in 1968 after medaling in the   race. Kareem   has spoken out often and thoughtfully on society’s ills. LeBron James has addressed violence and police brutality, and is a union activist. The   skier Beckie Scott has spoken out repeatedly on athletic doping and on the fecklessness of international organizations. The point is not whether you agree with their every utterance, any more than that was so with regard to Ali. To see athletes  —   young men and women who could rightly enough claim obsession with sport and endorsements  —   embrace the larger world and its discontents is moving. Ali was a man, which is to say complicated and   and imperfect. He could be cruel to opponents, in the ring and outside it. Joe Frazier, he said, was too dumb and too ugly to be champion. It is probably smart not to get too worked up about this. Cruelty is woven into boxing like tweed into a fine herringbone jacket. Ali reincarnated himself as champion, three times winning that title, and that gave to his life narrative a metaphorical power. I know the young Ali, lean and dangerous and endlessly boastful, only through my father’s stories, and from old newsreels. The Ali I remember was   and a ferocious competitor, too willing to stand and absorb punishment. By the time he tangled with George Foreman in 1974 in Zaire, the fight known as the Rumble in the Jungle, his speed and reflexes were like bike tires worn down. The question was not whether Foreman would beat him senseless, but how quickly the end would come. Ali, per usual, would have none of that. “If you think the world was surprised when Nixon resigned, wait till I whup Foreman’s behind,” he told David Frost. Here’s Norman Mailer’s classic account in the “The Fight. ” Ali would “slide off a punch and fall back into the ropes with all the calm of a man swinging in the rigging. All the while, he used his eyes. They looked like stars, and he feinted Foreman out with his eyes, flashing white eyeballs of panic he did not feel which pulled Foreman through into the trick of lurching after him on a wrong move. ” I drove back to Purchase College that night and listened to the staccato,    reports on WINS news radio. When the anchor broke in excitedly to say that Ali had toppled Foreman in the eighth round like an oak tree, I pounded my dashboard and screamed like a banshee loose on the Hutchinson River Parkway. Ali’s decline would play no small part in my own decision to turn away from boxing. I had read of Joe Louis, slowed and   and lost late in his life. But unlike my parents, I never knew him in his   prime. Ali was the athlete of my youth. By the end, Parkinson’s and his past braveries in the ring had rendered Ali near immobile and mute. Now he is dead. Here is another outtake from that primal force. He had listened as young white men berated him for resisting the draft. Then, eyes flashing, he came back at them. “You talking about me about some draft and all you white boys are breaking your neck to get to Switzerland and Canada and London,” he said, adding, “If I’m going to die, I’ll die now right here, fighting you. ” The words speak to a passion forever young, and brave.",0

9548,WIKILEAKS: Emails Show Clinton Collusion Between State Department And DOJ,"We Are Change 
Wikileaks has been leaking more emails then we can keep up with but two of the biggest bombshells recently released by the international whistle-blower organization are that the Department of Justice and State Department were in collusion with the Clinton campaign.
The emails show Clinton campaign manager John Podesta being warned by Department Of Justice Assistant Secretary General Peter Kadzik from a non-government email address about Hillary’s investigation.
Kadzik wrote to Podesta with the subject line “heads up,” tipping him off to the investigation into Hillary Clinton on Benghazi.
“There is a HJC oversight hearing today where the head of our Civil Division will testify. Likely to get questions on State Department emails. Another filing in the FOIA case went in last night or will go in this am that indicates it will be awhile (2016) before the State Department posts the emails,” Kadzik wrote.
Peter Kadzik is also in charge of investigating Huma Abedin’s emails. Kadzik was also an attorney for John Podesta and in Podesta’s own words he was a “ fantastic lawyer” who “kept me out of jail.” 
In another bombshell, Podesta made false statements to a grand jury during the investigation into the Monica Lewinsky trial, which Podesta himself summarizes in another leaked email. 
A further revelations about Kadzik is the fact that Peter Kadzik represented Marc Rich as his attorney – the same Marc Rich that Bill Clinton controversially pardoned and the FBI released it’s investigation files into on Monday.
If that’s not enough Kadzik’s son tried to get a job working for the Clinton campaign . Then there is the fact that Kadzik had multiple dinners with Podesta during the email investigation .
These are obvious conflicts of interest here and one that needs to be brought forward.
In another example of collusion between the Clinton campaign and the government’s investigation of it’s candidate Hillary Clinton, it’s been revealed that FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe’s wife received $675,000 in political donations from Clinton campaign surrogate Terry McAuliffe’s PAC and the Democratic Party of Virginia.

Terry McAuliffe was the person that enabled the FBI to open an investigation into the Clinton Foundation when Terry McAuliffe himself was investigated for corruption .
Other Wikileaks emails show collusion between officials in the U.S. State Department. Two recently leaked emails show that not only was Clinton’s campaign tipped off by a DOJ insider but the U.S. State Department colluded with the New York Times the day prior to announcing Hillary’s private server.
Lauren Hickey told Clinton aides that then-State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki “just cleared” a statement to a New York Times reporter. 
“Hi guys – Jen just cleared. She made the highlighted change — just rephrased a line about NARA updates state is undertaking. Yes on your point re records – done below. And yes will let you know — should be in the new few minutes.” – Lauren Hickey.
Additionally an email from Brian Fallon, Clinton’s press secretary who used to be the DOJ’s director of public affairs until joining Clinton’s campaign in April 2015, highlights that Fallon was being leaked information from the DOJ on Hillary Clinton’s investigation in the early stages of a status hearing. So what makes you think he didn’t get further information? To add to that, again a private non-government email was used to relay this information to Podesta and the rest of the campaign.

“DOJ folks inform me there is a status hearing in this case this morning, so we could have a window into the judge’s thinking about this proposed production schedule as quickly as today.”
– Brian Fallon.

What more will be revealed about the inner workings of Clinton’s campaign and the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private server? Stay tuned to We Are Change.

9549,Berlin Attraction Reveals an Uneasy Phenomenon: Hitler Sells - The New York Times,"What do you do about the buildings associated with Hitler’s life and death? In Austria, they are hitting the delete key, but in Germany, it’s more like copy and paste. After decades of indecision and delay, the Austrian government is moving to seize and either demolish or drastically remodel the house where Hitler was born, so that it never becomes a shrine for  . In Berlin, where the authorities have generally taken a somber approach to the terrible history, the story is different. Most landmarks of Nazi rule in the city were demolished long ago, but a commercial firm has now   one of them as a tourist attraction: the bunker where Hitler committed suicide in 1945. The new bunker was built about a mile from the original site by Historiale, which also runs the Berlin Story Museum next door. Wieland Giebel of Berlin Story says the intent is to show tourists more of the city’s past. The company attracted some publicity by inviting dozens of foreign correspondents to an opening tour in the fall, and then began admitting the general public for tours twice a day. Mr. Giebel said each tour has attracted at least 30 visitors at 12 euros ($12. 5) a person. Like the museum  —   a mishmash of memorabilia  —   the bunker tour seems to appeal to a public appetite that several experts have recognized. Hitler sells. “Of course it sells, that is clear,” said Stefanie Endlich, a professor at the University of the Arts in Berlin and an expert on Nazi art. “But all these revivals of National Socialist situations are a little unsettling. ” Historians at   institutions, like the widely praised Topography of Terror center nearby, are also disturbed by Mr. Giebel’s venture. “We don’t work with sets,” said   von Damaros, spokesman for the center. Besides that, he said, Mr. Giebel “demands an entry fee we do not. ” Mr. von Damaros estimated that about 1. 3 million people a year visit the Topography of Terror exhibition, a dense and grim accounting of how the Nazis rose, ruled and destroyed. “This shows the interest in working through the story continues to be high,” he said. “And it also is proof that the quality is right. ”",0
9550,Distrubing New Video Shows Donald Trump Sexually Assaulting Miss Universe ON STAGE,"Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr 
The list of women sexually assaulted by Donald J. Trump just keeps growing — and a new cringe-inducing video from a 2011 corporate speech adds yet another . In the video, Trump not only sexually assaults, but humiliates, the 2004 Miss Universe winner on stage, in front of thousands. “She’s not very bright” 
Both candidates have had cringe-inducing moments this election cycle, but by-the-by, Clinton’s have been significantly less than Trump’s have and Trump’s have come in rapid succession of horrible moments; a parade of everything wrong with the masculine idea in the United States. A new video posted by the Huffington Post on Saturday added yet another horrible moment to the raft of them — a raft that, in any decent society, would have already sunk. 
A few weeks ago, a tape of Donald Trump emerged into the popular conscious. The tape contained two things: Trump admitting that he sexually assaulted women and Trump using the word “pussy.” No points for guessing which one pissed off more of his evangelical supporters. Since then, a huge number of women have come forward and leveled accusations of sexual assault at Donald Trump. 
Make no mistake, Trump is having his Bill Cosby moment right now. 
Among the list of accusations against Trump include claims that Trump told a group of 10-year-olds that he’d date them in 10 years, a telling a group of 14-year-olds he’d date them in a few years, groping women, sexually assaulting women, and we can’t forget that he’s been accused of raping a 13-year-old at a party hosted by infamous American financier and level three sex offender Jeffery Epstein (who served three months of an 18 month prison sentence for soliciting sex from an underage prostitute, because we don’t have a two-tier justice system at all in the United States). 
Thus, this new footage that shows Trump forcing 2004 Miss Universe winner Jennifer Hawkins into a nonconsensual kiss and then humiliating her on stage isn’t an aberration. It’s a continuation of the skeevy behavior that a huge number of men are not only okay with, not only think is normal, but believe is something that’s worth preserving and perpetuating instead of stamping out like an intellectual scabies infection. 
The video shows Trump calling Hawkins on stage to join him after telling the audience his philosophy of using revenge to succeed in business: “Get even with people,” he said. “If they screw you, screw them back 10 times as hard. I really believe that.” 
There are a few quotes from the Bible that are relevant here, but I’m pretty sure that Biblical literalists and right-wing evangelicals don’t know what those quotes are. They’re too busy agreeing with Trump. 
Trump was apparently mad at Hawkins the day before because he thought she’d slighted him by declining to introduce him at an event in Sydney — Hawkins, it should be noted, is Australian. Once she was onstage with Trump, Hawkings laughed apologetically and said it was a “miscommunication with my management,” which left her, “[feeling] really bad.” 
Trump seemed to accept this, saying: “When she found out, she got in her car and she got her ass over here, and I love her.” 
Spray-tan Hitler has a well-known vindictive streak. He at least entertained the possibility of forming a PAC to sink the political careers of Ted Cruz — voted second most punchable face in the world after Trump superfan and Breitbart personality Milo Yiannopoulos — and John Kasich after the two of them refused to show up at the Republican national convention and kiss his ring. He’s threatened to use his power as president to arrest people he disagrees with. To say he’s vindictive may well be a British-level understatement (and if he’s elected, it’ll definitely be a British-level mistake). 
That vindictive streak is probably what led to the sequence of bizarre events that followed, culminating ultimately with Trump forcing a nonconsensual kiss on Hawkins. 
First, he described how he would have embarrassed Hawkin if she’d really slighted him: “I was actually going to get up and tell you that Jennifer is a beautiful girl on the outside, but she’s not very bright. That wouldn’t have been true, but I would have said it anyway.” 
Trump then made a sexual pun, and of course lingered on it until the audience got it or laughed out of awkwardness, I can’t be sure which: “And you know what? She came tonight, she came — came, she came, she came.” Once the audience laughed, Trump added: “See, so they have the same filthy minds in Australia.” 
Then he grabbed her around the waist and forced a kiss on her. This is pretty much on par with what others have accused Trump of doing — according to Cathy Heller, who claims that Trump assaulted her at a Mother’s Day brunch at Mar-a-Lago : “He took my hand, and grabbed me, and went for the lips,” she claimed. Alarmed, she said she leaned backwards to avoid him and almost lost her balance. “And he said, ‘Oh, come on.’ He was strong. And he grabbed me and went for my mouth and went for my lips.” She turned her head, she claims, and Trump planted a kiss on the side of her mouth. “He kept me there for a little too long,” Heller said. “And then he just walked away.” 
If you feel like you need a shower after this, just remember: you probably have a relative who thinks voting for this man is a good idea.

9551,Trump and Staff Rethink Tactics After Stumbles - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump loves to set the day’s narrative at dawn, but the deeper story of his White House is best told at night. Aides confer in the dark because they cannot figure out how to operate the light switches in the cabinet room. Visitors conclude their meetings and then wander around, testing doorknobs until finding one that leads to an exit. In a darkened, mostly empty West Wing, Mr. Trump’s provocative chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, finishes another   day planning new lines of attack. Usually around 6:30 p. m. or sometimes later, Mr. Trump retires upstairs to the residence to recharge, vent and intermittently use Twitter. With his wife, Melania, and young son, Barron, staying in New York, he is almost always by himself, sometimes in the protective presence of his imposing longtime aide and former security chief, Keith Schiller. When Mr. Trump is not watching television in his bathrobe or on his phone reaching out to old campaign hands and advisers, he will sometimes set off to explore the unfamiliar surroundings of his new home. During his first two dizzying weeks in office, Mr. Trump, an outsider president working with a surprisingly small crew of no more than a   empowered aides with virtually no familiarity with the workings of the White House or federal government, sent shock waves at home and overseas with a succession of executive orders designed to fulfill campaign promises and taunt foreign leaders. “We are moving big and we are moving fast,” Mr. Bannon said, when asked about the upheaval of the first two weeks. “We didn’t come here to do small things. ” But one thing has become apparent to both his allies and his opponents: When it comes to governing, speed does not always guarantee success. The bungled rollout of his executive order barring immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries, a flurry of other miscues and embarrassments, and an approval rating lower than that of any comparable   president in the history of polling have Mr. Trump and his top staff rethinking an improvisational approach to governing that mirrors his chaotic presidential campaign, administration officials and Trump insiders said. This account of the early days of the Trump White House is based on interviews with dozens of government officials, congressional aides, former staff members and other observers of the new administration, many of whom requested anonymity. At the center of the story, according to these sources, is a president determined to go big but increasingly frustrated by the efforts of his small team to contain the backlash. “What are we going to do about this?” Mr. Trump pointedly asked an aide last week, a period of turmoil briefly interrupted by the successful rollout of his Supreme Court selection, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch. Chris Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and an old friend of the president’s, said: “I think, in his mind, the success of this is going to be the poll numbers. If they continue to be weak or go lower, then somebody’s going to have to bear some responsibility for that. ” “I personally think that they’re missing the big picture here,” Mr. Ruddy said of Mr. Trump’s staff. “Now he’s so caught up, the administration is so caught up in turmoil, perceived chaos, that the Democrats smell blood, the protesters, the media smell blood. ” One former staff member likened the aggressive approach of the first two weeks to   but said the president’s team had stormed the beaches without any plan for a longer war. Clashes among staff are common in the opening days of every administration, but they have seldom been so public and so pronounced this early. “This is a president who came to Washington vowing to shake up the establishment, and this is what it looks like. It’s going to be a little sloppy, there are going to be conflicts,” said Ari Fleischer, President George W. Bush’s first press secretary. All this is happening as Mr. Trump, a man of flexible ideology but fixed habits, adjusts to a new job, life and city. Cloistered in the White House, he now has little access to his fans and supporters  —   an important source of feedback and validation  —   and feels increasingly pinched by the pressures of the job and the constant presence of protests, one of the reasons he was forced to scrap a planned trip to Milwaukee last week. For a sense of what is happening outside, he watches cable, both at night and during the day  —   too much in the eyes of some aides  —   often offering a bitter    of critics like CNN’s Don Lemon. Until the past few days, Mr. Trump was telling his friends and advisers that he believed the opening stages of his presidency were going well. “Did you hear that, this guy thinks it’s been terrible!” Mr. Trump said mockingly to other aides when one dissenting view was voiced last week during a West Wing meeting. But his opinion has begun to change with a relentless parade of bad headlines. Mr. Trump got away from the White House this weekend for the first time since his inauguration, spending it in Palm Beach, Fla. at his private club,    posting Twitter messages angrily  —   and in personal terms  —   about the federal judge who put a nationwide halt on the travel ban. Mr. Bannon and Reince Priebus, the two clashing power centers, traveled with him. By then, the president, for whom chains of command and policy minutiae rarely meant much, was demanding that Mr. Priebus begin to put in effect a much more conventional White House protocol that had been taken for granted in previous administrations: From now on, Mr. Trump would be looped in on the drafting of executive orders much earlier in the process. Another change will be a new set of checks on the previously unfettered power enjoyed by Mr. Bannon and the White House policy director, Stephen Miller, who oversees the implementation of the orders and who received the brunt of the internal and public criticism for the rollout of the travel ban. Mr. Priebus has told Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon that the administration needs to rethink its policy and communications operation in the wake of embarrassing revelations that key details of the orders were withheld from agencies, White House staff and Republican congressional leaders like Speaker Paul D. Ryan. Mr. Priebus has also created a   checklist for the release of any new initiatives that includes signoff from the communications department and the White House staff secretary, Robert Porter, according to several aides familiar with the process. Mr. Priebus bristles at the perception that he occupies a diminished perch in the West Wing pecking order compared with previous chiefs. But for the moment, Mr. Bannon remains the president’s dominant adviser, despite Mr. Trump’s anger that he was not fully briefed on details of the executive order he signed giving his chief strategist a seat on the National Security Council, a greater source of frustration to the president than the fallout from the travel ban. It is partly because he is seen as having a clear vision on policy. But it is also because others who had been expected to fill major roles have been less confident in asserting their power. Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s    occupies a central role in the administration and has been present at most major decisions and photo ops, but he is a father of young children who has taken to life in Washington, and, along with his wife, Ivanka Trump, has already been spotted at events around town. Mr. Bannon has rushed into the vacuum, telling allies that he and Mr. Miller have a brief window in which to push through their vision of Mr. Trump’s economic nationalism. Mr. Bannon, whose website, Breitbart, was a magnet for white nationalists and xenophobic speech, has also tried to reassure official Washington. He has been careful to build bridges with the Republican establishment, especially Mr. Ryan  —   whom he once described as “the enemy” and vowed to force out. He now talks regularly with Mr. Ryan to coordinate strategy or plot their planned overhaul of the tax code. Before he was ousted in November as transition chief, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, the Trump adviser with the most government experience, helped prepare a detailed staffing and implementation plan in line with the kickoff strategies of previous Republican presidents. It was discarded  —   a senior Trump aide made a show of tossing it into a garbage can  —   for a strategy that prioritized the daily release of dramatic executive orders to put opponents on the defensive. Mr. Christie, who agrees in principle with the broad strokes of Mr. Trump’s immigration policy, says the president has been let down by his staff. “The president deserves better than the rollout he got on the immigration executive order,” Mr. Christie said. “The fact is that he’s put forward a policy that, in my opinion, is significantly more effective than what he had proposed during the campaign, yet because of the botched implementation, they allowed his opponents to attack him by calling it a Muslim ban. ” In the past few days, Mr. Trump’s team has stressed its cohesion and the challenges of   an administration that few outside its group ever thought would exist. “This team spent months in the foxhole together during the campaign,” said Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. “We moved into the White House as a unified team committed to enacting the president’s agenda. ” As part of Mr. Trump’s Oval Office renovation, he ordered that four hardback chairs be placed in a semicircle around his Resolute Desk now heaped, in Trump Tower fashion, with memos and newspapers. They are an emblem of Mr. Trump’s    management style, but also a reminder that in the White House, the seats always outlast the people seated in them. But finding enough skilled players to fill key slots has not been easy: Mr. Spicer is serving double duty as communications director, a key planning position, in addition to engaging in    combat with the news media. Mr. Trump, several aides said, is used to quarterbacking his own media strategy, and did not see the value of hiring an outsider. An early plan was to give the communications job to Kellyanne Conway, his former campaign manager and top TV surrogate, but the demands of the job would have conflicted with Ms. Conway’s other duties as a   adviser to Mr. Trump with Oval Office   privileges, according to one aide. Mr. Trump remains intensely focused on his brand, but the demands of the job mean he spends less time monitoring the news media  —   although he recently upgraded the   TV in his private dining room so he can watch the news while eating lunch. He often has to wait until the end of the workday before grinding through news clips with Mr. Spicer, marking the ones he does not like with a big arrow in black Sharpie  —   though he almost always makes time to monitor Mr. Spicer’s performance at the daily briefings, summoning him to offer praise or criticism, a West Wing aide said. Visitors to the Oval Office say Mr. Trump is obsessed with the décor  —   it is both a totem of a victory that validates him as a serious person and an   backdrop  —   so he has told his staff to schedule as many televised events in the room as possible. To pass the time between meetings, Mr. Trump gives quick tours to visitors, highlighting little tweaks he has made after initially expecting he would have to pay for them himself. Flanking his desk are portraits of Presidents Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson. He will linger on the opulence of the newly hung golden drapes, which he told a recent visitor were once used by Franklin D. Roosevelt but in fact were patterned for Bill Clinton. For a man who sometimes has trouble concentrating on policy memos, Mr. Trump was delighted to page through a book that offered him 17 window covering options. Ultimately, this is very much the White House that Mr. Trump wanted to build. But while the world reckons with the effect he is having on the presidency, he is adjusting to the effect of the presidency on him. He is now a public employee. And the only boss Mr. Trump ever had in his life was his father, a   developer the president still treats with deep reverence. With most of his belongings in New York, the only family picture on the shelf behind Mr. Trump’s desk is a small    photograph of that boss, Frederick Christ Trump.",0
9552,Penguins Finish Off Sharks to Win Stanley Cup - The New York Times,"SAN JOSE, Calif.  —   Much of Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals was part hockey, part speedskating. When it was over on Sunday night, the Pittsburgh Penguins had their second title in eight years and their fourth in franchise history, defeating the San Jose Sharks,  . What turned out to be the winning goal typified the   skill on display throughout the series. The Pittsburgh captain Sidney Crosby fed defenseman Kris Letang for a   low in the right   circle that found its way into the San Jose net at 7 minutes 46 seconds of the second period. And despite encouragement from the spirited crowd inside SAP Center for the Sharks’ first appearance in the Stanley Cup finals in their   history, San Jose could not find the equalizer before Penguins forward Patric Hornqvist scored an insurance goal into an empty net with 1:02 left in the third period. The game ended when Crosby cleared the puck the length of the ice with San Jose on a power play, and then the celebration began. “Man, I’m going to remember this day for the rest of my entire life,” said the rookie Penguins goaltender Matthew Murray, who faced only 19 shots in the clinching game. Murray, who is 22, added: “I probably won’t believe this until next year, to be honest. It’s so surreal. ” Crosby, who had 19 postseason points, was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy, which is given to the most valuable player of the playoffs. During his postgame media conference, he drew comparisons with the first cup he won in 2009, his fourth of 11 seasons in the league. “I have a greater appreciation this time around,” the    Crosby said, noting that after    appearances in the finals in 2008 and 2009, “you just think it’s going to be an annual thing. ” “With the core we have,” he added, “you think everyone’s going to stay together, the team’s not going to change. But it does. ” None of Pittsburgh’s four Stanley Cup wins have come on home ice. Although the Stanley Cup presentation was made inside SAP Center by N. H. L. Commissioner Gary Bettman, thousands of Penguins supporters were able to celebrate at a watch party inside Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh. Center Evgeni Malkin said the championship felt as good as the 2009 title, and he was not surprised that it took so long to win it again. “It’s not easy to win in this league. They have 30 good teams,” Malkin said. “We played against a tough San Jose team, and they not win in 25 years. It’s not easy. San Jose a great team, great coaches. But it’s tough to win. I’m glad finally we win. ” Malkin added: “We did a great job. Actually, tonight we worked so hard, we deserved to win. ” For the fifth time in the six games, the Penguins opened the scoring. With Sharks forward Dainius Zubrus in the penalty box for tripping, Brian Dumoulin’s shot from the left point eluded San Jose goaltender Martin Jones at 8:16 of the first period. Jones, who made 24 saves, was more formidable later in the period, however, making two quick saves on Crosby in a   span after a Sharks giveaway. The Sharks tied the game,   at 6:27 of the second period when center Logan Couture used Penguins defenseman Justin Schultz as a screen and beat Murray with a   wrist shot. The goal was Couture’s 30th point of the playoffs, the best in the league. But Letang answered 79 seconds later, and San Jose could not draw even again. The Sharks, who finished third in the Pacific Division, fell short of their goal, but they went a long way toward erasing their reputation as playoff underachievers with wins over the Los Angeles Kings, the Nashville Predators and the St. Louis Blues. “I’m very proud of our group,” Sharks Coach Peter DeBoer said. “I thought our guys emptied the tank, gave us everything they possibly could. We weren’t as good as them during this   period. ” The challenge Pittsburgh presented went beyond their   team speed, he added. “They have good sticks, too. They force you into quicker decisions. They really challenge your execution. We hadn’t seen pressure and sticks like that through the first three rounds. ” Pittsburgh had entered the playoffs as the No. 2 seed in the Metropolitan Division, defeating the Rangers, the Washington Capitals and the Tampa Bay Lightning en route to the finals. The Penguins righted their season after Mike Sullivan replaced Mike Johnston on Dec. 12 as coach when the team was near . 500. “We changed style,” Malkin said of the coaching change. “Before, we played more   now we played in offensive zone. We use our legs. We skate with puck, we skate without puck. Always skating. ”",0
9553,"Fox News’s Harassment Payments Are Under Investigation, Lawyer Says - The New York Times","The United States attorney’s office is looking into the way Fox News handled payments related to sexual harassment cases to determine whether the company misled investors, according to the lawyer for a woman who is suing the network. At a hearing in New York State Supreme Court on Wednesday, the lawyer, Judd Burstein, who is representing the former Fox anchor Andrea Tantaros, said that another one of his clients had received a grand jury subpoena related to Fox News. He did not identify that client. Mr. Burstein said in a text message that he believed federal investigators were looking at whether Fox News structured sexual harassment settlement claims by paying them out in salaries, “so as not to have to report them. ” He added that the prosecutors had identified themselves as being from a securities fraud division of the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan. In a statement, Fox News said it had not received a subpoena but had “been in communication with the U. S. attorney’s office for months. ” The statement added that Fox “will continue to cooperate on all inquiries with any interested authorities. ” The United States attorney’s office declined to comment. The prospect of a criminal investigation is a surprising escalation of the sexual harassment scandal that engulfed Fox News over the summer and led to the departure of its chairman, Roger Ailes. After reaching a $20 million settlement with Gretchen Carlson, a former anchor who sued Mr. Ailes, and conducting an internal investigation into his conduct, the company tried hard to put the episode behind it. The scope of the investigation by the United States attorney’s office, which appeared to be in the early stages, was not immediately clear. Mr. Burstein made the remarks while he was arguing that Ms. Tantaros’s case  —   she sued the network in August, accusing Fox News of retaliation after she complained about sexual harassment  —   should go forward in an open court. A judge rejected that claim on Wednesday and ruled that her case would be resolved in arbitration. In a statement, a spokeswoman for Fox News said, “The court granted Fox News’s motion to send Andrea Tantaros’s case to arbitration, where it always belonged, and rejected her counsel Judd Burstein’s histrionics. ” Asked whether Mr. Ailes had received a subpoena, Susan Estrich, his lawyer, declined to comment. Mr. Ailes has denied the sexual harassment allegations. Ms. Tantaros’s suit asserts that the network’s newsroom resembled “a   Playboy   cult. ” The suit named a number of Fox News executives in addition to Mr. Ailes, accusing them of marginalizing her and removing her from the air after she complained. Fox News denied the charges, saying that Ms. Tantaros was let go for violating her contract by writing a book without approval. In July, Ms. Carlson sued Mr. Ailes for sexual harassment. Fox News’s parent company, 21st Century Fox, hired the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison to conduct an investigation, and a number of other women stepped forward with similar accusations, including the former Fox star Megyn Kelly.",0
9554,"Amid Party Concerns, Donald Trump Meets With His Finance Team - The New York Times","Donald J. Trump convened the first meeting of his national finance team on Thursday amid persistent Republican concerns that a shortfall in   efforts and a lack of discipline were imperiling his presidential bid. During the gathering at the Four Seasons Hotel in Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Trump dwelled little on his recent controversies, including his comments about the Mexican heritage of the judge presiding in a lawsuit filed by former students of Trump University. But a top Trump surrogate, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, did allude to the recent bumpiness of the campaign, said an attendee, John A. Catsimatidis, a New York investor and grocery magnate. “People make mistakes,” Mr. Christie said, according to Mr. Catsimatidis, “and they take it back. ” A spokesman for Mr. Christie referred questions to the Trump campaign. Mr. Trump has not backed off his attacks on the judge, Gonzalo P. Curiel, but did issue a statement this week calling it unfortunate that his comments had been “misconstrued. ” Among those also in attendance for the meeting were Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, and Woody Johnson, the Jets owner and onetime supporter of Jeb Bush who recently joined Mr. Trump’s finance committee. Mr. Trump had initially said he hoped to raise roughly $1 billion by November for himself and the party, but efforts to date have been well off pace. He has since revised that figure downward. “We’ll raise what we need to raise,” Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, said after leaving the meeting. Mr. Catsimatidis echoed a recent suggestion from Mr. Trump that raising $1 billion was unnecessary because he attracted so much media attention. “He’s got $2 billion in free advertising and free TV,” Mr. Catsimatidis said. He added that he remained friends with the Clintons and had not committed to a candidate. In his remarks to the finance group, Mr. Trump expressed confidence in his ability to compete in states like New Jersey, Maryland and California that are rarely hospitable to Republicans, said an attendee who requested anonymity to discuss the private meeting. Mr. Trump has also hired a pollster to gauge his prospects in New York, causing consternation among Republicans who worry that he is spending foolishly.",0
9555,Family of Man Charged in Killing of Queens Imam Insists He Is Innocent - The New York Times,"They arrived early, an hour before the judge started hearing cases on Thursday, taking up much of a long bench in the Queens courtroom. They were family members of Oscar Morel, the man charged with   murder in the   attack on an imam and his assistant on a sidewalk on Saturday afternoon. The relatives had come to support Mr. Morel as he returned to Queens Criminal Court, facing charges that carry a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole for an attack that has stirred fear and anger among Muslims in New York. His family members called out to him during the brief hearing, telling him, “Love you, Oscar,” even though they were chastised by the judge. Mr. Morel, who turned 36 on Thursday, acknowledged them with a nod. The relatives declined to talk to reporters. But as his father, who declined to give his name, walked out of the courthouse supported by two relatives, he said in halting English, “He don’t do it. ” On Saturday, the authorities said, Mr. Morel approached the imam, Alauddin Akonjee, 55, and his assistant, Thara Miah, 64, from behind near the intersection of Liberty Avenue and 79th Street in the Ozone Park neighborhood, and then shot them both in the head. Mr. Morel, who worked as a janitor, was taken into police custody on Sunday night, and has been charged with a single count of   murder and two counts of   murder. Police officials said that investigators found a weapon, a .  revolver that tests showed was used in the killings, hidden inside a wall in his apartment, as well as clothes of Mr. Morel’s that fit the description of what the gunman was believed to have worn during the attack. There was also video evidence connecting Mr. Morel to the scene, officials said. But during the hearing on Thursday, prosecutors said that a potential witness in the case failed to identify Mr. Morel as the assailant during a lineup, selecting another person who had been placed by the police. It was a development that Mr. Morel’s lawyer, Michael J. Schwed, said he found troubling, indicating “something prejudicial in the way that the lineup was conducted. ” Mr. Schwed said outside the courtroom that he had met only briefly with Mr. Morel, but that his client had spent much of the time insisting that he was innocent. “I told him I was his lawyer,” Mr. Schwed said. “And he said: ‘I didn’t do this and what can we do? How can I prove it?’ He was very upset. ” Mr. Schwed added, “And he’s hoping to get exonerated as soon as possible. ” Outside City Hall on Thursday morning, relatives of Mr. Akonjee and Mr. Miah gathered with activists and other members of the city’s Muslim community, where they condemned the attack and continued calls for the authorities to classify the killings as a hate crime. Officials have said that they had not ruled out classifying the attack as a hate crime, but investigators had to know more about what motivated the killings before doing so. Momin M. Ahmed, a    of Mr. Akonjee, said that his family was desperate for answers. “We want to know what’s the reason for it, and we want justice,” said Mr. Ahmed, who described Mr. Akonjee as peaceful and loving. Mashuk Uddin, a younger brother of Mr. Miah, said he had struggled to cope with the loss of a brother who, after their father died, had become more like a father to him. “I cannot sleep,” he said. “I cannot eat. ” Many in the Muslim community believe that the episode was the result of animosity stirred by   rhetoric. “It’s our worst nightmare come true,” Iman Boukadoum, a board member of the Association of Muslim American Lawyers, said. During the gathering, attendees also said they wanted city officials to rename the streets near the site of the attack after the two men, as a memorial and as a physical reminder of the painful repercussions from the violence. “The tragedy is not just theirs,” Afaf Nasher, the executive director of the Council on   Relations of New York, said, referring to the men’s families, tears streaming down her face. “It’s all of ours. ”",0
9556,"A Drumbeat of Multiple Shootings, but America Isn’t Listening - The New York Times","CINCINNATI  —   After the slaughter of nine worshipers at a South Carolina church last June, but before the massacre of eight students and a teacher at an Oregon community college in October, there was a shooting that the police here have labeled Incident 159022597. 01. It happened on a clear Friday night at an Elks Lodge, on a modest block of clapboard houses northeast of this city’s hilly downtown. Unlike the butchery that bookended it, it merited no presidential statements, no saturation television coverage. But what took place at 6101 Prentice Street on Aug. 21 may say more about the nature of gun violence in the United States than any of those far more famous rampages. It is a snapshot of a different sort of mass violence  —   one that erupts with such anesthetic regularity that it is rendered almost invisible, except to the mostly black victims, survivors and attackers. According to the police account, more than 30 people had gathered in the paneled basement bar of the lodge to mark the 39th birthday of a man named Greg Wallace when a former neighbor, Timothy Murphy, showed up, drunk. Fists flew. Mr. Murphy ducked out the door, burst back in with a handgun, and opened fire. As partygoers scrambled for the door, he chased Greg Wallace’s younger brother Dawaun to a tiny     bathroom, where he shot him nine times before the violence spilled out onto the street. There, another Wallace relative, also armed with a handgun, fired back at him. By the end, 27 bullets had flown, hitting seven people: Mr. Murphy, who died Dawaun Wallace, who was grievously wounded four bystanders, one of whom was hit in the genitals, another in the leg. And Barry Washington. A seasonal packer for Amazon. com, Mr. Washington, 56, had stopped at the lodge on his way to the store for cigarettes, said his sister, Jaci Washington. He was in the bathroom when Mr. Murphy cornered Dawaun Wallace there. A single bullet pierced Mr. Washington’s arm, then his heart. He left behind a son, a daughter, a brother, a sister, a mother and four grandchildren. “My brother died on the floor of a bathroom for no reason,” Ms. Washington said. “He had nothing to do with the whole situation. I can’t believe I lost my brother like this. ” Yet many in the neighborhood where they grew up, she said, responded with a shrug. “The reality is, this happens quite frequently,” she said. “And it’s kind of, ‘Oh, well, this guy was killed today. Somebody else will be killed tomorrow.’ ” That is more than correct. The Elks Lodge episode was one of at least 358 armed encounters nationwide last year  —   nearly one a day, on average  —   in which four or more people were killed or wounded, including attackers. The toll: 462 dead and 1, 330 injured, sometimes for life, typically in bursts of gunfire lasting but seconds. In some cities, law enforcement officials say a growing share of shootings involve more than one victim, possibly driven by increased violence between street gangs. But data are scarce. Seeking deeper insight into the phenomenon, The New York Times identified and analyzed these 358 shootings with four or more casualties, drawing on two databases assembled from news reports and citizen contributors, and then verifying details with law enforcement agencies. Only a small handful were   mass shootings like those in South Carolina and Oregon. The rest are a pencil sketch of everyday America at its most violent. They chronicle how easily lives are shattered when a firearm is readily available  —   in a waistband, a glove compartment, a mailbox or garbage can that serves as a gang’s gun locker. They document the mayhem spawned by the most banal of offenses: a push in a bar, a Facebook taunt, the wrong choice of music at a house party. They tally scores of unfortunates in the wrong place at the wrong time: an    clinging to his mother’s hip, shot as she prepared to load him into a car a    church deacon, killed by a stray bullet while watching television on his couch. The shootings took place everywhere, but mostly outdoors: at neighborhood barbecues, family reunions, music festivals, basketball tournaments, movie theaters, housing project courtyards, Sweet 16 parties, public parks. Where motives could be gleaned, roughly half involved or suggested crime or gang activity. Arguments that spun out of control accounted for most other shootings, followed by acts of domestic violence. The typical victim was a man between 18 and 30, but more than 1 in 10 were 17 or younger. Less is known about those who pulled the triggers because nearly half of the cases remain unsolved. But of those arrested or identified as suspects, the average age was 27. Most of the shootings occurred in economically downtrodden neighborhoods. These shootings, by and large, are not a   phenomenon. The divide is racial as well. Among the cases examined by The Times were 39 domestic violence shootings, and they largely involved white attackers and victims. So did many of the   massacres, including a wild shootout between Texas biker gangs that left nine people dead and 18 wounded. Over all, though, nearly   of victims and suspected assailants whose race could be identified were black. Some experts suggest that helps explain why the drumbeat of dead and wounded does not inspire more outrage. “Clearly, if it’s    we don’t get the same attention because most people don’t identify with that. Most Americans are white,” said James Alan Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University in Boston. “People think, ‘That’s not my world. That’s not going to happen to me.’ ” Michael Nutter, a former Philadelphia mayor, who is black, said that society would not be so complacent if whites were dying from gun violence at the same rate as blacks. “The general view is it’s one bad black guy who has shot another bad black guy,” he said. “And so, one less person to worry about. ” Droves of experts study   massacres by     assailants, usually driven by mental disorders, at schools, workplaces and other public spaces. Academics regularly crunch data on single homicides and assaults. But the   shootings that wound or kill several victims  —   a relatively small subset of the shootings that kill nearly 11, 000 people and wound roughly 60, 000 more each year  —   are uncharted territory for researchers, said Richard B. Rosenfeld, a professor of criminology at the University of  . Louis. The Times compiled its list of 358 shootings with four or more casualties from largely   lists managed by the social media network Reddit and Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit organization. The groups recently combined their efforts at the website gunviolencearchive. org. Four or more casualties is a far broader measure than “mass shootings,” which are commonly defined as the killing of at least four people, not including the attacker. But it captures many victims who some criminologists say are too often ignored: people who might have died given a slightly different trajectory of a bullet, or   medical care. Counting assailants among casualties increased the total number of cases by fewer than three dozen, most of them domestic violence shootings that ended in suicide. Hispanics were not separately identified, because police reports do not systematically identify victims and suspects by ethnicity, only by race. There are 358 reasons for those 358 shootings, though some remain a mystery in about a fourth of the cases, investigators have discerned no motive. As for the rest, some patterns stand out. The fewest occurred while another felony, such as a burglary, was underway. Domestic violence shootings were nearly as infrequent, but were among the deadliest. About a third were provoked by arguments, typically   or   often over petty grievances. A sampling: Outside a crowded bar in Decatur, Ill. a customer found an expensive watch. When another man insisted it was his, the customer pulled out a semiautomatic handgun, shot the man in the face and wounded four people near him. After a day of drinking, singing karaoke and watching football, four   friends in a small town north of Baton Rouge, La. got into a fight  —   some said over the choice of music. One shot the other three, then killed himself. Outside an Orlando, Fla. housing project, lewd comments about a young man’s pregnant girlfriend resulted in 15 to 20 gunshots. A    boy who peered out his window at the fracas was struck directly in one eye. One of three wounded adults later acknowledged that “a    fist fight would have settled the issue,” the police report said. Another third of the 358 cases  —   and the most common in cities with more than 250, 000 residents  —   were either   or were   shootings typical of gangs. But the police and prosecutors say many of those were not directly linked to criminal activity, such as a dispute over a drug deal. More often, a minor    —   a boast, an insult, a decision to play basketball on another gang’s favorite court  —   was taken as a sign of disrespect and answered with a bullet, said Andrew V. Papachristos, a Yale University professor who studies gang behavior. Over all,   of shootings took place outdoors, endangering innocent people. More than 100 bystanders, from toddlers to grandparents, were injured or killed. Among them: eight family members shot as they bade one another goodbye after a reunion in Philadelphia a soldier struck by a stray bullet during a shootout in a public square in Savannah, Ga. a    college sophomore killed when a gunman sprayed a crowd outside an Ocala, Fla. club. In Cincinnati, where last year’s toll of 479 gun deaths and injuries was the highest in nine years, a growing share of shootings involves more than one victim  —   1 in 8 attacks with guns in the first half of last year compared with 1 in 12 over the same span in 2010. Police officials in some other cities have noted a similar trend, though others say they have not. What is behind the upticks, they said, is a matter of speculation. In Rochester,   shootings accounted for fewer than 15 percent of victims in 2006 so far this year, they make up 38 percent. Police Chief Michael Ciminelli said that he suspected that social media was playing a role by simultaneously catalyzing minor disputes into deadly standoffs and drawing more people into them. Larry C. Smith, interim chief of police in Durham, N. C. and a   veteran of the force, said, “Are we starting to reap the   age? I don’t know. ” “But five, or certainly 10 years ago,” he added, “it wasn’t like this. ” The Elks Lodge shooting was one of five last year in Cincinnati that resulted in at least four casualties. The others took place on street corners, on a front porch and at a cookout in a parking lot. Police officials say they suspect that as many as half of the 24 victims were not the intended targets community workers blame   gunmen who are often high on drugs or are drunk. “They are not marksmen,” said Aaron Pullins, an   worker. “They don’t know how to hold the gun. They just shoot. ” Investigators have linked three of those shootings to gangs, although like many of their counterparts in other cities, they say the word gang conjures up a false image of a   hierarchical criminal organization. Instead, they describe fluid, sometimes tiny bands of teenagers and young adults bound by illegal activity. “They are groups of friends who rob and shoot each other,” Detective Greg Gehring said. “That’s just what they do. ” And they do it all too well. Last year such groups accounted for 40 of Cincinnati’s 58 gun homicides and more than half of its 421 nonfatal shootings. Two of the five shootings with four or more casualties occurred just 300 feet apart in East Westwood, an impoverished neighborhood with high unemployment and dropout rates, on a block that averaged a shooting nearly every other month. A third occurred a mile away. That pattern is typical: Urban gun violence tends to spread around specific blocks or intersections, like a contagious disease. Rival gang members, seeking revenge for an earlier shooting, had already tried to run Jonathan Austin, 24, off the road when they caught up to him in early December outside the Schwarz Market in East Westwood, the police said. They chased him and his friends for an entire block, firing up to 50 shots. Mr. Austin was killed. Three of his friends were injured, including an    who was shot repeatedly in the back, damaging his spine. Detective Gehring said that when he talked to the teenager last month, he was bedridden in his mother’s apartment, worried he would never move his legs again. With the help of the market’s surveillance video and one witness, the police arrested a    felon on charges of murder and illegal possession of a weapon. But as many as five other gunmen got away. A few weeks ago, one of the suspects was shot 11 times, possibly in retaliation, the detective said. Street violence is   that way: Shootings beget shootings that beget more gunmen. Professor Papachristos, the gang expert, said the more violent the neighborhood, the more teenagers and young men seek safety in numbers. “The No. 1 reason people join gangs is for protection,” he said. “The perverse irony is they are then more at risk. ”   Abdullah, 67 and   with a neatly trimmed gray beard, is an   turned outreach worker for Cincinnati’s Human Relations Commission. He or his   were at the scenes of all five of Cincinnati’s shootings with four or more casualties last year, working the crowds outside the yellow police tape, trying to defuse the potential for further gunfire. They see themselves as stop signs for young black men bound for  . They also see themselves as   about the intersection of race and gun violence  —   a topic that neither the city’s mayor, who is white, nor its police chief, who is black, publicly addresses. “White folks don’t want to say it because it’s politically incorrect, and black folks don’t know how to deal with it because it is their children pulling the trigger as well as being shot,” said Mr. Abdullah, who is black. No one worries more about    violence than  . Surveys show that they are more fearful than whites that they will be crime victims and that they feel less safe in their neighborhoods. Most parents Mr. Abdullah meets are desperate to protect their children but are trapped in unsafe neighborhoods, he said, “just trying to survive. ” And some are in denial, refusing to believe that their sons are carrying or using pistols, even in the face of clear evidence. “ ‘Not my child,’ ” he said, adopting the resentful tone of a defensive mother. “ ‘It may be his friends, but not my child, because I know how I raised my child.’ ” His reply, he said, is blunt: “These are our children killing our children, slaughtering our children, robbing our children. It’s our responsibility first. ”   make up 44 percent of Cincinnati’s nearly 300, 000 residents. But last year they accounted for 91 percent of shooting victims, and very likely the same share of suspects arrested in shootings, according to the city’s assistant police chief, Lt. Col. Paul Neudigate. Nationally, reliable racial breakdowns exist only for victims and offenders in gun homicides, not assaults, but those show a huge disparity. The gun homicide rate peaked in 1993, in tandem with a nationwide crack epidemic, and then plummeted over the next seven years. But blacks still die from gun attacks at six to 10 times the rate of whites, depending on whether the data is drawn from medical sources or the police. F. B. I. statistics show that   who constitute about 13 percent of the population, make up about half of both gun homicide victims and their known or suspected attackers. “Every time we look at the numbers, we are pretty discouraged, I have to tell you,” said Gary LaFree, a professor of criminology at the University of Maryland. Some researchers say the single strongest predictor of gun homicide rates is the proportion of an area’s population that is black. But race, they say, is merely a proxy for poverty, joblessness and other   disadvantages that help breed violence. Mr. Nutter, now an urban policy professor at Columbia University, spoke out repeatedly about the disparity during his eight years as Philadelphia’s mayor  —   and was accused of casting   in a bad light. “Some people got upset,” he said. “I said, ‘I’ll stop talking about it when you stop killing each other.’ ” Cloaking the issue, he said, only makes it easier for the country to tune out what amounts to “mass murder occurring in slow motion every day. ” Both he and Mr. Abdullah say they wish some of the outrage over police killings of unarmed   would spill over to victims who die in anonymity in routine gun violence. After a white University of Cincinnati police officer fatally shot an unarmed black driver in July, street protests erupted here, Mr. Abdullah noted. But “when we kill each other,” he said, “it seems an acceptable way of life. ” Every month, the outreach workers attend more ceremonies, outpourings of grief marked by teddy bears, high school photos, candles and scrawled tributes to the victim of the day. “I feel so burned out,” said Steve Sherman, one of the workers. “We go to vigil, after vigil, after vigil, after vigil. ” From his hospital bed, one of four young men shot last May at one of Cincinnati’s most violent intersections pointed a police officer to a suspect. He gave the man’s first name. And he suggested that he had been shot in retaliation for an earlier shooting in the same area. Officers were able to identify the suspect and confirm that his car had been shot up a few days earlier, said Police Specialist Mark Longworth, who headed the inquiry. But “that’s where this case died,” he said. The injured victim attributed his information purely to “street talk,” not to direct knowledge that would stand in court. Hints are not evidence. “It’s frustrating because if people would do the right thing, we could probably prevent some of these shootings from happening,” Specialist Longworth said. “But in that world, very few things are worse than being labeled a snitch. ” Nationally, nearly half of last year’s shootings with four or more casualties ended in the same way: no arrest often, not even a suspect. At least 160 assailants, responsible for 102 murders and 635 gun injuries, were still on the streets at year’s end. A case was more likely to be solved if one or more victims died  —   the situation in about half the cases. But even some double, triple and quadruple murders continue to stump investigators. The national clearance rate for homicides has fallen from nearly three in four in 1980 to fewer than two in three today. That is partly because public attention has driven down the share of domestic violence killings, which are routinely solved, Professor Rosenfeld said. Much of what remains are killings involving gangs, drugs and witnesses with criminal backgrounds who are wary of talking to the police. “You are left with a larger percentage of homicides that are more difficult for police to clear,” he said. A shift in law enforcement from solving crimes to preventing them has also contributed, as has rising distrust of the police in some cities, said Charles F. Wellford, emeritus professor of criminology at the University of Maryland. Still, he said, some law enforcement agencies are much worse at closing murder cases than others. Some of those same departments are worse at closing shootings with four or more casualties, too. In Baltimore, the police have not solved any of 11 shootings last year. New Orleans made arrests in only one of eight cases Chicago, two of 16. Cincinnati was more typical, solving two of its five cases, at least in part. Detective Charles Zopfi had real hopes of arresting the gunmen behind a   shooting here last September. About 20 people had gathered on a warm Monday night for a cookout in a parking lot beside an apartment building. “There were kids and older people, not your usual crowd of   to    guys,” the detective said. As a car sped down the street, someone fired at least 10 bullets out a window. Detective Zopfi said he knew from experience how people respond in such situations: They look in the direction of the gunfire, and only then dive for cover. But eight months later, he said, he has been unable even to nail down whether the vehicle was black or green. He heard that of the five victims, a      man was left paralyzed from the waist down. But that man refused to take his phone calls, then changed his telephone number. A wounded    named Jabarri seemed the best hope of persuading witnesses to come forward, the detective said. Sometimes, the moral outrage over a child victim overwhelms the code of silence. And Jabarri, he said, was “the cutest little boy” who had smiled beguilingly at him from a hospital gurney even after being shot in the leg. At the detective’s request, Jabarri’s mother agreed to meet with a reporter. But when the reporter showed up at her home, she backed out, pleading a haircut appointment. “The code of silence is strictly enforced,” the detective said. Mr. Abdullah, the   worker, talks to some of the victims and witnesses who will not give information to the police. “They are scared,” he said. “We have had cases where people found out who talked and that person wound up dead. ‘So if the police cannot protect me, why would I jeopardize my life and my family?’ ” “It’s so much bigger than the idea of ‘no snitching,’ ” he said. Barry Washington was a neighborhood fixture in Madisonville, a racially mixed community of small, neat homes in northeastern Cincinnati where he grew up. Slim, handsome and barely    he had an infectious smile and a weakness for hats, from jaunty duckbills to baseball caps worn backward. He helped out   families at the Presbyterian church, and brought household goods to the   apartment he shared with his    mother, Amanda. He was getting to know a son, then 37, whose existence he had only recently discovered. “An   good guy,” said his sister, Jaci. “There wasn’t a woman who didn’t love him, or a man who didn’t want to hang out with him. ” A     Mr. Washington could landscape a yard, operate a forklift, mend a torn basketball. He had to revert to odd jobs after the bus stopped running last year to Amazon. com’s northern Kentucky warehouse, where he had packed shipments. But his sister said he had planned to share an apartment near the warehouse so he could resume work there. Madisonville is neither Cincinnati’s safest nor its most dangerous neighborhood. The Washingtons had avoided brushes with gunmen, but Mr. Washington was wary even around ninth graders. “ ‘Be careful,’ ” his sister recalled him saying. “ ‘The little young kids are getting crazy.’ ” Sometime before 11 p. m. on Aug. 21, Mr. Washington left his apartment in a green pullover, telling his niece he needed cigarettes. His mother was in bed, watching a police drama. The next morning, Jaci Washington awoke to a blizzard of text messages about a shooting. She called her mother, who said her brother had not come home. Soon Amanda Washington’s phone rang: a detective, asking repeatedly whether she was alone. “Why? What happened to my son?” she demanded. “Is he dead?” Mr. Washington had stopped at the Elks Lodge, a narrow,   building clad in pale green siding a   walk from their apartment. Greg Wallace’s party was underway in the basement bar, a “Happy Birthday” banner and blue and yellow balloons on the walls. Tins of muffins and rolls sat on tables covered with plastic tablecloths. Mr. Wallace and his brother Dawaun had recently been feuding with Timothy Murphy. The three men had grown up together in the neighborhood, and as adults had each been convicted of drug trafficking, court records show. Mr. Murphy’s mother, Christine Poindexter, said her son was upset because the Wallaces were selling drugs out of his father’s house. The argument resumed when Mr. Murphy showed up at the party, and ended only when Mr. Murphy was dead and Dawaun Wallace had been peppered with nine bullets. Tests later showed that Mr. Murphy’s blood alcohol level was nearly three times the legal driving limit, and that there was evidence of recent marijuana use. Mr. Murphy’s killer was not prosecuted, Detective David Gregory said, because he appeared to have fired in  . Barry Washington’s death was collateral damage  —   a stray bullet, meant for Dawaun. Nine months later, Mr. Washington’s family is still reeling. His mother, a cancer survivor, is virtually a  . “We loved him dearly, and with a pull of the trigger, he was gone,” she said. “That I cannot accept. ” Jaci Washington’s    son is withdrawn and angry. Her    daughter has nightmares. Her brother, she said, probably would have counseled her to forgive his killer. “He kept telling me, ‘You have to look for the good in everybody, ’” she said. But she says she cannot forgive. She grasps for metaphors to capture the family’s loss. “It’s like the world crashing in. It’s like a nuclear bomb went off on my couch,” she said. “It’s like someone hit ‘pause’ in my life. I just saw him, and I will never see him again. ” Mr. Murphy’s mother is not seeking forgiveness. In an interview, she said she did not believe her son had fired a gun at anyone, insisting that the police had botched the investigation and let the real culprits go free. And she is angry with Jaci Washington for characterizing her son as a murderer at community meetings on gun violence. Ms. Washington and her mother no longer go to those meetings. They seemed futile, they said  —   more broken people, describing more senseless deaths. “I don’t want pity. I want results,” Jaci Washington said. “One more black shooting in a black neighborhood. ‘Let’s rally around.’ It’s a facade. When all is said and done, we’re still left with the grief. ”",0

9558,Таиланд между ТТП и ЕАЭС | Новое восточное обозрение,"Страна: Таиланд 4 февраля 2016 г. было подписано соглашение о создании Транстихоокеанского партнерства (ТТП). После ратификации соглашения всеми странами, на которую уйдет как минимум два года, в АТР появится огромная зона свободной торговли, объединяющая Австралию, Бруней, Вьетнам, Канаду, Малайзию, Мексику, Новую Зеландию, Перу, Сингапур, США, Чили и Японию. По прогнозам создателей ТТП, на его территорию со временем придется до 25% мирового товарооборота. При этом главным игроком там будут США, и торговля будет вестись по их правилам. Проект ТТП – попытка Америки сохранить свое экономическое доминирование в АТР и создать достойную конкуренцию Китаю. В идеале американцы желали бы видеть в своем партнерстве все страны Юго-Восточной Азии, однако все идет далеко не так гладко, как они рассчитывали. Пока что из АСЕАН в ТТП вошли только Вьетнам, Малайзия и Сингапур. Есть еще один кандидат от АСЕАН – это Таиланд. Однако если он и вступит в ТТП, то не на тех условиях, на которых этого хотели бы США. Интерес к проекту ТТП Таиланд выразил еще в 2012 г., когда шли предварительные переговоры, однако в последующие годы каких-либо шагов в эту сторону не предпринимал. Это не могло обрадовать американцев, ведь Таиланд один из их важных торговых партнеров. На США приходится более 20% таиландского экспорта и 14% импорта. Это немалые деньги, ведь ежегодный импорт Таиланда составляет около $150 млрд. Все эти показатели могли бы заметно увеличиться, если бы страна вступила в ТТП. Не стоит также забывать об относительно дешевой рабочей силе в Таиланде, что привлекает на его территорию многих иностранных инвесторов. Неудивительно, что США крайне заинтересованы в участии Таиланда в ТТП. Также в этом заинтересована Япония. Страна восходящего солнца является вторым по значимости игроком в ТТП и при этом главным экспортером продукции в Таиланд. Японская доля в таиландском импорте превышает 22%. Известно, что в Таиланде сейчас работает более полутора тысяч японских или совместных таиландско-японских предприятий. Очевидно, что сотрудничество с Японией чрезвычайно важно для таиландской экономики. 2 февраля 2016 г., за 2 дня до подписания соглашения о ТТП, премьер-министр Таиланда генерал Прают Чан-Оча встретился с делегацией японской торгово-промышленной палаты во главе с ее председателем Акио Мимура. Представители японского бизнеса обратились к правительству Таиланда с просьбой вступить в ТТП. По их словам, это заметно поспособствует развитию и укреплению таиландско-японского экономического сотрудничества. При этом делегаты добавили, что желают и дальше увеличивать количество японских предприятий в Таиланде, пока их устраивает налоговая политика государства. После встречи Прают Чан-Оча заявил, что она имела большое значение и способствовала росту доверия между правительством Таиланда и японскими инвесторами. Тем не менее вступления Таиланда в ТТП после той встречи так и не последовало. Более того, в тот момент таиландское руководство уже вело переговоры о присоединении страны к Евразийскому экономическому союзу (ЕАЭС) – организации экономически развитых стран бывшего СССР во главе с Россией, одному из потенциальных конкурентов ТТП. Кстати, с ЕАЭС на тот момент уже решил создать зону свободной торговли Вьетнам – еще один важный член АСЕАН, который при этом вошел в ТТП. В апреле 2016 г. Прают Чан-Оча посетил Россию. Тогда он заявил о желании Таиланда создать с ЕАЭС зону свободной торговли. В мае 2016 г. министр иностранных дел Таиланда Дон Прамудвинаи заявил, что страна готова присоединиться к ЕАЭС. По его словам, правительство Таиланда рассмотрело все возможности, которые несет создание зоны свободной торговли с ЕАЭС, и нашло их весьма заманчивыми. При этом все страны, входящие в ЕАЭС, также окажутся в выигрыше. Также Дон Прамудвинаи сказал, что вступить в ЕАЭС Таиланду поможет Россия, и что таиландская заявка уже разрабатывается. Следует напомнить, что Россия также является крупным торговым партнером Таиланда, и ежегодный товарооборот между ними составляет около $4,6 млрд. При этом имеются большие перспективы для роста, и поэтому превращение России и ЕАЭС в главных партнеров Таиланда вполне возможно. В заключение глава таиландского МИД сказал, что его страна скоро приступит к непосредственным переговорам о вхождении в ЕАЭС, когда уладит некоторые внутренние вопросы. 1 июня 2016 г. СМИ обнародовали заявление таиландского вице-премьера по вопросам экономики Сомкита Чатусипхитхака о том, что Таиланд все же готов вступить в ТТП, но лишь после ряда публичных слушаний, которые должны пройти в течение года. На них будет дано слово как сторонникам, так и противникам вступления. Также сообщалось о создании комитета во главе с таиландским министром торговли, цель которого – решить, выгодно ли стране членство в ТТП. Тогда Прают Чан-Оча заявил, что в первую очередь необходимо защитить права граждан Таиланда. Известно, что многие таиландские компании выступают против присоединения к ТТП, поскольку навязанные Америкой правила торговли сильно ударят по ним. Активно протестуют таиландские фермеры. Это стоит учесть, ведь в сельском хозяйстве занято около 60% населения страны. Вопрос о присоединении Таиланда к ТТП так и остается открытым. Заявление премьер-министра о том, что это состоится через год после всенародного обсуждения, сложно расценивать как обещание. Возможно, сейчас Таиланд стремится получить от США и Японии как можно больше преференций. При этом он продолжает сближение с ЕАЭС. В случае, если Таиланд присоединится к ЕАЭС и сделает его своим основным партнером, США и Японию ждут большие убытки. Даже если после этого Таиланд войдет и в ТТП, США уже не смогут его полностью контролировать. Американцам придется сотрудничать с Таиландом, учитывая его интересы, иначе он от них окончательно отвернется и целиком сосредоточится на ЕАЭС. Та же ситуация и с Вьетнамом, который уже состоит и в ТТП, и в ЕАЭС. Таиланд и Вьетнам входят в число самых развитых стран АСЕАН, и если они порвут с ТТП, то и другие члены АСЕАН могут последовать за ними. При этом именно контроль над Юго-Восточной Азией необходим США, чтобы сдерживать экономическую экспансию Китая. Таким образом, план ТТП идет совсем не так, как хотели США. Они надеялись создать мощный экономический союз, в котором были бы главными. Этот союз должен был стать инструментом экономического и политического влияния Америки в АТР, с помощью которого она ослабила бы Китай и ЕАЭС и вновь стала бы мировым экономическим лидером. Однако в лице таких стран, как Таиланд и Вьетнам, США получили не группу зависимых государств, а самостоятельных торговых партнеров. Вероятно, торгуя друг с другом, страны ТТП смогут неплохо заработать. Однако мирового экономического доминирования США, как видно, через ТТП не добьется.

9559,"London Attacker Known to Police, Allegedly Appeared on TV Jihad Show, Linked to Anjem Choudary","One of the London Bridge attackers was allegedly a   Islamist, who appeared on Britain’s Channel 4 TV station, was reported to police, and can be linked to the network around notorious hate preacher Anjem Choudary. [According to numerous reports, the suspected London Bridge terrorist appeared in a Channel 4 documentary last year, which also featured the “new Jihadi John” alleged Islamic State executioner Abu Rumaysah, hate preacher Mohammed Shamsuddin (also know as Abu Saalihah) and infamous social media radical Abu Haleema.  Twelve people, including four women in niqabs and men in Islamic robes, were arrested in Barking yesterday after raids at a flat believed to be the home of one of the attackers. A    man has been released without charge. The    suspected terrorist is known as “Abz” in the film. According to The Times, one of the suspects was born in Pakistan, grew up in Britain, and has been named by relatives as one of three men who rampaged through the capital this Saturday. He is thought to be the attacker who wore an Arsenal shirt and was later pictured dying on the street with a fake suicide belt strapped to him. According to an associate, interview anonymously on the BBC’s Asian Network, he was reported to the   hotline numerous times. It was also claimed that, two years earlier, police were warned that the suspect was trying to radicalise children in a local park. Police have asked the press not to fully identify the terrorists at this stage, but say they know who they are and will release their names “as soon as operationally possible”. Mohammed Shamsuddin, who “Abz” is filmed alongside in the Channel 4 documentary, was an associate of notorious hate preacher Anjem Choudary, who founded the   terror group  . Mr. Choudary has been linked to numerous murderous terrorists, including Michael Adebolajo, one of the killers of Fusilier Lee Rigby, and the   London bombers, and was convicted last year of supporting Islamic State. Abu Haleema and suspected Islamic State executioner Abu Rumaysah were also associates of Mr. Choudary, and both appear in the same film “Abz”. In the Channel 4 program, the suspected London attacker is shown in a scene when the group of radicals, led by Mohammed Shamsuddin, pray in a central London park and unfurl a black flag which is identified as that of the Islamic State. The group mock the police when they are questioned and tread a delicate line throughout the film, appearing to praise Islamic State, a banned group, but not openly backing them. Islamic State has now claimed the London Bridge attack. At one point near the Channel 4 film, Mohammed Shamsuddin laughs and smiles as he watches Islamic State execution videos. “The guy’s foaming at the mouth, wow!” he says. “And I’m eating, hahahaha. ” Abu Haleema, who has associated with Islamic State recruiters, says: “for the record, I don’t support the Islamic State” when challenged, before bursting out into a fit or laughter. “Just for the record so I don’t get nicked [arrested]” he adds.",0

9561,U.S.-Led Coalition Confirms Strikes Hit Mosul Site Where Civilians Died - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The   military coalition in Iraq said Saturday that an initial review of recent airstrikes in Mosul, the Islamic State’s last stronghold in Iraq, had confirmed that the strikes hit a site where scores of civilians were killed. The inquiry, military officials said, found that a building had collapsed a few days after strikes by American forces. United States officials are seeking to determine whether the airstrikes brought down the building, leaving many Iraqis dead, or the Islamic State used the strikes as an opportunity to detonate an explosive in the building. The Pentagon had acknowledged on Friday that it was investigating reports that its airstrikes had caused deaths in Mosul. The next phase of the investigation, military officials said, is likely to take about three weeks. The March 17 airstrikes  —   which Iraqis said had led to the deaths of possibly 200 people  —   could have produced among the highest civilian death tolls in an American air mission since the United States invaded Iraq in 2003. The reports of heavy civilian casualties have come at a critical point in the military campaign to defeat the Islamic State. Iraqi officials said that the Trump administration had appeared to loosen restrictions on the rules of engagement, making it easier for the Iraqis to call in airstrikes. The Iraqis had been frustrated by the Obama administration’s deliberate approach. Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said that the rules had not been loosened. The coalition said in a statement on Saturday that the airstrikes had been conducted “at the request of the Iraqi security forces,” and that it believed it was hitting Islamic State fighters and equipment. “The coalition respects human life, which is why we are assisting our Iraqi partner forces in their effort to liberate their lands from ISIS brutality,” the statement said. “Our goal has always been for zero civilian casualties, but the coalition will not abandon our commitment to our Iraqi partners because of ISIS’s inhuman tactics terrorizing civilians, using human shields, and fighting from protected sites such as schools, hospitals, religious sites and civilian neighborhoods. ” It added: “Coalition forces work diligently and deliberately to be precise in our airstrikes. Coalition forces comply with the Law of Armed Conflict and take all reasonable precautions during the planning and execution of airstrikes to reduce the risk of harm to civilians. ” The civilian deaths occurred in the recently liberated neighborhood of Mosul Jidideh, and reports of mass casualties began emerging on Thursday, six days after the coalition said it had struck the area. That lapse may have been a result of delays in getting rescue workers to the area, some of whom traveled from Baghdad, 250 miles away. Iraqis on Saturday continued to pull bodies from the rubble, as families held hastily arranged funerals for the victims, some of whom were buried in mass graves, shrouded by blue tarpaulins, according to photographs and videos shared on social media. In one video, Basma Basim, the head of Mosul’s provincial council, stood in front of destroyed buildings where the strikes occurred and said that dozens “of innocent women, men, old men and children’s bodies, are in these homes and shops behind me  —   we couldn’t save them. ” She added, “All the men I met had a wife, sister or children buried under the rubble, at least 20 persons died for each. ” The battle for Mosul, now in its sixth month, has taken a heavy toll on civilians, with the Islamic State gathering civilians to use as human shields and, lately, with reports of growing numbers of deaths from airstrikes. The Iraqi Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, said in a statement that more than 3, 800 civilians had been killed in the battle for western Mosul, which began in January. On the eastern side of the city, which was declared liberated in January after months of fighting, 2, 190 civilians were killed, the group said. In a statement on Saturday, Lise Grande, the United Nations’ top humanitarian official for Iraq, said, “We are stunned by this terrible loss of life and wish to express our deepest condolences to the many families who have reportedly been impacted by this tragedy. ” She added: “Parties to the conflict  —   all parties  —   are obliged to do everything possible to protect civilians. This means that combatants cannot use people as human shields and cannot imperil lives through indiscriminate use of firepower. ” Iraq’s Ministry of Defense, which works closely with the American military, broke two days of silence on Saturday when it said that it was opening an investigation into the civilian deaths. At the same time, the speaker of the Iraqi Parliament, Salim   ordered commanders of Iraq’s security forces to give lawmakers a report on the matter and to appear before the assembly.",0

9566,Transforming hope into reality for patients of drug-resistant TB,"Shobha Shukla, Citizen News Service - CNS Hope for shorter and more effective new TB drugs License DMCA Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) remains a public health crisis. As per WHO's Global TB Report 2016, 480,000 people fell ill with MDR-TB in 2015, with 3 countries - India, China, and Russia - carrying the major burden and together accounting for nearly half of all MDR-TB cases globally. Detection and treatment gaps continue to plague the MDR-TB response. In 2015, only 1 out of every 5 people needing treatment for MDR-TB were able to access it and only 52% of those who started MDR-TB treatment were cured. ""These sobering statistics remind us of our urgency to continue the fight to develop better, faster and affordable treatments that will finally bring this pandemic under control,"" said Dr Mel Spigelman, CEO of TB Alliance, which is working to advance several promising regimens to tackle all forms of TB. The current MDR-TB regimen lasts for 2 years or more. It includes medicines and injectables that are not only toxic but also come at a cost that is higher than what many patients and healthcare systems can afford. Even the new 9 month MDR-TB regimen that has recently been endorsed by WHO, though shorter, does include 4 months of injectables. However new results from 2 clinical studies conducted by TB Alliance point to an emerging paradigm, where countries may soon have the short, all-oral, and affordable drug regimens needed to treat all people with TB. Late stage clinical results from these two studies were unveiled yesterday at the 47th Union World Conference on Lung Health in Liverpool. The NC-005 study - Advertisement - The NC-005 study investigates an oral, injection free regimen that purports to treat both drug-sensitive and MDR-TB with a short, simple, safe, and affordable treatment. A Phase 2b, 2 month study tested various combinations of BPaMZ--Bedaquiline (B), Pretomanid (Pa), Moxifloxacin (M) and Pyrazinamide (Z). It was conducted at 10 sites in 3 countries (Uganda, South Africa, and Tanzania). A total of 240 patients were enrolled in the study-- 180 patients with drug-sensitive TB received BPaZ and 60 patients with MDR-TB received BPaMZ. The study also investigated a simpler dosing scheme for bedaquiline, which could lead to fewer pills and an overall less complicated treatment for patients. NC-005 showed that the best regimen was a combination of all four drugs, BPaMZ, which was examined in an arm of the trial. Data showed that at the end of 2 months, clinical study participants receiving BPaMZ cleared TB bacteria from their sputum 3 times as quickly as those on the standard treatment regimen. Almost all participants had culture conversion after the 2 months of treatment. This is the fastest rate of culture conversion that has ever been seen and indicates the potential of BPaMZ to treat all forms of TB-drug-sensitive as well as MDR-TB with the same regimen. The regimens appeared safe. The study showed that it was possible to simplify the dosing of Bedaquiline and found that a daily dose of Bedaquiline (200 mg) is at least as active and safe as the labelled dose. This will allow for simpler daily dosing with the regimen and to be combined in a fixed dose combination. The BPaMZ regimen is being tested to see if it can cure the vast majority of TB patients in as less as 3 months. If successful, the regimen could reshape the treatment landscape of TB, especially for people with MDR-TB, who currently face an arduous 9-24 month treatment journey that is too often unsuccessful. The results of NC-005 could pave the way to a global Phase 3 trial. The Nix-TB Study ('Nix' means to put an end to) - Advertisement - It is estimated that 9% of all the MDR-TB patients suffer from extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) that is resistant to at least four commonly used anti-TB drugs. XDR-TB is often considered a death sentence. Most XDR-TB is not treated at all because of the cost and complexity of the treatment. Of those who do receive treatment, less than one third get cured. In May 2015, TB Alliance and partners launched the world's first clinical study-- the Nix-TB Study-to test a new XDR-TB drug regimen called BPaL, consisting of Bedaquiline (B), Pretomanid (Pa), and Linezolid (L) in patients who have no other treatment options. It is the first study to test an all-oral drug regimen, comprised of drugs with minimal pre-existing resistance, that has the potential to shorten, simplify, and improve treatment for XDR-TB. Nix-TB is an open-label study that is being conducted at 2 sites in South Africa--at Sizwe Hospital in Johannesburg and at Brooklyn Chest Hospital in Cape Town. Additional sites to expand the study are planned. Patients who have XDR-TB, or have failed their current MDR-TB treatment or who have side effects of their current MDR-TB treatment, are enrolled.Till to date, 50 patients have been enrolled in the study, including patients as young as 14 and those who are co-infected with HIV with a CD4 cell count of 50 or higher.",0
9567,Why Trump: A quick primer for the world's elite,"Why Trump: A quick primer for the world's elite Donald Trump’s election victory was unprecedented, but it should not have been surprising. His popularity was the result of socio-economic trends that had been gathering force over the past 20 years Donald Trump’s election victory was unprecedented, but it should not have been surprising. His popularity was the result of socio-economic trends that had been gathering force over the past 20 years. 

President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump shake hands following their meeting in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Nov. 10. Photo: AP 
Elites across the U.S. and the world are puzzled by the election victory of Donald Trump. They should not be – it is no more surprising than the fall of one more domino in a line that has already toppled half a dozen others.
Trump’s victory follows the victory of the Brexit vote, and the rise and popularity of anti-liberal, nationalist leaders in the Philippines, Turkey, Hungary, and of course, Russia. Around the world, the rising polarization of wealth, the anger of those being left behind and trapped in the decline of social mobility have resulted in people venting their anger at what they perceive as selfish elites.
The data make clear that there was no huge outpouring of support for Donald Trump. He received 59.9 million votes overall; slightly less than Mitt Romney received in 2012 (60.9 million) and a hair more than John McCain received in 2008 (59.6). Trump defeated Clinton because she failed to generate as much enthusiasm as President Obama, who received 65.9 million votes in 2012 and a whopping 69.3 million votes in his first election in 2008. Large numbers of people who voted for Obama in earlier elections either stayed home (as with many of the Bernie Sanders voters) or voted for Trump.
In the Electoral College, the results were a surprise only because of overconfidence by Democrats and the biased judgements of urban-based elite media and commentators (plus polls that skewed toward urban voters). But a quick glance at the state and county maps of Republican and Democratic voting makes the outcome very clear. In the major cities where global finance and high technology has enriched the economies, and large numbers of the highly educated and higher-income households are located, voting went Democratic; in the rural areas dependent on the domestic economy, and particularly those hurt by the financial downturn since the Great Recession and by stagnant incomes, voting was overwhelmingly Republican.
Recommended: "" Will Trump's presidency change the way America views Russia? "" Overall, the Electoral College results were clear: as has usually been the case, the Northeast and West Coast states went Democratic, while the southern and mountain states went Republican. The crucial swing states were those in the upper Midwest – from western Pennsylvania and Ohio through Iowa, Wisconsin and Michigan. All of these were states that had voted for Obama in the previous two elections, but all of them went to Trump in 2016, giving him a large victory in the Electoral College.
The key swing voters in these swing states were the “white working class” - whites who had not attended college. These were the groups who felt the most pain in the late 2000s as their savings and homes crashed in value, while the high-paying union jobs that had been the foundation of their communities and their prosperity continued to fade away. In 2012, they voted strongly against Mitt Romney, who was seen as exactly the kind of predatory elite private equity investor who had enriched himself by closing factories and shipping jobs abroad.
But in 2016, they voted strongly against Hillary Clinton, who was also seen as representative of the Wall Street elites who had engineered bailouts for bankers and gotten rich themselves, while the white working class struggled to survive. Trump, in comparison, was seen as a self-made man who had no patience for political correctness, who would not give special favors to minorities and immigrants, and who would “make America (meaning their America, of small-town Midwestern communities) great again.” ;
This group of voters are now neither Democrats nor Republicans; rather they are supporters of anyone who promises to pay attention to their needs and shake up the system that they feel has neglected and scorned them. They supported Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries, and Donald Trump in the Republican primaries.
The real question we should be asking thus is not why Trump won the election; it is why so many voters rejected mainstream politicians from BOTH the Democratic and Republican parties, and voted for insurgents who aimed to overthrow the establishment of their parties and the nation . In short, why were so many voters willing to support what amounted to a revolution against politics-as-usual, a revolution aimed at blowing up the status quo?
The answer to that question is easily revealed in the graph shown below.

In this graph, from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, the upper blue line shows the growth in America’s economy. To be more specific, it shows the real (adjusted for inflation) level of GDP per person. This grew rapidly from 1993 to 2000, suffered a brief pause in the recession of 2001-2002 (the dot.com bust), and then continued to rise strongly to 2007. It again paused and dipped for the Great Recession of 2007-2009, but then rose again, reaching an all-time high in 2014.
One would expect that in a fair and open free market society there would be a strong relationship between rising national income and rising household income. ; Certainly there would be some increase in inequality as the benefits of growth would not be spread fully equally, but on average, one would expect that as a society as a whole grew richer, the people of that society would grow richer as well.
This was the case from the end of World War II all the way to the 1990s. But as shown by the bottom red line in the figure – which tracks the real median household income in the U.S. – for the last 15 years that expected relationship has failed. Over this period, the median household income has dropped; household income stopped rising in tandem with national economic growth from 1999 to 2007, first remaining flat even as the economic grew, then dropping by ten percent after 2007, even as the overall economy returned to steady growth.
There are a number of words to describe this state of affairs, but the obvious ones that leap to mind are “unfair,” “unjust,” and “intolerable.” ; No doubt most of the U.S. population has not been poring over graphs like this one – they don’t know the data or the trends. But what they do clearly see and resent is that highly visible pockets of the economy are enjoying strong economic growth; it is visible in New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Denver, Los Angeles, Houston, Miami and Chicago. These and other centers of design, finance, and professional life are thriving and driving a growing economy. ;
But the median households across the country – especially in rural areas and former manufacturing centers – are being left out of this growth; instead their incomes are falling. Some people blame immigrants; others blame globalization or sending jobs abroad. Economists and media pundits often blame technological advances for leaving uneducated workers behind. But for many households with stagnant or falling incomes watching the rising wealth of the bankers, executives, and urban professionals, the result that matters is a hatred of the elites who have manipulated the rules of the game to favor themselves and capture (if not steal) all the fruits of national economic growth.
The result is not all that different from what happened in East Germany for households that received TV images of the quality of life in West Germany, and increasingly realized that they were being left behind. The East Germans felt that their leaders had betrayed them; those leaders lost all legitimacy, and they were abandoned in what became a revolutionary movement that quietly toppled the Communist regime.
America has always had high inequality; that is not the issue. In the past, high inequality was combined with two elements that comprised the “American dream.” First, while some attained enormous wealth, average incomes rose as well. Not everyone would become a Rockefeller or Ford, but everyone could expect a rising income over their lifetimes if they worked hard.
Also read: "" Why Russia has no reason to celebrate a Trump presidency ye t "" Second, the path for mobility was open to all – anyone with the luck, brains, or business talent could strike it rich and move to the top of the income hierarchy. That opportunity was fueled by an open frontier in the 19 th and early 20 th century, and by a huge increase in public education and professional and white collar jobs from the 1960s to the 1990s. In those years, those with the ability and effort could put themselves through a good public college and get a professional or government job with excellent income and solid benefits. Parents from the lower and working classes whose children could be encouraged to be disciplined and hard-working could count on their children being able to get an outstanding education and achieve high levels of professional success.
In the last twenty years, both these elements of the American Dream have been stripped away. Average incomes have stagnated, then declined, even though the overall economy has grown. In addition, avenues to social mobility have dried up. Funding for public universities has plummeted, and costs have skyrocketed compared to working-class incomes. The number of professional and white collar jobs has grown only slowly, and those positions are increasingly taken by the children of well-to-do parents who can provide superior pre-school, private, and college educations, connections that lead to valuable internships, and pathways to top jobs. A 2015 Pew study of social mobility in the U.S. states that “the United States is very immobile. The persistence of advantage is especially large among those raised in the middle to upper reaches of the income distribution.”
As the American Dream is what legitimized the high level of inequality and the position of elites in the eyes of the average working family, the erosion of that dream has undermined the legitimacy of today’s elites. Instead, a substantial number of Americans want to “take down” the selfish and privileged elites that they see running Washington D.C. and betraying them. These people responded with wild enthusiasm to Donald Trump’s promise to “drain the swamp.”
In sum, the income patterns in America over the last 15 years made it inevitable that sooner or later an uprising would occur against the ruling establishment . Whether it drew from the left (Bernie Sanders’ supporters) or the right (Trump’s supporters) or both, an anti-elite movement was going to gain traction. Yes, there are bigots, racists, sexual aggressors and xenophobes among Trump supporters, given that Trump himself has shown these characteristics in his speeches and actions. But these are not the groups that pushed Trump to the Presidency. If not Trump, it would have been another populist who, sooner or later, would have overcome an opponent from the hated elites.
Throughout history, whenever selfish elites monopolize economic growth and produce a polarization of incomes, the result is a loss of legitimacy and the rise of insurgent movements to overturn the social order that is no longer providing expected routine benefits. Since the 1990s, the U.S. has been repeating these conditions. The surprise should not be that Donald Trump (or someone like him) was elected president. The surprise should be: Why did it take so long?

9568,"James Comey Testimony Proves Trump Right, CNN Wrong - Breitbart","The prepared written testimony that former FBI Director James Comey is set to deliver on Thursday morning vindicates President Donald Trump’s claim that he was told three times that he was not under investigation. [At the same time, the Comey testimony refutes reports by CNN and other outlets that Comey would dispute that claim.  When Trump fired Comey, he wrote: “While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau. ” As Zero Hedge noted Wednesday, CNN reported on Tuesday that Comey was “expected to refute Trump. ” Citing an anonymous source, CNN reported that “Comey is expected to explain to senators that those were much more nuanced conversations from which Trump concluded that he was not under investigation. ” Zero Hedge adds that CNN’s chief political analyst Gloria Borger, said: “Comey is going to dispute the president on this point if he’s asked about it by senators, and we have to assume that he will be. He will say he never assured Donald Trump that he was not under investigation, that that would have been improper for him to do so. ” However, Comey acknowledges in his prepared testimony that he did, in fact, tell Trump three times that he was not under investigation: once in a meeting at Trump Tower on January 6 a second time during a dinner on January 27 (which CNN says was “more nuanced”) and a third time during a telephone conversation on March 30. On a fourth occasion, in a phone call on April 11, the president said that he was not under investigation, and was not corrected. CNN has now added a correction to the top of its story: CORRECTION AND UPDATE: This article was published before Comey released his prepared opening statement. The article and headline have been corrected to reflect that Comey does not directly dispute that Trump was told multiple times he was not under investigation in his prepared testimony released after this story was published. Corey’s written testimony contradicts Trump’s account of events in one respect  —   namely, that Trump asked Comey for his “loyalty. ” However, Comey’s prepared remarks add a new revelation, which is that Comey agreed to provide “honest loyalty. ” He speculates that it is possible that he had a different understanding of that phrase than the president did.

9569,Fentanyl Outpaces Heroin as the Deadliest Drug on Long Island - The New York Times,"An anesthetic commonly used for surgery has surpassed heroin to become the deadliest drug on Long Island, killing at least 220 people there in 2016, according to medical examiners’ records. The drug, fentanyl, is a synthetic opioid, which can be 100 times more potent than morphine. The numbers from Long Island are part of a national pattern, as fentanyl fatalities have already surpassed those from heroin in other parts of the country, including New England, as its use has skyrocketed. Part of the reason for the increase is economic  —   because fentanyl can be manufactured in the lab, it is much cheaper and easier than cultivating heroin. In New York City, more than 1, 000 people are expected to die from drug overdoses this year  —   the first recorded   death total in city history, according to statistics compiled by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Nearly half of all unintentional drug overdose deaths in the city since July have involved fentanyl, the health department said. The medical examiners of Long Island’s two counties, Nassau and Suffolk, compiled the new numbers. “Fentanyl has surpassed heroin as the most commonly detected drug in fatal opioid overdoses,” Dr. Michael J. Caplan, the Suffolk County medical examiner, said in a written statement about the statistics, which were obtained by The New York Times ahead of their release. “The influx of illicitly manufactured fentanyl from overseas is a nationwide issue that requires a multidisciplinary intervention from all levels of government. ” Nationwide, recorded deaths from opioids surpassed 30, 000 in 2015, according to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And overdoses caused by synthetic opioids like fentanyl increased by 72. 2 percent in 2015 over 2014  —   one of the deadliest    surges for any drug in United States history, the same data shows. As recently as three years ago, few people outside the medical profession or law enforcement had even heard of fentanyl, which is legally prescribed in the form of transdermal patches or lozenges. But drug dealers have been lacing heroin with fentanyl for years, just to fill out the packets and save on the heroin  —   with or without the user’s knowledge. At the same time, many drug users seek out fentanyl because it gives them a higher high and the thrill of using something so risky, although often they do not know exactly what they are shooting up. In a statement responding to the overdose data, James J. Hunt, special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s New York Division, said that seizures of fentanyl had increased drastically in the last five years. “Not only are drug traffickers mixing it with heroin for street distribution,” he said, “but drug suppliers are sending it in bulk form for resellers to sell in pill form or in bulk powder. ” Prescription fentanyl is used to treat cancer pain and as an anesthetic for surgery. Even small amounts of it can be deadly. The drug is so powerful that law enforcement officers have to wear gloves when searching for it, as just a tiny bit can get into the skin and, depending on the amount, can be fatal. On Long Island, America’s most densely populated suburban region, opioids of all kinds killed at least 464 people in 2016, the medical examiners’ records show. Hundreds of additional drug overdose analyses are pending. “Too many young people have fallen victim,” the Nassau County executive, Edward Mangano, said of the new data in a written statement. The Nassau County medical examiner, Dr. Tamara Bloom, did not comment on the new numbers. In New York City, as of June, there were 184   overdose deaths recorded  —   more than in all of 2015, health department records show. Since then, the number of fatal 2016 overdoses involving fentanyl has surged to about 500, according to the department data. Fentanyl is increasingly being manufactured by Mexican drug cartels, according to the D. E. A. or is cooked up in labs in the United States. It is being sold by dealers in New York City and on Long Island, according to Mr. Hunt, the D. E. A. special agent. Some users who purchase it believe they are actually buying prescription pain pills like oxycodone or hydrocodone, or heroin alone  —   drugs far less potent than fentanyl. A user can fatally overdose within moments of snorting, injecting or swallowing the drug, authorities said.",0
9570,German Court Rejects Effort to Ban Neo-Nazi Party - The New York Times,"BERLIN  —   Germany’s highest court rejected on Tuesday an attempt to ban the National Democratic Party, the country’s oldest   political organization, finding that it did not pose a danger to democracy even though its principles violate the Constitution. The ruling by the Federal Constitutional Court came after years of deliberation and at a time of   in the country, where another   party, Alternative for Germany, is poised to win representation in Parliament in national elections this year. Although the National Democratic Party “pursues aims contrary to the Constitution,” there was a lack of “concrete supporting evidence” that the   party would be able to successfully achieve its goals and to pose a genuine threat, said Andreas Vosskuhle, the president of the court. “That a party has aims that run contrary to the Constitution is not sufficient grounds for banning a party,” he said. Germany’s 16 states submitted a petition in 2013 to ban the party, citing its racist,   agenda, but the law that allows a party to be banned is not based on “sympathies or worldview,” but on evidence of a specific threat to the Constitution, he said. Germany has strict laws on banning political parties, and only two have been outlawed since the defeat of the Nazis at the end of World War II  —   the   Socialist Reich Party, in 1952, and the German Communist Party, in 1956. A 2003 attempt to ban the National Democratic Party also failed, after the court found that paid informants in the party were partly responsible for evidence the government used. Over the past decade, the party has continued to lose popularity, with many of its members switching to Alternative for Germany. That party was founded in 2013 on an   agenda, but it has attracted followers after emerging as a prominent voice against Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision to allow nearly one million refugees into the country since summer 2015. Although the influx has slowed, the issue remains a political point of contention. In September, voters ejected the National Democratic Party from the legislature in   the last state in which it had seats. Other than Udo Voigt, a member of the European Parliament, the party is now represented only at the local level. The eight judges of the court cited the party’s lack of playing a significant role in the political landscape as a reason for their decision not to ban it. “In more than five decades that it has existed, the National Democratic Party has not been able to achieve lasting representation in a state legislature,” Mr. Vosskuhle said, reading from the   ruling. “There are no indications that this will change in the future. ” At the height of its popularity, the party narrowly missed winning seats in the West German Parliament and was represented in seven of the country’s 11 state legislatures. Since German reunification in 1990, the party has been strongest in states of the former East Germany. The ruling means the   party remains eligible under German law for financial support from the government, drawn from taxpayers, one of the arguments for the attempt to ban it. Mr. Vosskuhle acknowledged this point, suggesting the idea of changing the Constitution to restrict funding from parties that are recognized as violating Germany’s democratic principles. On Tuesday, however, the party celebrated the ruling, with its leader, Frank Franz, posting on the party’s Facebook page, “  winner against an attempt to be outlawed. ” Thomas de Maizière, Germany’s interior minister, said that despite the ruling, he supported keeping the party under observation by the domestic intelligence services, a move that he credited for keeping the party from posing a substantial threat. But the ruling also earned criticism, especially from Jewish groups such as the World Jewish Congress, which expressed “disappointment” and “dismay” at the court’s ruling. “This sends the wrong signal, all the more so as the court made it very clear that the NPD indeed strives to overthrow the democratic order and shares many of the aims of Hitler’s Nazi Party,” said Ronald S. Lauder, the group’s president.",0

9572,"Ryan Lochte, ’12 Olympic Champion, Misses Rio Cut in 400 I.M. - The New York Times","OMAHA  —   Ryan Lochte was off to a rough start at the United States Olympic trials even before he climbed on the blocks Sunday night for the second step in his defense of his Olympic gold medal in the   individual medley. The nonstop American Airlines flight that Lochte and his SwimMAC teammates had taken from North Carolina had encountered   problems. The plane flew below 10, 000 feet for several minutes before the pilots made an emergency landing in Kansas City, Mo. Instead of arriving here Thursday at 3 p. m. Lochte and his teammates pulled into their downtown hotel in two vans around midnight. It made for a long traveling day but provided perfect preparation for the inconveniences that the swimmers are likely to encounter if they qualify for the Games in Rio de Janeiro. Lochte, 31, a   Olympian and   medalist who had the world’s   time last year in the   individual medley, had not planned to defend his 400 I. M. title. He figured his winning effort at the London Games of 4 minutes 5. 18 seconds, the   time in history, was a fitting finale. Like shoveling snow, the 400 I. M. is a physically taxing activity best left to the youth. The proof was in the composition of the field Sunday at CenturyLink Center. The 94 men averaged 19. 5 years old. The youngest was    Carson Foster, who finished 43rd in the heats. The oldest, by two years, was Lochte, who qualified second in the first step of his title defense. He finished   of a second behind the preliminaries pacesetter, Chase Kalisz, whom Lochte afterward described as “a young buck. ” Kalisz, 22, has trained for the past several years, most recently at Arizona State, with Michael Phelps, the only swimmer to have finished faster than Lochte in the event. Lochte channeled Phelps in the first half of the final, taking the butterfly out fast and extending his lead on the backstroke leg. But Kalisz made his move on the third leg, bettering Lochte by more than four seconds in the breaststroke, and won going away in 4:09. 54. Jay Litherland, 20, from Georgia, passed a fading Lochte on the freestyle leg to secure the second and final Olympic berth with a personal best of 4:11. 02. Lochte was third in 4:12. 02. “We’re going to have our two best guys in that event in the Olympics representing the U. S. A. ,” said Lochte, who revealed that he had pulled his groin muscle on the breaststroke leg of his morning race. He said the injury had forced him to start hard in the final with the hope he could build an unbeatable lead by the time he got to the breaststroke leg, where the injury rendered his kick ineffectual. Lochte never considered skipping the final, he said. At his age, he was perhaps tempting fate in swimming the race at all. “I’m sure someone in their 30s could do it if they could get the motivation to do the training, but that’s tough,” said Kalisz’s coach, Bob Bowman. He added, “There’s only so long you can sustain that kind of work. ” Kalisz’s time was the second best in the world this year, behind Kosuke Hagino’s 4:08. 85. Hagino and a fellow Japanese swimmer, Daiya Seto, who has clocked a 4:10. 53, had pushed Lochte to enter the event. David Marsh, who coaches Lochte at SwimMAC in Charlotte, N. C. appealed to Lochte’s patriotism, telling him that if he was the best swimmer to have on the blocks for the United States, then he ought to swim. Generation Next had other ideas, and when its leader, Kalisz, climbed out of the water, Phelps was on the deck to hug him  —   twice. “He told me he was proud of me, and it was a very emotional moment,” Kalisz said. “Michael has been like an older brother to me that I never had, and he’s been the one guy that I have looked up to my entire life. ” Phelps, who turns 31 this week, had qualified to compete in the 400 I. M. at the Olympics three times, doing so in 2012 despite a training regimen that was less than diligent. He finished fourth at the London Games with a time more than five seconds slower than his winning effort of 2008. When Lochte mentioned to him this year that he was thinking about taking the 400 I. M. out of mothballs and adding it to his trials program, Phelps was blunt, he said. “I just said to him, ‘If you’re going to swim it, you better train because you can’t do it without it trust me,’” Phelps said Saturday. He added, “There’s no way to hide in that race. ” Phelps’s words proved prophetic. “I did everything I could in that race,” Lochte said. “It just wasn’t enough. Just got to forget about it. ” How will his injury affect his performance the rest of the week? “I don’t know,” Lochte said. “I’m just going to have to keep working on it, and hopefully it gets better. ”",0

Russia is to probe samples of the substance fired by militants. 2 killed, 37 injured in ‘poisonous substance’ attack on Aleppo – Russian MoD 
“Militants who have been striving in the past days to break though the Syrian Army’s exterior defense ring of Aleppo at any cost have used toxic substances multiple times,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said Thursday, as cited by RIA Novosti. 
He added that the analysis of the samples retrieved by the Russian experts in the area will be carried out in Russia at a laboratory accredited by the chemical watchdog OPCW. 
“Experts of the Russian Defense Ministry are equipped with all the necessary technical means of carrying out an express analysis, filtering and delivering samples to the Russian Federation,”Konashenkov said, adding that those “will be analyzed at the laboratory of chemical-analytical control at the Scientific Center of the Troops of Radiological, Chemical and Biological Defense that is accredited by the Organization for the Prohibition of the Chemical Weapons (OPCW).” 
The spokesman also noted that Russia has not been hitting any targets in Aleppo for 18 days, thus “fully complying with the moratorium on any actions in the area around Aleppo.” 2 killed, 37 injured in ‘poisonous substance’ attack on Aleppo – Russian MoD At least two Syrian military personnel were killed and 37 civilians injured in a terrorist attack that struck the government-controlled areas of Aleppo, in which the militants used toxic substances, Russia’s center for reconciliation in Syria reported. 
“ Illegal armed groups fired homemade shells fitted with poisonous substances against the Dahiyat Al-Assad and Al-Hamdaniya districts in Aleppo ” on Sunday, Russia’s Defense Ministry reported. 
The attack was first reported by Syrian media, who said at least 15 people experienced severe breathing problems following the assault. 
A local doctor told RT that the symptoms among the injured pointed to the use of highly toxic chlorine gas. 
On Monday, human rights NGO Amnesty International said it was investigating the incident, which it said could amount to “a war crime.” 
“ What we saw in the videos is symptoms of some kind of an alleged chemical attack, ” Amnesty International Syria researcher Diana Semaan told RT. The organization blamed the armed Syrian opposition for the attack on western Aleppo.

The alleged chemical attack was launched amid a major offensive by the militants against government forces in Aleppo. Rebels from various groups are taking part in the assault, including those fighting under the FSA (Free Syrian Army) banner and Islamist militants. 
In the course of 24 hours, the rebels conducted 58 shelling attacks on government-controlled regions in Syria. Aleppo has come under fire 29 times, according to the reconciliation center data. Related Posts:",0
9574,"‘Cork Dork’ Sniffs, Swills and Spits Through the World of Wine Experts - The New York Times","CORK DORKA   Adventure Among the Obsessive Sommeliers, Big Bottle Hunters, and Rogue Scientists Who Taught Me to Live for TasteBy Bianca Bosker329 pages. Penguin Books. $17. Some people shuffle paper for their jobs. Sommeliers lick rocks. Well, not all sommeliers. But a number of them do, if they’re desperate enough to want to know the difference between the taste of blue slate and that of red. Some forgo brushing their teeth in the morning, or drinking hot beverages, or using perfume, scented laundry detergent, extra salt. Their palates  —   and their noses  —   are their instruments. Who would risk blistering or blunting them? Would a violinist leave her Stradivarius in a locked trunk on a sweltering day? She would not. Bianca Bosker’s “Cork Dork: A   Adventure Among the Obsessive Sommeliers, Big Bottle Hunters, and Rogue Scientists Who Taught Me to Live for Taste” is a compendium of bewitching and sometimes disgusting facts. (There’s an art to spitting, apparently.) Do ignore the subtitle, which is filled with about as many additives as your average plonk, and every bit as cloying. It’s deceptive. Bosker’s journey into this sodden universe is thrilling, and she tells her story with gonzo élan. I’m not one to let blurbers, often   into service by authors or publishers, do my work. But when the sommelier and blogger Madeline Puckette writes that this book is the “Kitchen Confidential” of the wine world, she’s not wrong, though Bill Buford’s “Heat” is probably a shade closer to this book’s sensibility and heart. “Cork Dork” is likely to find a large audience. The real miracle is that Bosker was sober enough to write it. “Most days,” she explains, “I was drunk by noon, hung over by 2 p. m. and, around 4 in the afternoon, deeply regretting the burger I’d devoured for lunch. ” Bosker was the technology editor of The Huffington Post when she heard about the World’s Best Sommelier Competition. She   videos. She marveled. She decided to change her life. For 18 months, she shadowed renowned wine fanatics, hoping to understand their obsession and to become a certified sommelier herself. The goal was more foolhardy than she knew. Sommeliers, at least in her hometown (New York) are a diehard lot. They’re best described as punctilious sybarites  —   “the most masochistic hedonists I’d ever met,” as Bosker writes. They spend evenings on their feet. During the day, they practice the arcane rituals of wine service, ingest a magnum of wine esoterica and, if they’re aspiring to become master sommeliers, sample more than 20, 000 kinds of wine so that they can make such blind declarations as: “This is a   blend from the right bank of Bordeaux from the village of   in the 2010 vintage of Grand Cru Classé quality. ” That’s a direct quote, by the way. It comes from Bosker’s friend  —   and Sherpa  —   Morgan Harris, a precocious, brassily opinionated sommelier at New York’s Aureole. He and other expert tasters are expected to become the Alan Turings of wine, deciphering flavors as if the Battle of the Atlantic depended on it. Bosker had exactly no experience in this field. But because she’s possessed of a jolly hubris, she manages to wheedle and bluff her way into a series of jobs for which she isn’t remotely qualified, and then to muscle her way into the most elite   group in Manhattan  —   which would be like me deciding I wanted to brush up on my baseball skills by joining the Yankees for spring training. She gets a quick, boozy education, and so do we. About how to decant properly, which is as difficult as sinking a hole in one. About how to serve, which involves more rules than cricket. (Whatever you do, do not show customers the back of your hand.) She gives great gossip. While trailing a “somm” at Marea, an upscale Manhattan restaurant, Bosker learns that management keeps SparkNotes on its 1 percenter clientele. They’re a confetti of acronyms, the most devastating of which is HWC, or “Handle With Care. ” (At other restaurants, it’s SOE, or “Sense of Entitlement. ” Ow.) Readers also get a feel for restaurant economics from “Cork Dork,” and this much is clear: Sommeliers are secret weapons, capable of adding extra zeros to the bottom line. They’ve mastered the fine art of the upsell, sometimes based on the semiotics of customer clothing and accessories alone. Is Dad wearing a $50, 000 Patek Philippe watch? Do not give him a bottle of Pinot Grigio if the most expensive one on your list is only $80. “YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED,” Harris booms. (Steer him toward a $270 bottle of Chablis grand cru instead.) I’d say that Harris deserves his own reality show, but in a sense, he already has one, as do some of the other somms that Bosker follows. They’re on the Esquire Network’s “Uncorked. ” It felt a bit dishonest of the author not to reveal it. And while I appreciated her bravado, I grew similarly queasy, as time wore on, with how she would congratulate herself for   her way into an event she had no business attending. Did she promise the organizers publicity in her book? A magazine article? Too often, she doesn’t say. On occasion, Bosker radiates youthful   maybe a touch of naïveté. But she is, in the main, great company as a narrator  —   witty, generous, democratic. She devotes many pages to singing the praises of taste and smell, which philosophers throughout the ages have considered the baser senses, and shows how just about any of us can sharpen them. She’s suspicious, as any good journalist should be, of cant  —   she’s a decanter!  —   and interrogates at length whether the florid language of the sommelier (“notes of vanilla, cassis and saddle leather”) is useful or even authentic. She shows up at one of her fancy tasting groups with a plastic cup of chervil and asks everyone to give it a sniff. They can’t identify it  —   even though they regularly claim to detect hints of the herb in what they drink. Eventually, she interrogates the entire notion of wine expertise, which in turn raises the biggest question of all: What does make a wine great? Especially if, as one damning study found, most judges in a California wine competition gave contradictory ratings to the same bottle of wine every time they tasted it? And if a wine economist explains that there’s little correlation between quality and cost once a bottle exceeds $50 or $60? (“After that,” Bosker writes, “brand, reputation and scarcity start to nudge up a bottle’s cost. ”) Bosker ultimately arrives at her own kind of homespun answer to what makes a wine special. It accommodates tastes high and low, and she’s still certainly capable of enjoying three different vintages of the fabled Château d’Yquem. “It tasted like the sun,” she writes. “It tasted like an experience that would never repeat itself. ”",0

Skip the “thank you for your service.” Let’s talk about what veterans really need. 
Veterans Day is Friday, and strangers who learn that I served seven years on active duty in the U.S. Army will inevitably thank me for my service. While some people believe that veterans deserve lifelong gratitude for their role protecting our country, more than a few of us find it annoying; an empty platitude that civilians use to absolve themselves from asking what exactly we sacrificed, or what we truly need now. 
What post-9/11 veterans need are good jobs, with good benefits. They need employers who don’t thoughtlessly cut-and-paste job prerequisites that favor someone who spent four years partying at a state university over a vet who was waking up at 6 a.m. and wearing a uniform during 60-hour workweeks, except for when they were in combat.

Representative Nydia Velazquez ( ) would change that. She introduced a bill Thursday that would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to prohibit immigration officers and agents from wearing clothing with the word “police” on it. According to the Los Angeles Times, officials and open borders advocates in the California city are leading an effort to halt the practice of ICE officials quickly identifying themselves as police. The mayor of LA, Eric Garcetti, City Attorney Mike Feuer, and City Council President Herb Wesson penned a letter to the directors of ICE and the ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Division “to urge in the strongest possible terms that ICE immediately cease this practice in our city. ” The officials sent a copy of the letter to U. S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. The Times reported that the officials used the   justification that “the city’s immigrant communities are living in heightened fear of deportation and detention, and that such practices only discourage people from reporting crimes. ” These city officials do not contend that the practice is illegal. Rep. Velazquez calls the practice “completely unconscionable,” and the bill would apply to agents and officers with U. S.

She also charges that “hate crimes and hate rhetoric have increased since Donald Trump made it to the White House” and counters  —   “You didn’t see that when Obama was in the White House. ” The Post reported that officials in the sanctuary city of Hartford, Connecticut, have also jumped on board to prohibit ICE officers and agents from identifying themselves as law enforcement. The police chief from Hartford issued a statement that said, “ICE agents should not identify as local police as it is misleading and can damage the important relationship with local communities. ” Harford Mayor Luke Bronin said, “our police and other public safety officers need to foster a relationship of trust with all our residents. ” He argues, “Our police officers have worked hard to build that trust, and for ICE agents to present themselves as local police will undermine the hard work our department has done. ” Mayor Bronin contends “We follow all state and federal laws, and we will partner with anyone to help get violent criminals off the streets. But federal agents should not be creating the impression that they are local police. ” News8 in Connecticut reports that Hartford sees itself as a “sanctuary city” and prohibits the local police or city agencies from collecting “immigration information. ” The Immigrant Defense Project and the Educational Alliance support Velazquez’ bill. The Times also reported that the Council on   Relations (CAIR) Service Employees International Union, Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the Central American Legal Assistance all champion the bill. Reps. Luis V. Gutierrez ( ) and Juan Vargas ( ) and other Democrats in Congress have also endorsed the bill, it reports.

9577,How To Live After Trump,"Before Trump’s glorious victory over the forces of progressive darkness, I promised that I would provide a roadmap on what traditional men could do next to usher in a return of the patriarchy. If Hillary had prevailed, the roadmap would have been a grim one, as all of our work would have had to take place underground. Happily, we will be able to work in the open. Here are three ways that we can leverage Trump’s victory to bring back the patriarchy.
Rule yourself Bruce Wayne is a good role model for traditional men: Urbane, fit, financially independent—and dangerous.
This may seem obvious, but if we are going to bring back the patriarchy, we have to be men who are worthy of it. A patriarch who relies solely on the fact that he is a man will quickly be overthrown. However, a man who has authority because he has earned it by the way he lives will naturally retain it. Thus, the first step in making progress under a Trump administration is the same as it would have been if Hillary had been elected—self-improvement.
Self-improvement involves the obvious things: getting in shape, training martial arts, getting rid of addictions, and exercising self-discipline. The process of self-improvement needs to be under-girded with a philosophy of life. For most men, this will involve adopting, and faithfully living, one of the faith-traditions. For others, it may mean adopting stoic philosophy. Whatever it is, it will have to be more substantial than the degenerate, “pleasure, wealth, and power at any cost” morality of our Spirit Cooking elites—lack of morality got us into this problem in the first place.
Self-improvement also involves moving in the direction of financial independence. Under a Trump administration, this last goal will become easier to achieve. Trump’s tax plan cuts tax rates across the board. This will especially benefit men who are in the middle class who are trying to generate more income. They will be able to keep their savings so that they can move ahead rather than paying a penalty that keeps them from becoming wealthy.
Trump’s emphasis on fair trade will also result in more American jobs and unleash unprecedented creativity. The age of Trump will be a great time to start a new business. One word of warning is in order though: Under Trump the US is likely to flourish in a way that hasn’t happened since the the 1920s. Enjoy the prosperity but don’t get caught back in the materialism merry-go-round. Our goal is a lifetime of financial independence, not conspicuous consumption.
Financial independence is an important practical consideration because you will need a firm financial foundation for the second step, which is ruling your family.
Rule your family Be the patriarch.
Starting with the boomers, our society rejected the traditional way of life and adopted progressivism. Families got smaller, divorce became more common, promiscuity increased, feminism became the default philosophy for girls, and the remaining vestiges of the patriarchy vanished. Progressivism promised freedom but delivered enslavement to political correctness and globalism.
A Trump administration will do little to reverse the deleterious effects that progressivism has had on the family. At best, the only thing government can do for the family is encourage it financially and provide a safe environment for it. But real change has to come from the bottom up—from men and women who return to tradition. For us, that means finding a traditional woman, or more likely one who can be converted to tradition, getting married, and having lots of children. A Twitter shitlord ( @johnrandom1234 ) drove home this point in a humorous way by suggesting with a four-step “Trump Bump” starter kit:




Getting married, having children, and raising them to hold to the patriarchy is the long game, but it is the only way we will have long term victory. Without a next generation of traditional men, any ground that we gain under Trump will soon be lost.
Rule society—bring back the patriarchy Benjamin Franklin is a great example of a man who was serious about his civic duty.
The next thing that we must do is start reclaiming our institutions. Trump has captured the presidency and Republicans control Congress, but many of those Republicans are cucks who will oppose the Trumpian agenda. And our other institutions are still dominated by leftists. Hollywood, the news media, education, and corporations all proclaim the progressive, anti-patriarchy message. If we don’t take advantage of the current moment, any gains that Trump makes will be quickly rolled-back after he leaves office.
Therefore, we need to start re-engaging with these institutions to shift them towards Patriarchal Nationalism . You can share any ideas you have to do this in the comments. Here, I’d like to suggest that one institution that needs our participation: the Republican Party. Trump has created many allies within the GOP but the majority of the Party still holds to the cucked ideology of open borders and bad trade deals like NAFTA. The GOP desperately needs like-minded men within its ranks who will help Trump achieve his vision.
Getting involved in your local GOP is easy. You merely have to get in touch with your local party leadership in your district. You don’t have to run for elected office. Simply volunteer your time in getting local officials elected, voting for delegates, or attending GOP events. Go in with a respectful attitude. A lot of the local GOP leaders are good people who still don’t understand that the real battle is against globalists. Work for incremental change. And, if you have the disposition required for it, consider running for local office yourself.
One piece of advice: If you do choose to get involved in politics, don’t get caught up in it. One way we ended up with an ossified and out-of-touch GOP is that people started to hold the globalist neoconservatism with an almost religious fervor. The other trap is to use politics as a way of enriching oneself in the manner of Hillary Clinton. If you do choose to enter the political realm, resolve at the outset to not use it for your own financial gain. Don’t make politics your life. Think of it strictly as civic duty.
Of course, politics is not everybody’s cup of tea. The key is to use your gifts, whether that is in movie-making or in running a company, to help create an environment where the patriarchy can flourish.
Conclusion The one thing we must not do in wake of the Trump victory is rest on our laurels. If Hillary had won, we’d all have a great sense of urgency to protect what little remained of our way of life. Now that Trump is coming into power, the temptation is to relax—to just let Trump do it all. This temptation must be avoided. We must capitalize on the Trump victory with the same high level of urgency that we would have regarded a Hillary victory. If we don’t, we run the risk of losing all the ground we have gained.

On The News Line – US, Russia on road to final collision 

Nov 4, 2016 
These are some of the headlines we are tracking for you in this episode of On the News Line: 
1. US Russia on a collision course 
Tensions between the US and Russia: their relation has hit such a low, that it’s beyond a Cold War. US presidential hopeful Hilary Clinton has pledged to set up a no-fly zone in Syria. The Russian Ministry of Defense has warned that there may be no time for any hot-line discussions with the Americans about stealth aircraft or incoming missiles. No time for talks, meaning anything in the air will be shot down, bringing the two nuclear powered nations ever closer to a confrontation. 
2. Lebanon’s new face 
The power vacuum in Lebanon has ended with the election of the leader of the Christian Free Patriotic Movement party as president. Michel Aoun secured the votes of 83 out of 127 MPs at parliament, capping a political impasse which dragged on for over two years. Aoun is a strong ally of Lebanon’s resistance movement Hezbollah and his election is seen as a disappointment for Israel and Saudi Arabia, two enemies of what is known as the axis of resistance of which Hezbollah is a main pillar. Aoun was earlier endorsed by leader of the pro-Saudi political party March 14 Saad Hariri. 
3. Yemen heading for partition 
No end is in sight for the crisis in Yemen : The country’s former president Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi has said ‘no’ to a peace proposal put forward by Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, the UN special envoy for Yemen. The details of the plan have not been made public, but according to some sources, it gives Yemen’s Ansarullah movement and its allies a share in the country’s future government. The serious disagreement between forces loyal to Hadi and the Ansarullah movement has sparked fears over Yemen’s possible partition. Two parallel institutions in Sana’a and Aden are in the making which may end up partitioning of the country. 

Israel plans to build new settler units in east al-Quds 
Nov 2, 2016 – Israeli authorities say a municipal building-permit sub-committee has approved technical details of plans in the Gilo area. They say more detailed building permits will be required before the settler units are built. The project was first approved in 20-12 and Wednesday’s approvals have been seen as open defiance of international calls to stop settlement expansion on the occupied Palestinian territories. All Israeli settlements are illegal under international law. 
Israel destroys Bedouin village for 105th time 
Brave people fighting with occupation 
Nov 2, 2016 – A Palestinian Bedouin village has been demolished by Israeli forces, and it’s not the first time. 
For the 105th time, Araqib village in the Negev desert was destroyed by Israeli bulldozers backed by troops. According to Israeli police, a number of buildings were demolished. Palestinians say Israelis confiscated vehicles and possessions of residents of the village. The first demolition of Araqib took place in 20-10. There are approximately 160 thousand Bedouins residing in the occupied territories. Authorities have repeatedly refused to connect Bedouin villages to the national water and electricity grids. Rights groups claim that the Israeli policy to destroy Bedouin villages is aimed at removing the indigenous Palestinian population to make room for the expansion of Israeli communities. 

The Baltics watch 
Some background: the Baltic republics lost about 50% of their population and 90% of their industries built by the USSR after they got occupied by the West in the 1990s. Due to the Russia’s countersanctions they have lost about 85% of their trade with Russia and stand to lose the rest in the next two years. Mostly, what’s left it’s income from the use of the Baltic ports for oil and coal transfer. The Baltic republics run by pro-fascist governments and deliberately violate every human right of their ethnic Russian population.

How Hitler Became Hitler and Why It’s Important Today , by Igor SHUMEYKO 

The US deliberately provoked the USSR into cancelling the summit conference in May 1960 in Paris where the USSR offered a peace treaty for a united and neutral Germany, for Germany without NATO and the US occupation. 

How the US military industrial complex survived disarmament 
In 1959, the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev called at the United Nations for an end of the arms race and for an end of nuclear testing. The atmosphere was poisoned by radioactive particles. And he offered a peace treaty for a united and neutral Germany. These proposals should be discussed and concluded at a summit conference in May 1960 in Paris by the victorious Allies of War World II. The US government and the “military-industrial complex” were against this offer. An end of the Cold War would have shaken their supremacy. How did they manage to bring about the failure the summit? There is an official version, and a story that is told the first time in this documentary. 
According to official history, the Summit in Paris failed because of Krushchev´s anger. Related to the U-2-incident, that spy plane of the CIA. According to the official history, the Soviets alone are responsible for the division of Germany. The official history denies the existence of nuclear tests in Patagonia, invents an „heroic kidnapping“ of a Nazi War Criminal by Israeli agents and describes the earthquake in Chile as a natural event. 
A true “intelligence fabric” had been built around the Summit conference by the CIA and the Pentagon, consisting of several provocations: Shortly before the summit, a U-2 spy plane violated Russian airspace – at an altitude that made it impossible for the Soviet air defense not to detect it. While Eisenhower was staying at the disarmament summit, his generals arrived in Argentina with four aircraft carriers – full of nuclear explosives. They wanted to conduct nuclear tests, said the newspaper. These tests however were at that time prohibited by the US-Soviet moratorium and by the US Atomic Energy Law. During the summit, the CIA took Russian hostages. 
But the US nuclear tests in Argentina ended in catastrophe. Thousands of people died. They had to cover up everything. But in the archives of the US, Germany, Argentina and even the Catholic Cathedral are still documents that show what really happened. 
Brief history of the modern Russian Special Forces Spetsnaz Army FSB ФСБ Centre 2013 Documentary (English Subtitles) 
The FSB is mainly responsible for internal security of the Russian state, counterespionage, and the fight against organized crime, terrorism, and drug smuggling. Since 2003, when the Federal Border Guards Service was incorporated to the FSB, it has also been responsible for overseeing border security.[1] The FSB is engaged mostly in domestic affairs, while espionage duties are responsibility of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service. However, the FSB also includes the FAPSI agency, which conducts electronic surveillance abroad. All law enforcement and intelligence agencies in Russia work under the guidance of FSB, if needed. 
The FSB combines functions and powers similar to those exercised by the United States FBI National Security Branch, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Federal Protective Service, the National Security Agency (NSA), U.S. Customs and Border Protection, United States Coast Guard, and partly the Drug Enforcement Administration. The FSB employs about 66,200 uniformed staff, including about 4,000 special forces troops. It also employs about 160,000–200,000 border guards

9580,"In Second Debate, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton Spar in Bitter, Personal Terms - The New York Times","Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton collided in an almost unremittingly hostile debate on Sunday night, a   spectacle of character attacks, tawdry allegations, and Mr. Trump’s startling accusation that Mrs. Clinton had “tremendous hate in her heart. ” In a remarkable political maneuver, Mr. Trump said Mrs. Clinton had smeared women who accused her husband, Bill Clinton, of sexually assaulting or harassing them, seeking to salvage his presidential candidacy after explosive reports about his past lewd comments about women. Tense at first, and then increasingly angry as he grew more comfortable on the attack, Mr. Trump noted that three of Mr. Clinton’s accusers were sitting in the audience. It was one of several moments when Mr. Trump aimed to energize his most conservative supporters and drive a wedge between them and the elected Republican officials who have been abandoning him. He even threatened that if it were up to him, Mrs. Clinton would “be in jail” for her use of a private email server as secretary of state. Both candidates were visibly uneasy throughout the debate, even refusing to shake hands at the beginning, as the town hall event unfolded on a small stage in a highly charged atmosphere. It was a deeply ugly moment in American politics, featuring the sort of personal invective rarely displayed by those who aspire to lead the nation. “Bill Clinton was abusive to women. Hillary Clinton attacked those same women  —   attacked them viciously,” Mr. Trump said, arguing that the accusations against Mr. Clinton were “far worse” than Mr. Trump’s own remarks in 2005 that he could grope women because he was “a star. ” Mr. Trump apologized for those comments but also repeatedly minimized them as “  talk,” and even tried to blame Mrs. Clinton for raising them in light of Mr. Clinton’s behavior. “She brings up words that I said 11 years ago  —   I think it’s disgraceful, and she should be ashamed of herself, to tell you the truth,” Mr. Trump said to scattered applause. Mrs. Clinton did not specifically rebut his charges about her husband, saying only, “So much of what he just said is not right. ” Instead, she broadened her indictment of Mr. Trump beyond the 2005 recording, assailing him for refusing to show contrition for his many inflammatory statements. “He never apologizes to anybody for anything,” Mrs. Clinton said. She unfurled a litany of his provocations, including his mocking a Gold Star family, accusing a Hispanic judge of being biased by virtue of his ethnicity, ridiculing a reporter who has a disability, and falsely claiming that President Obama was not born in America. “Yes, this is who Donald Trump is,” Mrs. Clinton said about his 2005 remarks. “The question for us, the question our country must answer, is that this is not who we are. ” After a tumultuous political weekend, the debate was watched extremely closely by Republican members of Congress, who are deciding whether to join dozens of elected officials who have broken away from the party’s nominee. Mr. Trump’s performance was   enough that no more Republican officials disavowed him in the immediate aftermath of the debate, and it prompted his running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, to assure him via Twitter he would remain on the ticket after Mr. Trump’s “big debate win. ” Mr. Trump’s attacks on the Clintons  —   including a promise that, as president, he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Mrs. Clinton’s email practices  —   were striking even in a presidential campaign that has often seemed like a race to the bottom because of Mr. Trump’s    assaults on his rivals. But no single answer by Mr. Trump seemed sufficient to put to rest the controversy over his 2005 remarks. As much as he apologized, he did not confess or reveal anything new about his treatment of women over the years. Instead, Mr. Trump alternated between sounding chastened or defensive and trying to energize his base, which remains deeply hostile to Mrs. Clinton. He did so by blasting Mrs. Clinton relentlessly over her State Department email and repeatedly interrupting her, barely concealing his contempt. He said again that Mrs. Clinton should be “ashamed” of herself for deleting some of the personal emails she sent as secretary of state. “Oh, you didn’t delete them?” he said sarcastically. Mrs. Clinton, plainly exasperated, shot back: “O. K. Donald. I know you’re into big diversion tonight  —   anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it’s exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you. ” At several points, Mr. Trump expressed his frustration with the moderators, Anderson Cooper of CNN and Martha Raddatz of ABC, demanding that Mr. Cooper focus more on one of Mrs. Clinton’s biggest vulnerabilities, her email. “Why aren’t you bringing up the emails?” he asked, before flatly accusing the moderators of conspiring against him. “It’s nice, one on three,” he said. Mr. Trump appeared more confident and aggressive than he had in the first debate, often dismissing Mrs. Clinton’s arguments out of hand and painting her as a politician “for 30 years” who had no record of accomplishment. “It’s just words, folks it’s just words,” he said about Mrs. Clinton’s policy proposals.   minutes later, he added, “It’s all talk and no action. ” Mr. Trump made little, if any, effort to appeal to moderate voters, instead hurling a series of insults at Mrs. Clinton. At one point, an audience member pressed him about whether he could be a “devoted president” for all Americans, and he said emphatically that he could be, without acknowledging that his comments over the past year had been extraordinarily divisive. Instead, he attacked Mrs. Clinton. “She calls our people ‘deplorable,’ a large group, and irredeemable,” Mr. Trump said, invoking a comment that Mrs. Clinton made last month disparaging what she said was half of Mr. Trump’s supporters. Mrs. Clinton’s response reflected a strategy of hers throughout the town   debate: trying to engage directly with the undecided voters in the audience who asked some of the questions, and showing her empathetic side. “Mr. Carter,” she said, naming the man who asked the question, “I have tried my entire life to do what I can to support children and families. You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Children’s Defense Fund. And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years I’ve been in public service. I’m proud of that. ” Mr. Trump, however, was far less concerned with connecting with the voters seated in front of him than with attacking Mrs. Clinton in ways that would rally his voters behind him, and against the Republican officials who have been coming out against him. “She’s lied about a lot of things,” Mr. Trump said, contending that Mrs. Clinton’s shift to opposing the   Partnership trade deal was a falsehood. Moments later, he painted her in some of his most vicious language of the campaign. “She has tremendous hate in her heart,” Mr. Trump said. “She has tremendous hatred. ” In that moment and several others, Mr. Trump sought to bait Mrs. Clinton into lashing out, just as she did to great effect during their first debate. But she kept her composure, while Mr. Trump often seemed disgusted and running at a high boil. He even swiped at the Republicans now disavowing him, saying they should have done a better job holding Mrs. Clinton accountable over her emails. “I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen,” he said. He also used a question about Mr. Pence’s   rhetoric on Russia at last week’s   debate to breezily dismiss his running mate. “He and I haven’t spoken, and I disagree,” Mr. Trump said. Mrs. Clinton found herself on the defensive more than in the first debate, as Mr. Trump showed himself capable of some agility. When the moderators challenged her over revelations that in one of her paid speeches, she had asserted that politicians needed a “public and a private position” in making deals, she gave a meandering answer about how her remarks related to the plot of the Steven Spielberg film “Lincoln. ” Mr. Trump pounced. “She got caught in a total lie,” he said. “Now she’s blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln. ” As some audience members laughed, he added, “Honest Abe never lied. ” Mrs. Clinton also had several strong moments, especially early in the debate, when she reminded voters of Mr. Trump’s recent attacks on a former Miss Universe for gaining weight. At one point, Mr. Trump dissembled when he was pressed by a moderator about why he had posted on Twitter before dawn to accuse the beauty queen, Alicia Machado, of recording a sex tape. “It wasn’t ‘check out a sex tape,’” he said at the debate. Mr. Trump had in fact tweeted, “Check out sex tape. ” The night unfolded in dramatic fashion. Shortly before the debate, Mr. Trump held a brief news conference in St. Louis with three women  —   Paula Jones, Juanita Broaddrick and Kathleen Willey  —   who allege that Mr. Clinton sexually assaulted or harassed them during his years in office in Arkansas or as president. They were joined by a fourth woman, Kathy Shelton, who was 12 when she was raped by a    in Arkansas Mrs. Clinton represented the man, who ultimately pleaded guilty to a reduced charge. Only in the final minutes was there a brief cessation in the warfare. One audience member asked the candidates to cite something positive about each other, and Mrs. Clinton reached for a common answer to such questions. “Look, I respect his children,” she said. “His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald. ” Mr. Trump thanked her for the “very nice compliment,” and then offered his own. “I will say this about Hillary: She doesn’t quit, she doesn’t give up,” he said. “She’s a fighter. ” A moment later, after the moderators concluded the debate, Mr. Trump reached out his hand, and Mrs. Clinton shook it.",0

Μπορεί να περιλαμβάνει συναλλαγές για παράνομες χρηματοδοτήσεις ή διαφθορά, άλλες για τους δεσμούς των συζύγων Κλίντον με τους Αδελφούς Μουσουλμάνους και τους τζιχαντιστές.
Δίκτυο Βολταίρος | Δαμασκός (Συρία) | 1er novembre 2016 English Español français Türkçe русский Deutsch Η Χίλαρι Κλίντον και η επικεφαλής του προσωπικού γραφείου της, Χούμα Αμπεντίν. Η αναβίωση της έρευνας από το FBI των ιδιωτικών μηνυμάτων ηλεκτρονικού ταχυδρομείου της Χίλαρι Κλίντον δεν αφορά πλέον θέματα ασφάλειας, αλλά μικρο-κομπίνες που θα μπορούσαν να φτάσουν μέχρι εσχάτη προδοσία.
Από τεχνική άποψη, αντί να χρησιμοποιεί έναν ασφαλή διακομιστή της Ομοσπονδιακής Κυβέρνησης, η Υπουργός Εξωτερικών είχε εγκαταστήσει στο σπίτι της έναν ιδιωτικό διακομιστή, έτσι ώστε να μπορούσε να χρησιμοποιήσει το Διαδίκτυο χωρίς να αφήνει ίχνη σε συσκευή του ομοσπονδιακού κράτους. Ο ιδιωτικός τεχνικός της κας Κλίντον είχε καθαρίσει το σέρβερ της πριν από την άφιξη του FBI, οπότε δεν ήταν δυνατόν να γνωρίσει κανείς γιατί είχε εγκαταστήσει αυτή τη συσκευή.
Αρχικά, το FBI σημείωσε ότι ο ιδιωτικός διακομιστής δεν είχε το σύστημα ασφάλειας των διακομιστών του Στέιτ Ντιπάρτμεντ. Ως εκ τούτου, η Κλίντον δεν είχε διαπράξει παρά μόνο ένα σφάλμα ασφάλειας. Σε δεύτερο στάδιο, το FBI κατέσχεσε τον υπολογιστή του πρώην μέλους του Κογκρέσσου, Anthony Weiner. Ο τελευταίος είναι ο πρώην σύζυγός της Χούμα Αμπεντίν, επικεφαλής του προσωπικού γραφείου της Χίλαρυ. Βρέθηκαν μηνύματα ηλεκτρονικού ταχυδρομείου από την Υπουργό Εξωτερικών.
Ο Anthony Weiner είναι ένας εβραίος πολιτικός, πολύ κοντά στη Κλίντον, ο οποίος φιλοδοξούσε να γίνει δήμαρχος της Νέας Υόρκης. Αναγκάστηκε να παραιτηθεί μετά από ένα πολύ πουριτανικό σκάνδαλο: είχε στείλει ερωτικά SMS σε μια νεαρή γυναίκα που δεν ήταν η σύζυγος του. Η Χούμα Αμπεντίν τον χώρισε επίσημα κατά τη διάρκεια αυτής της αναταραχής, αλλά στην πραγματικότητα δεν τον άφησε.
Η Χούμα Αμπεντίν είναι μια Αμερικανίδα που μεγάλωσε στη Σαουδική Αραβία. Ο πατέρας της διευθύνει ένα ακαδημαϊκό περιοδικό –του οποίου ήταν η ίδια για χρόνια γραμματέας της σύνταξης- το οποίο αναπαράγει τακτικά τις θέσεις της Μουσουλμανικής Αδελφότητας. Η μητέρα της προεδρεύει το σαουδαραβικό σύλλογο των γυναικών που είναι μέλη της Αδελφότητας και συνεργαζόταν με τη σύζυγο του προέδρου της Αιγύπτου Μοχάμεντ Μόρσι. Ο αδελφός της Χασάν εργάζεται για λογαριασμό του Σεΐχη Yusuf al-Qaradawi, ιεροκήρυκα των Αδελφών και πνευματικού σύμβουλου της Αλ-Τζαζίρα.
Με την ευκαιρία μιας επίσημης επίσκεψης στη Σαουδική Αραβία, η Υπουργός Εξωτερικών επισκέπτεται το κολέγιο Dar al-Hekma συνοδευομένη από την Σαλέχα Αμπεντίν (μητέρα της επικεφαλής του προσωπικού της γραφείου), πρόεδρο του Συλλόγου των γυναικών Αδελφών μελών της Αδελφότητας . Η Χούμα Αμπεντίν είναι σήμερα μια κεντρική φιγούρα της εκστρατείας της Κλίντον, δίπλα στον διευθυντή της εκστρατείας, John Podesta, πρώην Γενικό Γραμματέα του Λευκού Οίκου υπό την προεδρία του Μπιλ Κλίντον. Ο Podesta είναι επίσης ο επίσημος λομπίστας του Βασιλείου της Σαουδικής Αραβίας στο Κογκρέσο με τη μικρή αμοιβή των 200 χιλιάδων δολαρίων μηνιαίως. Στις 12 Ιουνίου του 2016, η Πέτρα (Petra), το επίσημο πρακτορείο ειδήσεων της Ιορδανίας, δημοσίευσε μια συνέντευξη με τον Σαουδάραβα πρίγκιπα κληρονόμο του στέμματος, Μοχάμεντ μπιν Σαλμάν, ο οποίος διαφήμιζε τον εκσυγχρονισμό της οικογένειάς του που είχε χρηματοδοτήσει παράνομα στο ύψος του 20% την προεκλογική εκστρατεία της Χίλαρι Κλίντον, παρότι είναι γυναίκα. Μια ημέρα μετά από αυτή τη δημοσίευση, το πρακτορείο ακύρωσε το τηλεγράφημα και ισχυριζόταν ότι ο ιστοτόπος του είχε πέσει θύμα πειρατείας.
Σύμφωνα με το ιορδανικό πρακτορείο ειδήσεων Petra στις 12 Ιουνίου 2016, η σαουδαραβική βασιλική οικογένεια έχει χρηματοδοτήσει παράνομα το 20% της προεκλογικής εκστρατείας της Χίλαρι Κλίντον. Η κα Αμπεντίν δεν είναι το μόνο μέλος της κυβέρνησης Ομπάμα που συνδέεται με την Αδελφότητα. Ο ετεροθαλής αδελφός του προέδρου, Abon’go Μαλίκ Ομπάμα, είναι ταμίας της Ιεραποστολής των Αδελφών στο Σουδάν και του πρόεδρος του Ιδρύματος Μπαράκ H. Ομπάμα. Βρίσκεται άμεσα κάτω από την εντολή του προέδρου του Σουδάν Omar al-Bashir. Ένας Μουσουλμάνος Αδελφός είναι μέλος του Συμβουλίου Εθνικής Ασφαλείας -το ανώτατο εκτελεστικό όργανο των ΗΠΑ-. Από το 2009 έως το 2012, ήταν ο Mehdi Κ Alhassani. Δεν είναι γνωστό ποιος τον διαδέχθηκε, αλλά ο Λευκός Οίκος αρνιόταν ότι ένας Αδελφός είναι μέλος του Συμβουλίου έως ότου προέκυψε η απόδειξη. Επίσης, ένας Αδελφός είναι πρεσβευτής των Ηνωμένων Πολιτειών στην Ισλαμική Διάσκεψη, ο Rashad Hussain. Οι άλλοι ταυτοποιημένοι Αδελφοί καταλαμβάνουν λιγότερο σημαντικές θέσεις. Ωστόσο, πρέπει να αναφέρουμε τον Louay Μ Safi, νυν μέλος του Εθνικού Συνασπισμού της Συρίας και πρώην σύμβουλος του Πενταγώνου.
Ο πρόεδρος Ομπάμα και ο ετεροθαλής αδελφός του Abon’go Μαλίκ Ομπάμα στο Οβάλ Γραφείο. Ο Abon’go Malik είναι ταμίας της Ιεραποστολής της Μουσουλμανικής Αδελφότητας στο Σουδάν. Τον Απρίλιο του 2009, δύο μήνες πριν από την ομιλία του στο Κάιρο, ο πρόεδρος Ομπάμα δέχθηκε κρυφά μια αντιπροσωπεία της Αδελφότητας στο Οβάλ Γραφείο. Είχε ήδη καλέσει, κατά τη διάρκεια της ενθρόνισης του, την Ingrid Mattson, πρόεδρο του Συλλόγου των Μουσουλμάνων Αδελφών και γυναικών Αδελφών των Ηνωμένων Πολιτειών.
Από την πλευρά του, το Ίδρυμα Κλίντον χρησιμοποίησε ως υπεύθυνο του σχεδίου ""Κλίμα"" τον Gehad el-Haddad, ένας από τους παγκόσμιους ηγέτες της Αδελφότητας ο οποίος μέχρι τότε ήταν υπεύθυνος μιας τηλεοπτικής κορανικής εκπομπής. Ο πατέρας του ήταν ένας από τους συνιδρυτές της Αδελφότητας το 1951 όταν αναδημιουργήθηκε από τη CIA και το MI6. Ο Gehad αποχώρησε από το Ίδρυμα το 2012, όταν έγινε εκπρόσωπος στο Καΐρο του υποψηφίου Μοχάμεντ Μόρσι, και ύστερα επίσημος εκπρόσωπος της Μουσουλμανικής Αδελφότητας σε παγκόσμια κλίμακα.
Γνωρίζοντας ότι όλοι οι τζιχαντιστές ηγέτες του κόσμου είτε προέρχονται από την Αδελφότητα είτε από το σουφικό Τάγμα των Naqshbandi -τις δύο συνιστώσες του Μουσουλμανικού Παγκόσμιου Συνδέσμου, ήτοι της σαουδαραβικής αντι-αραβικής εθνικιστικής οργάνωσης- θα θέλαμε να μάθουμε περισσότερα για τις σχέσεις της κας Κλίντον με τη Σαουδική Αραβία και τους Αδελφούς.
Έτυχε ότι στην ομάδα του αντιπάλου της, Ντόναλντ Τραμπ, υπάρχει ο στρατηγός Michael T. Flynn, ο οποίος προσπάθησε να αντιταχθεί στην ίδρυση του Χαλιφάτου από τον Λευκό Οίκο και παραιτήθηκε από την ηγεσία της Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA, στρατιωτική υπηρεσία πληροφοριών) για να τονίσει την αποδοκιμασία του. Τρίβεται εκεί με τον Frank Gaffney, έναν ιστορικό «ψυχρό πολεμιστή», ο οποίος χαρακτηρίζεται ως «συνωμοσιολόγος» επειδή κατήγγειλε την παρουσία των Αδελφών στο Ομοσπονδιακό Κράτος.
Είναι αυτονόητο ότι, κατά την άποψη του FBI, κάθε υποστήριξη σε τζιχαντιστικές οργανώσεις είναι έγκλημα, ανεξάρτητα από την πολιτική της CIA. Το 1991, οι αστυνομικοί -και ο γερουσιαστής Τζον Κέρι- είχαν προκαλέσει την πτώχευση της πακιστανικής τράπεζας BCCI (παρότι έδρευε στα νησιά Καϋμάν) την οποία χρησιμοποιούσε η CIA για ποίκιλες μυστικές επιχειρήσεις με τη Μουσουλμανική Αδελφότητα, καθώς και με τα Λατίνο-καρτέλ των ναρκωτικών.

9582,Krauthammer on Bannon at CPAC: He Showed He Was ’the Brains of the Operation’ - Breitbart,"Thursday on Fox News Channel’s “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer reacted to the joint appearance of White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and chief of staff Reince Priebus earlier in the day at the Conservative Political Action Conference.  Krauthammer told host Tucker Carlson the focus on reports of friction between the two was “trivial” and that Bannon’s first public appearance since inauguration was the real tell because he described Bannon as “the brains of the operation. ” “I think they’re going to bat down these stories in the media that there is a terrible conflict going on all the time,” Krauthammer said. “I think they felt that there is the first order of business, I think it’s somewhat trivial because it was a very substantive exchange and from Bannon who we’ve not heard of since the swearing in, it was extremely revealing. This is the brains of the operation. This is the guy who thinks strategically, and large categories, and he laid them out. I thought that was the most interesting part, and unfortunately, it got the least amount of coverage. ” Carlson asked Krauthammer to elaborate on that strategy, which Krauthammer broke down to three “overarching” ideas  —   international relations, trade, and the “administrative state. ” “His representation of Trump is that you can never get out of Reince or out of Trump,” he said. “He basically said there are three overarching ideas. One is the international arena. We are going to break that down, where essentially, you got this in the inaugural address, the world and our allies have been parasitic on us years with alliances and trade and multilateral trade, where done with that  —   America first. That’s number one. The second is what he calls economic nationalism  —   meaning trade and immigration. We are looking at America first regarding the economy. The third is the destruction of the administration administrative state. ” “Now, on the third one, I think you can get a consensus among all conservatives, and I think we’re all rooting that on,” Krauthammer continued. “And I think the first salvo in that war happened yesterday when the Trump administration reversed the bathroom bill that had been issued by the Obama in administration, which whatever your ideas about transgender sexuality, it is not the province of the federal government. It has nothing to do with the overblown leviathan state. It’s a way to say we’re going to smash all this and we’re going to eliminate this sort of excess. That’s Reaganism, that’s hardcore Reaganism, the regulatory rollback. On the other two, this is going against the tradition of the last 30 years. And he will run into trouble, especially on the second having to do with trade in Congress. Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",0
9583,Cliff Sims: House Healthcare Bill ’Still a Work in Progress’,"Cliff Sims, special assistant to President Trump, spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Tuesday about the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) release on the American Health Care Act. [While disputing the CBO numbers, Sims said, “This bill is still a work in progress. This bill is not finalized. The president has met with conservative allies over the last week or so, from the Heritage Foundation to Freedom Works and many other groups that have come in and met with him. ” Sims also cited members of congress and the Freedom Caucus as having met with Trump recently to share their concerns and ideas regarding any final bill.  “I’ve been in the room,” added Sims, “where someone will bring up an idea or change that they’re suggesting to the bill, and the president will turn to the HHS secretary, the OMB director, or, if it’s Paul Ryan or Mitch McConnell in the room, and say, ‘Will you guys think about this? Let’s kick this around. Let’s see if this is something that we should add. ’” Sims also paraphrased Trump’s recently expressed sentiments that “things are still under negotiation. We’re still trying to strengthen this bill. There’s a long way to go. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. ",0

Trump described the current financial situation of the country as “a mess” and vowed to fix it.  “The finances of this country are a mess, but we’re going to clean that up,” Trump said, pointing out that he had only been president for four weeks. “I can’t take too much of the blame for what’s happened, but it is absolutely out of control. ” Trump met with his Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, as well as Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. He was joined by his senior staff, including Jared Kushner, Reince Priebus, Steve Bannon, and his economic adviser Gary Cohn.

(BBC News) Global wildlife populations have fallen by 58% since 1970, a report says. 
The Living Planet assessment, by the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and WWF, suggests that if the trend continues that decline could reach two-thirds among vertebrates by 2020. 
The figures suggest that animals living in lakes, rivers and wetlands are suffering the biggest losses. 
Human activity, including habitat loss, wildlife trade, pollution and climate change, is attributed to the declines.",0

9587,Red Cross Therapist Stabbed to Death by Syrian Asylum Seeker,"A Red Cross therapist who helped treat asylum seekers was stabbed to death by a    Syrian after the pair got into a heated argument. [The fatal stabbing occurred at a Red Cross facility in Saarbrücken that specialised in counselling and therapy for asylum seekers. The victim, a therapist employed by the Red Cross, was repeatedly stabbed by the Syrian and succumbed to his wounds at the scene, Die Welt reports.  Police say the attack occurred during a counselling session and say the asylum seeker got into a heated argument with the therapist. The Syrian then brought out a knife which he had on his person and used it to commit the deadly attack. Police have not said what caused the conflict but noted the Syrian had also been injured in the incident and had to be taken to the hospital. Consequently, police have no been able to interrogate him. They have not released the identity of the attacker or the victim in the case so far. German Red Cross President Rudolf Seiters briefly commented on the attack saying that he was “shocked”. The organisation said they are mourning the death of the therapist who they called a “meritorious” employee. The Red Cross has been criticised in Germany in the past when last year they were accused of covering up sexual abuse in one their asylum centres in Potsdam. The allegations were brought forward by a former employee who wrote a letter saying female staff were sexually harassed by male migrants and the manager of the asylum home chose to cover up the issue rather than address it. A similar murder of an asylum centre worker by a migrant occurred in Sweden last year when Alexandra Mezher was stabbed to death by a Somali asylum seeker. Ms. Mezher got involved in a dispute between migrants and as a result was attacked by the Somalian who claimed to be underage at the time but was later revealed to be an adult. Earlier this week, another asylum home murder occurred in Germany when an Afghan asylum seeker stabbed a    child to death. The    Afghan was already known to police and had a prior conviction for attempted murder by arson and was forced to wear an ankle monitor.",0
9588,MILO: ’Non-College Educated Doesn’t Mean Stupid’ - Breitbart,"Breitbart News Senior Editor MILO claimed that “  educated doesn’t mean stupid,” during his talk at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs tonight, adding that a majority of his   educated employees are “some of the smartest and most successful people. ”[  “Let’s be clear about what the left lost. The white working class turned against the Democrat party in a historic fashion during this election. The numbers are stunning, even to someone as stunning as me,” MILO proclaimed. “I’m not a dataporn kind of faggot like those   losers at the Guardian and the spectacularly dreadful FiveThirtyEight, but I have to share a few of the key stats from Pew Research with you. ” “  whites voted for Donald Trump by a 4% margin. This is similar to how they voted for Mitt Romney,” he continued. “That is a bit embarrassing to be honest, but we have to admit that those goofy #NeverTrump people are all college eggheads. Proof that college can make you dumber. ” “But the numbers for those that didn’t graduate college are amazing. A 39% margin for Trump! These are the deplorables, ladies and gentlemen, just as much as the hip millennials posting Pepe on Twitter,” explained MILO. “Let’s be clear about one thing.   educated doesn’t mean stupid. It means you wisely chose not to pay $40, 000 a year to be lectured on microaggressions. Some of the smartest and most successful people in history have been either college dropouts, like me, or people who never attended at all, like a lot of my crew on this tour. ” MILO continued to claim that “They are smarter  —   and so am I  —   than 90 per cent of the people in this room. ” “They’re already more successful and they already have more enjoyable jobs and have more political and cultural influence than most of the people in this room. No offense!” he added. “But my point is that ‘  educated’ isn’t a synonym for dumb redneck or idiot. A good 50 per cent of the most successful people I know didn’t get a university degree. ” “The split among all voters is also amazing. All college graduates went to Hillary by a 9% margin, while all people without degrees went to Trump by 8%. We haven’t seen this kind of gap since 1980,” stated MILO. “So rather than smart versus dumb, try to think of this split in cultural terms. When we look at the way counties voted in battleground states, it is a similar story. Trump won Wisconsin by taking 10 counties that typically go Democrat. ” “Kenosha County has been Democrat since 1972, but it went to Trump. Similar stories and countries exist in every state,” MILO explained. “The evidence very clearly shows the left lost the white working class. ” Written from prepared remarks.

9589,The World Tree,"Remy Porter Remy escaped the enterprise world and now works as a consultant. Editor-in-Chief for TDWTF. 
When Nate was wrapping up his senior year of college, he hunted around for a job that would hire an undergrad on flexible hours. He knew that the kinds of companies that tended to hire on those terms could often have… creative practices, but college wasn’t about to pay for itself. 
He found a small shop that needed an extra hand. Extremely small- there was only one other developer, Gordon. Nate was prepared to enter a tiny shop with no real practices or procedures, because with only one developer, you don’t expect a lot of rules and bureaucracy. 
Gordon was only one person, but he was able to create enough contrived, arcane, and downright mysterious bureaucratic policies and procedures for fifty developers. Reading the style-guide was closer to reading a novel, but not a good novel where there was a clear point and narrative thread, but something meandering and pointless, like a Douglas Adams book. 
Gordon wasn’t just opinionated about style . He also had Opinions™ on the proper use of source control. “Branches,” Gordon explained, “are absolutely vital for separating units of work.” 
Gordon’s explanation came after Nate was stunned by the sheer number of branches- there were hundreds of branches in the repository. “Look,” Gordon said, “you don’t have to be intimidated by this. We can start you out, just do this small change in the main branch, then I’ll show you how to release it.” 
Nate dutifully checked out master , made the change, and committed it. He sent Gordon a pull request. 
“You used the wrong branch. Back out your change, and put it in the main one.” 
“Which branch is the main one? It’s not master ?” 
“It used to be, but we don’t really use master anymore. Use master_4513 .” 
As it turned out, the “main branch” was usually whichever branch Gordon touched last. There were five or six different branches that could be the “main” branch at any given time. Maybe seven- it was very hard for Nate to be certain. 
Nate made the changes in master_4513 , but that was only the start of the nightmare. Now, those changes had to be merged into the correct branch for deployment. “This is pretty complex, do you want me to walk you through it?” Gordon asked. 
Nate said yes, and so Gordon sat down next to him, and started explaining each step that Nate needed to perform. These “explanations” started with Gordon pressing his fingers against Nate’s monitor and saying, “Click here.”“No, fire up the GUI, not the CLI.”“Select this branch.” The instructional process was recorded as a smear of fingerprints on Nate’s screen. 
Changes merged outward from the main branch (whatever “main” happened to be that day). Instead of merging back towards a known-good trunk of code, changes were made to the trunk, and then percolated outward, according to Gordon’s own twisted logic. “You see,” he explained, “we’ve gotta maintain, like, 15 different versions, and some of them depend on a different version of our framework lib. This main version builds against version 1.2 of the framework.” 
“But… isn’t your framework up to version 4.5? Like… for years now?” 
“Yeah, but this change only goes out to the 2.0 users, so you need to merge from main to master_51 , then to frameworkupgradeA1 , then to perky_peregrine . You’ll need to resolve conflicts.” 
Nate ground his teeth hard enough to make diamonds between them, and fought his way through the merge conflicts. A few hours later, Nate’s one line change was merged into a releasable version, but Nate had no idea how that change would migrate to any other version, if it ever did. 
Nate’s next assignment was to make a change to the same version, and since it was a larger change, he made a feature branch off of perky_peregrine , do the changes there, then merge right back into perky_peregrine after the work was done. Then he could propagate the changes back to the current “main” branch, asdfg . This resulted in an angry visit from Gordon. 
“Are you trying to mess this up?” Gordon demanded. “There is a system . There are policies ! Did you even read the development guide I gave you? Feature branches are fine, but they have to come off the main branch, not one of the dependent branches!” 
Nate had tried valiantly to read it, but failed. “I was just going to do the work, merge into perky_peregrine , and then delete the branch, why does it matter?” 
“Merge back ?” Gordon shrieked. “DELETE the BRANCH? Branches don’t merge backwards , only outwards. Like a tree. Each feature branch is supposed to be an entirely new line of development. Have you even used source control?” 
Something snapped in the back of Nate’s brain, because for a brief, terrifying moment, that almost made sense. Nate had been puzzling over the bizarre state of their source control repository, and those words from Gordon put understanding it within tantalizing reach. If he asked a few more questions, he might just see the method to this madness… 
Nate chose the wiser path. He smiled, he nodded, he complied with Gordon’s policies, and moved on to the next feature, weeks after cutting through the shrubbery that was Gordon’s branching system. 
The next feature was to make a change that only impacted users of the latest version of the base framework. The current “main” branch was back on version 2.3, so Nate needed to start by making a branch from there. Then he had to bring it up to version 4.0, then convert a few of the datafiles into a new format, then finish the upgrade to 4.5. This was about two weeks of hair pulling frustration. Then he could make his changes. He spent that week asking serious questions about the career path he was on. Finally , he could merge his changes into the actual 4.5 release branch, but never back into any master branch. 
This resulted in tens of thousands of merge conflicts. The next few weeks were spent cutting through them, and by the end of that time, Nate discovered the semester was nearly over. He was about to graduate. He went to Lindsey, the co-owner of the small company, and handed in his resignation. 
“We’ve been really impressed by your work,” she said. “You could stay on after college, if you like.” 
Her tone was even, perhaps even a little indifferent, but there was a plea in her eyes. Nate vaguely recalled hearing that Gordon was a friend of Reggie, the other co-owner. Nate saw a hint that Lindsay knew what Gordon was doing to their software product. Maybe she thought Nate could be her ally in fixing it. 
Or maybe Nate was reading too much into it. Discretion was the better part of valor. “I’m sorry, I just don’t think I’m the right fit for this team,” he said. They made the polite noises, she promised him a recommendation letter, they connected on LinkedIn, and Nate went off to find a source tree that didn’t look like a tangled briar. 
A few months after Nate settled into his new job, he snooped on Gordon’s LinkedIn profile- he was unemployed. A message to Lindsay confirmed that she’d fired him over his inability to deliver new features. The last anyone had heard, Gordon had retired to a cabin in the woods, where he could be alone with many branches that never merged back into their trunks.

9590,"MARKO, SOON, ET AL: To Put America First Is to Put Our Planet’s Climate First - Breitbart"," The article below was contributed by Istvan Marko, J. Scott Armstrong, William M. Briggs, Kesten Green, Hermann Harde, David R. Legates, Christopher Monckton of Brenchley, and Willie Soon. [On June 2, 2017, in a Letter regarding US withdrawal from Paris climate agreement addressed to the MIT community, Professor Rafael Reif, president of MIT, criticized President Trump’s decision to exit the Paris Climate Accords. In this refutation, we propose to clarify the scientific understanding of the Earth’s climate and to dispel the expensively fostered popular delusion that   global warming will be dangerous and that, therefore, the Paris Agreement would be beneficial.  Professor Reif wrote, “Yesterday, the White House took the position that the Paris climate agreement  —   a landmark effort to combat global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions  —   was a bad deal for America. ” There is no science unambiguously establishing that CO2 is the chief cause of the warming observed since the end of the Little Ice Age. The opposite has been repeatedly demonstrated. Ice cores have revealed that changes in CO2 concentration follow, rather than precede, changes in temperature. During the last deglaciation, the latest   records show atmospheric CO2 lagging temperature by 50 to 500 years. Our enterprises and industries return to the air some of the CO2 that was formerly present there, and some warming may be expected. That warming will be small and beneficial. Professor Humlum and colleagues have demonstrated that changes in CO2 concentration follow changes in temperature after about   months. The   between changes in temperature and consequent changes in CO2 concentration are caused by outgassing of CO2 from the oceans when they warm and uptake by the oceans as they cool. In addition, the growth rate of the atmospheric CO2 has been slowing recently, linked to an enhanced terrestrial biosphere uptake. Our contribution to atmospheric CO2 adds to the effect of these fluctuations, but it does not add much. One of us (Harde 2017) has reached similar conclusions. Professor Reif’s assertion that global temperatures can be regulated by an international agreement to atone for our sins of emission is, therefore, at odds with scientific knowledge regarding cause and effect. King Canute’s warning to his English courtiers in 1032 A. D. that even the divinely anointed monarch could not command sea level should be heeded by bombastic intergovernmental agencies a millennium later. The professor’s assertion is, moreover, logically invalid, since the Paris agreement permits China and India to industrialize without limit on their emissions. Besides, the Paris agreement is not binding. Under its terms, no nation is compelled to sin no more, and many  —   even including Germany and Denmark, the leaders in renewable energies  —   now appear unlikely to meet the agreement’s targets. The Paris agreement is, in practice, a political tool for suppressing growth and redistributing wealth. Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, former chairman of the IPCC, said, in resigning in 2015, that the environment was his “religion,” and Ms. Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the U. N. Framework Convention on Climate Change until last year, openly stated in 2015 that the goal was to overturn capitalism  —   in her words, “to change the economic development model that has been reigning for at least 150 years, since the industrial revolution. ” Professor Reif writes, “The scientific consensus is overwhelming. ” The late author Michael Crichton, in his Caltech Michelin Lecture 2003, said, “In science consensus is irrelevant.   …     There is no such thing as consensus science. If it’s consensus, it isn’t science. If it’s science, it isn’t consensus. Period. ” Doubt is the seedcorn of science. Consensus is a political notion which, when pleaded, indicates that the pleader is totalitarian. As Abu Ali ibn   said in the eleventh century: The seeker after truth [his splendid definition of the scientist] does not place his faith in any mere consensus, however venerable or widespread. Instead, he subjects what he has learned of it to his   scientific knowledge, and to investigation, inspection, inquiry, checking, checking and checking again. The road to the truth is long and hard, but that is the road we must follow. The alleged “consensus” is nothing more than an agreement that the weather has warmed in the past 300 years. Yet the quantum and attribution of warming are hotly debated among climatologists. Even today, measuring global temperature is subject to errors, biases, missing data, and subjective adjustments. The estimation of global average temperature from satellite data is relatively new and employs a completely different temperature measurement method from the older methods. Nevertheless, the satellite data and balloon data have provided essentially identical estimates. Neither displays a worrying trend. Both are increasingly at odds not only with the surface temperature records, all of which have been adjusted ex post facto so as to show more warming than the original raw data showed, but also with the alarming projections of the serially unreliable computer models of climate on which the U. N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change profitably but misguidedly relies. Scientists agree that climate changes. It has done so since the first wisps of the Earth’s atmosphere formed, but they disagree on the causes of climate changes, including the mild warming since the Little Ice Age. Legates et al. (2015) for example, found that only 0. 3 percent of 11, 944   articles on climate and related topics, published during the 21 years of 1991 to 2011, had explicitly stated that recent warming was mostly  . Professor Reif wrote, “As human activities emit more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, the global average surface temperature will continue to rise, driving rising sea levels and extreme weather. ” In the last 20 years, we have released more than a third of all the CO2 produced since the beginning of the industrial period. Yet global mean surface temperature has remained essentially constant for 20 years, a fact that has been acknowledged by the IPCC, whose models failed to predict it. NOAA’s State of the Climate report for 2008 said that periods of 15 years or more without warming would indicate a discrepancy between prediction and observation  —   i. e. that the models were wrong. Just before the recent naturally occurring el Niño event raised global temperature, there had been 18 years and 9 months without any global warming at all. The climate models relied upon by the IPCC and the politicians they advise have predicted warming at about twice the rate observed during the past 27 years, during which the Earth has warmed at 0. 4 °C, about half of the 0. 75 °C   warming rate implicit in IPCC’s explicit 1990 prediction that there would be 1. 0 °C warming from  .   Green and Armstrong (2014) conducted   validation tests of the models and found that their forecasts were much less accurate than assuming there had been no global warming at all. The relative inaccuracy of the IPCC projections increased with longer ( ) horizons. Even forecasts of natural global cooling at a rate of 1 ºC per century were much more accurate over long periods than the IPCC’s projections of dangerous   global warming. Ten years ago, Al Gore asserted that global temperatures had reached a dangerous “tipping point,” with extreme warming imminent and unavoidable. Professor Scott Armstrong challenged Mr. Gore to a   bet based on the    (2009)) scientific   forecast of global mean temperatures. Mr. Gore declined the bet, but theclimatebet. com website keeps track of how the bet would have turned out. With the   life of the bet due to end at the end of this year, the cumulative monthly error in the IPCC’s    0. 3 ºC per decade prediction is 22 percent larger than the error from the benchmark prediction of no warming at all. Why does Professor Reif continue to champion the notion of dangerous manmade global warming when it is so greatly at odds with observation? Professor Reif wrote, As human activities emit more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, the global average surface temperature will continue to rise, driving rising sea levels and extreme weather. ” The average sea level rise since 1870 has been 1. .5 mm (about a twentieth of an inch) per year. Professor   Mörner, a renowned   researcher who has published more than 500   articles on this topic, has been unable to find observational evidence that supports the models’ predictions of dramatically accelerating sea level rise. Professor Reif wrote, “As human activities emit more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, the global average surface temperature will continue to rise, driving rising sea levels and extreme weather. ” Observations during the last few decades indicate that extreme events, including tornadoes and hurricanes, have been decreasing, rather than increasing, both in number and in intensity. Moreover, the total accumulated cyclonic energy has also been declining. As MIT Emeritus Professor Richard Lindzen has explained, the decline in storminess is a consequence of reduced temperature differentials between the tropics and   that arise when global average temperatures are warmer. Professor Reif wrote, “As the Pentagon describes it, climate change is a “threat multiplier” because its direct effects intensify other challenges, including mass migrations and   conflicts over existential resources like water and food. ” Milder temperatures and increased CO2 levels green the planet, instead of browning it. Deserts are retreating, and vegetation cover has increased throughout recent decades. The production of maize, wheat, rice, and soybeans is at a record high. More CO2 in the air helps plants by CO2 fertilization. Our planet has seen more than 20 percent greening during the past three decades, half of which is due to the action of CO2. Forecasts of droughts are also not borne out by experience. For example, since the   Australian Chief Climate Commissioner Professor Tim Flannery warned that dams would no longer fill owing to lack of rain, Australia has been subjected to a series of dramatic floods and overflowing dams. Governments’ naïve belief in Professor Flannery’s warnings appear to have led to policy actions and omissions that exacerbated flooding and failed to take full advantage of the rainfall when it came. The most comprehensive recent study of the worldwide extent of droughts (Hao et al. 2014) found that for 30 years the percentage of the Earth’s land mass under drought or severe drought has been declining. Though the U. N. Environment Program had published in 2005 a document predicting 50 million climate refugees by 2010, to date there have been no bona fide climate refugees. Nor has mass migration owing to global warming been observed. The one person recognized as a climate refugee had his demand rejected by the Supreme Court of New Zealand. He has returned to his island home, where he remains safe from inundation. Professor Reif wrote, “The carbon dioxide our cars and power plants emit today will linger in the atmosphere for a thousand years. ” The average residence time of a CO2 molecule in the Earth’s atmosphere is about four to seven years. Taking into account multiple exchanges leads to an estimate of a mean lifespan of 40 years (Harde 2017). Rather than a problem, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is the prime nutrient for plants. Indeed, plants grow more strongly when CO2 concentrations are much higher than they currently are, which is why commercial greenhouses add CO2 to the air. The current CO2 concentration is higher than for 800, 000 years, but it is far lower than at almost any time in the previous history of our planet. Nor is CO2 a pollutant. It is a colorless, odorless gas that is not toxic to humans and other animals even at concentrations much higher than we are currently experiencing. It is also one of the most important fuels for phytoplankton, which use carbon dioxide for energy and that release oxygen. Up to 75 percent of the oxygen present in the air originates in the phytoplankton photosynthetic   process. Moreover, during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras, there were long periods during which the levels of CO2 were much higher than today, but the temperatures were far colder. We are not aware of any explanation that squares the   global warming theory with that fact. Professor Reif wrote, “In 2016 alone, solar industry employment grew by 25 percent, while wind jobs grew 32 percent. ” Growing jobs by subsidy is easy, provided that one cares nothing for the far greater number of jobs destroyed by the additional taxation, energy price hikes, or public borrowing necessary to pay for the subsidy. Several studies have shown that the creation of one “green” job results in the loss of two jobs elsewhere in the economy. Despite all those subsidies, solar power accounts for 0. 9 percent and wind generation for 5. 6 percent of total U. S. electricity production. Electricity itself is a small fraction of total energy consumption, including transportation, industrial processes, and heating. The   alternative energy companies survive through heavy subsidies and supportive regulations. For example, SunEdison received $1. 5 billion in subsidies and loan guarantees, and yet it was compelled to file for bankruptcy. Solyndra is another example.   “renewable” energy is cripplingly expensive to the customer but is often unprofitable even after massive subsidies from taxpayers. Europe is suffering from political rejection of fossil fuels: energy prices have soared, millions of poor people are unable to pay their energy bills, and   businesses are relocating to where energy is cheaper. Theirs is not an example the U. S. should wish to follow. By withdrawing from the Paris agreement, President Trump did a wonderful thing for America and the world. He showed that advocacy masquerading as science should not be the basis for political decisions. He showed that to put America first is to put the planet first. And, by rejecting the   of   global warming, he began the long and necessary process of waking up the likes of Professor Reif to the fact that the diversion of time, effort, and trillions of dollars away from real environmental problems and towards the bogus but (to MIT) profitable   of supposedly catastrophic global warming is as bad for the planet as it is for true science.",0
9591,Trespassing in Christina’s World - The New York Times,"At the steering wheel my father consults his large paper map, turning it this way and that, squinting at the small blue lines that squiggle through tiny Maine coastal towns. He’s heard that the author E. B. White’s house is somewhere around here, and he’s determined to find it. My mother, next to him in the passenger seat of our rusty gold station wagon with my baby sister on her lap, raises her eyebrows at my other two sisters and me,   in the second row. It’s the early 70s, and seatbelts haven’t caught on yet. We gaze back at her, knowing that once Dad gets an idea into his head, it’s almost impossible to stop him. We range in age from 1 to 10 (I’m the oldest) and all of us are literally and figuratively along for the ride. Besides, we’re excited at the prospect of meeting this author we already feel we know. We’ve been lulled to sleep every night by the soft cadence of my dad’s Southern accent as he reads us stories about a wise spider and a hapless pig, a resourceful mouse and a mute swan. Dad pulls off the road into the dusty parking lot of a country store with a lone gas pump, and gets out of the car. We hear him chatting with the attendant through the open window. “Sure is nice around here. ” The guy shrugs. My sisters and I glance at each other. Rural Mainers tend to be   and   averse. But as usual, Dad doesn’t seem to notice. “You lived here long?” “Ayuh. ” Amazingly, before long, and with only a little coaxing, the attendant is telling Dad about his grandkids and his lobster boat and pointing off into the distance, giving him the intel he’s come for. “Mr. White lives right over that hill there. Privet hedge in front. Can’t miss it. ” Back on the road, my sister Cynthia ventures, “Isn’t it rude to show up on someone’s doorstep without asking?” Dad grins and winks at us in the rearview mirror. “He’ll be flattered. ” We pull up to the farmhouse to find a courtly   man trimming the hedge with a set of clippers. “It’s him!” Dad whispers. He rolls down his window and leans out. “Hello, good sir!” The man seems a little nonplused. “I have a car full of young readers here who’d give anything to meet their favorite author. A word from you, and they’ll remember this moment for the rest of their lives. ” What choice does the poor man have? Within a few minutes, the famously reclusive E. B. White is demonstrating to a cluster of little girls in bathing suits that when you crush pine needles between your fingers and hold it to your nose, the smell is as strong as patchouli. And Dad is right  —   we never will forget it. My childhood was rife with moments like this. Dad was always going out on a limb, befriending people who didn’t necessarily seem to want new friends, trespassing on private property, pushing the boundaries of acceptable behavior in quest of adventure. His philosophy was that you don’t need money or plans, only a willingness to be present in the moment and to go where inspiration takes you. If you don’t, you’ll miss the entire point of being alive. Raised dirt poor in rural Georgia by a millworker mother and a father who often went to the bar rather than home after work, Dad learned early on that his quickest route up the social ladder was through charm and smarts. He got himself to college  —   the first in his family  —   on a football scholarship, then used seminary to springboard to a doctorate in a foreign land. As a young academic in the ‘60s, he grew to reject traditional values and had scant respect for the social codes of privilege. At parties, he could often be found talking to the bartender or a    Irish grandmother in the kitchen rather than the hosts. A Southerner through and through, even after moving to Maine, he was constitutionally incapable of walking down a street in New York without stopping to chat with doormen, bodega owners and homeless people. He never met a taxi driver whose story he didn’t want to know. Dad’s unorthodox and sometimes embarrassing friendliness got him, and us, into trouble now and then. Some people didn’t take kindly to probing questions. Others found his   openness suspect or unsophisticated. But his innate, bottomless curiosity about the world also taught his four daughters to be open to new experiences and comfortable with improvisation. Even now, in his late 70s, he lives each day with a kind of purposeful recklessness, asking provocative questions and seeking new experiences in the belief that he can break through to something better, more meaningful, more satisfying. Though my parents had little money, they took us on adventures all over the world. Driving through Scotland in a rainstorm, we pulled over to the side of the road and rode the wild ponies grazing by the fence. We coaxed a stray lamb over to our rented R. V. to feed it. One year my father switched houses, cars, teaching jobs, committees and pets with a professor in Melbourne, Australia, sight unseen. Another year our family of six flew to Crete without a plan at the airport Dad bought a map and started asking random strangers, with the help of a woefully inadequate Greek phrase book: “What should we do?” “Where should we stay?” This spontaneity meant that we missed flights, lost luggage, drove on perilous roads late at night, stayed in some   hovels, and sometimes went hungry. But it also yielded beautiful surprises: an undiscovered beach, a fisherman’s hut with a breathtaking view, a hillside breakfast of goats’ milk yogurt and fresh honey that I still remember 35 years later. It led to his daughters’ sense of the world not as a huge frightening place but as a wonderland ripe for discovery. The Maine farmhouse in Andrew Wyeth’s iconic painting “Christina’s World” was not yet a museum or even open to the public when my father got it into his head  —   soon after our ambush of E. B. White  —   to take a family field trip there. Following his usual routine, he pulled into the small village of Cushing and asked a local how to find the Olson house. When we arrived (no doubt trespassing) we picnicked in the field where the woman in the pink dress in the painting had lain. Looking up at that weathered gray house on the hill, and hearing the story of the woman with my name who spent her lifetime there, I was entranced. Years later, I drew on that experience to tell my own story of the painting in my new book. There’s no doubt that my dad’s endless curiosity has shaped who I am. I often find myself  —   to my own kids’ embarrassment  —   chatting with strangers in lines, accepting spontaneous invitations, and seeking     adventures. I think the most important thing I learned from my dad is that when you go out on a limb there’s a risk it will break, but you’ll get a whole new perspective on the world. And if you’re really lucky, it can feel like flying.",0
9592,NC Woman Charged with Sexual Misconduct with Dog and Creating Child Porn - Breitbart,"A North Carolina woman has been arrested and accused of sexual misconduct with an animal and creating child porn by filming children in bathrooms, authorities report. [Rowan County Sheriffs arrested Wendy Arlene Kasper, 36, and charged her with felony secret peeping with a recording device and possessing photographic images from secret peeping. She was also hit with three counts of crimes against nature after video showing her engaging in sexual contact with a dog came to light during the investigation, Fox 8 reported.  An investigation was launched in December by the Rowan County Sheriff’s Office Criminal Investigative Division which joined with the Rowan County Department of Social Services after allegations were made that Kasper sexually exploited a young girl. During the course of the investigation, authorities found video of the child using a bathroom and learned that Kasper had also sexually abused a dog on several occasions. Police also found a link between Kasper and an individual named Joshua Douglas Martorelli, whom they suspect of dealing in child pornography. “This investigation indicated that Kasper was involved in child pornography dissemination with    Joshua Douglas Martorelli,” the Sheriff’s Office said in a press release released on Saturday. “Martorelli is also from Salisbury, and is possibly involved in a larger child pornography group that is still under investigation. This information is being shared with other jurisdictions to include the N. C. SBI,” the statement added. An arrest warrant for Martorelli was also released and police say he was last seen in the Old Concord Road area of Salisbury, North Carolina. Kasper is being held in the Rowan County Detention Center under a $25, 000 secured bond. Authorities are asking anyone with information on the location of Martorelli to contact Lt. C. A. Moose (704)   Detective C. J. Gordy (704)  . Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.",0
9593,Cate Blanchett’s Star Power Lifts ‘The Present’ on Broadway - The New York Times,"Cate Blanchett is proving to be a strong   draw on Broadway. “The Present,” a new adaptation of a   Chekhov play starring Ms. Blanchett in her Broadway debut, last week grossed just over $1 million, a sign of strength for any Broadway show, but especially for a nonmusical play. One illustrative comparison: A revival this season of “The Cherry Orchard,” also by Chekhov, topped out at $384, 000 during its best, and final, week of performances. “The Present,” which opened on Jan. 8, received mixed reviews, but has been selling well since beginning previews on Dec. 17. Last week, a   week for Broadway over all, was the strongest yet for “The Present,” which had a healthy average admission price of $129 and played to 95 percent full houses, according to figures released Wednesday by the Broadway League for the week ending Jan. 15. The adaptation, written by Ms. Blanchett’s husband, Andrew Upton, is a modern take on Chekhov’s first play, which is most often produced under the title “Platonov. ” Ms. Blanchett, a   Oscar winner, plays a Russian widow who is turning 40 and worried about how to hang on to her home. The play’s action centers on a wild birthday party at which the character’s friends and family have gathered. The overall Broadway season, which began in May and runs through this May, continues to look strong  —   grosses are up 0. 4 percent over the previous,   season. But attendance is now down 1. 1 percent, a potentially worrisome indicator, although there are several   shows scheduled to open later this season. Among the signs of health: Two of this season’s plays announced that they had recouped their capitalization costs, meaning, in industry parlance, that they are hits, and can generate profits until they close this month. A revival of “The Front Page,” with a cast led by Nathan Lane, has recouped its $4. 875 million capitalization, according to the producer Scott Rudin that production is scheduled to close Jan. 29. And “Oh, Hello on Broadway,” starring the comedians Nick Kroll and John Mulaney, has recouped its $2. 9 million capitalization, according to the producers Patrick Catullo and Marcia Goldberg it is scheduled to close on Sunday.",0
9594,Silent Coup in the USA? Former Diplomat Explains How Soft Regime Change Works,"Waking Times 
“How could one person like myself be able to do what we in the business call regime change?” ~Steve Pieczenik 
Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State under Henry Kissinger, Steve Pieczenik has a long history as an expert in psychological warfare and was a diplomat to Soviet Russia helping to instigate the collapse of the megalithic communist state in 1991. In a recently released video he speaks on the role the American government played in manipulating Soviet culture and leadership to bring about a silent coup, or bloodless regime change, offering insight that is especially relevant in the present context of U.S. politics. 
Pieczenik explains the effectiveness of soft strategies as tools for destabilizing the U.S.S.R., noting firstly how religion was used externally to bring about an internal rise in the Russian Orthodox religion to undermine the atheist regime in the Kremlin. 
A second soft tactic by the U.S. was to demonstrate for top Soviet military leaders the effectiveness of modern U.S. weaponry against Soviet tanks and other weapons systems. This allowed Soviet leaders to grasp the dominance of power already in play, effectively neutralizing the Soviet military without having to actually engage in warfare. 
“A third element was creating economic hardship for the Soviet Union which they really could not comprehend,” says Pieczenik, who explains how Reagan’s funding of the Strategic Defense Initiative , or SDI, was largely a tactic of smoke and mirrors to force the Soviets to respond by over-spending on obsolete defense programs. It was a bluffed cold war arms race, aimed at destabilizing the financial systems of the Soviet Union. 
The fourth component of regime change, of which Pieczenik was greatly concerned, was cultural, involving the creation of a fissure between the younger and older generations in Soviet Russia, achieved primarily by exposing Russians to American rock and roll music, which was, at the time, highly revolutionary for the Soviet culture. 
The fifth element was the process of negotiations that took place between the Soviet politburo and American intelligence agencies for the deconstruction of the communist elements of the Soviet state, initiating the sequence of events that became known as perestroika . This was systemic and psychological warfare and negotiation with members of the government and Soviet elite, which neutralized the Soviet Union allowing for a collapse of the communist component. A regime change. Silent Coup in America Today? 
We see hints of many of these same elements at play in American politics today. 
Recent revelations made public by Wikileaks impacted the result of the 2016 election. The timing of the releases and the overtly partisan nature of their contents, targeting only the Democrat campaign, revealed a clear bias, opening the door to speculation of a connection between Julian Assange and deeper state actors in both the Russian and the American intelligence communities. 
The primary defensive play of the Democrats was to blame Russia without ever providing specific evidence of Russia’s involvement in the leaks, yet some analysts indicated that the NSA was the source of the leaks , and that a silent coup had been initiated by the U.S. intelligence community covertly working to prevent a Clinton win. 
Now, after the election, the manipulation of the body politic continues as protests organized by political front groups funded by the likes of billionaire social engineer George Soros continue, and resistance to a Trump presidency picks up steam. 
The nation is clearly being manipulated by off-screen actors on both sides of the stage. Is there an attempted silent coup happening right before our eyes in the United States? 
Many of the elements of regime change noted by Pieczenik are visibly in play in America today. Religion is weaponized as Islam is being used by globalists as an invincible enemy. There are signs of a new arms race as both Russia and China demonstrate new military capabilities and global assertiveness. Economic warfare is in play as the banking and financial crisis created by central banks continues to destabilize the financial system. There are elements of a cultural war in the U.S. as millennials and so-called social justice warriors are attempting to disrupt civil discourse, essentially advocating for the end of free speech . And as we see in recent election events, there is some type of negotiation taking place behind the scenes in American politics between several factions. 
In the end, the American people may very well be at the mercy of those who are maneuvering to drastically alter the social, cultural and political environment in the U.S. Unfortunately these maneuvers would only lead to greater system of control and authoritarianism than we already have, unless the body politic wakes up refuses to allow themselves to be weaponized and used as pawns by the oligarchy .

9595,"Narendra Modi Bolsters India’s Ties With U.S., Thanks (Partly) to Donald Trump - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   After decades of mistrust and fitful reconciliation efforts, India and the United States made a turn toward cooperation on Tuesday, and Donald J. Trump can claim at least some of the credit. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, making his second visit to the White House in two years, announced a crucial step toward ratification of the Paris agreement to limit greenhouse gases, bringing the accord close to full implementation. The two sides also announced that they intended to complete a deal in which India will buy six nuclear reactors from Westinghouse by June 2017, fulfilling an agreement struck in 2005 by President George W. Bush. The price is still under discussion, but more difficult issues like liability have been resolved. “We continue to discuss a wide range of areas where we can cooperate more effectively in order to promote jobs, promote investment, promote trade and promote greater opportunities for our people, particularly young people, in both of our countries,” President Obama said in the Oval Office during the meeting. Mr. Modi responded with his own praise of the burgeoning partnership. When President Obama visited India in January 2015, Mr. Modi referred to him as “Barack” and thanked him for his “deep personal commitment” to their friendship. In the Oval Office on Tuesday, Mr. Modi referred to the president as “my friend Obama. ” “The United States is well aware of the talent that India has,” Mr. Modi said in Hindi. “We and the United States can work together to bring forward this talent, and use it for the benefit of mankind and use it for the benefit of innovations and use it to achieve new progress. ” Mr. Modi has made clear that he intends to set aside decades of standoffishness  —   rooted in India’s colonial experience  —   to cement closer ties with Washington, in part because the next American leader may not share President Obama’s enthusiasm for India. The news media in India has extensively chronicled comments by Mr. Trump that critics have said were racist, his “America First” views and his unorthodox campaign. While Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has said little about India, his vows to tighten immigration policies worry Indian officials. “Modi wants to get as much as he can out of Obama’s last months in office,” said Ashley J. Tellis, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. For the Americans, the most important part of Mr. Modi’s visit was his announced intention to formally join the Paris climate change agreement by the end of this year. So far, countries representing about 50 percent of global emissions have announced that they will submit legal paperwork to the United Nations documenting their compliance with the deal. The pact will become binding when at least 55 countries representing 55 percent of global emissions formally join. The inclusion of India, the world’s   emitter after China and the United States, would guarantee that the deal will go into effect before the next American president takes office. Mr. Trump has vowed to “cancel” the Paris climate agreement if elected, something Mr. Obama is eager to prevent. Once the accord enters into legal force, no nation can legally withdraw for four years. “If the Paris agreement achieves ratification before Inauguration Day, it would be impossible for the Trump administration to renegotiate or even drop out during the first presidential term,” said Robert N. Stavins, the director of the environmental economics program at Harvard. Mr. Obama and Mr. Modi also announced a separate agreement to cut the use of hydrofluorocarbons, potent   chemicals produced by coolants in refrigerators and  . India and the United States have been at odds on the details of such a deal, but the agreement announced on Tuesday means both governments now expect in October to sign on to an international accord to phase out the chemicals. Phasing out the chemicals could reduce by 25 percent the expected warming of the planet by the end of the century. “This is the most significant step the international community could take” to reduce climate warming, Brian Deese, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama, said in a call with reporters. The two sides also announced joint efforts for the United States to invest in India’s renewable energy development, including the creation of a $20 million finance initiative. The last time Mr. Modi visited, in September 2014, he was invited to dinner but announced that he was observing a religious fast. So Mr. Obama had the awkward task of eating before a guest who sipped only water. This time, at a working lunch, Mr. Modi ate. On Wednesday, Mr. Modi will become the fifth Indian prime minister to address both houses of Congress. The two countries finalized a deal that allows their forces to help each other with crucial supplies, and the United States formally recognized India as a major defense partner, which should allow India to buy some of the most sophisticated equipment in the United States arsenal. India’s increasing willingness to form military partnerships with the United States is, in part, a result of its deepening worries about China. Recent patrols by Chinese submarines in the Bay of Bengal have unnerved New Delhi, and a 2014 visit to India by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, did nothing to soothe Indian sensibilities, as Chinese troops made an incursion into border territory that India claims as its own. China’s refusal in the months since to resolve the territorial claims at the heart of the standoff has quietly infuriated Indian officials. Another reason Washington and New Delhi have grown so close is the increasingly testy relationship between the United States and Pakistan, India’s longtime rival. Although Pakistan is formally an ally of the United States, American officials have made clear that India has displaced Pakistan in American interests and hearts. “We have much more to do with India today than has to do with Pakistan,” Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said in April. “There is important business with respect to Pakistan, but we have much more, a whole global agenda with India, agenda that covers all kinds of issues. ”",0
9596,A Single Concussion May Have Lasting Impact - The New York Times,"A single concussion experienced by a child or teenager may have lasting repercussions on mental health and intellectual and physical functioning throughout adulthood, and multiple head injuries increase the risks of later problems, according to one of the largest, most elaborate studies to date of the impacts of head trauma on the young. You cannot be an athlete, parent of an athlete, sports fan or reader of this newspaper and not be aware that concussions appear to be both more common  —   and more dangerous  —   than most of us once thought. According to a report released last week by the health insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield, based on data from medical claims nationwide, the incidence of diagnosed concussions among people under the age of 20 climbed 71 percent between 2010 and 2015. The rates rose most steeply among girls, with the incidence soaring by 119 percent during that time, although almost twice as many concussions over all were diagnosed in boys. The report acknowledges that the startling increase may partly reflect a growing awareness of the injury among parents, sports officials and physicians, which has led to more diagnoses. But the sheer numbers also suggest that more young people, particularly young athletes, are experiencing head injuries than in the past. Similar increases have been noted among young people in other nations. But the consequences, if any, for their health during adulthood have largely remained unknown. So for the new study, which was funded primarily by the Wellcome Trust and published in August in PLOS Medicine, scientists from Oxford University, Indiana University, the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and other universities turned to an extensive trove of data about the health of people in Sweden. A plethora of linked registries in that nation contain information about people’s medical and hospital visits, socioeconomic status, education, physical disabilities and other aspects of their lives, says Dr. Seena Fazel, a professor of forensic psychiatry at Oxford and the new study’s senior author. The registries also allow researchers to compile information about family members. In this case, the scientists concentrated on all Swedes born between 1973 and 1985 and looked for those who had experienced a head injury of some kind before the age of 25. More than 104, 000 people qualified. The researchers pulled data about these people for 40 years or until someone had either died or emigrated from Sweden. For each participant, the researchers also compiled comparable medical and other records for a sibling who had never been given a diagnosis of a head injury and compared outcomes both between family members and against the full population of the country. The results were discomfiting. Young people who had experienced a single diagnosed concussion  —   which the researchers categorized as a mild traumatic brain injury  —   were much more likely than the nation’s general population and than their own siblings to be receiving medical disability payments as adults. They also were significantly more likely to have sought mental health care and much less likely to have graduated from high school or to have attended college than their uninjured brother or sister. And they were about twice as likely as an uninjured sibling to die prematurely. The possibility of lingering physical or psychological problems during adulthood rose precipitously, the researchers found, if someone had experienced more than one concussion while young, or if his or her brain injury had been more severe than a concussion. The outcomes also generally were worse if someone had experienced head trauma after the age of 15, probably because the brain is less resilient than in earlier childhood, Dr. Fazel says. (The researchers did not quantify the causes of the injuries in this study, but past research shows that in the very young, he says, brain injuries usually result from falls, with sports becoming the primary cause in teenagers, and auto accidents the main cause among young adults.) There was, thankfully, encouraging news squirreled away within the data. While young people who had been hit in the head displayed heightened risks for physical and psychological difficulties as adults, most, in fact, were fine. “The majority of individuals who had diagnoses of brain injury in our study did not experience adverse outcomes,” Dr. Fazel says. Unfortunately, it is impossible at the moment to identify which children or teenagers who experience head trauma may be most at risk of struggling in later life and which will instead recover without apparent complications, he says. So the message of this study further underscores that, whenever possible, we should take steps to prevent childhood head injuries. While “there are lots of benefits from sports,” Dr. Fazel says, it may be important to consider changes to the rules or equipment in contact sports, like football and soccer, to try to reduce head trauma. If a young person does suffer head trauma, he continues, more and   monitoring is also probably a good idea. Such monitoring may be especially important if the child shows any signs of “a decline in psychosocial performance,” he says, such as a drop in grades or a change, even subtle, in personality. A neurologist can provide useful assessments, and regular   neurological assessments may need to be continued, even into adulthood.",0
9597,Arianna Huffington Exposed Colluding With DNC in New WikiLeaks Emails,"We Are Change 
According to the Code of Ethics for Journalism (yes we have one of those):
“A journalist should behave in such a way as not to become a victim of a collision of real or hidden interests.
He/she should reject privileges or presents which could influence his/her opinion or create such an impression. They should not take part in activities that endanger his/her professional integrity.The professional status of the journalist is not compatible with occupying a position in state bodies, or in the headquarters of political parties and other political organizations. If work in political parties causes conflict of interests, raises or may raise the question of objectivity of mass media, it is not acceptable. Conflicts of interests damage the prestige of mass media.” 
That being said, award winning journalist and The Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington sought a ‘useful’ role in the Democratic party, and pledged to use HuffPost to ‘Echo [the DNC’s] Message’.
The part-time media tycoon and full-time socialite sought to play a “useful” role within the Democratic Party establishment by using her website to quote “echo” the party message, according to emails published by WikiLeaks.

In an April 2008 email to top Democratic operatives, including Paul Begala, Stan Greenberg, David Brock, and current Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, Democratic operative Susan McCue relayed a discussion she had with Huffington about advancing the Democratic cause in an official capacity.
Huffington, explained McCue, suggested that she would be more comfortable in a role of covert influence, and “using Huffpo to echo our message.” The media tycoon “has a point,” McCue conceded.
Back in October a HuffPo writer by the name of David Seamen went public that HuffPo and Arianna, was editing and censoring his material. https://youtu.be/hIcImy1MKuc Funny thing is that just prior to David going public the DNC held an “Off-the-Record” party for main stream reporters, news anchors, and editors. Guccifer 2.0 provided The Intercept with emails revealing “friendly and highly useful relationships” between the Clinton campaign and the U.S. media. Those emails showed that the Clinton campaign held a private, “off-the-record” dinner with “influential reporters, anchors and editors” No wonder only 6 percent of Americans trust the media.

Back in 2011, Huffington praised Wikileaks, saying: “If I ruled the world, my first goal would be to make it easier to cut through to the facts. At the moment, we are all drowning in spin, smokescreens and lies. Those who perpetrated the two biggest policy disasters of the past ten years—the Iraq war and the financial crisis—could not have pulled their work off without a lack of transparency. So greater transparency would be at the top of my agenda..The internet has already shown great promise in cutting through spin. YouTube, Twitter, email, and turbocharged search engines have made it easier to expose our leaders’ distortions. But if I were in charge, I’d go much further to protect the rights of disclosure and free speech on the internet, and challenge the press—particularly in America—to break its addiction to faux objectivity.”

9598,Rethinking the Khazar Theory!,"360 Views Share: By Dr. David Duke. When I was first began to understand the ultra-racist, supremacist ideology of Judaism and Zionism, I came into contact with the theory that present-day Jews are genetically unrelated to the historical Jewish community. The allegation, known as the “”Khazar theory”, claims that the Ashkenazim Jews of today are actually the descendants of the Khazar people, a Central Asiatic nomadic tribe that allegedly converted to Judaism in the 9th Century AD. It is claimed that these newly-minted Jews then migrated into what is now Russia, Eastern Europe and later Western and Northern Europe. The theory is also used to advance the idea that Jewish actions are character are not genetic or racial because the Khazar people adopted the Talmudic values of Shephardic and other Jews who were unrelated to them. Interestingly enough, the Khazar theory was launched, and is still to this day, driven primarily by Communist Jews and other Jews who promote it in the Gentile community as a refutation that the Jews can’t be racist because they are not a race! It is ironic that the three most prominent exponents of the theory that “the Jews are not a race” all have almost exaggerated caricatures of features people ascribe as Jewish. Above, left to right: Zionist extremist and Communist Party member Arthur Koestler (author of the “The Thirteenth Tribe”); Jewish geneticist Eran Elhaik; and Shlomo Sand, an Israeli academic and former member of the Union of Israeli Communist Youth (Banki). All three maintain that large numbers of present-day Jews are completely genetically unrelated to the Middle Eastern-origin Jews who wrote the Babylonian Talmud. 
For years I accepted the Khazar theory as true. After it, all it was repeated by some writers who also recognized the leading Jewish role in Communism and their leadership in many other subversive movements. It was only later, when I considered the question logically and scientifically, were my doubts about the Khazar theory aroused. One thing that I did not know then was that Koestler, the communist Jew who popularized the Khazar Theory bragged in a Jewish magazine that he advanced the theory as way to fight against anti-Semitism. His theory was that since the Gospels and Europeans blamed Jews for the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, if he could make Europeans believe that they are not related by blood to the Christkiller Jews talked about in the New Testament that he could lessen hatred against Jews. One must remember until the Jewish triumph of “Christian Zionism” 99 percent of Christianity viewed Jews as the greatest enemies of Jesus Christ and God, as the New Testament makes very, very clear. So in those days some Jews, such as Koestler saw an advantage to say that the Jews were not actually related to the Jews who crucified Christ and so persecuted Christians. Koestler’s official biography, written by Michael Scammell, specifically quotes him on why he wrote The Thirteenth Tribe . ”His argument was that if he could persuade people that a non-Jewish “Khazar” heritage formed the basis of modern Jews, then this would be a weapon against European racially-based anti-Semitism. “Should this theory be confirmed, the term ‘anti-Semitism’ would become void of meaning,” he said. According to Scammell, Koestler told French biologist Pierre Debray-Ritzen he “was convinced that if he could prove that the bulk of Eastern European Jews were descended from the Khazars, the racial basis for anti-Semitism would be removed and anti-Semitism itself could disappear.” (Source: Scammell, Michael. Koestler: The Literary and Political Odyssey of a Twentieth-Century Skeptic, Random House, 2009, ISBN 978-0-394-57630-5, p. 546.) In the 1950s the Khazar Theory was also promoted by Benjamin Friedman, a prominent rich Jew who converted to Christianity and turned against the Jews. It was certainly self-serving for him to promote the idea that Jewishness was mostly cultural and religious and not racial in nature therefore facilitating more acceptance of him. There are three fundamental issues which need to addressed: the scientific evidence; thehistorical-logical evidence; and the reasons why the Khazar theory came about. Part I: The Scientific Evidence—Twelve DNA Studies Which Disprove the “Khazar Theory” 1. A 1999 study titled “Jewish and Middle Eastern non-Jewish populations share a common pool of Y-chromosome biallelic haplotypes” ( M.F. Hammer et.al, Proceedings of the US National Academy of Sciences 6769–6774, doi: 10.1073/pnas.100115997 ) found that: “[D]espite their long-term residence in different countries and isolation from one another, most Jewish populations were not significantly different from one another at the genetic level. “Admixture estimates suggested low levels of European Y-chromosome gene flow into Ashkenazi and Roman Jewish communities . . . Jewish and Middle Eastern non-Jewish populations were not statistically different. The results support the hypothesis that the paternal gene pools of Jewish communities from Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East descended from a common Middle Eastern ancestral population, and suggest that most Jewish communities have remained relatively isolated from neighboring non-Jewish communities during and after the Diaspora.” 2. A November 2001 study titled “The Y Chromosome Pool of Jews as Part of the Genetic Landscape of the Middle East” ( Almut Nebel et. al., American Journal of Human Genetics, Nov 2001; 69(5): 1095–1112 ) found that in most Jewish populations, male line ancestors appear to have been mainly Middle Eastern. The study found that Ashkenazi Jews in particular “share more common paternal lineages with other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than with non-Jewish populations in areas where Jews lived in Eastern Europe, Germany and the French Rhine Valley. This is consistent with Jewish traditions in placing most Jewish paternal origins in the region of the Middle East.” 3. A September 2006 study titled “European Population Substructure: Clustering of Northern and Southern Populations” ( Michael F Seldin et.al., PLOS Genetics, DOI: 0.1371/journal.pgen.0020143 ) found that both Ashkenazi Jews as well as Sephardic Jews showed more than 85% membership in the ‘southern’ European group which made their results “consistent with a later Mediterranean origin of these ethnic groups.” 4. An April 2008 study titled “Counting the Founders: The Matrilineal Genetic Ancestry of the Jewish Diaspora” ( Doron M. Behar et.al., PLoS ONE. 2008; 3(4): e2062. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0002062 ) found that about 40% of Ashkenazi Jews originate maternally from just four female founders, who were of Middle Eastern origin. 5. A January 2009 study titled “A genome-wide genetic signature of Jewish ancestry perfectly separates individuals with and without full Jewish ancestry in a large random sample of European Americans” ( Anna C Need et.al., Genome Biology, 2009; 10(1): R7. doi: 10.1186/gb-2009-10-1-r7 ) found that “individuals with full Jewish ancestry formed a clearly distinct cluster from those individuals with no Jewish ancestry.” This study showed that in DNA terms, Jews, both Sephardic and Ashkenazim, cluster as a distinct group—something that, if the Khazar theory was true, would be impossible. 6. A December 2009 study titled “Genomic microsatellites identify shared Jewish ancestry intermediate between Middle Eastern and European populations” ( Naama M Kopelman et.al., BMC Genetics. 2009; 10: 80. doi: 10.1186/1471-2156-10-80 ) found that : “Jewish populations show a high level of genetic similarity to each other, clustering together in several types of analysis of population structure. These results support the view that the Jewish populations largely share a common Middle Eastern ancestry and that over their history they have undergone varying degrees of admixture with non-Jewish populations of European descent.” 7. A December 2009 study titled “The genome-wide structure of the Jewish people” ( Doron M. Behar, et. al., Nature 466, 238–242 (08 July 2010) doi:10.1038/nature09103 ) analyzed individuals from 14 Jewish Diaspora communities and compare these patterns of genome-wide diversity with those from 69 Old World non-Jewish populations in order to “provide comprehensive comparisons between Jewish and non-Jewish populations in the Diaspora, as well as with non-Jewish populations from the Middle East and north Africa.” The results identified a “previously unrecognized genetic substructure within the Middle East” and that “Most Jewish samples form a remarkably tight subcluster,” and that “trace[s] the origins of most Jewish Diaspora communities to the Levant.” 8. A June 2010 study titled “Abraham’s children in the genome era: major Jewish diaspora populations comprise distinct genetic clusters with shared Middle Eastern ancestry” ( Atzmon et al., American Journal of Human Genetics, 2010;86:850-859 ) refuted the idea of large-scale genetic contributions of Central and Eastern European and Slavic populations to the formation of Ashkenazi Jewry. This study found used genome-wide analysis of seven Jewish groups (Iranian, Iraqi, Syrian, Italian, Turkish, Greek, and Ashkenazi) and “demonstrated distinctive Jewish population clusters, each with shared Middle Eastern ancestry, proximity to contemporary Middle Eastern populations, and variable degrees of European and North African admixture.” This paper specifically excluded the “Khazar theory” as an origin for present-day Jews, saying “the genetic proximity . . . is incompatible with theories that Ashkenazi Jews are for the most part the direct lineal descendants of converted Khazars or Slavs.” 9. A March 2012 study by Steven M. Bray et. al., titled “Signatures of founder effects, admixture, and selection in the Ashkenazi Jewish population” ( Proceedings of the US National Academy of Sciences, 16222–16227, doi: 10.1073/pnas.1004381107 ) found that the “Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population . . . has a common Middle Eastern origin with other Jewish Diaspora populations” while concluding that the Ashkenazi Jewish population has had the most European admixture. 10. A March 2012 study by Christopher L. Campbell et. al., titled “North African Jewish and non-Jewish populations form distinctive, orthogonal clusters” ( Proceedings of the US National Academy of Sciences, doi: 10.1073/pnas.1204840109 ) found that genome-wide analysis of five North African Jewish groups (Moroccan, Algerian, Tunisian, Djerban, and Libyan) “demonstrated distinctive North African Jewish population clusters with proximity to other Jewish populations.” Furthermore, the study showed, the Sephardic Jewish genome is “compatible with the history of North African Jews—founding during Classical Antiquity with proselytism of local populations, followed by genetic isolation with the rise of Christianity and then Islam, and admixture following the emigration of Sephardic Jews during the Inquisition.” Finally, this study added “ These populations showed a high degree of endogamy and were part of a larger Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jewish group.” (*Endogamy: the practice of marrying within a specific ethnic group, rejecting others on such a basis as being unsuitable for marriage or for other close personal relationships.) 11. In his book, “Legacy: A Genetic History of the Jewish People” (Oxford University Press, USA; May 2012), Harry Ostrer, a professor of Pathology and Genetics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University and Director of Genetic and Genomic Testing at Montefiore Medical Center, Medicine, concluded that “Jews exhibit a distinctive genetic signature.” ( Jews Are a ‘Race,’ Genes Reveal–Author Uncovers DNA Links Between Members of Tribe, The Jewish Daily Forward, May 04, 2012 ). Ostrer, who is also director of genetic and genomic testing at Montefiore Medical Center, said in his conclusion that “Jews are a homogeneous group with all the scientific trappings of what we used to call a race.” Ostrer also deals specifically with the Khazar theory. He pointed out that the findings from the Jewish HapMap Project (see below) completely refute “the theories that Ashkenazi Jews are the descendants of converted Khazars or Slavs.” ( Jews: A religious group, people or race?, Jerusalem Post, 8/26/2012 ) 12. The Jewish HapMap Project , a joint project of Albert Einstein College of Medicine and New York University School of Medicine, was created to “understand the structure of the genomes in Jewish populations” and is an outgrowth of the Human HapMap Project. According to this project, “Jewish populations are remarkable for maintaining continuous genetic, cultural, and religious traditions over 4000 years, despite residence all over the world.” Its findings, based on first hand DNA studies amongst Jewish populations around the globe, found no evidence to support a Central Asian DNA origin for Jewry. According to the Jerusalem Post, the “Jewish HapMap Project in New York City has so far shown “in exquisite detail what had been conjectured for a century. Jewish populations from the major Jewish Diaspora groups – Ashkenazi, Sephardic and Mizrahi – form a distinctive population cluster that is closely related to Semitic and European populations. Within this larger Jewish cluster, each of the Jewish populations formed its own subcluster. “A high degree of mixing of Ashkenazi, Sephardi, Italian and Syrian Jews caused them to become more closely related to each other than they were to Middle Eastern, Iraqi and Iranian Jews. This genetic split seemed to have occurred about 2,500 years ago.” ( Jews: A religious group, people or race?, Jerusalem Post, 8/26/2012 ) DNA Studies Find that Ashkenazim Jews have 30% European Admixture Both the Behar study (section 7 above) and the Atzmon study (section 8 above) were commented upon by the British former deputy editor of the journal Nature , and currently the scientific correspondent for the N ew York Times , Nicholas Wade, in an article in that newspaper as follows: “Jewish communities in Europe and the Middle East share many genes inherited from the ancestral Jewish population that lived in the Middle East some 3,000 years ago, even though each community also carries genes from other sources — usually the country in which it lives,” adding that a “major surprise from both surveys is the genetic closeness of the two Jewish communities of Europe, the Ashkenazim and the Sephardim.” Wade pointed out that the two studies “refute the suggestion made by the historian Shlomo Sand in his book ‘The Invention of the Jewish People’ that Jews have no common origin but are a miscellany of people in Europe and Central Asia who converted to Judaism at various times. “Jewish communities from Europe, the Middle East and the Caucasus all have substantial genetic ancestry that traces back to the Levant; Ethiopian Jews and two Judaic communities in India are genetically much closer to their host populations,” Wade wrote. “The shared genetic elements suggest that members of any Jewish community are related to one another as closely as are fourth or fifth cousins in a large population, which is about 10 times higher than the relationship between two people chosen at random off the streets of New York City. “Ashkenazic and Sephardic Jews have roughly 30 percent European ancestry, with most of the rest from the Middle East, the two surveys find. The two communities seem very similar to each other genetically, which is unexpected because they have been separated for so long.” ( Studies Show Jews’ Genetic Similarity, Nicholas Wade, New York Times, June 9, 2010 ). Eran Elhaik’s Single Study Attempts to Refute the Mass of Earlier DNA Evidence The mass of DNA and genetic evidence is, therefore, overwhelmingly indicative that, despite a certain amount of European admixture among Ashkenazim Jewry, there is still a clearly definable Middle Eastern genetic component to both Ashkenazim and Sephardic Jewry. Despite all of these studies—and many more, too numerous to list individually here—in December 2012, a single individual by the name of Eran Elhaik, from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, attempted to refute all of the above mentioned evidence. His paper, titled “The Missing Link of Jewish European Ancestry: Contrasting the Rhineland and the Khazarian Hypotheses” was published in the journal Genome Biological Evolution ( (2013) 5 (1):61-74.doi: 10.1093/gbe/evs119 ). In a nutshell, Elhaik—whose rather obviously Jewish physical appearance should by itself indicate that there is indeed a common Jewish “type” (how else can many Jews be physically “recognized” as Jews?)—argues that his method of doing comparative studies between present-day Central Asian populations, Ashkenazim Jews and non-Jewish test groups, “proves” that Ashkenazim Jews are a hotchpotch of genetic origins, with a strong link to what he identifies as the “Khazar” tribe. Even though Elhaik’s work is the only single paper (as opposed to literally dozens of opposing DNA studies), written by a single Jewish individual (as opposed to the other papers which were written by dozens and dozens of scientists from around the globe, Jewish and non-Jewish alike), it has quickly become the most-quoted “proof” of the “Khazar Theory.” Critical Errors in Elhaik’s Paper Elhaik’s paper has a number of errors, some small and a number of major ones. But they are all serious, because even the “small” errors cast doubt on his academic ability and motivation. For example, his paper discusses in detail what he sees as the geographic origin of the Khazars—yet he completely misidentifies the geographic location of one of his test sample groups, the Mbuti and Biaka Pygmies. These two groups, Elhaik asserts at least twice, are to be found in “South Africa.” Actually, the Mbuti and Biaka Pygmies are nowhere near South Africa, and are only to be found literally half a continent away, in the Congo. While this may seem a “small” error, it does indicate sloppiness in research which certainly does not bode well for the rest of the paper. This sloppiness is again repeated when Elhaik asserts that “Eastern and Central European Jews account for approximately 90% of over 13 million worldwide Jews.” In reality, the figure is far less. Of the estimated 13 million Jews worldwide, 8 million are Ashkenazim and 5 million are Sephardic, a division of 61% “European Jews” to 39% “non-European Jews.” And it should be pointed out that the Zionist State of Israel actually has a Sephardic and Mizrahi (non-Ashkenazi) Jewish majority among Jews. These actual facts on Jewish ethnicity are readily available, and Elhaik’s motivation for making this clearly false claim could only be ascribed to a desire to underscore his general assertion, namely that most Jews are not Middle Eastern in origin and that Jews are not race, or a genetically similar people. The most important error in Elhaik’s paper, however, is actually openly admitted: namely that there is actually no “Khazar DNA” in existence, against which any sort of measurement can be taken. Elhaik himself admits this in his paper: the “Khazars have been vanquished and their remains have yet to be sequenced. . .” —in other words there is no record of what exactly Khazar DNA might have been. As there is no record of what Khazar DNA is—it is, ipso facto, physically impossible to determine who is descended from it and who is not. Elhaik attempts to circumvent this major problem by selecting what he calls “surrogate populations”—in this case, “contemporary Middle Eastern and Caucasus populations.” Anyone with a basic understanding of historical events in the Caucasus in particular will immediately see that Elhaik’s assertion that current populations in that region can be taken to reflect those of 1,500 years ago, is highly problematic and quite simply, unsustainable. The Caucasus, a region at the border of Europe and Asia, situated between the Black and the Caspian seas, has been crisscrossed by numerous peoples and races over the last 2000 years, ranging from Indo-Europeans, Semites, Mongols and others—and is today highly genetically diverse. A claim that DNA samples from this region can be taken as any sort of DNA yardstick, is dubious to say the very least. Finally, Elhaik’s methodology in comparing the DNA samples is, to make an understatement, unique to him. As Marcus Feldman, director of Stanford University’s Morrison Institute for Population and Resource Studies, said, “He [Elhaik] appears to be applying the statistics in a way that gives him different results from what everybody else has obtained from essentially similar data.” ( ‘Jews a Race’ Genetic Theory Comes Under Fierce Attack by DNA Expert. The Jewish Daily Forward, May 07, 2013 ) Interestingly, the study which was cited in the New York Times of the “Jews as a race” is exactly the same conclusion that was reached by German National Socialist anthropologists and other experts who studied race science in the United States and elsewhere. Also, many of the present-day extensive studies have been carried out by both Gentile and Jewish geneticists alike, obviating any claims of racial bias. Elhaik’s theory is completely refuted by the new, most massive and most complete study ever done of the Jewish Genome One of Elhaik’s arguments was that the previous studies (referenced above) “were done in the pregenome-wide era using uniparental markers and including different reference populations”—implying that their results are not in line with the most modern DNA sequencing methodology. In fact, at least one study—which appeared after Elhaik’s work was first published—has confirmed the accuracy of the original studies, and also completely refuted Elhaik’s hypothesis. Titled “No Evidence from Genome-Wide Data of a Khazar Origin for the Ashkenazi Jews,” this study was published by the journal Human Biology in August 2013 (Behar, Doron M. et.al.; Human Biology, Access Pre-Prints. Paper 41 ), this paper emphasized the serious error with Elhaik’s work: “Because the Khazar population has left no obvious modern descendants that could enable a clear test for a contribution to Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, the Khazar hypothesis has been difficult to examine using genetics. “Furthermore, because only limited genetic data have been available from the Caucasus region, and because these data have been concentrated in populations that are genetically close to populations from the Middle East, the attribution of any signal of Ashkenazi-Caucasus genetic similarity to Khazar ancestry rather than shared ancestral Middle Eastern ancestry has been problematic.” This latest, most massive study of the Jewish genome was a worldwide effort of geneticists, both Gentile and Jewish, to analyze Jewish genetics. Researchers from laboratories around the globe, including Estonia, Russia, Italy, Greece, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Armenia, the US, and Israel, gathered together the largest Jewish DNA data set ever yet assembled. The paper explained as follows: “Here, through integration of genotypes on newly collected samples with data from several of our past studies, we have assembled the largest data set available to date for assessment of Ashkenazi Jewish genetic origins.” “Employing a variety of standard techniques for the analysis of population genetic structure, we find that Ashkenazi Jews share the greatest genetic ancestry with other Jewish populations, and among non-Jewish populations, with groups from Europe and the Middle East. “No particular similarity of Ashkenazi Jews with populations from the Caucasus is evident, particularly with the populations that most closely represent the Khazar region. Thus, analysis of Ashkenazi Jews together with a large sample from the region of the Khazar Khaganate corroborates the earlier results that Ashkenazi Jews derive their ancestry primarily from populations of the Middle East and Europe, that they possess considerable shared ancestry with other Jewish populations, and that there is no indication of a significant genetic contribution either from within or from north of the Caucasus region.” The latest, most up-to-date and modern DNA analysis has, therefore, completely refuted the “Khazar Theory.” It is important to understand that this refutation has come from non-Jewish and Jewish scientists from dozens of different universities and geneticists all over the world, and cannot be ascribed to a “conspiracy.” Part II: The Historical-Logical Evidence The Historical Record Shows Jewish Physical Consistency One of the most obvious indicators of genetic commonality is physical appearance. European people broadly resemble each other; African people broadly resemble each other; Chinese people broadly resemble each other; Australian Aborigines broadly resemble each other and so on. It is a characteristic of genetically similar people to physically resemble each other. Jews are no different in this regard to any other people. They too show a resemblance to each other—this is why it is possible to often “recognize” a Jewish person by his physical appearance. A good example in point is the already mentioned Jewish geneticist Eran Elhaik, who, despite physically embodying a Jewish sterrotype recognized around the world, tries to claim that there is no genetic commonality amongst Jews. The “Khazar theory” holds that most Ashkenazim Jews are not Semitic, but are “Central Asian” converts to Judaism. Proponents of the “Khazar theory” fail to understand the logical consequence of their belief—namely that a supposed Central Asian origin of “most” Ashkenazim Jews means that they will not physically resemble other Jews. As anyone can see, this is not the case. Sephardic Jews are, on average, slightly darker than Ashkenazim Jews, but there is no doubt that there is a physical similarity which allows them still to be recognized as such. Above: These two illustrations make the point even more dramatically. On the left, the Ashkenazim Jewess, Barbara Streisand, New York, 1966. On the right, a Jewish leader of Israelite trade delegation as portrayed on a mural on the wall of the 18th Dynasty (1400 BC) Tomb of Sobekhotep, Thutmose IV; Egypt. Two thousand years before the alleged Khazar conversion and they look the same as modern Ashkenazi Jews. Streisand’s paternal grandparents came from Galicia (Poland–Ukraine) and her maternal grandparents came from Russia—if anyone would be “Khazar,” according to that theory, it would be her. Nonetheless, she closely resembles the only designated Jew as portrayed on an Egyptian tomb from 3.400 years ago, the leader of a Jewish trade delegation to Egypt. The genetic continuity is clear—and if the Khazar theory was true, there would be no physical similarity, because there would have been a racial sea change in Jewish appearance. Left: The famous banker of Pompeii, Jucundus, who lived circa 20–62 AD. (700 years before the alleged Ashkenazi conversion) Identified as a Jew by the German anthropologist, Hans F.K. Günther, in his book “ Racial Elements of European History” (Fig, 240a and b, chapter VIII) . Alongside, the Ashkenazi Jew, Abe Foxman of the ADL. The similarity between Jucundus and Foxman is clear, and serves a further indication of the physical continuity of the Jewish type over centuries—something that would be impossible if the “Khazar theory” was true. In addition to genetic studies, there have been extensive physiological comparison of Jewish remains from burial sites from ancient Israel and present-day Ashkenazi and Sephardic physiology, all of which conclusively shows their similarity across both the Sephardic and Ashkenazi spectrum—and their difference from European populations. Jewish Supremacist Behavior Through the Millennia Disprove the “Khazar Theory” Another piece of the jigsaw which disproves the Khazar theory, is that Jewish Supremacist behavior has remained constant throughout the millennia—from biblical times right through to the present day. Most Christians are aware of the behavior of the Old Testament Jews—who burn, rampage, kill rape and enslave their way through Palestine supposedly on order of their tribal God. They are aware of the fact that the gospels of the New Testament show that elite of the Jews, the Pharisees, were the biggest enemies of Christ and arranged for his crucifixion, and the New Testament is clear that they led the persecution of Christians which has continued through both Jewish Bolshevism and the cultural assault in the Zio global media. It must also be clear that the Talmud, the books of Jewish law promoting Jewish extremist supremacism and hatred against all non-Jews, was written hundreds of years before any alleged Khazar conversion. While it another debate altogether as to the historical accuracy of those events, there is no question about Jewish interaction with Gentiles—and Romans in particular—during the first century AD. The world’s first anti-Jewish riots broke out in the city of Alexandria in 38 AD, and re-occurred in 66 AD, 115 AD, 118 AD, and 411 AD. In that year, the archbishop of Alexandria, Cyril, ordered the expulsion of all Jews from the city. The Roman historian Socrates of Constantinople (not be confused with the Socrates of Classical Greece), in his Ecclesiastical History, recorded the reasons for this first great expulsion of Jews from a non-Jewish city in detail, and reveals behavior by Jewish Supremacists exactly as the world experiences it today, over 1,500 years later: “. . .[T]he Jews were continually factious; and there was added to their ordinary hatred of the Christians . . . Cyril, on being informed of this, sent for the principal Jews, and threatened them with the utmost severities unless they desisted from their molestation of the Christians. These menaces, instead of suppressing their violence, only rendered the Jewish populace more furious, and led them to form conspiracies for the destruction of the Christians, one of which was of so desperate a character as to cause their entire expulsion from Alexandria” (Socrates, Hist. Eccl., VII, 13; PC, LXXXII, 759 ff). The very first Jewish community outside of the Middle East was established in Rome in 139 BC—and it was not long before their activities roused Roman public opinion against them. The famous orator Cicero, among others, frequently spoke against the presence of Jews during sittings of the Roman senate. In his famous Pro Flacco oration (which dealt with the case of a Roman aristocrat, Lucius Valerius Flaccus, accused of unlawfully confiscating Jewish money), Cicero said: “Now let us take a look at the Jews and their mania for gold. You chose this site, [chief prosecutor] Laelius, and the crowd which frequents it, with an eye to this particular accusation, knowing very well that Jews with their large numbers and tendency to act as a clique are valuable supporters to have at any kind of public meeting.” Many other prominent and famous Romans, such as Seneca, Juneval, and Tacitus all went on record as complaining about the activities of Jews within the Roman Empire. The Roman historian Tacitus, in his most famous work, Histories, described the activities of the Jews as follows: “In order to secure the allegiance of his people in the future, Moses prescribed for them a novel religion quite different from those of the rest of mankind. Among the Jews all things are profane that we hold sacred; on the other hand they regard as permissible what seems to us immoral . . . The other practices of the Jews are sinister and revolting, and have entrenched themselves by their very wickedness. Wretches of the most abandoned kind who had no use for the religion of their fathers took to contributing dues and free-will offerings to swell the Jewish exchequer; and other reasons for their increasing wealth may be found in their stubborn loyalty and ready benevolence towards brother Jews. “But the rest of the world they confront with the hatred reserved for enemies. They will not feed or intermarry with gentiles. Though a most lascivious people, the Jews avoid sexual intercourse with women of alien race. Among themselves nothing is barred. They have introduced the practice of circumcision to show that they are different from others.” (Tacitus, Histories, 5.2–5). The famous British historian Edward Gibbon, in his monumental work, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, (Lippincourt, Philadelphia, 1878, vol. 2, page 4), discussed Jewish Supremacist behavior in Roman times this way: “From the reign of Nero to that of Antoninus Pius, the Jews discovered a fierce impatience of the dominion of Rome, which repeatedly broke out in the most furious massacres and insurrections. Humanity is shocked at the recital of horrid cruelties which they committed in the cities of Egypt, of Cyria, and of Cyrene, where they dwelt in treacherous friendship with the unsuspecting natives; and we are tempted to applaud the severe retaliation which was exercised by the arms of the Legions against a race of fanatics whose dire and credulous superstition seemed to render them the implacable enemies not only of the Roman government, but of all human kind.” Anti-Jewish literature during Roman times was very widespread. One work by the Greek, Apion, was so well-known that the Romanized Jewish historian Josephus (who wrote the famous account of the Jewish uprising of 70 AD, called The Jewish Wars) wrote an entire book trying to refute Apion’s arguments. The Roman Emperor Tiberius formally expelled the Jews from Rome in 19 AD. They returned shortly thereafter, only to be expelled once again in 49 AD. In 116 AD, Emperor Trajan ordered that all Jews in Mesopotamia should be killed, saying that they were the cause of continual uprisings in that region. One of the most famous emperors of the Eastern Roman Empire, Justinian (527–565 AD), adopted a comprehensive anti-Jewish policy which barred Jews from the civil service, military posts, and any other positions of influence in his government. All of these events pre-date the supposed “Khazar conversion” by centuries—yet it can be seen that the identical behavioral patterns are on display before and after the supposed “Khazar” infusion. Logic dictates that if the racial make-up of Jews changed substantially after the year 700 AD, then their behavioral traits would also have changed. The fact that they did not, is yet more proof that there was no racial sea-change amongst Jews as is claimed by the supporters of the “Khazar theory.” The historical-logical evidence therefore clearly shows that there has been no change in Jewish Supremacist behavior from the time of the ancient Romans to the present-day. If there had been large-scale conversions, as the “Khazar theory” claims, the genetic continuity of the Jewish people would have been disrupted, which would likely have caused a change in behavior. As this behavior as remained constant, the historical account indicates that the “Khazar theory” is untrue. Part III: The Reasons Why the “Khazar Theory” Has Come About 1. The “Khazar Theory” Deflects Attention from the Most Racist Jews of all, the Sephardic Jewish Extremists, suggests that there is not “Jewish problem” but a Khazar or Ashkenazi problem. The “Khazar theory” falls down when it is understood that it only attempts to explain the origin of the “European” or Ashkenazim Jews—and completely ignores the Sephardic and Mizrahi element of Jewry, which compromises nearly 40% of all Jews today and a majority of Jews in the Zionist State of Israel. The ludicrousness of the situation is underlined when it is appreciated that the Sephardic element of Jewry tends to be the most religious and the most orthodox. They most closely follow the dictates of the Talmud and the Torah laws—and are therefore most immersed in the racist supremacy and anti-Gentile hatred which guides all Jewish behavior. It was, after all, the former chief rabbi of the Sephardic Jews in Israel who announced that Gentiles are donkeys, created by God only to serve Jews, among many other overtly racist comments. This ultra racist Jew, Rabbi Yosef, recently died and had the largest funeral in the history of Israel. By focusing on the bogus “Khazar” theory, its proponents deflect attention away from the proven historical record that Jewish Supremacist behavior is common to both Ashkenazim and Sephardic Jewish extremists. This is proven by the fact that Israel uses DNA tests to check if potential immigrants to that country are Jewish or not. If there was a wide divergence between Ashkenazim and Sephardic Jewry, as the “Khazar theory” would maintain, then it would not be possible for Israel to genetically distinguish who is a Jew and who is not. 2. The “Khazar Theory” is Popular Among Anti-Zionists (For the Wrong Reasons) In the wake of the Second World War and establishment of the Zionist State of Israel, the Khazar theory gained traction in the anti-Zionist movement. It seemed to be powerful argument against Zionism. If the leaders of the Zionist movement had no relation to the historical people called Jews in the Mideast, then the theoretical rationale of the Zionists to claim Palestine as a historical homeland, was demolished. This logic is, of course, fundamentally flawed, because it matters not if modern Jews were related or partly related to Jews who lived in the region 2,000 years earlier. No matter what the case, there is no moral justification for the Jewish terrorist creation of Israel. It is a crime against humanity to drive hundreds of thousands of men, women and children from their land and homes, terrorize them and murder thousands, just because of a claim that one’s distant ancestors supposedly lived there millennia ago. It this “logic” is carried through to its conclusion, then it would be “justified” to drive from their homes 99.9 percent of the people alive on planet Earth—because there is hardly a region on earth that has not been subjected to invasions or migrations throughout history. To explain this inconsistency another way: by using the “Khazar theory” as “proof” that the Zionists cannot claim Israel because they are not the real Jews, the anti-Zionists are in fact saying that IF it can be shown that the Zionists ARE the real Jews, then they would have the right to claim Palestine as a homeland. Remember that a majority of Jews in Israel are Sephardic or Mizrahi Jews who are non-Ashkenazi. This “logic”, as detailed above, is false. 3. The “Khazar Theory” is a Tactic to Disguise Jewish Supremacist Racism The “Khazar argument” is intrinsically related to the question of whether the present-day Jews are a religion or a race. Prominent Jews have long referred to Jews as a “race,” even in modern times. If there was any leader of world Jewry in the days before The Second World War it was Nahum Goldman, the President of the World Zionist organization. He said: “The Jews are divided into two categories, those who admit they belong to a race distinguished by a history thousands of years old, and those who don’t. The latter are open to the charge of dishonesty.” Even the current prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking before a gathering of Jews from all over the world, candidly referred to the “Jewish race”: “If Israel had not come into existence after World War II than [sic] I am certain the Jewish race wouldn’t have survived.” (Daily Pilot, Newport Beach/Costa Mesa, Feb. 28, 2000, front page.) Leading Jews have always defined themselves as much more than a religion but as people of special genealogy, and expressed the ultimate supremacism that God has chosen them above all others. Israel is a Jewish religious state, in which the religious dictates hold supreme. The rabbis determine all the important issues: immigration, education, housing, and marriage. It matters not if a person believes in God or not—the only thing that counts is if one is of Jewish lineage, or Jewish descent. It matters not if one’s Jewish mother was an atheist or a Haredim, or if her great grandmother was religious or not—what ultimately counts is one’s blood, not one’s belief in God. Ironically, this is not only true in Israel. It is true in the very synagogues of the Jewish religion across the globe. Atheist? No problem as long as if you are of the tribe. The tactic of claiming that Judaism is simply a religion is an effective defensive strategy. Whenever anyone complains about Jewish domination of any institution (achieved by favoring their own and disfavoring their non-Jewish competitors), Jewish Supremacists simply say that they are a “religion” like any other, rather than an ethnic group. People in America, Europe, and the Western world, all overwhelmingly endorse the concept of religious freedom—and thus they equate criticism of Jewish actions as “religious bigotry” and oppression. “After all,” the claim is made, “it is just a religion.” This is a Jewish Supremacist tactic: They disguise Jewish racism through religious dogma, rather than admitting ethnic nationalism. I have come to believe that the Khazar theory is one more piece of controlled opposition as illustrated in Orwell’s 1984 where Emmanuel Goldstein is supposedly Big Brother’s opposition, but in fact he is part of the Big Brother apparatus. How convenient it is to suggest that Jews are not a race, not a related people that gives them a unity and strength in conflict with other peoples. One cannot explain the power of Zionism unless one understands Jewish tribalism. Jewish tribalism (racism) and favoritism and preference for fellow Jews combined with discrimination against non-Jews ultimately enables them to take over almost any institution. Without Jewish racism, Zionism could not flourish, for that is what gives the Jewish extremists its enormous economic, media and political influence. Christians who propagate the “Khazar theory” should not forget that the Talmud is perhaps the most anti-Christ tome ever written. The Talmud portrays Jesus being boiled in human excrement—“forever”! The Talmud as well the gospel recounting of the Jewish persecution behind the crucifixion of Christ all took place hundreds of years before any supposed Khazar conversion! How convenient it is for the anti-Zionist, anti-Jewish supremacist efforts be divided on the foundation of the Jewish problem. Bear in mind, the problem we face is not a “Khazar” problem, it is a Jewish problem, it is a problem of extremist Jewish racism and supremacism which continually plunges our world into war, hatred, tyranny and degradation. It is for these reasons, that I no longer believe the Khazar theory. Anyone who opposes Jewish extremism, supremacism and Zionism I consider an ally and brother in the cause for the liberation of Europeans and every people on the Planet from the Zio-Globalist threat. I accept whole heartedly those who still believe the Khazar theory, but at the same time I must express what I think to be the truth: that, overall, the theory does more harm than good in our efforts to oppose Jewish tribalism. As a final note is important to show that Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews are not claimed to be Khazars by anyone and they were throughout the Mediterranean world at the time of Christ some 900 years before any alleged Khazar conversion. They were the ones who crucified Christ, the ones Christ railed against. Some of the very same people who expose the Talmud and the Jewish role in Christ crucifixion are now telling us that Jews are actually Khazars today! Not a single Khazar wrote a word of the vicious Talmud. The most important Jewish rabbi in Israel is the Chief Sephardic Rabbi, as typified by the late Ovadia Yosef. Yosef was viciously anti-Gentile and anti European and anti-Palestinian. When he died he was honored like no other Israeli citizen in history — with the largest funeral honored by all Ashkenazi, Sephardi and Mizrahi. Although I am friends with and respect all who believe in the Khazar theory if they are fighting against the Jewish Supremacists, I though will personally will no longer endorse what I believe is a patently false idea fostered upon us by Jewish communists who seek to lessen our understanding of the core threat of Jewish racism and Jewish tribalist supremacism. When people tell us the threat of Ashkenazi Jews it confuses people on the subject to no end. It deflects from the fundamental fact that the Jewish establishment, i.e. every major Jewish organization of all types of Jews– is working for our genocide.",0
9599,"Monsanto Behind 4-Years-in-the-Making, Failed Peace Deal in Colombia","Monsanto Behind 4-Years-in-the-Making, Failed Peace Deal in Colombia Nov 7, 2016 1 0 
Colombians just refused a peace deal championed by President Juan Manuel Santos Calderón with the narrow margin of just .05% of the votes. This would have ended 52 years of war in the country that has resulted in 250,000 deaths thus far. 
Though recent stories suggested the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels who had been waging a guerilla war in Colombia had put down their arms , a surprising contributor to the prolonged hardship Colombians now face can be traced directly to Monsanto . 
Negotiations for the failed peace deal took four long years, but behind the attempts to start fresh, with hopes of incorporating FARC rebels into civil Colombian life, the biotech and seed-monopolizing company, Monsanto, was waging a war of their own. 
Members of the FARC rebel resistance have spent decades roaming the jungles of Columbia – bathing in creeks and sleeping in crude campsites . They, like almost no other Colombian, are familiar with the U.S.-Colombian so-called anti-narcotic war which allows Monsanto to spray the air with glyphosate, widely known as the trademarked herbicide, Roundup. 
Once this herbicide reaches the jungle floor, it destroys not only coca, but also the many other plants that provide for indigenous Colombian’s needs. 
This practice began in the 1980s. In 1999 the campaign to spray glyphosate acquired an official status known as ‘Plan Colombia.’ Only just recently, the Colombian government defied the U.S. agreement and stopped the aerial spraying of crops used to make cocaine, ending the 20-year long, Monsanto-led environmental devastation. 
What many don’t know is that the U.S. government pledged to fund the purchase of glyphosate herbicides from Monsanto, supply the aircraft equipped with the means to spray, and to train Colombian commandos to carry out the aerial onslaught . 
These planes faced an ongoing threat of receiving ground fire by FARC rebels. 
FARC leader Timoleón Jiménez (real name is Rodrigo Londoño Echeverri), known as ‘Timochenko’ among partisans and a graduate of the Peoples’ Friendship University in Russia as well as a trained doctor, said in an interview to Colombian newspaper VOZ: 
“In the regions, where farm communities live close to coca crops, the government accuses landowners of illegal coca production and using this excuse constantly air-sprays their fields with glyphosate. This chemical destroys coca randomly along with other agricultural crops, causing irretrievable harm to animals and people, especially to children, seniors and pregnant women.” 
The result was that rebels attempted to shoot down planes to escape chemical death. In an attempt to avoid the ground fire, the U.S.-supplied, Monsanto-herbicide-filled crop dusters would fly higher, but continue their spraying, becoming more willy-nilly in their aim. 
The Colombian tropical rainforests, are thus barbarically sprayed with millions of tons of Monsanto’s herbicide. This is extraordinarily troublesome due to the fact that Colombia is considered one of the most important countries for maintaining biodiversity, with almost 10% of all endemic plant species growing within its forests. 
Moreover, 6 million Colombians have had to flee their homes due to Monsanto’s spraying . Instead of eradicating crops, you’d think the biotech company was trying to eradicate people. Indigenous Shuar leader from Scumbios, Ecuador explains the situation , 
“We always used to have a pharmacy in the jungle. But now we can’t find the trees and animals that we need. The animals and fish have disappeared. The birds, too. We have never seen anything like this before. It has to be the result of the spraying. We notice the effects immediately after the area is sprayed. Birds, animals, and fish begin to disappear within a few weeks. The health effects linger for weeks, and even longer.” 
Additionally, soil has lost its fertility, water is polluted, and multi-generational homesteads are uprooted. Forests are quickly dying, also. 
Instead of the land being shepherded by Colombians, biotech corporations use them to expand their genetically-modified crop empires, which are resistant to glyphosate. 
What has assisted this expansion? The war against Colombian guerrillas. FARC representatives at peace talks in Havana were the ones who demanded Monsanto and the US stop spraying . 
As Russian journalist, Elena Sharoykina has stated , 
“Despite the support of the head of the government, the glyphosate moratorium was criticized by the Colombian ‘war faction’ and its U.S. bosses. Juan Carlos Pinzón Bueno, the defense minister, Álvaro Uribe Vélez, the former head of the government, and Kevin Whitaker, the U.S. ambassador in Bogota, have publicly opposed it. They claimed it an undeserved concession for FARC and appealed to continue the aerial spraying of the herbicide ‘for the sake of combating narcotics’. 
Of course, it’s not only about coca plantations. The U.S. uses the anti-narcotic campaign in Colombia as an easy excuse to eradicate FARC. Washington is usually surprisingly tolerant to drug production, when it brings profit. 
. . .Nowadays, the estimated number of active FARC members hardly exceeds 5-6 thousand people. It’s naive to think that several thousand of rebels trapped in jungle can control a transnational joint venture known as the ‘Colombian cocaine industry’, worth tens of billions U.S. dollars .” 
One thing is clear in the face of a lost vote for peace. 
“‘Glyphosate’ and ‘war’ have become synonyms now in Colombia. That is why the moratorium on the aerial spraying of the herbicide wouldn’t last long. Already in April 2016 the Colombian government under U.S. pressure and on the pretext of fighting the drug business resumed the use of glyphosate .”",0
9600,"Review: In ‘The Skin of Our Teeth,’ the End of the World as We Know It - The New York Times","The world is coming to an end, and they’re all singing “Jingle Bells. ” That may not be your idea of a great musical selection for Armageddon. But as performed by a ragtag chorus of displaced persons in Theater for a New Audience’s spirited revival of Thornton Wilder’s “The Skin of Our Teeth,” the choice of song feels fitting, resourceful, valiant and  —   for just those reasons  —   very moving. The scene comes near the end of the first act of this wobbly mammoth of a play, which opened on Tuesday night at the Polonsky Shakespeare Center in Brooklyn. And as often happens in the director Arin Arbus’s heartfelt interpretation of Wilder’s 1942 cosmic comedy, the sequence’s elements register as both exceedingly whimsical and disturbingly familiar. What’s being portrayed, after all, is an earth succumbing to climate change, which means that although it is high summer, a glacier is advancing on Excelsior, N. J. where a home has become a haven for a swarm of refugees, whose admittance was a subject of angry argument among the family that lives there. And what may be the last fire on the planet is about to go out. It is hardly a cause for celebration that the alarm bells being rung here sound as resonant today as they must have in the early 1940s, when the United States was on the brink of world war. Yet a celebratory glow pervades this   portrait of a single family’s survival against the odds through freeze, famine and war. “The Skin of Our Teeth” can be quaint, creaky and tedious. But it feels as perversely suitable to 2017 as “Jingle Bells” does to the Ice Age. When the play first opened, with a dazzling cast led by Fredric March and Tallulah Bankhead, Brooks Atkinson wrote in The New York Times that it stood “head and shoulders above the monotonous plane of our moribund theater. ” Atkinson particularly admired Wilder’s “mischievous ideas about the informality of good theater. ” But while he adored the first third of “Skin,” he was less enamored of the two other acts. He wasn’t wrong. That first act, which places a    American family on the edge of extinction in the Ice Age, still feels as fresh as morning and as old as Moses (who happens to appear in it). But as it continues to follow the allegorical Antrobus clan in its   struggle for survival (through a   flood on the boardwalks of Atlantic City and a   world war) “Skin” can wear thin. Recent revivals  —   including a misguided whopper in Central Park in 1998, starring John Goodman  —   have suggested that the play had gone the way of its singing dinosaurs. Wilder’s starker “Our Town” and robust “The Matchmaker” (the basis for the musical “Hello, Dolly! ”) seemed far more likely candidates for survival. Ms. Arbus  —   whose fruitful association with Theater for a New Audience has yielded a bright string of cleareyed productions of classics  —   doesn’t entirely restore “Skin” to newborn sprightliness. But she makes you appreciate why its first audiences cherished it. Her production does particularly well by Wilder’s inspired notion to have the improvisatory spirit of “theater, interrupted” reflect the   persistence of life itself. From its first moments (and it’s all in the script) the production is troubled by falling scenery, electrical blackouts and a temperamental actress who refuses to stay in character. That’s the woman who plays Sabina, the Antrobus’s mantrap of a maid, embodied with original comic flair by Mary Wiseman, who brings to mind not so much Ms. Bankhead (who created the part) as a young Lucille Ball with an attitude. It is Sabina who guides us  —   irascibly and apologetically  —   through the willful anachronisms of the play. Its central archetypal clan is made up of Mr. and Mrs. Antrobus (David Rasche and Kecia Lewis) and their children Gladys (Kimber Monroe) and Henry (Reynaldo Piniella) who was originally named Cain. Mr. Antrobus is an inventor of genius (his contributions include the wheel, the lever and the alphabet) while his wife is a fierce defender of family. As for Sabina, she’s basically Lilith, the eternal temptress, there to lead good men like Mr. Antrobus astray. In its sexual politics (and its Oedipal confrontations) “Skin” can feel agonizingly dated. And despite solid performances by Mr. Rasche and Ms. Lewis, the configuring of this eternal triangle occupies entirely too much stage time. It’s as a   production that this “Skin” captures, tickles and distresses the imagination. Ms. Arbus has enlisted a crackerjack production team  —   including Riccardo Hernandez (sets) and Cait O’Connor (the commedia dell’  costumes and puppets)  —   and a diverse cast of nearly three dozen (including a fierce Mary Lou Rosato as a boardwalk soothsayer) to fill Wilder’s   canvas. The production deploys them with wit and efficiency, while retaining an endearing air of ramshackle spontaneity. The script has updated its anachronisms (Trader Joe’s instead of A  P) and features some stirring contemporary songs by César Alvarez about the search for home. “So many years I have been dreaming, dreaming, dreaming of a place to call my own,” the refugees sing, toward the first act’s end. By that point, it’s looking as if they may all freeze to death. So when Ms. Wiseman steps out of character to ask the audience to bring its chairs to the stage to stoke the fire, there’s no question that were we able to oblige, we would. At such moments, “Skin” becomes a welcome pep rally for a world that could use some reassurance that it will, despite everything, carry on.",0
9601,Comment on Opiates And Chronic Pain Patients: The Painful Side-Effects Of Obama’s New Regulation by Entertainment and Movie reviews with tips on how to get Website Traffic and Make Money Online.,"Subscribe 
The Obama administration recently announced measures to fight opioid addiction with treatment and prevention . It is hard to predict how these measures – and the new CDC guidelines – will affect chronic pain patients. However, in order to understand the many concerns patients with chronic pain have raised, it’s important to hear about what they are already facing. 
Women, particularly women of color, face a difficult time getting diagnosed with chronic pain conditions, let alone receiving treatment . Age also plays a role – young chronic pain patients may face difficulties in receiving accurate care. Several women with chronic pain shared their stories with me in an effort to display how difficult things already are for many of us in chronic pain. 
Holy, a young woman from Maryland living with Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS), shared some of her struggles with me yesterday. AS is a debilitating form of arthritis that mainly attacks the back and spine. As such, it causes a tremendous amount of pain which can escalate during periods called ‘flare-ups.’ During flare-ups, patients may have to up medications such as corticosteroids (Prednisone) and pain medication. 
Holy has been refused medical care during painful flare-ups that caused her to go to the emergency room. Currently, she is in so much pain that she is unable to work or continue pursuing secondary education. 
She feels that her pain could be better controlled with a higher dose of the opiate she is currently on, but fears the reactions and repercussions she will face by asking for that dose. Holy’s insurance won’t cover a consultation with a pain management specialist, something that many physicians are requiring in order to get away from prescribing opiates themselves. All she wants is to be able to function enough to pursue her education and have a semblance of Quality of Life (QOL). 
Holy’s story is not unlike that of Britta in Minnesota, who currently has little pain management for her chronic illness-related pain. While she would like to ask for pain management and discuss medications, her insurance and health care organization have both put extreme regulations on opiates. 
Other patients, including yours truly, already experience issues when picking up opiates or other controlled substances for pain relief at the pharmacy. We are often treated like criminals, something that becomes more obvious when you hear about urine and blood testing for illegal drugs in order to obtain your pain relief. 
While the stories above are the most common I encounter, there are rare stories like that of Gwendolyn from Colorado. While she admits she is terrified of the effects of the new prescription guidelines, Gwendolyn sees a pain management specialist who has assured her that they will do whatever they can to make sure the process of obtaining her script doesn’t change and that her QOL isn’t negatively affected. Like Holy, though, she still has had negative responses when needing to utilize the emergency room. 
An important note to make: Uncontrolled pain can and does lead to suicide . Patients who have little to no QOL and cannot access pain relief often feel as though they have nowhere to turn. Relationships suffer, contributing to a feeling of isolation and loneliness. There are some doctors who see this , who realize that pain and depression may be related, and who are reluctant to follow or are even actively resisting the various new guidelines. 
It remains to be seen how the new guidelines will affect healthcare across the country. Reducing the number of deaths from opiate abuse is important, but we also need to be mindful of those in unending pain who may have no other options than opiates. Limiting their access reduces their QoL and will, ultimately, lead to preventable deaths.

We need the wall. And it’s a wall, in certain areas where you have massive physical structures, we don’t need, and certain big rivers and all, but we need a wall. And we’re going to get that wall.

You’re not staying any longer. ” “If you keep coming back illegally after deportation, you will be arrested, prosecuted and put behind bars,” Trump added. “Otherwise, it will never end.

We’ve seen the attacks from Boston to San Bernardino, hundreds of individuals from other countries have been charged with   offenses in the United States. We spend billions and billions on security all over the world, but then we allow radical Islamic terrorists to center right through our front door. That’s not going to happen anymore.

A firefighter from Florida appeared on TRUNEWS with Rick Wiles in April 2016, in which he shared his years-old vision of Donald Trump becoming president. 
Many people are questioning how Donald Trump fits into God's plan for the nation.

For I will use this man to bring honor, respect and restoration to America. America will be respected once again as the most powerful and prosperous nation on Earth, (other than Israel). The dollar will be the strongest it has ever been in the history of the United States, and will once again be the currency by which all others are judged,'"" Taylor says the Lord told him five years ago.

BY CHARLES E. SCHMIDT Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter’s announcement on Wednesday that the Pentagon is suspending its program to claw back military signing bonuses is a welcome development amid a debacle that should never have happened. The hounding of nearly 10,000 California National Guard veterans to repay money that was mistakenly given for re-enlisting at the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars was not just ungrateful. It was poor strategy. Imagine being a recent high school or college graduate considering career options. Your recruiter promises you a generous bonus in exchange for a few years of being told where to live, where to work and what time to wake up — while, by the way, possibly getting shot or blown up and killed. You would also be required to subject yourself to a justice system that could send you to prison for a disagreement with your boss.

9605,Why Is the Foreign Policy Establishment Spoiling for More War? Look at Their Donors.      - ICH," Why Is the Foreign Policy Establishment Spoiling for More War? Look at Their Donors. By Dennis Kucinich
 The Nation "" - W ashington, DC, may be the only place in the world where people openly flaunt their pseudo-intellectuality by banding together, declaring themselves think tanks, and raising money from external interests, including foreign governments, to compile reports that advance policies inimical to the real-life concerns of the American people.
As a former member of the House of Representatives, I remember 16 years of congressional hearings where pedigreed experts came to advocate wars in testimony based on circular, rococo thinking devoid of depth, reality, and truth. I remember other hearings where the Pentagon was unable to reconcile over $1 trillion in accounts, lost track of $12 billion in cash sent to Iraq, and rigged a missile-defense test so that an interceptor could easily home in on a target. War is first and foremost a profitable racket.
How else to explain that in the past 15 years this citys so called bipartisan foreign policy elite has promoted wars in Iraq and Libya, and interventions in Syria and Yemen, which have opened Pandoras box to a trusting world, to the tune of trillions of dollars, a windfall for military contractors. DCs think tanks should rightly be included in the taxonomy of armored war vehicles and not as gathering places for refugees from academia.
According to the front page of this past Fridays Washington Post , the bipartisan foreign-policy elite recommends the next president show less restraint than President Obama. Acting at the urging of liberal hawks brandishing humanitarian intervention, read war, the Obama administration attacked Libya along with allied powers working through NATO.
The think tankers fell in line with the Iraq invasion. Not being in the tank, I did my own analysis of the call for war in October of 2002, based on readily accessible information, and easily concluded that there was no justification for war. I distributed it widely in Congress and led 125 Democrats in voting against the Iraq war resolution. There was no money to be made from a conclusion that war was uncalled for, so, against millions protesting in the United States and worldwide, our government launched into an abyss, with a lot of armchair generals waving combat pennants. The marching band and chowder society of DC think tanks learned nothing from the Iraq and Libya experience.
The only winners were arms dealers, oil companies, and jihadists. Immediately after the fall of Libya, the black flag of Al Qaeda was raised over a municipal building in Benghazi, Gadhafis murder was soon to follow, with Secretary Clinton quipping with a laugh, We came, we saw, he died. President Obama apparently learned from this misadventure, but not the Washington policy establishment, which is spoiling for more war.
The self-identified liberal Center for American Progress (CAP) is now calling for Syria to be bombed, and estimates Americas current military adventures will be tidied up by 2025, a tardy twist on mission accomplished. CAP, according to a report in The Nation , has received funding from war contractors Lockheed Martin and Boeing, who make the bombers that CAP wants to rain hellfire on Syria.
The Brookings Institute has taken tens of millions from foreign governments , notably Qatar, a key player in the military campaign to oust Assad. Retired four-star Marine general John Allen is now a Brookings senior fellow . Charles Lister is a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute , which has received funding from Saudi Arabia , the major financial force providing billions in arms to upend Assad and install a Sunni caliphate stretching across Iraq and Syria. Foreign-government money is driving our foreign policy.
As the drumbeat for an expanded war gets louder, Allen and Lister jointly signed an op-ed in the Sunday Washington Post , calling for an attack on Syria. The Brookings Institute, in a report to Congress , admitted it received $250,000 from the US Central Command, Centcom, where General Allen shared leadership duties with General David Petraeus. Pentagon money to think tanks that endorse war? This is academic integrity, DC-style.
And why is Central Command, as well as the Food and Drug Administration, the US Department of transportation, and the US Department of Health and Human Services giving money to Brookings ?
Former secretary of state Madeleine Albright, who famously told Colin Powell , Whats the point of having this superb military youre always talking about if we cant use it, predictably says of this current moment , We do think there needs to be more American action. A former Bush administration top adviser is also calling for the United States to launch a cruise missile attack on Syria.
The American people are fed up with war, but a concerted effort is being made through fearmongering, propaganda, and lies to prepare our country for a dangerous confrontation, with Russia in Syria.
The demonization of Russia is a calculated plan to resurrect a r aison dętre for stone-cold warriors trying to escape from the dustbin of history by evoking the specter of Russian world domination.
Its infectious. Earlier this year the BBC broadcast a fictional show that contemplated WWIII, beginning with a Russian invasion of Latvia (where 26 percent of the population is ethnic Russian and 34 percent of Latvians speak Russian at home).
The imaginary WWIII scenario conjures Russias targeting London for a nuclear strike. No wonder that by the summer of 2016 a poll showed two-thirds of UK citizens approved the new British PMs launching a nuclear strike in retaliation. So much for learning the lessons detailed in the Chilcot report.
As this years presidential election comes to a conclusion, the Washington ideologues are regurgitating the same bipartisan consensus that has kept America at war since 9/11 and made the world a decidedly more dangerous place.
The DC think tanks provide cover for the political establishment, a political safety net, with a fictive analytical framework providing a moral rationale for intervention, capitol casuistry. Im fed up with the DC policy elite who cash in on war while presenting themselves as experts, at the cost of other peoples lives, our national fortune, and the sacred honor of our country.
Any report advocating war that comes from any alleged think tank ought to be accompanied by a list of the think tanks sponsors and donors and a statement of the lobbying connections of the reports authors.
It is our patriotic duty to expose why the DC foreign-policy establishment and its sponsors have not learned from their failures and instead are repeating them, with the acquiescence of the political class and sleepwalkers with press passes.
It is also time for a new peace movement in America, one that includes progressives and libertarians alike, both in and out of Congress, to organize on campuses, in cities, and towns across America, to serve as an effective counterbalance to the Demuplican war party, its think tanks, and its media cheerleaders. The work begins now, not after the Inauguration. We must not accept war as inevitable, and those leaders who would lead us in that direction, whether in Congress or the White House, must face visible opposition.

9606,9 Breathtaking Photos Of Nature With A Generous H... | ClickHole,"Email The majesty of nature is awe-inspiring, and don’t worry, we’ve got plenty of those monkeys with the giant red asses. 1. We’re not going to leave you hanging, wondering when the swollen red asses are going to show up. Here’s one monkey ass to start this list of beautiful nature photos off right. 2. Elsewhere in nature, the blue whale is the largest animal in Earth’s history, even bigger than the dinosaurs! And if you think we blew our entire red-assed money wad on that first one, then you are seriously mistaken. 3. The Alaskan wood frog has the amazing ability to freeze in winter and thaw itself out when the weather gets warm again. It sounds like something out of science fiction, and while it isn’t a hulking red monkey ass, it’s still an impressive example of the power of evolution. 4. No way we’d skimp on monkeys with bulbous red buttocks. That’s not how we treat our readers. When we promise inflamed red monkey asses, we deliver in spades. Feast your eyes on these remarkable specimens. 5. More monkeys with beacon-like red asses are coming up, but in the meantime here is the hummingbird moth. At first glance, you’d mistake it for a bird, but it’s actually an insect that happens to look like a hummingbird, which is pretty cool if you think about it. 6. Once again, it’s time to behold red monkey ass, and this time there’s a whole gaggle of monkeys with blindingly bright asses. But this isn’t the end of the red assfest, no siree. This we promise. 7. Chimpanzees are our closest cousins in nature, with an almost human-like intelligence. They sadly were not blessed with a bright-red ass but are smart enough to use simple tools like sticks to catch termites. You can’t help but wonder about humanity’s place in nature when you see a creature so similar to us. 8. We’ve got a real showstopper of a red ass on deck, but first let’s do our due diligence and check out the Galápagos tortoise. It can live over 170 years. Incredible. 9. Here we go! This monkey has a truly huge red ass, much bigger and redder than any ass we’ve seen before. We are fortunate to share a planet with a bloated red miracle as beautiful as this monkey’s breathtaking ass. Red monkey asses are nature at its finest, and we hope you’ve had your fill of them. ",0
9607,What the WikiLeak Revelations Reveal About Donna Brazile and the DNC,"What the WikiLeak Revelations Reveal About Donna Brazile and the DNC Posted on Oct 28, 2016 ( Tim Pierce / CC 2.0 ) 
Donna Brazile, interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, faces new scrutiny as evidence points to abuses of power. 
Brazile’s alliance with the Hillary Clinton team looks to have started in 2008. In February of that year, while Clinton was running for president against Barack Obama, CNN political commentator and consultant Paul Begala wrote an email to the Clinton team saying that it should “court” Brazile. At that time, during the primaries, Brazile refused to publicly endorse a candidate but worked closely with the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Until recently, she also worked for CNN and ABC News. Her close relationship with the Clinton camp has deepened over the years. 
Evidence that Brazile would begin working to help Clinton is seen in an interview she gave with Joe Heim of The Washington Post in 2014. She told Heim: 
Technically, I’m neutral, but neutrality is something that gets you in trouble because, you ever notice someone who stands on the white line in the middle of the road? They get run over. And I don’t want to get run over. So I’m not neutral. I have to tell people that I’m neutral, but I’m ready for Hillary.

By the time this interview was conducted, she was already vice chair of the DNC. It is important to note that article 5, section 4 of the DNC Charter requires that the chairperson, national officers and staff of the DNC “maintain impartiality and evenhandedness during the Democratic Party Presidential nominating process.” 
If the WikiLeaks emails are not falsified (and all evidence and history point to that being the case), this notion of impartiality was used by the Clinton camp, to its advantage, throughout the primary campaign. 
In late October 2015, Adrienne K. Elrod, director of strategic communications and amplification for Hillary For America, sent out an email under the title “Bernie Pushback Update” that included a broadcasting strategy with the help of Brazile . The plan was to have Brazile appear on TV in the guise of a “strategist” and call out rival Bernie Sanders’ campaign for having a “Bad Strategy.” 
Elrod wrote: “All of our friends going out tonight post debate, including [former Michigan Gov. Jennifer] Granholm, Donna Brazile and [political consultant] Bill Burton, are ready to call Bernie’s team out if it comes up tonight.” 
The email was a response to a critique of Clinton by Sen. Sanders. 
The reliance on Brazile for help appears to have continued into the new year. On Jan. 3, 2016, an email exchange between John Podesta and Brazile titled “Happy New Year” went as follows: 
Subject: Re: Happy New Year 
On Jan 3, 2016, at 2:25 PM, John Podesta wrote: Wishing you a happy New Year. 2015 was challenging, but we ended in a good place thanks to your help and support. Look forward to working with you to elect the first woman President of the United States. >> Have a great New Year. >> -John 
On Sunday, January 3, 2016, Donna Brazile wrote: As soon as the nomination is wrapped up, I will be your biggest surrogate. 
On Jan 3, 2016, at 19:33 PM, John Podesta wrote: Thanks Donna. Holed up in the bunker and miss seeing you. 
Two days after this exchange, Brazile let the Podesta team know that Sanders was planning to launch a Twitter campaign. The emails reveal that the impartiality clause in article 5, section 4 would be violated again and again. 
On Feb. 2, she sent an email to Podesta titled “Good Luck Tonight” and wrote “Shake things up. It’s going to be rough. Very rough.” This was the day before a town hall event in which Clinton and Sanders would appear. 
More damning is an email Brazile sent to Podesta on March 12 titled “From Time to Time I Get The Questions In Advance.” In the email, she wrote, “Here’s one that worries me about HRC.” It was a question on the death penalty that was asked—verbatim—the following day at the town hall with Sanders. 
Brazile released a statement earlier this month after the Podesta emails revealed this exchange. “I often shared my thoughts with each and every campaign, and any suggestions that indicate otherwise are simply untrue,” Brazile said in the statement. “As it pertains to the CNN debates, I never had access to questions and would never have shared them with the candidates if I did.” 
Perhaps the DNC could be forgiven by claiming they did not know Brazile had such deep ties to Clinton and her campaign. But on July 22, before the Podesta emails were revealed, WikiLeaks released more than 19,000 DNC emails. The revelations forced DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz to resign after evidence pointed to a heavy bias against Sanders. Brazile was chosen as interim chair, even though the DNC leaks revealed her potential bias. 
In an email exchange, Abby Phillip of The Washington Post asked Brazile to respond to allegations that the DNC was not giving adequate representation to the Sanders camp. Brazile’s response: “I have no intention of touching this. Why? Because I will cuss out the Sanders camp!” 
In addition, new videos surfaced last week from conservative activist James O’Keefe alleging that the Clinton camp and the DNC worked with influential Democratic operatives on dark campaign strategies against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. The videos and allegations mostly center around interviews with Scott Foval and Robert Creamer. Foval was a Democratic operative and national field director for Americans United for Change. Creamer was a Democratic operative working for the DNC , a consultant for Americans United for Chance, the founder and president of Democracy Partners and the husband of Illinois Rep. Jan Schakowsky. 
In the videos, Foval talks about inciting confrontation and violence on behalf of the DNC and the Clinton campaign at Trump rallies. Foval is also seen talking about voter fraud schemes and is caught saying, “We manipulate the vote with money and action, not with laws.” 
Creamer, who is also implicated throughout the videos, has a seemingly close relationship with President Obama. Since 2009, Creamer has visited the White House 342 times, including having made 40 visits to Obama himself. The videos also reveal that Creamer is well connected to the Clinton campaign; he boasts about talking on the phone with campaign operatives at 10:30 a.m. every day. The WikiLeaks documents confirm that they indeed had a close relationship. 
Aaron Black, a DNC rapid response coordinator who worked under Foval, can also be seen taking credit for the shutdown of a Chicago rally for Trump in March. Trump had to cancel his appearance after violence broke out. 
According to O’Keefe, one of the terms used for inciting this type of conflict is known as “bird-dogging.” Multiple Podesta emails make reference to this term. One email written by Ilyse G. Hogue, director of political advocacy and communications at MoveOn.org, explained: “Our members are bird dogging Republican candidates in character all over the country. They dress up as execs from ‘RepubliCorp’ a not-so-fictitious merger between the Republican party and multi-national corporations and go to events.” However, the emails making reference to bird-dogging do not implicate the kind of violence that Foval does in the videos. 
According to The Washington Post reports : “Bird-dogging is a fairly common activist tactic, and reporters often recognize it when seemingly “perfect” questions come from a political audience.” 
The videos also allege that Hillary Clinton herself had an idea to place people in Donald Duck costumes at every Trump and Pence rally. The video alleges that Clinton and the DNC wanted Americans United for Change to make this happen. According to O’Keefe, if the Clinton campaign and the DNC worked with the group, it would be an “illegal coordinated campaign expenditure” and a violation of Federal Election Commission (FEC) regulations. According to the video, the Clinton campaign and the DNC (including Brazile) talked on the phone with Creamer to coordinate where the “Donald Ducks” should be placed. Foval said any messages the “ducks” were carrying had to be cleared with the DNC. Creamer was asked why the DNC didn’t fund the project itself. He explained that the committee was worried about a trademark issue between Brazile and ABC, which is owned by Disney. 
For some added context, O’Keefe has a history of sometimes editing videos in a way that slightly misrepresent the story. 
Since the videos were released, Foval has been fired from Americans United for Change and Creamer announced his resignation from the DNC. 
Democracy Partners released this statement on Oct. 18, 2016: 
Our firm has recently been the victim of a well-funded, systematic spy operation that is the modern day equivalent of the Watergate burglars. The plot involved the use of trained operatives using false identifications, disguises and elaborate false covers to infiltrate our firm and others, in order to steal campaign plans, and goad unsuspecting individuals into making careless statements on hidden cameras. One of those individuals was a temporary regional subcontractor who was goaded into statements that do not reflect our values. 
According to The Washington Post, neither man defended the “content of the videos,” but instead questioned the way the videos were edited and the impartiality and history of O’Keefe himself. You can watch the videos here . 
After the third presidential debate last week, Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly grilled Brazile over the allegations in the video and the WikiLeaks emails. Brazile refused to answer directly. Instead, she said she was being “persecuted” and that she wouldn’t “validate falsified information.” Asked if the videos were falsified, she dodged the question and Kelly pointed out that no one has come forward to question the videos’ legitimacy. Pressed regarding the WikiLeaks emails, Brazile responded: “… Thank God, I have not had my personal emails ripped off from me and stolen and given to some criminals to come back altered.” She added, “I have seen so many doctored emails. ... I will not sit here and be persecuted, because your information is totally false.” 
Robert Graham, from tech blog Errata Security, wrote that using a mechanism called DKIM he was able to prove that none of the emails was modified or doctored . 
You can watch the Kelly-Brazile interview below: 
</p><p> 
On Monday, Brazile appeared on Tavis Smiley’s talk show, continuing to spin the WikiLeaks emails. She refused to respond to the actual content, saying that the source of the leaks was “people who have proven to lie and manufacture stories” and that she was launching a cyber security task force. To date, none of the WikiLeaks releases in the past 10 years of publication (which include more than a million documents) ever has proved to be altered or false. Brazile asked Smiley, “How do you disprove a lie?” and repeatedly invoked Russia, claiming that the Russians were trying to sow “seeds of doubts into our entire election apparatus.” Resurrecting Cold War sentiment against Russia is not exclusive to Brazile. In fact, the Clinton camp has been doing plenty of this. 
People have every right to fear a Trump presidency, but when Clinton talks about a no-fly zone in Syria and the DNC is pushing the theory that Russia is trying to undermine the U.S. election, questions must be asked. If the Podesta emails are real, one can see a long history of ulterior motives at play. As of now, Brazile remains the chair and face of the DNC and Clinton looks set to be our next president.

9608,"Flooding of Coast, Caused by Global Warming, Has Already Begun - The New York Times","NORFOLK, Va.  —   Huge vertical rulers are sprouting beside low spots in the streets here, so people can judge if the tidal floods that increasingly inundate their roads are too deep to drive through. Five hundred miles down the Atlantic Coast, the only road to Tybee Island, Ga. is disappearing beneath the sea several times a year, cutting the town off from the mainland. And another 500 miles on, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. increased tidal flooding is forcing the city to spend millions fixing battered roads and drains  —   and, at times, to send out giant vacuum trucks to suck saltwater off the streets. For decades, as the global warming created by human emissions caused land ice to melt and ocean water to expand, scientists warned that the accelerating rise of the sea would eventually imperil the United States’ coastline. Now, those warnings are no longer theoretical: The inundation of the coast has begun. The sea has crept up to the point that a high tide and a brisk wind are all it takes to send water pouring into streets and homes. Federal scientists have documented a sharp jump in this nuisance flooding  —   often called “  flooding”  —   along both the East Coast and the Gulf Coast in recent years. The sea is now so near the brim in many places that they believe the problem is likely to worsen quickly. Shifts in the Pacific Ocean mean that the West Coast, partly spared over the past two decades, may be hit hard, too. These tidal floods are often just a foot or two deep, but they can stop traffic, swamp basements, damage cars, kill lawns and forests, and poison wells with salt. Moreover, the high seas interfere with the drainage of storm water. In coastal regions, that compounds the damage from the increasingly heavy rains plaguing the country, like those that recently caused extensive flooding in Louisiana. Scientists say these rains are also a consequence of human greenhouse emissions. “Once impacts become noticeable, they’re going to be upon you quickly,” said William V. Sweet, a scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Silver Spring, Md. who is among the leaders in research on coastal inundation. “It’s not a hundred years off  —   it’s now. ” Local governments, under pressure from annoyed citizens, are beginning to act. Elections are being won on promises to invest money to protect against flooding. Miami Beach is leading the way, increasing local fees to finance a $400 million plan that includes raising streets, installing pumps and elevating sea walls. In many of the   cities, mayors of both parties are sounding an alarm. “I’m a Republican, but I also realize, by any objective analysis, the sea level is rising,” said Jason Buelterman, the mayor of tiny Tybee Island, one of the first Georgia communities to adopt a detailed climate plan. But the local leaders say they cannot tackle this problem alone. They are pleading with state and federal governments for guidance and help, including billions to pay for flood walls, pumps and road improvements that would buy them time. Yet Congress has largely ignored these pleas, and has even tried to block plans by the military to head off future problems at the numerous bases imperiled by a rising sea. A Republican congressman from Colorado, Ken Buck, recently called one military proposal part of a “radical climate change agenda. ” The gridlock in Washington means the United States lacks not only a broad national policy on   rise, it has something close to the opposite: The federal government spends billions of taxpayer dollars in ways that add to the risks, by subsidizing local governments and homeowners who build in imperiled locations along the coast. As the problem worsens, experts are warning that national security is on the line. Naval bases, in particular, are threatened they can hardly be moved away from the ocean, yet much of their land is at risk of disappearing within this century. “It’s as if the country was being attacked along every border, simultaneously,” said Andrea Dutton, a climate scientist at the University of Florida and one of the world’s leading experts on rising seas. “It’s a slow, gradual attack, but it threatens the safety and security of the United States. ” One night eight years ago, Karen Speights, a Norfolk resident, was sitting at the dinner table with her mother, eating crab legs dipped in butter and a tangy sauce. She felt a tingle. “Ma!” she cried. “My feet are wet!” Her mother laughed, but then she felt it, too: a house that had not flooded since the family moved there in 1964 was soon awash in saltwater. Ms. Speights initially hoped that flood was a fluke. Instead, it turned out to be the first of three to hit their home in less than a decade. Nowadays, Ms. Speights, an administrative worker at a utility company, is wondering how to get her and her mother out of the neighborhood before the water comes again, without taking too much of a financial hit. And she pays more attention to problems that once seemed remote, like warnings from scientists about the rising sea. “I believe it because we’re living it,” Ms. Speights said as she sat on her sofa, nodding toward the nearby tidal marsh that sent water into her living room. “The water has to be rising if we never flooded, and all of a sudden we’ve flooded three times in eight years. ” Because the land is sinking as the ocean rises, Norfolk and the metropolitan region surrounding it, known as Hampton Roads, are among the   parts of the United States. That local factor means, in essence, that the region is a few decades ahead in feeling the effects of   rise, and illustrates what people along the rest of the American coast can expect. The biggest problems involve frequent flooding of homes and roads. As the sea rises, hundreds of tidal creeks and marshes that thread through the region are bringing saltwater to people’s doorsteps. This summer, on a driving tour of Norfolk and nearby towns, William A. Stiles Jr. pointed to the telltale signs that the ocean is gradually invading the region. He spotted crusts of dried salt in the streets, and   marsh grasses that are taking over suburban yards. He pointed out trees killed by seawater. He stood next to one of the road signs that Norfolk has been forced to install in recent years, essentially huge vertical rulers so people know the depth of floodwaters at   intersections. “There’s just more and more visible impacts: water on the street, water that won’t clear from the ditch, these intense rain events, higher tides,” Mr. Stiles said. “It’s beginning to catch the attention of citizens, restaurant owners, business people, politicians. There’s just much more of a conversation, and it’s not just in the politically safe places. It’s everywhere. ” Mr. Stiles, known as Skip, heads a local environmental group, Wetlands Watch. At his suggestion, students at two local universities began looking at the neighborhood where Ms. Speights lives, Chesterfield Heights. It has had little history of flooding, but that is starting to change as the water rises. The plan the students developed has morphed into an ambitious program to safeguard the neighborhood, and another nearby, for decades. The Obama administration recently gave Virginia more than $100 million to carry the plan out. The administration has also enlisted one of the universities, Old Dominion in Norfolk, to spearhead a broad effort at better planning. But the size of that grant illustrates the scope of the problem confronting the region, and the country: protecting a single neighborhood from rising water can easily cost tens of millions of dollars. Sea walls and streets may have to be raised, or movable gates built along waterways so they can be closed at times of high water. While the Obama administration is trying to create a few showcase neighborhoods, there is no sign Congress is prepared to spend the money that cities and states say they need: tens of billions of dollars just to catch up to the current flooding problems, much less get ahead of them. Norfolk alone, a town of 250, 000 people, has a wish list of $1. 2 billion  —   or about $5, 000 for every man, woman and child in the city. As the national response lags, experts warn that the flooding is putting the country’s defense at risk. Several studies have concluded that Naval Station Norfolk, the world’s largest naval base, is profoundly threatened by rising seas, as are other coastal bases. The Pentagon has managed to build floodgates and other protective measures at some facilities. But attempts by the military to develop broader climate change plans have met fierce resistance in Congress. That was the case this summer, when an effort by the Pentagon to appoint officers to take charge of climate resilience led to a House vote prohibiting taxpayer money from being spent on the plan. “When we distract our military with a radical climate change agenda, we detract from their main purpose of defending America from enemies” like the Islamic State, said Mr. Buck of Colorado, the Republican congressman who sponsored the measure. His amendment passed the House 216 to 205, though the Senate has yet to agree to it. Many people in Congress, almost all of them Republicans, express doubt about climate science, with some of them promulgating conspiracy theories claiming that researchers have invented the issue to justify greater governmental control over people’s lives. So far, this ideological position has been immune to the rising evidence of harm from   climate change. The Obama administration has been pushing federal agencies, including the Pentagon, to take more aggressive steps. But without action in Congress, experts say these efforts fall far short of what is required. “In the country, certainly in the Congress, it hasn’t really resonated  —   the billions and perhaps trillions of dollars that we would need to spend if we want to live on the coast like we’re living today,” said David W. Titley, a retired rear admiral who was the chief oceanographer of the Navy, and now heads a climate center at Pennsylvania State University. “I haven’t seen any evidence that there is serious thought about this: What does a world of three, four, five feet of   rise look like?” Deep in a thicket of trees on an     island in the Florida Keys, a diesel engine roared to life. Soon a drill bit was chewing through ancient limestone, pulling up evidence from the geological past that might shed light on the future of the planet. On a sultry day in March, Dr. Dutton, the University of Florida scientist, stood watch over the drilling operation, inspecting her samples as they emerged from the ground. She spotted fossilized corals, proof that what is now the dry ground of Lignumvitae Key was once underwater. With taxpayer funding from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Dutton is chasing what might be the most urgent question in climate science: How fast is the ocean going to rise? “Is it going to happen in decades, or centuries, or a thousand years?” Dr. Dutton asked as she took a break to eat lunch on a tarpaulin spread under the trees. “This will give us an example to say, ‘Well, the last time this happened, here is how long it took. ’” The opponents of climate science in Congress, and the tiny group of climate researchers allied with them, have argued that the concerns of thousands of mainstream scientists about the future are based on unproven computer forecasts. In reality, their concerns are based in large part on mounting evidence of what has happened in the past. Through decades of research, it has become clear that human civilization, roughly 6, 000 years old, developed during an unusually stable period for global sea levels. But over longer spans, coastlines have been much more dynamic. During ice ages, caused by wobbles in the Earth’s orbit, sea levels dropped more than 400 feet as ice piled up on land. But during periods slightly warmer than today, the sea may have risen 70 or more feet above the current level. Dr. Dutton and other leading scientists are focused on the last   high point, which occurred between the last two ice ages, about 125, 000 years ago. After years of surveying ancient shorelines around the world, scientists determined that the sea level rose by something like 20 to 30 feet in that era, compared with today. But how long did it take to make that jump? That is the question Dr. Dutton, using improved research techniques, wants to answer. Large parts of the Florida Keys are simply ancient coral reefs that grew during the period of high seas, and were exposed when the levels fell. Trees, roads and houses now sit atop the old reefs. By recovering samples, Dr. Dutton hopes to date a sequence of corals as they grew along with the rising sea, potentially revealing the rate at which the water rose. The research, likely to take years, may supply a figure for how quickly the ocean was able to rise under past conditions, but not necessarily a maximum rate for the coming decades. The release of greenhouse gases from human activity is causing the planet to warm rapidly, perhaps faster than at any other time in the Earth’s history. The ice sheets in both Greenland and West Antarctica are beginning to melt into the sea at an accelerating pace. Scientists had long hoped that any disintegration of the ice sheets would take thousands of years, but recent research suggests the breakup of West Antarctica could occur much faster. In the   scenario, this research suggests, the rate of   rise could reach a foot per decade by the 22nd century, about 10 times faster than today. In 2013, scientists reached a consensus that three feet was the highest plausible rise by the year 2100. But now some of them are starting to say that six or seven feet may be possible. A rise that large over a span of decades would be an unparalleled national catastrophe, driving millions of people from their homes and most likely requiring the abandonment of entire cities. In essence, by revealing how sensitive the ice sheets have been to past warming, Dr. Dutton’s research may answer the question of whether such a rapid jump is possible. Along those parts of the United States coast that are sinking at a brisk clip, including southern Louisiana and the entire Chesapeake Bay region, including Norfolk, the situation will be worse than average. On the Pacific Coast, a climate pattern that had pushed billions of gallons of water toward Asia is now ending, so that in coming decades the sea is likely to rise quickly off states like Oregon and California. Along the East Coast, scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration say that many communities have already, or will soon, pass a threshold where   flooding starts to happen much more often. “When you look at the historical record, there’s no trend saying the flooding is going down,” said Dr. Sweet, the NOAA expert. “The trends are all very clear. They’re going up, and they’re going up in many of these areas in an accelerating fashion. ” Late last year, in Paris, nations reached a landmark global agreement to cut emissions. It is fragile, and might not survive if Donald J. Trump is elected president in November he has pledged to scrap it. But the air is already so full of greenhouse gases that most land ice on the planet has started to melt. So even if the deal survives, it will, at best, slow the rise of the sea and perhaps limit the ultimate increase. Many climate scientists, including Dr. Dutton, believe a rise of at least 15 or 20 feet has already become inevitable, over an unknown period. As Brad Tuckman walked the piece of land in Fort Lauderdale where he is building a grand new house, he pointed toward the canal that wraps around three sides of the property. It is scenic, with yachts plying the water, yet as the sea has risen, street flooding in the area has become a recurring nuisance. So before starting construction, Mr. Tuckman said he spent nearly a   dollars to raise the sea wall and truck in dirt to elevate the land. “The predictions of what’s going to happen over the next 20, 30, 40 years  —   it’s real,” said Mr. Tuckman, the founder of a company offering creative services to the retail industry. In South Florida, among the   parts of the country for   flooding, people are not waiting for state or federal help. Those who can afford it are starting to act on their own. A company, Coastal Risk Consulting, has cropped up to advise them, and is offering its services nationally. Cities and counties in the region have formed an alliance and enlisted professors to help them figure out what to do. They are hiring “chief resilience officers,” an idea pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation in New York, which is paying some of the salary cost. In Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale, as well as in older Northern cities like Boston and New York, tidal marshes and creeks were filled in a century or more ago to make new land, and it is in these areas  —   “back bays,” as some of these spots are called  —   where the flooding is happening first. That is because they remain the lowest spots in the landscape, vulnerable to the rising water nearby. Old drain pipes empty into the tidal creeks, and at high tide the water can back up through these pipes, bubbling into the streets seemingly from nowhere. In Miami Beach, the city engineer, Bruce A. Mowry, has come up with a plan for combating the flooding. He rips up problematic streets, raises them with extra dirt and repaves them, installing new drains and giant pumps that can push water back into the bay. The approach has already been shown to work in several neighborhoods. A controversy has erupted about whether Miami Beach is polluting Biscayne Bay with the water, but the city is pushing ahead. Miami Beach plans to spend at least $400 million on its plan by 2018, raising the money through fees imposed on homes and businesses. The huge county government for the region,   County, is developing its own resilience strategy, one likely to cost billions. It has committed to rebuilding some of its decaying infrastructure, like a sewage plant, in a way that safeguards against   rise and storm surges. “I don’t see doom and gloom here I see opportunity,” said Harvey Ruvin, the clerk of courts for   County, who has been a leading voice on the environment in Florida for a   and who recently led a county task force on   rise. “We’re talking about the most robust possible jobs program you can think of, and one that can’t be outsourced. ” Many of the Republican mayors in the region are on the same page as Democrats in requesting national and state action on climate change, as well as pushing local steps. James C. Cason, the Republican mayor of Coral Gables, has convened informational sessions that draw hundreds of residents, and he has received no complaints for his stance. “I hope in coming years when we have to spend a lot of money, the citizens will still support it,” Mr. Cason said in an interview. Still, his city, and others in South Florida, have some hard decisions to make. Some property owners cannot afford to raise their sea walls, putting their neighborhoods at increased risk of flooding. Will they be held legally responsible when floods do occur? A strict policy could force some people from their homes. Conversely, should public money be spent to do the work, even if it largely benefits private property? Just for streets, storm drains and the like, South Florida governments will need to raise billions, and they have yet to figure out how. Moreover, if the rise of the sea accelerates as much as some scientists fear, it is doubtful the cities will be able to keep up. The region has one mayor, Philip K. Stoddard of South Miami, who is a scientist himself  —   he studies animal communication at Florida International University  —   and has been a close reader of scientific papers about climate change since the 1990s. “I remember lying in bed at night thinking, ‘I hope this isn’t real,’” Dr. Stoddard, a Democrat, recalled. “I hope other data comes in that contradicts it. It took me several years to get my head around it and say, ‘Oh, God, it is real. ’” Now he is focused on easing the pain for South Miami, with a $50 million system of sewer pipes to replace septic tanks threatened by the rising water table. “You can play it really badly and let unpleasant things happen earlier,” he said. “Or you can push them off by doing some infrastructure repairs and some thoughtful planning. ” He is, though, under no illusions about the   fate of the region he calls home. “We’re putting enough heat in the ocean to send water over us, no question,” Dr. Stoddard said. “Ultimately, we give up and we leave. That’s how the story ends. ”",0
9609,France Says Truck Attacker Was Tunisia Native With Record of Petty Crime - The New York Times,"NICE, France  —   French officials on Friday identified the man who used a   truck to massacre dozens of people on the French Riviera as a    native of Tunisia with a history of petty crime and marriage problems  —   but no links with the militant extremists who have targeted and traumatized France. The rampage Thursday night at a packed Bastille Day fireworks celebration in the southeastern city of Nice, which unfolded as the assailant used the rented refrigerated truck as a battering ram, was all the more unnerving because it came as a total surprise despite extensive security precautions, French officials acknowledged. Nearly 24 hours later there was no claim of responsibility, and the Paris prosecutor, François Molins, said the killer, whom he identified as Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, had been “completely unknown by intelligence services. ” Mr. Molins said the toll rose on Friday to 84 dead and 202 injured. At least 10 of the dead were children or teenagers, enjoying a fireworks display one moment and crushed to death the next. It was the third major terrorist assault in 19 months to strike France, which has been singled out by militant extremist groups like the Islamic State and Al Qaeda. “We will not give in to the terrorist threat,” Prime Minister Manuel Valls said Friday morning after a cabinet meeting led by President François Hollande. But Mr. Valls also offered a grim observation for his countrymen: “The times have changed, and France is going to have to live with terrorism. ” Starting around 10:45 p. m. Thursday, the attacker mowed down scores of victims before dying in a gunfight with three police officers, who pursued him down the Promenade des Anglais, a storied seaside boulevard. The police searched two locations in Nice on Friday, including a home with Mr. Bouhlel’s name outside it, and workers in   suits searched a truck smaller than the one used in the attack. His   was held for questioning. Although neither the Islamic State or Al Qaeda asserted any role, online accounts associated with the groups welcomed the massacre. Mr. Bouhlel was born on Jan. 3, 1985, and raised in Msaken, a town in northeastern Tunisia, Mr. Molins said. He had a history of petty crime, including theft, going back to 2010, and he received a   suspended sentence in March for assaulting a driver during an altercation in January. “However, he is completely unknown by intelligence services, both at the national and local levels,” Mr. Molins said. “He has never been in any database or been flagged for radicalization. ” Mr. Bouhlel rented the truck on Monday in     about six miles west of Nice, and then parked it in the Auriol neighborhood of eastern Nice. At 9:34 p. m. on Thursday, according to surveillance footage, Mr. Bouhlel bicycled to the truck and drove it westward, arriving at 10:30 in the Magnan neighborhood, north of the Promenade des Anglais. He drove into the crowd, heading east on the promenade, around 15 minutes later. Mr. Bouhlel initially crushed two people and then drove 1. 1 miles east, running over people left and right. Outside the Negresco Hotel, Mr. Bouhlel fired at three police officers who fired back, then pursued him for about a thousand feet. They killed him outside a Hyatt hotel and casino. Mr. Bouhlel was found dead in the passenger seat. In the truck’s cabin, police found an automatic 7.  pistol, a cartridge clip, and several cartridges. They also found a fake automatic pistol two fake assault rifles, a Kalashnikov and an   a nonfunctioning grenade and a mobile phone and documents. Among the dead were two German students and their teacher two Americans two Tunisians, and one Russian. Of the 202 people wounded, 52 had serious injuries and 25 were in intensive care, Mr. Molins said. Officials canceled festivities in Nice, a city of 340, 000, including a   jazz festival and a concert on Friday night by Rihanna. “There are many children, young children who had come to watch fireworks with their family, to have joy, to share happiness, delight, amazement, and who were struck, struck to death, merely to satisfy the cruelty of an individual  —   and maybe of a group,” said Mr. Hollande, flanked by Mr. Valls and Health Minister Marisol Touraine, after meeting with victims and medical workers at the Pasteur Hospital in Nice. Mr. Hollande said the victims were physically and psychologically scarred. “Many told me that they had no recollection of what might have caused their wounds,” he said. “However, they remember the bodies that were torn to shreds right in front of their eyes. ” Despite mounting  criticism over France’s efforts to prevent terrorism attacks, Mr. Hollande praised French security forces, saying they had “taken all necessary measures so that this fireworks show might be as protected as possible  —   as had been the case during the European Championship soccer tournament. ” “Why Nice?” Mr. Hollande asked. “Because it is a city that is known worldwide, one of the most beautiful cities on the planet. Why on the 14th of July? Because it is a celebration of freedom. It was, therefore, indeed to affect France that the individual committed this terrorist attack. ” Hours before the carnage, Mr. Hollande had said that a state of emergency put in place after the Nov. 13 attacks in and around Paris would end soon. The government will now seek to extend the state of emergency for three months. As France announced three days of national mourning, starting on Saturday, world leaders  —   including Pope Francis, President Obama, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Britain’s new prime minister, Theresa May  —   expressed sympathy and outrage. It was a sadly familiar ritual for France, where a total of 147 people were killed in terrorist attacks in and around Paris in January and November of last year, and it raised new questions throughout the world about the ability of extremists to sow terror. The internet reverberated with calls for prayer for victims of attacks in Brussels Istanbul Orlando, Fla. Baghdad and other cities struck by mass terrorism attributed to Islamist extremists this year. “The horror, the horror has, once again, hit France,” Mr. Hollande told the nation early Friday morning before leaving for Nice. “France has been struck on the day of her national holiday,” he said. “Human rights are denied by fanatics, and France is clearly their target. ” The attacks could add to the political problems facing Mr. Hollande, who is expected to seek a second   term next year even though he is deeply unpopular. On Friday, criticisms of the government’s seeming inability to prevent attacks began to emerge. Alain Juppé, a former prime minister and one of the main candidates in the   primary for next year’s presidential election, told RTL radio Friday morning, “If all the means had been taken, this tragedy would not have occurred. ” Mr. Juppé called for better coordination among France’s intelligence agencies, as a parliamentary inquiry recommended this month. Georges Fenech, a   lawmaker who presided over the parliamentary inquiry, said on Twitter early Friday that the attack was a “predictable tragedy. ” “I don’t want to hear about national unity,” Mr. Fenech told the news channel iTélé. “Today, it is a duty to talk to the French people, to tell them that our country is not equipped against Islamist terrorism. ” Christian Estrosi, the president of the    d’Azur region, which includes Nice, expressed outrage, sympathy and frustration in an interview with   on Friday morning, pointedly noting the attacks in France last year, as well as the ones in March in Brussels. “Questions are raised,” he said. “As I try to comfort the families, I also try to contain my anger. I can’t hide to you that I feel a deep anger. How is it possible in our country that after everyone said there was a state of emergency, a state of war, we forget it, after Charlie Hebdo and the Bataclan? After the Bataclan, we forgot, and there was Brussels. After Brussels, we forgot, and there was Nice, so there are questions that need to be answered. ” Witnesses to the Nice attack described scenes of mayhem. “We were enjoying the celebrations when we suddenly saw people running everywhere and tables being pushed down by the movement of panic,” said Daphné Burandé, 15, who was at a bar near the beach to watch the fireworks. “No one explained to us what was happening, and I heard some gunshots not very far away,” she said. “I waited at the bar for more information because I thought it was a false alert. But then, people were still running. ” Another witness, Raja   43, said the attack seemed, at first, as if it might have been the act of a drunken driver. “There was a white truck that was advancing slowly,” Ms. Kamel said. “Then it started to plow into the crowd, zigzagging and crushing people. I could not believe it. ”",0

9611,"3 Win the Pritzker, Long a Prize for Starchitects - The New York Times","In perhaps the clearest signal yet that the era of the solo celebrity architect is behind us, three friends who hung out a shingle in their Catalonian hometown, Olot, Spain, 30 years ago and never left or parted ways have won their profession’s highest honor: the Pritzker Prize. Rafael Aranda, Carme Pigem and Ramon Vilalta on Wednesday became the first team of three to be selected for the prize, which will be awarded in Tokyo on May 20. “Their intensely collaborative way of working together, where the creative process, commitment to vision and all responsibilities are shared equally, led to the selection of the three individuals for this year’s award,” Thomas J. Pritzker, the chairman of Hyatt Foundation, which sponsors the award, said in a statement, adding, “Mr. Aranda, Ms. Pigem and Mr. Vilalta have had an impact on the discipline far beyond their immediate area. ” Ms. Pigem, who spoke for the group because her English is strongest, said in a telephone interview that the collaboration was integral to the practice. “For us, it’s very important to work together  —   one of the most important things we talk about is shared creativity,” she said. “It’s not a question of one person it’s all three. Sometimes we say six hands, one voice. ” The architects are not widely known they have not designed major public projects or worked much outside Spain. But they came to the attention of the Pritzker jury because their works, if modest, “admirably and poetically fulfill the traditional requirements of architecture for physical and spatial beauty along with function and craftsmanship,” the citation said. “But what sets them apart is their approach that creates buildings and places that are both local and universal at the same time. ” The team’s buildings include the Soulages Museum, in Rodez, France, featuring boldly modern metallic architecture (in collaboration with G. Trégouët, 2014) and a   complex in Barcelona, Spain (Sant Antoni  —   Joan Oliver, 2007) that incorporates a library, a center for the elderly and a children’s playground. The design features ample views of interior gardens and sky, and metal corridors that nod to the site’s industrial past as a candy factory. They also continue to work on projects in their Catalonian home turf, like the   athletics track, completed in 2000, and the covered   Les Cols restaurant in 2011, with plastic walls of trees, between which real trees grow. In 1988, one year after completing their studies in architecture at the School of Architecture in Vallès, the three won first prize in a competition sponsored by the Spanish Ministry of Public Works and Urbanism, to design a lighthouse in Punta Aldea. “We said, O. K.,” Ms. Pigem said. “Maybe we can do something good in architecture. ” They founded their firm that year, calling it RCR Arquitectes, after the initials of their first names. For the lighthouse, they had pondered “the essence of the typology,” according to their Pritzker biography. The team members have brought a   sensibility to their built projects, as well as their work as consultant architects to the natural park in the volcanic zone of La Garrotxa. “For us, what is very, very important is the relationship to the site,” Ms. Pigem said. “If the site is natural, or if the site is a building, or if the site is a city. What is important is to study the strong and unique relationship between the existing and the new. ” In 2007, they converted an    foundry into their office, Barberí Laboratory. They are the second Pritzker laureates to come from Spain Rafael Moneo received the award in 1996. Ms. Pigem, who is married to Mr. Vilalta, said she and her colleagues “feel very excited and very joyful. ” The Pritzker jury said it was important to reward a local firm in an increasingly globalized world. “More and more people fear that because of this international influence,” the citation said, “we will lose our local values, our local art and our local customs. ” “They help us to see, in a most beautiful and poetic way, that the answer to the question is not ‘ ’ and that we can, at least in architecture, aspire to have both,” it continued, “our roots firmly in place and our arms outstretched to the rest of the world. ”",0

The Dalai Lama is the most prominent Buddhist believes wholly education and not war is the key to defeating the jihadi movement with the US holding the key to disrupting the group's movements.

At the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow where he had inaugurated the 2nd international festival known as “Tibet: Traditions, Art, Philosophy and Peace”. The argument is that the Obama administration's policies and the Saudi interference in Syrian crisis have been inactive with the lack of getting the effective things done. The Dalai Lama holds high esteem as he is a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, who took the idea that the United States should be criticised for allowing sectarian bloodshed in Middle-East to take place without having a cohesive plan to remove hard-line militants such as ISIS and Al-Nusra Front. Currently, Saudi's funnels weapons and dollars to terrorists in the opinion of many such as those who committed the Charlie Hebdo shooting and the condemnation of these attacked in the European capitals so it is hypocritical. Therefore, Putin and Dalai Lama view the Obama organisation of wasting time and lack effectiveness of crushing the ISIS terrorists. Therefore, their inability to conquer will continue to affect everyone until a cohesive plan is formed then acted upon. Related:",0
9615,Media Scoundrel Trump Bashing Continues Hot and Heavy,"Dispatches from STEPHEN LENDMAN N ever in the history of US presidential politics have media scoundrels allied more overwhelmingly for one aspirant over the other. Bias substituting for legitimate journalism is bad enough, disgracefully worse by featuring misinformation, distortions and lies about one candidate, while effusively praising the other undeservedly – highlighting nonexistent virtues for Hillary, suppressing negatives disqualifying her for any public office. 
Why haven’t other major media reported the news Fox News anchor Bret Baier broke Wednesday night about likely indictment(s) from the FBI’s Clinton Foundation probe – though not before it’s completed weeks or months from now? The New York Times and Washington Post continue as lead Trump antagonists, one-sidedly promoting Hillary’s candidacy, acting as virtual press agents. Times columnist Charles Blow calls him “an existential threat” – based solely on his rhetoric. As a businessman, he has no public record – unlike clear evidence of Hillary’s war crimes, racketeering and perjury. Lately, he’s been staying on point in the campaign’s late stages, diverging from his earlier bombast, apparently gaining support as November 8 approaches – likely why intense bashing persists along with drowning out negatives about Hillary, especially multiple FBI probes of her email scandal and racketeering foundation. Focusing solely on Trump, Blow writes as follows: Donald Trump is a bigot. Donald Trump is a demagogue. Donald Trump is a sexist, misogynist, chauvinist pig. Donald Trump is a bully. Donald Trump is a cheat. Donald Trump is a pathological liar. Donald Trump is a nativist. Donald Trump’s campaign (attracts) anti-Semites, Nazis and white nationalists… Donald Trump (is a sexual molester), an unrepentant predator. …Donald Trump is a lowlife degenerate…” Phew! 
Blow apparently believes Hillary is America’s sweetheart, saying she’s “tolerant.” He’s “intoleran(t).” She’s “respect(ful).” He’s “disrespect(ful).” She’s “a politician with some flaws.” He’s “a flaw threatening our politics…America’s existential threat.” No legitimate editor would touch Blow’s rubbish. Times editors featured it. 
WaPo editors claim “the only way Trump can win” is if voters forget or ignore what he’s said. Despite lots of bombast earlier in the campaign, he’s toned down his rhetoric, staying disciplined late in the campaign, and presented ideas on how he’ll govern if elected, agree or disagree with him. 
No duopoly power aspirants for congressional seats and the nation’s highest office represent popular interests – no matter what they say. With rare exceptions proving the rule, they all represent dirty business as usual. Voters have to decide from a deplorable array of unpalatable choices, especially for president. 
Trump’s main virtue is he’s not Hillary. She threatens humanity with possible nuclear war. He’d rather profit from planet earth than destroy it – and his business enterprises along with it. What type leader do you prefer at the most perilous time in world history? A simple choice for anyone valuing life over possible mass annihilation.

9616,"After F.B.I.’s Inquiry Into Omar Mateen, a Focus on What Else Could Be Done - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   Every day, in F. B. I. offices around the country, agents leaf through classified counterterrorism documents on American citizens one last time. They reread informant reports and review surveillance logs. And then they close the case and walk away. It is a weighty decision, one that supervisors closely review. But with up to 10, 000 F. B. I. terrorism investigations open at any given time, there is little time for  . The nightclub shooting in Orlando, Fla. in which a gunman killed 49 people, has brought unusual attention to a seemingly mundane process. For 10 months, F. B. I. agents investigated the gunman, Omar Mateen, but closed the investigation after following a standard checklist. F. B. I. supervisors approved the decision. Managers in Washington, who can reverse any decision to close a case, were notified. Officials said there was nothing particularly remarkable about the decision  —   until Sunday’s predawn shooting. On Tuesday, the F. B. I. was scrutinizing Mr. Mateen’s computer use, trying to learn how much his wife knew before the attack. Attorney General Loretta Lynch pledged a thorough investigation that would also address “if there are lessons we can learn to prevent another tragedy. ” But perhaps the biggest question raised by this episode  —   as it was after the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 and the shooting in Garland, Tex. last year  —   is why the perpetrator’s behavior was alarming enough to attract the F. B. I. ’s attention, but could not be stopped. The answer is in part a reflection of American vigilance in the era of “see something, say something. ” Tens of thousands of counterterrorism tips flow to the F. B. I. each year. Some are legitimate. Others come from vengeful   or people casting suspicion on  . Thousands of investigations are opened and closed. Right now, law enforcement officials say, the F. B. I. is investigating 1, 000 potential “homegrown violent extremists,” the majority of whom are most likely tied to or inspired by the Islamic State. Fifty to 100 are considered the highest priority. The flood of leads is so relentless that, years ago, counterterrorism agents hung an   section of fire hose outside their office suite in Northern Virginia as a symbol of their mission. Intelligence agencies in Europe and the Middle East face similar challenges, particularly with the rise of the Islamic State. But in the United States, Americans enjoy the unique protections of the First and Second Amendments. Criticizing, or even hating, the American government is not a crime. Neither is declaring support for the Islamic State or buying a gun. The number of agents working on terrorism cases is classified and changes with the threat, but across the country it amounts to several thousand, along with countless analysts. Sorting out angry Americans talking tough from   terrorists is among their biggest challenges. In Mr. Mateen’s case,   said in 2013 that he had boasted of ties to the terrorist groups Hezbollah and Al Qaeda. The remarks prompted the local sheriff to request his removal from the St. Lucie County Courthouse in Fort Pierce, Fla. where he worked as a security guard. The security contractor transferred him to work at a residential golfing community, and the sheriff alerted the F. B. I. Government officials said his claim had been dubious from the beginning. Hezbollah is a Shiite group Al Qaeda is Sunni. But agents opened what is known as a preliminary investigation. They secretly followed him and monitored his movements. They interviewed him twice, and dispatched an informant to get close to him in an investigation that spanned nearly a year. “I think the F. B. I. has an incredibly hard job, because this guy seems like a lone wolf,” said Caroline Fredrickson, the president of the American Constitution Society, a frequent critic of the agency. “He was an American citizen born in the United States. Law enforcement has been working its butt off to figure out what else could be done. ” This dilemma is not new, but it has become more acute in recent years. For years after the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the F. B. I. used Al Qaeda’s rigid hierarchy against the terrorist group. Government experts knew how plots were hatched and who approved them. They knew the terrorism pedigree of the key figures, and monitored travel to watch for people training in camps. Today, the Islamic State encourages anyone to take up arms in its name. Travel and training are unnecessary. Veteran counterterrorism agents ruefully note that the difference between America’s latest school shooting and its latest terrorist attack is whether the gunman praised the Islamic State  —   regardless of whether he had any actual ties to the group. Preventing those attacks is a fundamentally different mission, said James W. McJunkin, a former senior F. B. I. official who oversaw terrorism cases for years during Al Qaeda’s heyday. “It’s the counterterrorism equivalent of ‘How do you prevent someone from robbing a liquor store? ’” he said. After receiving a briefing Tuesday from investigators, Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, said Mr. Mateen appeared to have been motivated by a mixture of violent radicalization and hatred for gays and lesbians. “The picture is filling in, though there are still a lot of unanswered questions,” he said. Among those questions is whether Mr. Mateen’s wife knew about his plans. His wife, Noor Zahi Salman, told the F. B. I. that she had driven him to the Pulse nightclub at some point before the attack and that she had been with him when he bought ammunition, a senior law enforcement official said. She said she had tried to talk him out of waging an attack, the official said. Her statements were first reported by NBC News. “There’s an indication that she was with him in certain parts of the process, and we’re sorting through it,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is at an early stage. “We don’t know what’s true and what’s not. ” Ms. Salman is not in custody, the official said. While a person who withholds knowledge of a crime could face criminal charges, she is not facing imminent arrest, and no decisions have been made on whether she might be prosecuted, the official said. Neighbors of Ms. Salman’s parents in Rodeo, Calif, who are of Palestinian descent, said she had grown up in a Muslim household. She and her sisters were not allowed to drive, they said. They said they understood Mr. Mateen to be a controlling husband who frequently forbade his wife to visit her family. As the F. B. I. pieces together details of Mr. Mateen’s life, lawmakers and lobbyists are already questioning whether the authorities missed any leads. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to Obama administration officials demanding information about Mr. Mateen, his family and the dates he was on a terrorism watch list. James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director, has said Mr. Mateen was on a watch list during his investigation. Once it was closed, he was removed from the list, as is required. “We don’t keep people under investigation indefinitely,” he said. Even if Mr. Mateen had remained on the watch list, it would not have stopped him from buying a gun. Congress blocked an attempt last year to give the F. B. I. the power to block gun sales to people on terrorism watch lists. Had he been on a watch list, however, agents would have been alerted to the gun sale. “Certainly in retrospect in this case we would have liked to have known about it,” Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates said. She said the Justice Department would consider a new policy in which the F. B. I. is alerted on gun sales to people who were previously under investigation for terrorism. The National Rifle Association moved quickly to quash discussion of new gun policies. In a piece for USA Today, Chris W. Cox, the group’s executive director, blamed the federal authorities for not doing more to stop Mr. Mateen. “His former   reported violent and racist comments,” Mr. Cox wrote. “Unfortunately, the Obama administration’s political correctness prevented anything from being done about it. ”",0

9619,U.S. calls for special Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces talks - Russia accepts,"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 15:29 UTC The United States has called for a special meeting with Russia over alleged violations of the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty - a landmark Cold War-era agreement. Washington wants the Special Verification Commission (SVC) to discuss the problems related to the treaty's compliance . The event is expected to take place in mid-November. The INF set up the Special Verification Commission as a way to deal with disputes surrounding the treaty. Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan can also attend the meeting because they housed intermediate range missiles before the disintegration of the Soviet Union and remain parties to the treaty. No SVC meeting has been convened since 2003. Russia welcomes the United States' offer. «We have responded positively», said Mikhail Ulyanov, the head of Foreign Ministry's Non-Proliferation and Arms Control Department. The treaty, which bans testing, producing, and possessing ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 to 5,500 kilometers, eliminated an entire class of missiles from Europe, and set up an extensive system of verification and compliance. Two years ago, the United States first asserted that Russia was in violation of the treaty , by developing a missile system that fell within the INF prohibitions. Last year, Rose Gottemoeller, the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, said that Russia risked provoking «military and economic countermeasures» if it continued to stonewall the INF issue. The US has not released any specifics about which exactly Russian missile is the source of the violation. It should be noted that if Washington cannot present compelling evidence of the Russian non-compliance, the United States could be seen by the world as the party that killed the INF Treaty . The only thing the State Department has said is that an unspecified Russian ground-launched cruise missile breaches the agreement. The issue has been in focus of US media outlets recently. For instance, an article published by The New York Times on October 19 said « Russia appears to be moving ahead with a program to produce a ground-launched cruise missile». According to the article, «the concern goes beyond those raised by the United States in July 2014, when the Obama administration said that Russia had violated the 1987 treaty on Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces». On the very same day, The Wall Street Journal chimed in saying «The US is escalating a dispute with Russia over its accusations that Moscow possesses banned missile technology» . On October 17, two top House Republican chairmen - House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry (Texas) and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (Calif.) - wrote a letter to the US president saying «It has become apparent to us that the situation regarding Russia's violation has worsened, and Russia is now in material breach of the treaty» . Russia, in turn, has accused the US of violating the pact. According to Russia's officials, the Aegis Ashore missile defense system that the US has activated in Romania and plans to install in Poland represents a violation of the treaty. Aegis Ashore uses the naval Mk-41 launching system, which is capable of firing long-range cruise missile. This is a blatant violation of the INF Treaty provisions. The treaty bans launchers capable of firing intermediate range missiles. Mk-41s deployed in Europe may launch short and intermediate range cruise missiles deep into Russian territory . A US intermediate range weapon launched from Romania or Poland would require only a short flight time to reach beyond the Urals. Russia has also said that American armed drones violate the treaty. The US plans to arm tactical aviation in Europe with modernized B61-12 guided warheads will virtually nullify all the benefits of the INF Treaty from the point of view of Russia's security. The aircraft could fly from bases in Lithuania, Estonia and Poland to Russia's largest cities in 15-20 minutes - not that much longer than the flight time of the missiles scuttled by the INF treaty. If the US really wants the talks to produce a positive result, all these concerns should be part of the agenda. The SVC meeting will take place against the background of Russia's withdrawal from the plutonium disposal deal with the US because of Washington's non-compliance , recent movement of nuclear-capable Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad , rising tensions over NATO's ground forces to deploy near Russian borders in 2017, US withdrawal from the agreement over Syria and apparent disintegration of arms control regime. Only political unity among the major global powers can reverse the disintegration process. Non-compliance, technical or material, is not the only problem the INF faces. Russia and the US adherence to the treaty's provisions does not prevent other countries from efforts to acquire ground-based intermediate range nuclear capability. The treaty should become multilateral. Russia and the US could cooperate in an effort to reach this goal with the help of the United Nations. It may be kind of forgotten today as so many things have happened since then, but in October 2007 Russia and the United States issued a joint statement to call on all countries to join a global INF Treaty addressing the First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) of the UN General Assembly. Setting the existing differences aside, the parties could revive the process in an effort to involve other states. The SVC meeting may become a venue for addressing other issues related to arms control. The concerns are there. Candid talk is the best way to address the burning problems of mutual interest. The US has demonstratively refused to discuss the host of problems related to the ballistic missile defense in Europe. This stance is erroneous. The US should change its approach to the problem. The two great powers do need a venue for arms control dialogue. The reached agreement to restart contacts within the framework of SVC against the background of US presidential election gives hope that the tide may gradually turn. Comment: As usual, the U.S. blames Russia for what the U.S. is doing. And as usual, they provide no evidence or argumentation. They can't even say which Russian ""missile"" violates the treaty! Thankfully, these talks will give Russia the opportunity of bringing up the issue of the U.S.'s very real violation of the INF treaty.",0

9622,Can Kenya lead the African Union?,"Tweet Widget by Horace G. Campbell 
From championing impunity for suspected masterminds of crimes against humanity, to frustrating African liberation and unity by working in cahoots with Empire; from publicly supporting Israel's desire to join the African Union, to being a conduit for illicit financial flows from Africa; Kenya is fundamentally unfit to lead the AU. A deeply entrenched kleptocracy has ruined Kenya and actively undermined African interests for over half a century. Can Kenya lead the African Union? by Horace G. Campbell 
This article previously appeared in Pambazuka News . 
“ At every step of the way since 1963, Kenya worked against African independence.” 
Introduction 
The African Union will choose a new Chair of the AU Commission in January 2017. There are six candidates for this position, viz. Pelonomi Venson-Moitoi of Botswana, Farki Mahamat of Chad, Agapito Mba Mokuy of Equatorial Guinea, Amina Mohamed of Kenya, Abdoulaye Bathily of Senegal and Jakaya Kikwette of Tanzania. The post of Commission Chair became vacant after the expiration of the term of South Africa’s Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, who had been at the helm since 2012 and did not apply for a second term. 
At the last AU meeting held in July in Kigali, the election was suspended because, after seven rounds of voting, none of the top three contenders from Botswana, Equatorial Guinea and Uganda obtained the required two-thirds majority. Since the suspension of the process, Specioza Wandira Kazibwe of Uganda dropped out and three new candidates have appeared. Kenya has offered the Cabinet Secretary for Foreign Affairs to lead the African Union. The government of Kenya has embarked on a multimillion-dollar diplomatic offensive to persuade Africans that Kenya should lead the African Union. Should Kenya lead the African Union? 
Let’s begin this analysis by going back 53 years ago. At the dawn of independence in 1963, the political leaders in Kenya under Jomo Kenyatta and Oginga Odinga had agreed that, after independence, all British troops would leave Kenya. A few weeks after independence in December 1963, the so-called “Shifta rebellion” began and the political leaders of Kenya requested Britain to maintain their armed personnel in Kenya to assist in crushing the “rebellion.” The British troops have remained in Kenya since then. 
Was Britain instrumental in fomenting this “Somali question” within Kenya? This and related questions have become pertinent as the records of the British are open and we know of the findings of the Northern Frontier District (NFD) Commission along with the debates within Britain over the future of Somalia. Fifty-three years later, Somali descendants who live in Kenya are still being used as political football as Kenya has vowed to close the largest refugee camp in the world, the Dadaab, that hosts mostly Somali refugees following the collapse of their state in 1991. 
Kenya is fighting the so-called war on terror in Somalia and there are credible reports that this has been a very lucrative business venture for sections of the financial and sugar barons in Kenya. 
“Kenya had been used as a base to foil genuine support for decolonization, and since the so called ‘War on Terror’ Kenya has been serving as an ally of the US.” 
It is this section of the barons that leads Kenya that has now put forward the name of Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed to be the next head of the AU Commission. It is in this context of the lobbying by the Kenyan government that this author wants to put forward a number of reasons why Kenya cannot lead the African Union. 
The political leadership of Kenya since President Jomo Kenyatta, Daniel Arap Moi, Mwai Kibaki and now Uhuru Kenyatta has been servants of imperial intrigue and skullduggery to undermine African independence and Unity. Kenya had been used as a base to foil genuine support for decolonization, and since the so called ‘War on Terror’ Kenya has been serving as an ally of the US providing the political support for the US Africa Command and activities of the West in the Indian Ocean region. 
For a short while when the questions of the killings with impunity suggested the possibility of international justice, the present Kenyan leadership of Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto (both indicted for crimes against humanity) embarked on an overheated campaign to represent themselves as African nationalists opposed to imperial machinations of the International Criminal Court. Kenyan diplomats, with Amina Mohamed in the vanguard, led a diplomatic offensive against the ICC and since the charges have been dropped against President Kenyatta and Ruto, the leadership has been going on overdrive to harness international support for the accumulation of prowess of the barons in Kenya. 
These political forces hosted President Barack Obama for a global “entrepreneurship” conference in August, 2015, followed by Pope Francis’s visit in November. Kenya hosted the 10 th Ministerial Meeting of the World Trade Organization in December 2015 and in 2016 hosted the meeting of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). These latter meetings set back the agenda of Africans who had been struggling within the WTO for the rich countries to accede to the DOHA development round. While scuttling the African agenda in the WTO and without notice withdrawing its “peacekeeping” forces from South Sudan, the Kenyan leadership is asking Africans to support Amina Mohammed for the top position as AU Commissioner. 
In light of the aggressive diplomatic forces of the Moroccan leadership to reverse the position of the African Union on the independence of Western Sahara, it will be important for progressive forces within the Economic, Social and Cultural Council (ECOSOCC) to raise their voices about the present diplomatic campaign of not only Kenya, but also the other countries, Botswana, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, and Senegal who have fielded candidates for the position of AU Commissioner. Below we detail the number of reasons for opposing the leadership of Kenya at this historical moment. 
Illicit financial flows from Eastern Africa 
The number one reason why Kenya cannot lead the African Union is that Kenya has been a base for illicit financial flows out of Eastern Africa. Most of the fraudsters that steal from their societies have a base in the real estate and financial sectors of Kenyan society. Two years ago the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) estimated that economies of Africa lost approximately US$1Trillion and about US $50 billion per year from illicit financial flows. The Report of the High Level Panel on Illicit Financial Flows from Africa drew attention to the varying forms of fraud that had been employed to export capital from Africa, noting that, 
“Some of the effects of illicit financial outflows are the draining of foreign exchange reserves, reduced tax collection, cancelling out of investment inflows and a worsening of poverty. Such outflows which also undermine the rule of law, stifle trade and worsen macroeconomic conditions are facilitated by some 60 international tax havens and secrecy jurisdictions that enable the creating and operating of millions of disguised corporations, shell companies, anonymous trust accounts, and fake charitable foundations. Other techniques used include money laundering and transfer pricing.” 
This High Level Report went on to highlight the role of Kenya in illicit financial flows out of Africa: “Kenya is believed to have lost as much as $1.51 billion between 2002 and 2011 to trade misinvoicing. The role of IFFs and their adverse effect on the country’s GDP cannot be ignored. A recent study shows that Kenya’s tax loss from trade misinvoicing by multinational corporations and other parties could be as high as 8.3 per cent of government revenue, hampering economic growth and resulting in billions in lost tax revenue.” 
It does not take rocket science to grasp the fact that all of the malfeasance of disguised corporations, shell companies, anonymous trust accounts, fake charitable foundations, money laundering and transfer pricing are present in Kenya. From the period of 1960 and the gold scandals from Eastern Congo, Nairobi has been the base for money laundering in Eastern Africa. Illicit funds from the Eastern DRC, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda, Southern Sudan and Somalia all pass through the money laundering facilities of Kenya. Other illicit money grabbers from as far afield as Nigeria use the recourses and networks of the Kenya financial barons; the real estate boom in Kenya in the past fifteen years is directly linked to these fraudulent funds being laundered in Kenya. 
“From the period of 1960 and the gold scandals from Eastern Congo, Nairobi has been the base for money laundering in Eastern Africa.” 
Most recently, there was a report on the nexus of corruption and conflict in the Sudan, which brought out revealing figures on the extent of the real estate holdings in Nairobi and of the top officials of the South Sudanese state. Entitled War Crimes Shouldn't Pay [2] , the report found that ""top officials ultimately responsible for mass atrocities in South Sudan have at the same time managed to accumulate fortunes, despite modest government salaries"". 
Kenyan bureaucrats and financiers have been implicated in the top four ways of draining valuable resources out of South Sudan: (a) extractive services, (b) the military state (c) state spending and (d) money laundering. 
Questions on the complicity of Kenya in the debacle of the struggles between differing factions in South Sudan increased after Kenya decided to pull its troops out of South Sudan after the Secretary General of the United Nations sacked the Kenyan commander of the UN “peacekeeping” forces in South Sudan. 
When the High Level Panel outlined the extent of illicit financial flows out of Africa, they had given clear recommendations as to how to stop these forms of drainage out of Africa. The Panel called for member states of the African Union to inter alia: (a) Determine the nature and patterns of illicit financial outflows from Africa; (b) Raise awareness among African governments, citizens and international development partners of the scale and effect of such financial outflows on development; and (c) Propose policies and mobilize support for practices that would reverse such illicit financial outflows. 
It is the expectation of millions of the working poor in Africa that their representatives at the African Union would be at the forefront of calling for the return of stolen assets to African societies. One would have expected that because Kenya has been so prominent in the business of money laundering, the loudest calls for ending these forms of capital accumulation would come from inside the society. However, as one component of the disorientation of activists, the NGO mentality predisposes many to seek solutions from “donor agencies” without understanding that these so called “donors” form an essential link in the chain of draining resources out of Africa. 
Instead of robust voices exposing the role of Kenya in money laundering, the Kenyan political leadership has invested millions of dollars to send Vice President William Ruto on a spirited tour proclaiming the candidature of Amina Mohammed. On these trips to other African countries, Ruto has been proclaiming the virtues of Kenya as a base for trade and investment. 
War on terror as a business in Kenya 
The second reason for objecting to the bid for Kenya to take over the position as AU Commissioner relates to the role of Kenya in Somalia and the fact that the so-called “Operation Linda Nchi” has for all intents and purposes been a business venture by the sugar and military barons of Kenya. The African Union had committed its reputation on the future of peace in supporting African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). However, Kenya, Uganda and Ethiopia have played geo-political games with the lives of the people of Somalia and there is credible evidence that this Kenyan mission has been using the peacekeeping mission as a business venture. For years the United Nations Monitoring Group for Somalia has been reporting on the scale of the involvement of AMISOM troops in the sale of charcoal and sugar using the port of Kismayo under the control of AMISOM. 
When progressive forces in Eastern Africa did not take up the issue vigorously, a group named Journalists for Justice documented the reality that elements from the Kenyan army have been involved in a US$400 million sugar smuggling racket in Somalia and have also funded militants that they were supposed to be fighting. Far from fighting the Al Shabaab, the Kenyan Defense Forces (KDF) are “in garrison mode sitting in bases while senior commanders are engaged in corrupt business practices.” This report [3] on Kenya’s Criminal Racket in Somalia has produced enough evidence to corroborate the information that has been produced for nearly a decade about how war is a business in Somalia. 
Progressives have shirked from quoting from the reports of this organization in so far as the organizations also seek to use information on KDF involvement in racketeering in supporting the voices of those calling for the disbanding of the African Union. 
Layering and the barons of Kenya 
Apart from investigative journalists who have been documenting the war business in Somalia very few scholars have actually interrogated how the global war on terror feeds into the illicit global economy. It has been estimated by the World Economic Forum that the international illicit economy is valued at over US $3.8. trillion. This means that in terms of GDP, the illicit economy is among the top 10 economies in the world. It is in this global illicit economy where one finds the layering of barons with the financial barons at the top of the food chain. Next to the financial barons are the real estate barons, the land grabbers/barons, the sugar barons involved in smuggling and illegality, the drug barons – (see cases of cocaine smuggled as sugar), education and business of procurement, barons in hospitals and medicine – (see the Constant Gardner and Kenya as a place for fake drugs), military and security barons – war on terror as a business venture – ethnic and regional power brokers, political fixers and counterfeiting barons. 
“If we do not fight the cartels, we become their slaves.” 
These barons form the base for the Kenyan capitalist class and they have an agreement among themselves to divide the working peoples of Kenya on the basis of ethnicity, regionalism and religion. In the particular case of Kenya, there is public knowledge of the criminality of the cartels with the former Chief Justice Dr. Willy Mutunga raising questions of how these barons and cartels pose a threat to the wellbeing and security of the peoples of Kenya and East Africa. He had noted that, “The influence of the cartels is overwhelming. They are doing illegal business with politicians. If we do not fight the cartels, we become their slaves. But leaders who do take on the cartels must be prepared to be killed or exiled.” 
The statement of the Chief Justice provides the context for better understanding the spate of killings that have been labeled as “terror” attacks since the Kenyan Defense Forces invaded Somalia in 2011. A series of high profile incidents such as the Al-Shabaab siege of the Westgate shopping center in Nairobi that left 67 people dead, ensured that there was international support for counter-terrorism in Kenya. This was followed by the killing of approximately 68 people in Mpeketoni, Majembeni and Poromoko at the coast in June 2014; the killing of 28 people in a bus in Mandera in November 2014; the killing of 36 people in a Mandera quarry in December 2014; and the killing of 147 students on the campus of Garissa University College in April 2015. It is these kinds of killing with impunity that disqualify Kenya fundamentally since the aggressive stand on the ICC was not accompanied by an equally aggressive stand to pursue the perpetrators of the post-election killings in Kenya in 2008. 
Kenya undermining the African cause at the WTO 
One of the supposed strong points of Amina Mohamed was her leadership of Kenya at the 10 th Ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization in December 2015. Prior to the WTO meeting in Seattle in 1999, Kenyan intellectuals had been at the forefront of challenging the intellectual property rights claims of the pharmaceuticals. After the debacle in Seattle, the Global South had organized collectively to ensure that the rules of international trade did not continue to deepen the impoverishment of the billions of poor farmers in the South. Since 2001, there had been negotiations with the former colonized peoples over the future rules in a round of negotiations that had been named after the city of Doha, Qatar. From the moment of those negotiations in November 2001 until December 2015 there had been nothing but duplicitous back and forth between the North and the peoples of the South. The designation of these negotiations as the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) never seriously considered addressing the obstacles placed in the global trading system to foster real trading cooperation, which supports socioeconomic transformation in the South. 
From the formation of the WTO the African members along with others from the Global South had taken a collective stand on the hypocrisy of the North in relation to trade and investment, intellectual property and agriculture. Since the WTO came into existence, the countries of the European Union and North America failed to live up to the expectations at the end of the Uruguay Round that they would liberalize their agriculture sector and significantly reduce their subsidies. In the particular case of farmers from Africa, there had been opposition to the subsidies granted to European farmers, while African farmers live in poverty. 
In the particular case of African cotton exporters – Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mali – collectively known as the Cotton 4 or C-4 – they had successfully urged fellow WTO members to stand with Africa on questions of food security and the outstanding questions of subsidies. At the Nairobi 10 Ministerial Meeting, Amina Mohamed as Chairperson of the meeting jettisoned the claims of the Global South and hurriedly agreed to exclude the “African Issues” before the WTO. The newspapers of the financial barons in Kenya then proceeded to publicize the outcome pointing to a nebulous “Nairobi package” that postponed real discussions of the trade war against the South by the North. 
Somalia a political football: Question of oil and gas discoveries 
Attention had already been drawn to how the question of Somalia has been manipulated for the past fifty years by the Kenya barons. The manipulation of the poor refugees reached new heights as the Kenyan leadership has threatened to close the largest refugee camp in the world. 
The anti-Pan African position of the Kenyans reached new lows over the question of the demarcation of the land and sea boundaries. After Kenyans had agreed with the British to maintain the Northern Frontier District as part of Kenya in 1964, there were questions as to the real boundaries between Kenya and Somalia. These questions became more urgent after oil and gas companies began to explore the very large reserves of oil and gas from the Somalia coast through Kenya, Tanzania, down to Mozambique. Faced with differing maps from the colonial offices of Britain and Italy, the Kenyans and Somalians have been disputing a narrow triangle off in the Indian Ocean, about 100,000 square kilometers (62,000 square miles). Capitalists and speculators from Kenya, Somalia and their external supporters covet this area because it has a large deposit of oil and gas. Neither the political leaders of Kenya nor the possible leaders of Somalia offered a Pan-African vision of shared responsibility and cooperation to develop the resources in order to benefit the peoples of Africa. Instead, Kenya sought to use their legal, economic and regional muscle to start exploration and to begin discussions with foreign oil companies. 
Faced with the aggressive position of the Kenyan barons, the Somalis decided to take the matter to the International Court of Justice. Kenya objected to legal arbitration of an area that should not be disputed if Kenya supported the goals of a future united Africa. The position of Kenya thus far on border issues in Eastern Africa goes against the spirit of the African Union’s position with respect to Delimitation and Demarcation of Boundaries in Africa. 
Kenya ineligible to lead Africa at this point 
From the above reasons, this author wants to remind readers of the role of Kenya in becoming the champion of Israel and hosting the Israeli Prime Minister in July of 2016. The Kenyan President proudly claimed that Kenya would be an advocate for Israel before the African Union. This leadership under Uhuru Kenyatta, William Ruto and Amina Mohammed has thus agreed to undermine the Pan African position of supporting the self-determination of the Palestinian peoples. 
One can raise similar questions with respect to the real commitment of Kenya to continue to respect the rights of the peoples of Western Sahara. For the past two years the government of Morocco has been on an intense campaign to rejoin the African Union. In principle, progressive Africans welcome the return of Morocco to the African Union, but it must be spelt out clearly to Morocco that their return will be without conditions. That is, the political leadership of Morocco cannot demand that Africa drop recognition of the Polisario leadership. The summit of the African Union in January 2017 will be a testing ground to see how many societies of Africa will stand firm against Morocco and their supporters in France. 
If not Amin Mohammed, then who? 
Of the current six candidates to lead the African Union, the one candidate with a clear track record of commitment to the goals of Pan Africanism is Abdoulaye Bathily of Senegal. As a progressive historian, Bathily made his mark among a generation of intellectuals. Unfortunately, however, this position of the AU Commission Chair is being pushed by the government of Senegal with both France and Morocco dictating the foreign policy choices of Senegal. Without this subservience to France and Morocco by the Senegalese leadership, Bathily would be the obvious choice. 
The candidacies of Chad, Botswana and Equatorial Guinea already foundered at the meeting of the African Union in Kigali. Like Senegal, the government of Chad fronts for western interests and Chad was one of the few countries to send troops to fight with NATO to destroy Libya. Africa needs to take an independent position on the question of the manipulation of the so-called war on terror and on this matter, Chad ranks with those who need to account for their relationship with Boko Haram. 
Jakaya Kikwete has been a colorless leader of Tanzania for ten years. His friendship with leaders of the George W. Bush party in the USA will raise questions; however, with the arrival of Donald Trump, that faction of the US militarists, the Bush faction is no longer in the driver’s seat. 
African intellectuals and activists cannot afford to be bystanders at this moment. In this short essay, this author has pointed out how at every step of the way since 1963, Kenya worked against African independence. During the anti-apartheid struggles, Kenya supported UNITA and the MNR and for good measure, western security established the banking infrastructure for illicit dealing through Bank of Credit and Commerce International. There was the formation of the “Safari Club” C France, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Morocco and the conservative elements of the USA – to support the apartheid regime in South Africa and the conservative leaders of Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. 
“The one candidate with a clear track record of commitment to the goals of Pan Africanism is Abdoulaye Bathily of Senegal.” 
Since the global war on terror, Kenya has participated in the rendition programs of the US intelligence agencies and stepped up their business operations by working with the CIA to fund groups such as the Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counter-Terrorism (APRCT). ARPCT was a coalition of military entrepreneurs who understood war as a business and knew how to manipulate western intelligence agencies. 
According to a report in the Washington Post in 2006, “Despite its name, the ARPCT probably does little to combat terrorism and is more interested in maintaining the lawless status quo in which the warlords thrive. Experts say the moniker is an attempt to make the group appealing to Western governments, highlighting their battle against the spread of an Islamic militia.” 
Ten years after this exposure, organizations such as the Bell Pottinger group continue to wage information warfare against Kenyans and Africans on the so-called terrorist threats in Eastern Africa. If Kenya had spent every cent that it has been spending on Operation Linda Nchi on building schools, roads, hospitals and water supply systems in Somalia, then the issues before Africa and the African Union would be very different from the divisive questions of illicit trade in sugar, charcoal and the question of boundary demarcation. 
That eastern Africa continues to be strategically important to western security interests can be gleaned from the patience that the British exhibited in ensuring that Kenya maintained a military agreement with Britain for Britain to base troops in Kenya. In this case, Britain is acting as a front for US military interest. Kenya is important strategically to the U.S. Access to Kenyan air and a seaport facilitates imperial capabilities to project air and naval power in the Indian Ocean. 
The political leadership of China has bought into the idea that the Kenyan leadership is anti-imperialist because the leaders were taken to The Hague and the ICC. This kind of analysis by Chinese strategists exposes their limited understandings of class struggles in Eastern Africa and the history of Kenya selling out Africans. From time to time newspapers and journalists revisit the scandals after scandals [4] with respect to primitive accumulation in Kenya. 
Conclusion 
What needs to be understood is that Kenya’s Goldenberg or Anglo Leasing scandals and others are components of a model of capital accumulation in the illicit global economy. This illicit global economy is a legitimate component of the financialization forms of capital that diminishes real production and commerce. 
When the AU was formed, the Economic, Social and Cultural Council (ECOSOCC) had been mandated to bring to the fore the questions that affect Africans in all six regions. It is in this context where there needs to be new focus of the AU. At the last meeting in Kigali, there were feeble efforts to raise revenues for the AU. None of the governments took seriously the illicit global economy and the recommendations of the High Level Panel on Illicit Financial Flows. The western “donors” dominate the discussions on how to stem financial flows and downplay the importance of the return of stolen assets. Kenya was quite willing to raise the question of reparative justice with respect to the crimes of Britain during the colonial wars, but that same Kenyan leadership refuses to support the reparative claims of the global African community.

9624,"California, Drenched by Winter Rain, Is Told ‘Drought’s Over’ - The New York Times","After six years of a prolonged drought in California, it is all but over. On Friday, Gov. Jerry Brown ended the drought emergency for the vast majority of the state. The drought had reduced Folsom Lake, a major reservoir in Northern California, to less than a third of its capacity in 2015, and all but wiped out the Sierra Nevada snowpack. Friday’s announcement, though, was about as symbolic as it was pragmatic. It marked the formal end to a water shortage that had already been erased by a winter of plentiful rain and snow. Many of the state’s most stringent drought rules were eased months ago. Mr. Brown declared a drought state of emergency in January 2014 as the state suffered through one of the driest years in its history. Then, in April 2015, he took to a barren field that typically would have been covered with snow to order a 25 percent reduction in urban water use. As the drought dragged on, state officials worked to craft and then enforce rules aimed at restricting how much water Californians could use  —   and what they could use it for. To help urban dwellers cut their water consumption, many California water suppliers set up rebate programs to get residents to rip out their thirsty lawns and to replace them with   foliage and ground cover using alternate materials, like gravel. But the state’s hydrologic picture brightened significantly beginning in October 2016, when a series of massive storms drenched Northern California. The rain and snow continued through the winter, swelling major reservoirs to the point that officials were forced to make releases. Meanwhile, the state’s snowpack made an impressive recovery. As of Friday, the water content in the state’s snowpack was about 160 percent of what is considered normal for this time of year. By comparison, the snowpack was reported as about 5 percent of average the day Mr. Brown stood on the barren field and ordered mandatory water conservation. Consequently, Mr. Brown lifted the drought emergency on Friday for all but four Central California counties  —   Fresno, Kings, Tulare and Tuolumne  —   which were among the hardest hit. According to the order, Californians managed to slash their water use by more than 22 percent between June 2015 and January 2017. And even as state officials unveiled a plan to continue water conservation in the years ahead, some prohibitions against wasteful water practices  —   like hosing off a sidewalk  —   will remain. “This drought emergency is over, but the next drought could be around the corner,” Mr. Brown said in a statement. “Conservation must remain a way of life. ”",0
9625,No need to worry about Russia-India relations: Trubnikov,"india , russia , indo-russian cooperation Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, right, during their meeting at Taj Exotica Goa, India. Source:RIA Novosti On Oct. 15-16 Russian President Vladimir Putin travelled to India to participate in the annual BRICS summit held this year in Goa. Apart from discussing the future work of BRICS, the Russian leader held talks with India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi on a wide spectrum of issues on the bilateral agenda. To discuss the results of the talks and the impact of recent military drills on Russia-India relations, Russia Direct reached out to Vyacheslav Trubnikov, member of the board of directors of the Institute of World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO) of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Russian Federation to India (2004-2009). He explained why one should not worry about the future of Russia-India relations and shared his view on the closure of Russian media outlets working in Indian languages. 
What is the most important result of the Russian President’s visit to India in the context of Russia-India relations? What was the main takeaway? The key result is the confirmation and further development of the privileged status of Russia’s strategic ties with India. During the visit 20 documents were signed and though, of course, some of them were more important than others, I think that a very serious step forward was made. I wouldn’t say that it is a breakthrough in bilateral relations – it’s rather a gradual development. Vyacheslav Trubnikov. Source: Boris Prihodko/RIA Novosti Today, the scale of our cooperation is growing and the important factor here is that both countries share common approaches to current developments in the international arena. This was expressed in the joint statement titled “ Partnership for Peace and Stability on the Planet .” This is a very important document, which apart from bilateral relations, also helps to form our understanding of how the future polycentric (i.e. multipolar) world might look like. Deputy Foreign Minister of India Sujata Mehta once called Indian foreign policy a “flexible multilateralism,” which I would interpret as a multi-vector foreign policy. The recent negotiations between Putin and Modi showed that Indians are very close to the Russian perception of a multi-vector foreign policy and the countries often have the same or very similar approaches to any particular issue. This is the main takeaway from Putin’s visit. What is more, the leaders considered a wide group of current problems from very pragmatic standpoints that were transparent to each other. It is very important that the countries have managed to maintain the ability to understand each other very well. Sometimes representatives of both sides – such as government officials, diplomats, military leaders and experts – find themselves as prisoners of Soviet-era stereotypes or, on the contrary, think that everything remains as it is and nothing is changing. These are polar-opposite attitudes. The key here is that both sides take into account the interests of each other in pursuing their own national goals. The relationship India and Russia share is indeed one of privileged status and strategic importance. What about economic ties? What is being done to improve the current situation and fulfill the huge potential of cooperation in this area? 
India is Russia's especially privileged strategic partner: Putin We have a very limited trade turnover. There is no doubt about it. The countries have outstanding political relations, but the trade turnover does not reflect the vast economic potential. The volume of mutual investment does not reflect our capabilities as well – today they are at a level of $12 billion with $8 billion coming from India. So Indians are much more active in this respect, maybe due to their experience in working in foreign markets. RD: What about economic ties? What is being done to improve the current situation and fulfill the huge potential of cooperation in this area? Russia’s strong orientation to the West led to Russian companies being more interested in European and U.S. markets. Despite the sanctions, our missiles are still being produced in the U.S. Americans continue to cooperate when they have no option, notwithstanding the sanctions. Speaking about Russia’s pivot to the East, from my view, is not entirely correct. It is simply an alignment of our relations with the rest of the world. And now efforts are being made in this direction. The key thing here to understand is that the memoranda of mutual understanding only show the willingness of sides to cooperate. We can only talk about something when the contract is signed and sides are starting to implement it. This is a step-by-step work. Take, for example, the decision to create a free trade zone with India, which is due to be made in December by the Eurasian Economic Union. It’s not simple and it will require us to think about how to develop this aspect of our relationship. Discussing logistics will be key here. The establishment of economic corridors and energy bridges will require a lot of work on the ground. This can only be done gradually after necessary agreements are prepared and then signed. This is a serious question that requires a lot of time. Another example is the program signed between the Russian Ministry of Energy and India’s Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas to expand cooperation between the two countries in energy. This program will have to be fulfilled by specific projects and contracts later, and then it can be implemented. The countries are quite far away from each other and the questions of logistics and transportation of energy products will be crucial. All this work will be done gradually, stage by stage. The fact that the countries have set 2025 as a due date shows that both of them have considered this issue with responsibility. Overall, I would say that the cooperation now is moving in the right direction and is likely to provide a basis for future breakthroughs in trade turnover and energy cooperation. While the demand for energy in India is growing, the country does not enjoy many of its own energy sources, so that will give the basis for more active cooperation with Russia. 
Russia and India: A civilizational friendship What is your position towards the closure of many media outlets in Russia working in Indian languages? What are the implications of that? 
I’m strongly against it. The liquidation of media coverage that previously was done in eight Indian languages leads to a situation when Indians have less and less knowledge about Russia. The situation is similar in Russia as well: Russian businessmen don’t know how India looks like today. That’s why they are very cautious about entering the Indian market. Indian bureaucracy is sometimes a push-off factor, but the Modi government is making steps to liquidate many of the bureaucratic obstacles changing the tax system and making the environment for foreign investors more transparent. But if our businessmen don’t know about it, they will not go there. The same is applicable to Indians, though they know us a bit better. However, they get their information mostly from Western sources. Economic cooperation requires a systemic approach and in this respect I support the upcoming opening of the office of the Russian Export Center in India. People working there will be researching the developments on the Indian market and business climate. Once the TASS news agency had a correspondent in Delhi to report on the situation in the Indian market. Today I don’t know if someone is doing or is able to do this. All this leads to a situation when the countries don’t even know about the opportunities existing for effective cooperation. For instance, India’s southern states allow for all-year shipbuilding as opposed to Russia’s traditional shipyards, where the construction takes place only half a year. If India and Russia developed joint shipbuilding projects in India’s southern states that could benefit both states. The problem here is the lack of information about each other, which leads to missed opportunities. The interview is abridged. Read the full version published by Russia Direct . Facebook",0
9626,LA Times: Trump Should ’Revive’ Gang of Eight Amnesty Bill - Breitbart,"The Los Angeles Times editorial board is requesting President Donald Trump to “revive” the infamous ‘Gang of Eight’ amnesty legislation that would have legalized some 12 to 30 million illegal immigrants in the U. S.[In the L. A. Times editorial, Trump’s current immigration enforcement measures were blasted as “bullying” and the deportation of illegal immigrants was slammed for allegedly creating “more problems than it solves. ”  Instead, the L. A. Times editors said the ‘Gang of Eight’ amnesty legislation, which Sen. John McCain ( ) and Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) both heralded in 2013, is the answer to the current immigration problem facing the U. S. Most of the 11 million people living in the country illegally have been here for more than a decade, and have become entwined in the fabric of communities despite their illegal status. They are longtime neighbors and friends, the parents of American children, and workers who fill a significant percentage of the jobs in the agriculture, construction and service industries. Kicking them all out creates more problems than it solves. So rather than rousting those who established themselves here years ago without permission and otherwise have not broken significant laws, the administration should work with Congress to revive the 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill and tackle this issue in a humane, pragmatic and   manner that emphasizes what is best for the country. In fact, most Americans support immigration and immigration reform, and want a path for legalization for those who have been longstanding productive members of American society. At the risk of belaboring the obvious, immigration  —   despite society’s occasional surges of xenophobia  —   made this country. Not only does it define the nation’s past, it will define the future, as well. Yes, it needs to be orderly and controlled, which is why responsible national leadership is crucial. Instead, we get bellicosity and  . With Republicans controlling both Congress and the White House, the immigration system is theirs to fix. They need to get to it, rather than pursuing draconian, legally unsound and disruptive enforcement strategies. Amnesty has long been denounced by Trump and his Attorney General Jeff Sessions for its rewarding of legal status to what they see as   and   in the illegal immigration system. That viewpoint by Trump and Sessions has not stopped efforts by more   GOP senators and congressmen. Sen. Thom Tillis ( ) most recently introduced an immigration overhaul legislation that would include amnesty for the millions of illegal immigrants in the U. S. as Breitbart Texas reported.

9627,Down the memory hole: Ukraine's delusional politicians say Soviet Union started WW2,"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 20:10 UTC © Peter / Sputnik Soviet soldiers crossing a river. The North-Western Front. Kiev is trying to re-write history to create the impression that Ukraine was uniformly a victim of a Russian-controlled USSR. This is simply not true. The old shared state wasn't always dominated by Russians and Ukrainians played major roles. In case you missed it, last week, the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's Parliament, approved a document which states how the USSR was responsible for the outbreak of World War II. Yes, that Soviet Union, the same one which was invaded by Nazi Germany in 1941, during Operation Barbarossa, and lost anywhere between 25 and 40 million people as a result of the conflict, depending on who you believe. That the Rada these days exhibits more theatricality than its famous London drama school namesake is a given. But do MPs seriously expect people to swallow the notion of how the USSR, which incidentally was allied with Britain, France and the USA against the Germans, bears responsibility for the war's commencement? It seems they do. And they are trying to rope in the Polish and Lithuanians to legitimize their factual modification enterprise. Indeed, given the characters running the show in Vilnius and Warsaw these days, it's not inconceivable that they might succeed in their mission. Although in the latter's case it would be weird to facilitate the heirs of a mindset shared by the perpetrators of the Volyn and Galician massacre where up to 100,000 Poles were butchered by Ukrainian radicals in 1943. Incidentally, Ukraine has just censored a new Polish movie about the carnage. It's no secret how Kiev is crawling with foreign PR advisers these days, and much of the country's rebranding efforts since Maidan have displayed a level of sophistication heretofore unseen in the ex-Communist world. But this latest wheeze is incredible in its deviousness. The justification for the archival editing is the infamous Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of 1939, which divided Poland between Germany and the USSR. Now, that treaty was immoral and make no mistake about it. But it came after France and Britain had destroyed any chance for an anti-fascist front with the Munich Agreement, which allowed Hitler to march into Czechoslovakia. And many scholars contend that Moscow signed it in order to buy time before the inevitable Hitler invasion. It's worth mentioning how Ukrainians played a big part in the governance of the Soviet Union back then. And highlighting the fact that Poland itself also seized a part of Czechoslovakia in 1938 when it annexed the Teschen District! Which somewhat undermines its victimhood. False Correlation Despite Kiev's current attempts to paint the Soviet Union as a Russian-only affair, the historical reality is rather different. For instance, the original ""People's Commissars"" (equivalent to a ministerial cabinet) who created the state were a multi-national mix, featuring a Georgian by the name of Josef Stalin and three Ukrainians. Leon Trotsky, who essentially 'co-founded' the USSR with Vladimir Lenin, hailed from Kherson and Anatoly Lunacharsky was a native of Poltava. Meanwhile, Pavel Dybenko was born in Russia's border city of Bryansk to a Ukrainian family. Later, after Stalin replaced Lenin, the Georgian's Grigory Ordzhonikidze and Lavrentiy Beria came into the Kremlin's elite circle, in addition to Armenia's Anastas Mikoyan. And during the war, two men with deep associations to Ukraine began to rise up the ranks. The first was Nikita Khrushchev, who moved to Donbass as a teenager and subsequently began his working life and political career in the country. He went on to transfer Russia's Crimea province to Kiev in 1954. In fairness, Khrushchev was ethnically Russian but the man who followed him was a genuine Ukrainian. That was Leonid Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the Communist Party from 1964 to 1982. He was born in Kamenskoye, near Dnipropetrovsk. Furthermore, on his own 1947 passport his nationality is listed as Ukrainian. In fact, you could argue that Brezhnev, a man of exquisite tastes, was the Viktor Yanukovich of his day. Let's not forget the KGB either , regarded as the greatest symbol of Russian repression by Ukraine's nationalists. The problem with this yarn is is three of its eight chairmen were born in the country. The head Chekist in the 1961-1967 period was Vladimir Semichastny, from Donbas. While he has was Russian by blood, in 1982, the fully Ukrainian Vitaly Fedorchuk, a native of Zhitomir, took over. He didn't last long, but his successor, who bossed the KGB from 1982 to 1988, was Dnipropetrovsk's Viktor Chebrikov. The Real Agenda The point is that this highly organized PR campaign is trying to create a counter-factual historical narrative. In the new reality, Ukraine is attempting to make itself seem like a victim of 'Soviet Russia' when in fact most of the country was an integral part of the USSR, and very willingly so. Sure, west Ukrainians - mostly centered around Lviv - hated being connected to Moscow, but they have always been a minority inside their own country. Thus, for Ukraine to try team up with Poland and Lithuania now is quite comical. These two countries were invaded by both of the eastern front's main belligerents and suffered greatly. By contrast, what Ukraine endured was overwhelmingly imposed from Berlin. And the fact that over seven million Ukrainians fought in the Red Army is proof positive of where Kiev's loyalties lay in World War II. The problem today is that the post-Maidan regime is in desperate need of new chronicles to underpin its historic shift away from Moscow. Even if they are totally fictional. We also see this in attempts to lionize Stepan Bandera, who much of the country perceives as a Nazi collaborator and whose henchmen carried out the aforementioned Volyn and Galician massacres. The western PR advisers concocting this rubbish might feel they are being clever right now, but in the long term they are dividing Ukrainians once again into eastern and western camps. And when the next inevitable power shift tilts control back in the other direction, the chronology and commemorations will change again. The fact is that Kiev should be seeking a ""national idea"" which unifies the country. But every time the rulers change, the side in power seeks to impose its interpretation of the past. So long as this continues, Ukraine will never be united and stable. And that's very sad. Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist, who is based in Russia Comment: Further reading",0

9629,Salesforce Shareholders Besiege Possible Twitter Deal - The New York Times,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   The investor pressure began building on Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce. com, two weeks ago. On Sept. 23, news broke that Mr. Benioff’s company was in discussions to buy the troubled social media company Twitter. Inside the offices of hedge funds and mutual fund companies on Wall Street and elsewhere, investors in Salesforce immediately began to question the rationale for buying Twitter. They were not happy. The investors made their concerns known to Mr. Benioff. In emails and other communications, the shareholders told the chief executive and Salesforce’s investor relations team that they disapproved of a   with Twitter. The effort was led by Fidelity Investments, the mutual fund firm that is Salesforce’s largest shareholder, with about 14 percent of the company. At least one Fidelity portfolio manager emailed Salesforce about the deal being a bad idea, according to people briefed on the correspondence, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the communications were private. Other Salesforce investors, including hedge funds, said they would sell the company’s stock, according to two people with knowledge of the communications. By this Wednesday, when Mr. Benioff spoke at an investor meeting at a San Francisco hotel, his language about any deal had turned conciliatory and defensive. “I read all of your notes, you probably know that,” Mr. Benioff said. “I also read your emails. And as I digest all of that information, this is actually the No. 1 thing that has been on my mind. In some cases we have been unusually surprised and we have had to do a reset. ” The pushback offers a window into how big investors can exert pressure on   deals behind the scenes. Salesforce is particularly vulnerable to what its large institutional investors think because the unprofitable online software company relies heavily on its stock to make acquisitions and pay employee compensation. As a result, the company needs to keep investors happy for its share price to continue going up. Salesforce declined to comment, as did a representative from Fidelity. It is unclear whether or not Mr. Benioff will continue to pursue Twitter. One person involved in the negotiations said that, for now, Salesforce’s shareholders have halted a potential deal. For Twitter, that would mean that its options have narrowed. The social media company had been talking to potential buyers, as well as considering divestitures and layoffs to focus its business. But companies including Google, Apple and Disney are not interested in buying Twitter, people at those companies said, and Salesforce appeared to be one of the last interested parties. Twitter as well as Google and Apple declined to comment. Disney did not respond to calls. Recode earlier reported that Google, Apple and Disney would not make bids. Even though Salesforce is a    company, in some ways Mr. Benioff still runs it like a   making promises of boundless growth and equity riches for all employees. Salesforce does not have much cash on hand  —   just over $1 billion as of the end of July  —   compared with other tech companies, which makes it important that shareholders continue to buy its stock and enhance its value. Unlike behemoths like Microsoft, Apple and Oracle, which can turn to their   cash hoards for deals, Salesforce must use a combination of stock and borrowed money to buy companies. If shareholders were to sell and drive down the value of Salesforce stock, that would hurt Mr. Benioff’s   capabilities. Salesforce needs to aggressively acquire companies to keep its revenue growing as its core business,   software, slows, said Mark Moerdler, a senior research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. The company’s reliance on stock can sometimes be a negative. Earlier this year, for example, Salesforce offered a higher per share price than rivals to buy the professional   site LinkedIn. Yet LinkedIn ultimately took a lower offer from Microsoft that was all in cash. Salesforce also depends on stock to pay its employees. During the company’s fiscal year ended Jan. 31, it paid out $593. 6 million in   compensation, about 8 percent of its total sales. The recent investor pushback puts Mr. Benioff, who has long been a shareholder darling, in an unfamiliar position. Salesforce shares have zoomed higher since pricing at $11 in its initial public offering to around $71 now, as investors clamored to own a piece of one of the first companies to successfully convince big enterprises to rent out software that is stored in the cloud, rather than own it and run it themselves. But after the Twitter news broke, investors pushed the stock down by as much as 8 percent over the next 10 days. On Wednesday, during Mr. Benioff’s investor meeting where he sometimes gazed upon his own image projected on an enormous screen above the crowd, he bristled at times over the shareholder reaction. “Well, what about this one deal right here!” Mr. Benioff said, using a shrill and mocking voice to imitate one shareholder email. “I mean the kind of things that I have been reading in the emails are so extreme I am like, Jesus, do they really think that we would do a deal at that level?” Mr. Benioff emphasized that he is a careful deal maker who is sensitive to what any acquisition might mean for Salesforce’s shareholders, which include large, influential institutions like T. Rowe Price, BlackRock, Sands Capital Management and Harbor Funds. “I don’t believe in running the company like a lone wolf,” he said, pointing to his board members who sat in the front row. But he still left the door open, ever so slightly, for future acquisitions. “We believe innovation happens not just in Salesforce, but in other companies,” he said.",0
9630,"Betsy DeVos, Trump’s Education Pick, Plays Hardball With Her Wealth - The New York Times","After Tom Casperson, a Republican state senator from Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, began running for Congress in 2016, he assumed the family of Betsy DeVos,   Donald J. Trump’s nominee to be education secretary, would not oppose him. The DeVoses, a dominant force in Michigan politics for decades with a fortune in the billions, had contributed to one of Mr. Casperson’s earlier campaigns. But a week before his primary, family members sent $24, 000 to one of his opponents, then poured $125, 000 into a “super PAC,” Concerned Taxpayers of America, that ran ads attacking him. The reason, an intermediary told Mr. Casperson: his support from organized labor. “Deceitful, dishonest and cowardly,” was how Mr. Casperson’s campaign described the ads, complaining that the groups running them “won’t say who they are or where their money is coming from. ” On Primary Day, Mr. Casperson went down to defeat. In announcing his intention to nominate Ms. DeVos, Mr. Trump described her as “a brilliant and passionate education advocate. ” Even critics characterized her as a dedicated, if misguided, activist for school reform. But that description understates both the breadth of Ms. DeVos’s political interests and the influence she wields as part of her powerful family. More than anyone else who has joined the incoming Trump administration, she represents the combination of wealth,   ideology and political hardball associated with a   family of billionaires: Charles and David Koch. “They have this moralized sense of the free market that leads to this total program to turn back the ideas of the New Deal, the welfare state,” Kim   a historian who has written extensively about the conservative movement, said, describing the DeVoses. Ms. DeVos declined to be interviewed for this article. Like the Kochs, the DeVoses are generous supporters of think tanks that evangelize for unrestrained capitalism, like Michigan’s Acton Institute, and that rail against unions and back privatizing public services, like the Mackinac Center. They have also funded national groups dedicated to cutting back the role of government, including the National Center for Policy Analysis (which has pushed for Social Security privatization and against environmental regulation) and the Institute for Justice (which challenges regulations in court and defends school vouchers). Both organizations have also received money from the Koch family. Indeed, the DeVoses’ education activism, which favors alternatives to traditional public schools, appears to derive from the same   views that inform their suspicion of government. And perhaps more than other   billionaires, the DeVoses couple their seeding of ideological causes with an aggressive brand of political spending. Half a dozen or more extended family members frequently coordinate contributions to maximize their impact. In the 2016 cycle alone, according to the Michigan Campaign Finance Network, the family spent roughly $14 million on political contributions to state and national candidates, parties, PACs and super PACs. All of this would make Ms. DeVos  —   whose confirmation hearing has been delayed until next week amid mounting pressure that her government ethics review be completed beforehand  —   very different from past education secretaries. “She is the most emblematic kind of oligarchic figure you can put in a cabinet position,” said Jeffrey Winters, a political scientist at Northwestern University who studies economic elites. “What she and the Kochs have in common is the unbridled use of wealth power to achieve whatever political goals they have. ” Ms. DeVos, 59, grew up in Holland, Mich. the daughter of a conservative auto parts magnate who was an early funder of the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian group. When she married Dick DeVos in 1979, it was akin to a merger between two royal houses of western Michigan. Her husband’s father, Richard Sr.   of the multilevel marketing company Amway, was an active member of the Christian Reformed Church that preached a mix of social conservatism and  . He once told the church’s official magazine that Chicago’s poor dwelled in slums because that was “the way they choose to live,” according to a Washington Post story from the 1980s. A fan of   and pinkie rings, Richard Sr. wrote books with titles like “Ten Powerful Phrases for Positive People. ” A similar air hung over his business. Amway sales representatives, which the company calls “independent business owners,” make money both by selling the company’s products  —   everything from perfume to toilet bowl cleaner  —   and by recruiting other sales representatives. The Federal Trade Commission once investigated the company for running a pyramid scheme before concluding that it had misled potential recruits about how much they could expect to earn. The flip side of the family’s proselytizing for capitalism, according to Professor   has been an effort to dismantle much “that would counterbalance the power of economic elites. ” Amway funded a nationwide ad campaign in the early 1980s, protesting high taxes and regulations. Not long after, the company pleaded guilty to cheating the Canadian government out of more than $20 million in revenue. The family had a more winning public face in Dick DeVos, who combined the practiced empathy of a pitchman with the entitlement of an heir, spending over $30 million on an unsuccessful run for governor of Michigan in 2006. The Detroit Free Press described him that year as the wealthiest man to seek office in the state’s modern history. Betsy DeVos, who served as chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party for most of the decade between 1996 and 2005, has often played the role of strategist in the relationship. She was a key adviser in her husband’s run for governor and publicly brooded that he had been too gentlemanly in his first debate against the incumbent. “He’s very good with people, a retail politician who looks you in the eye, shakes your hand, listens to what you say,” said Randy Richardville, a former Republican leader of the Michigan Senate, describing the couple’s strengths. “I would never underestimate Betsy DeVos in a knife fight. ” Ms. DeVos has sometimes lacked her husband’s finesse, once famously blaming many of the state’s economic woes on “high wages. ” She has won detractors, by their account, by browbeating legislators into voting her way. “Betsy DeVos was like my    granddaughter at the time,” said Mike Pumford, a former Republican state representative who once clashed with her. “They were both sweet ladies as long as they kept hearing the word ‘yes.’ They turned into spoiled little brats when they were told ‘no. ’” But Ms. DeVos has often made up for what she lacks in tact through sheer force of will. Mr. Richardville said he and Ms. DeVos disagreed over term limits, which she supported as party chairwoman and he opposed: “I said, ‘I don’t think you should be setting policy. You should be supporting those of us who do make policy.’ But she never backed down. ” While Dick and Betsy DeVos appear to practice a more tolerant form of Christianity than their parents  —   Ms. DeVos has spoken out against   bigotry  —   as recently as the early 2000s they funded some groups like Focus on the Family, a large ministry that helps set the political agenda for conservative evangelicals. They have also backed groups that promote conservative values to students and Christian education, including one with ties to the Christian Reformed Church. Their economic views are strikingly similar to the elder Mr. DeVos’s. According to federal disclosures, Amway, which Dick DeVos ran between 1993 and 2002, has lobbied frequently over the last 20 years to reduce or repeal the estate tax. Only the top 0. 2 percent wealthiest estates paid the tax in 2015. The company has also opposed crackdowns on tax shelters. Ms. DeVos has been an outspoken defender of unlimited contributions known as soft money, which she described in a 1997 editorial as “  American dollars that Big Brother has yet to find a way to control. ” After Congress later passed a major campaign finance reform bill, a nonprofit that Ms. DeVos helped to create and fund masterminded the strategy that produced Citizens United, the 2010 Supreme Court decision laying the groundwork for super PACs funded by corporations, unions and individuals to raise and spend unlimited amounts in elections. And then there are the family’s efforts to rein in the labor movement. Through their contributions to think tanks like the Mackinac Center, as well as Mr. DeVos’s direct prodding of Republican legislators, the family played a key role in helping pass Michigan’s      legislation in 2012. The legislation largely ended the requirement that workers pay fees to unions as a condition of employment. Unions in the state bled members in 2014, the first full year the measure was in effect. Allies say the DeVoses fight for their beliefs. “Betsy and Dick see themselves as principled conservatives,” said Frederick Hess of the American Enterprise Institute. “It kind of seems healthy and admirable to give resources to folks who are going to fight for causes you believe in. ” But the fights can appear to be as much about consolidating power as ideology. Unions were arguably the family’s most formidable political opponent in Michigan, one of labor’s traditional strongholds. The DeVos family’s roots as education activists date back at least to when Richard DeVos Sr. was running Amway and an institute based at the company’s headquarters trained teachers to inject   principles into their curriculum. According to an interview Ms. DeVos gave to Philanthropy magazine, she and her husband became interested in education causes when they began visiting a Christian school that served   children in Grand Rapids in the 1980s. “If we could choose the right school for our kids”  —   by which she appeared to mean primarily private schools  —   “it only seemed fair that they could do the same for theirs,” she told the magazine. The family spent millions of dollars on a ballot proposal in 2000 asking if Michigan should legalize vouchers, in which students can use taxpayer money to attend private schools. Many critics, like the education historian Diane Ravitch, argue that the point of vouchers is to destroy public education and teachers’ unions. The group Americans United for Separation of Church and State has documented how conservative Christians have long supported vouchers, which could fund religious schools. After voters objected by more than a    ratio, Dick DeVos gave a speech at the Heritage Foundation saying such efforts would have to shift to state legislatures, where groups backed by   donors could offer “a political consequence for opposition, and political reward for support of education reform issues. ” It is not unusual for the wealthy  —   who devote nearly 50 percent of their philanthropic dollars to education, according to the group    —   to spend aggressively in the political realm to impose their preferred reforms. Even by these standards, however, the DeVoses stand out for the amount of money they spend trying to advance their goals through politics rather than philanthropy, such as research into reforms or subsidizing schools. As Sarah Reckhow, an expert on education philanthropy at Michigan State University, put it: “The DeVoses are like: ‘No, we know what we want. We don’t need to have all this window dressing. ’” Ms. DeVos has led two nonprofits that have spent millions of dollars electing governors and legislators sympathetic to school vouchers around the country. Matt Frendewey, a spokesman for one of the groups, said the efforts had frequently been bipartisan, and that the amount of money they had spent has been dwarfed by contributions from teachers’ unions opposed to reform. Yet in Michigan, at least, the family’s political strategy has not been subtle. After he defied Ms. DeVos on a key charter school vote, Mr. Pumford, the former Republican legislator, survived an effort by the Great Lakes Education Project, a nonprofit the DeVoses bankrolled, to defeat him in his 2002 primary. But shortly after, the House speaker told him the Education Committee chairmanship he coveted would not be forthcoming. “I said, ‘Why? ’” Mr. Pumford recalled. “He said: ‘You know why. The DeVoses will walk away from us. ’” Mr. Pumford added: “She told me that was going to happen. ” (Rick Johnson, the House speaker, said he did not recall the conversation but also that he had not promised Mr. Pumford the chairmanship and would not have explained his reasons for withholding it.) Over time, the Great Lakes Education Project helped elect Republican majorities sympathetic to the DeVoses’ agenda. But the DeVoses’ lobbyists and operatives also discovered less messy ways to advance legislation. Late one night of their last workweek in 2015, the Michigan House and Senate were about to approve some uncontroversial changes to campaign finance law, when the bill abruptly grew by more than 40 pages. After the legislators discovered what they had voted for, many said they were horrified. Tucked away in the new pages was a provision that would have made it much harder for local bodies like school boards to raise money through property tax increases. “Michigan schools will likely suffer the brunt of the impact because the vast majority rely on periodic voter approval of local operating levy renewals for property taxes,” the ratings agency Moody’s wrote of the measure the following month. “I was fooled into voting for something I opposed,” said Dave Pagel, a Republican representative. “I consider it the worst vote I’ve made. ” The chief culprits, according to Mr. Pagel and others at the state Capitol when the bill passed, were lobbyists closely tied to the DeVoses. Tony Daunt, a spokesman for the Michigan Freedom Fund, a nonprofit headed by the DeVoses’ longtime political aide, and whose political spending arm they have funded generously, said the group was “part of the discussion process with people in the legislature” about the proposal and “had consistently expressed support for the policy. ” The law was later blocked by a federal judge, but the group has vowed to try again. Ms. DeVos’s advocates see in these fights the toughness to take on entrenched opponents of expanding reforms like charter schools and vouchers. In promoting Ms. DeVos in The Washington Post, Mitt Romney, the Republican Party’s 2012 presidential nominee, emphasized that her wealth gave her the independence to be “someone who isn’t financially biased shaping education. ” He added, “DeVos doesn’t need the job now, nor will she be looking for an education job later. ” But critics see someone with an unmistakable agenda. “The signs are there that she will do something radical,” said Jack Jennings, a former general counsel for the House education committee. “Trump wouldn’t have appointed this woman for this position if he didn’t intend something radical. ”",0
9631,Fighter jets drop training bombs on northern Michigan,"We Are Change 
 
This graphic, courtesy of The Atlantic, highlights the disparity in flight hour costs for various aircraft in the US fleet. 
LUZERNE, Mich. – Officials say a mechanical failure is believed to have caused the release of six training bombs and a training missile from a military plane over Michigan’s northern Lower Peninsula.
No one was injured due to the release, which WWTV and WPBN report happened Oct. 25 over Oscoda County.
The training weapons were on a plane heading to Camp Grayling from Selfridge Air National Guard Base in suburban Detroit when they fell off.
Lt. Col. Matthew Trumble, director of the Camp Grayling Air Gunnery Range, says it’s a “rare” situation.
The Guard says the missile was non-explosive and the six training bombs can release smoke so that pilots can see where they land.
In a bizarre end to a military exercise, that ended with training bombs accidentally falling from the sky, as a group of fighter jets heading to Camp Grayling from Selfridge were forced to turn around when they realized a rack of training munitions on one had reportedly accidently fell off.
The Michigan National Guard says the bombs and missile were found near Luzerne.

9632,FOX: Latinos Are Already CRUSHING Trump At The Polls,"Comments 
Republicans are fond of blaming the media for their troubles, but never blaming voters for utterly rejecting their party’s platform of racism, hatred and economic inequality. To some Republican voters, it will even come as a surprise that Donald Trump loses next week’s election, but the signs were all there and here’s an excerpt from just one of the rare Fox News stories that admits it: “ ‘Sleeping Giant’ awake and roaring – early voting shows high Latino turnout “: 
The tens of millions of early votes cast point to strength from Democratic-leaning Latino voters, potentially giving Clinton a significant advantage in Nevada and Colorado. With more than half the votes already cast in those states, Democrats are matching if not exceeding their successful 2012 pace, according to data compiled by The Associated Press. 
Latinos, another group that Democrats have been banking on, are turning out in larger numbers than anticipated, and they very well may be the ones who give the party’s presidential nominee the margin of victory. “We are seeing the trajectory of the election change in some states, but Democrats are also making up ground,” said Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor and expert in voter turnout. 
They don’t let Sean Hannity or Lou Dobbs on to Fox News Latino, which is probably why it actually publishes some factual stories, unlike Fox News or Fox Business, who just today had to retract an entirely false story about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. 
Meanwhile, Univision exit polling is showing that Latinos have the same high level of regard for Hillary Clinton in Florida that they have for President Barack Obama. This level of support is considered key to the Democratic nominee’s strategy to win the Sunshine State, which would act as a firewall, closing almost all of the Republican nominee’s paths to the presidency. The Miami Herald reports : 
Hillary Clinton has hit a key marker among Florida Hispanics, according to a new poll: She’s reached the level of popularity that helped President Barack Obama win the nation’s largest battleground state in 2012. 
Sixty percent of Florida Latinos favor Clinton, the Univision News poll shows. That’s the same number that voted for Obama four years ago, according to exit polls from that election. 
The polls further indicate that Hillary Clinton will probably get at least 60% of the latino vote in Florida, but there’s 9% of the sample that is still not decided, so it could be much higher by the time election day finishes. 
Politico is reporting that the Democratic nominee’s 30-point lead amongst Latino voters in Florida isn’t just a problem for Trump, but that for the entire GOP it’s a “terrifying” prospect. For the wing of the Republican party that likes to win elections, this poll is probably invoking the moment where they see their party’s entire electoral history as the party of Lincoln flash before its eyes, which can only mean that the end of the decadently twisted Grand Old Party is near. 
Republicans wrote an autopsy of their party after their politics of division, hatred and the 47% blew the 2012 election, which declared the GOP dead in the water. Particularly, the report cited the Tea Party’s radical anti-immigration policies, racist dog whistles and the war on women. 
Luckily, that spurred the rank and file GOP voters in 2016 to pick an orange zombie Presidential candidate, a man who has turned off women and latinos like a switch, and added muslims, finished off black people and finally convinced college educated voters to trust that the Democratic party is the only rational political actor that can be trusted. 
Donald Trump’s “safe zone”– THE Fox News Network – is reporting a massive turnout in the latino communities the Republican candidate so despises. 
Now, there is absolutely no way he can claim that the election is rigged next Tuesday night when all of the major news networks pronounce his campaign dead, and the Republican Party along with it. ",0

9634,Hayward: Burger-Flipping Robots Know the True Minimum Wage Is Always Zero - Breitbart,"I thought the grim lesson of the   robots was so obvious it barely deserved comment, but comment I did  …     and soon discovered plenty of people do need this lesson explained to them:[BurgerFlipBot calculates that the true minimum wage is, always has been, and always will be ZERO. https:  .   —   John Hayward (@Doc_0) March 10, 2017,   It’s time for a little primer in BurgerFlipRobot economics, with a little help from the friendly (and   ) folks in my Twitter stream. I decided not to reprint any Tweet except my own, because I don’t wish to embarrass anyone. Quite the contrary  —   I think even my more hostile correspondents were asking very good questions about robots, perhaps even better than they realized.  Rest assured all of the following objections were thrown at me by real people. I have paraphrased them slightly and edited out profanity as needed.   What do you mean, the “real minimum wage is zero?” The true minimum wage is $0. 00. Zip, zero, nada. It doesn’t matter what any government entity declares the minimum wage must be. Business owners always have the option of not hiring you, and therefore paying you nothing. I don’t mean this in a grand, abstract, “well duh” sense. I mean you. You personally, dear reader. Every time you apply for a job, and the prospective employer thinks you might be worth hiring, he also has the option of saying “no” and paying you nothing. He is more likely to say no if the mandatory minimum wage plus overhead  —   the real cost of hiring you, less than half of which you see on your paycheck  —   is higher than the value of your labor. That’s important to remember, because   jobs tend to be   positions. The labor isn’t worth much, but it does have some value. The problem is that the value is sometimes going to be less than what the employer is required by law to pay if he says yes to the  .  Frankly,   jobs are a gamble for employers, and the odds aren’t great. It costs money to train new employees. High overhead costs must be covered. The new guy may very well quit or need to be fired before the investment made in hiring him is recouped.    people have thin resumes and minimal career capital to protect, so it’s difficult to tell if they can be trusted. Hard work plus low pay leads to disgruntled employees. Employers simply don’t know if young workers, or older people   the workforce after a long jobless period, can be trusted not to steal or give free stuff to their friends, but also to appear on time for their designated shift, to keep their hair short, their fingernails clean and their uniforms unstained. Hiring them is a huge roll of the dice for business owners who already have many, many other problems to solve.   The machines that replace human workers don’t cost zero. They aren’t free! No, and no one said they were. Arguing with a point nobody made is impolite. The point is that machines can cost much less than human employees, over a long period of time. They don’t quit suddenly unless the electricity is turned off, they don’t sneak a few sawbucks from the cash register, or throw a fit in front of customers, or stage angry protests to demand higher minimum wages. Even though machines do cost some money to buy and maintain, it is also true that business owners still do not have to buy a machine or a person’s labor and time, so the eternal minimum wage of human workers remains at zero. Of course, when the cost of the machines begins to drop below the minimum legal cost of hiring human labor, then human workers are going to have a fundamental problem.   Upgrading and maintaining BurgerFlipBot will cost a lot of money! Yes, but it will cost less money next year, and maybe even less than the cost of the least diligent kitchen crewmembers.  Too many Americans have no idea what it’s like to run a business. They don’t even know how much their own employers are shelling out for their labor.  It won’t take long before BurgerFlipBot and its cousins become so much cheaper than human staffers  —   and then hiring unreliable, untrustworthy or unskilled people becomes actually  . Once that happens, the trend will just accelerate as more robots purchases fund the development of better and cheaper robots.  If you are reading this on a cell phone, you hold the proof of this proposition in the palm of your hand. Imagine how cheerful and happy BurgerFlipBot Series 7 will be when it greets you when you enter the   joint. Another nice thing about BurgerFlipBot is that installing and maintaining it will probably be cheaper than complying with the   maze of regulations surrounding the most politicized resource in our economy: human labor. Even if the FDA inspects the hell out of automated restaurants, it probably won’t approach the compliance cost of dealing with the paperwork for human labor  —   and who knows what new mandates and restrictions politicians will add to human labor over the next decade or two?   The   robot is crude and slow! It could never replace me! This is just propaganda to scare me out of demanding a fair living wage! BurgerFlipBot is crude and slow now, but it should hardly be necessary to explain to any denizen of the 21st Century that machines get better over time, especially when demand for the machines gives the designers enough money to make improvements. For the time being, human labor is often objectively superior to robots. The problem is that it might not be superior enough to justify the high cost and hassle of employing humans.  The poor folks who don’t understand what’s going on with automation and the minimum wage were criminally miseducated by schools that didn’t teach them about elasticity. To put it very simply, elasticity means price affects supply and demand gradually. Many factors contribute to how much a given increase in price will affect supply and demand. Some goods have inelastic supply and elastic demand, or vice versa. Gasoline is a common example of an inelastic product because demand only changes a little as the price fluctuates. People still need gas, even when it’s expensive. When central planners daydream about using gas price increases to reduce America’s carbon footprint, they need to threaten gigantic hikes of $9 or $10 per gallon. Conversely, the demand for each brand of beer is fairly elastic  —   raise the price of Bud Light and people will quickly switch to Coors Light.  Let’s be blunt about the elasticity of labor: both supply and demand are far more elastic than most people imagine. Raise the cost of labor enough, and employers will quickly make do with less or develop robots to human work. Make welfare benefits generous enough, and people will quickly stop supplying cheap labor. Management still wants cheap labor for basic work, so they’ll find it elsewhere. The younger generation is much more willing to deal with machines in commercial environments than older people were. They’re willing, and often eager, to conduct a wide range of transactions without human assistance  —   ordering from Amazon. com instead of shopping in a    store, for example, or ordering food from a touch screen at a restaurant instead of speaking with a cashier. Resistance to automation is melting away before our very eyes. This melting is rapidly closing the value gap between human and machine labor. Unfortunately, that revolution is occurring at the same time human labor is becoming problematic due to poor education, bad worker attitudes, and demands for a higher minimum wage.   consumers will forgive many errors by BurgerFlipBot if the food stays cheap. The danger is not that restaurants will abruptly stop hiring humans and roll out BurgerFlipBot nationwide as soon as the minimum wage hits $15, $18, or $20 per hour. The danger is that artificially inflated wages gradually make automation more appealing, while improvements in technology and changing customer attitudes gradually remove the drawbacks of automation.   Okay, so we lose some   jobs to these robots. So what? Those jobs stink anyway. It’s better to work as a   BurgerFlipBot repair technician than slave over a hot grill for crap wages! This brings us back to the searing truth of “the true minimum wage is zero. ”   jobs are important to society and to young people. Sacrificing a huge number of them to create a few     maintenance jobs will not be pleasant for the people can qualify to work on a grill, but cannot work on a complex robot. Far too much of our labor argument is dominated by puerile sentiments like “everyone deserves a living wage. ” This is not about what people deserve. It’s about what they can earn. Many people who could prosper if they began as   are not ready to work as BurgerFlipBot technicians. Automation and robots threaten to demolish the   to the workforce for a vast number of young,   and marginal employees. Artificially increasing the cost of labor by jacking up the minimum wage will accelerate that demolition. In earlier times, labor activists were confident that business would eventually buckle to their demands, because the bottom line was no employees = no business. That is no longer true. Employers generally still prefer human labor, but the variables are changing. In a nation with tens of millions of   workers, a 10 percent reduction in demand for labor means a lot of people will lose their chance at employment, possibly forever. Many   or   people financed good career paths by starting out in humble   jobs. They prospered from flipping burgers, even though they only flipped burgers for a couple of years. Combine automation with artificially increased competition for   work from mass immigration, and the result will be a large number of people who never get a chance at working their way out of poverty. They’ll never really learn how to work. Furthermore, BurgerFlipBot doesn’t pay taxes. Our current social welfare system demands steady input from human workers forking over payroll taxes to the government. The ratio of taxpaying workers to dependents has already become dangerously low. It’s simply amazing to watch people who are comfortable with our entitlement system or want even more entitlement spending for benefits such as health care, cavalierly assume the current system is sustainable with a smaller workforce working better jobs.   Well, automation will happen no matter what minimum wage we demand, so we’re screwed anyway. Don’t give up hope. Elasticity is the key concept to remember. Jacking up labor costs makes it more likely human jobs will be replaced, and makes it more likely the replacement will happen soon. That’s bad news for a society that is still struggling to reconfigure its education system to improve the value of human capital. Increasing the incentives for employers to ditch humans for machines quickly leaves us with less time to improve the workforce and develop new avenues for human employment. It matters a great deal how quickly these changes happen. Some people blithely assume   workers can simply switch jobs after robots take their positions. That takes time, both to train the workers and to create the new jobs. We’ve allowed foolish politics on economics, education, and immigration to run down the clock.  Take a look around at all the   machines you see this weekend, and all the ways   has replaced   retail activity. Consider the grim proof that social welfare spending is no substitute for work, even if lavish benefit programs were sustainable. Understand that once BurgerFlipBot is on the job, it’s very unlikely human workers will ever take its job away.  We can’t stop progress or robots, but we can adopt wise policies that maximize both supply and demand for human capital, encouraging employers to pay the best price for   labor. Right now, we’re trying to force them to pay more than the labor is really worth because our government has not been able to establish a better set of labor, immigration and education policies. BurgerFlipBot is a symbol of that government failure  —   and a stark warning of what lies at the end of that road.",0
9635,Brooklyn Residents Seek Answers After a Mentally Ill Ex-Convict Is Fatally Shot - The New York Times,"On a residential block of Union Street in Brooklyn, everyone seemed to have known Andre Lane, the neighborhood fixture with the body of a fighter and a great singing voice who appeared a little off but was considered harmless. Now, they all want to know who killed him in the public housing complex around the corner. Mr. Lane, 26, who had a lengthy history of mental health problems, had survived a brutal beating at the hands of correction officers at Rikers Island, New York City’s main jail complex, in 2012. But he was shot and killed on Wednesday night as he struggled to remake a life that had been difficult from the start. People in the Brownsville neighborhood where Mr. Lane lived and died could not make sense of his death. “He didn’t bother nobody,” Byron Jenkins, 49, said. “Everybody knew Andre had a mental problem. Once he had an argument with somebody, he calmed down. “I don’t know what took place” on Wednesday, Mr. Jenkins continued, “but he shouldn’t have died like that. ” Mr. Lane was shot around 10:30 p. m. the police said, inside 682 Ralph Avenue, one of five red brick apartment buildings that make up the Ralph Avenue Houses. Bullets struck him in his torso and right arm, the police said, and he was pronounced dead at Kings County Hospital Center. Residents said they heard a boom, followed by the pop of five gunshots. From her kitchen on the fourth floor of the building, Joan, 51, said she saw the reflection of people’s feet running from the building in a glass door across the street. Her partner said he saw through a bedroom window the flash of a gun firing in the lobby. Like many of her neighbors, Joan declined to give her surname because she feared retaliation. Investigators were still trying to find the gunman as well as witnesses to help them piece together what happened before the shooting. But they faced the formidable task of penetrating the silence of a neighborhood terrorized by gangs, and where mistrust of the police and fear of retaliation for cooperating with them stymie efforts to catch criminals. Mr. Lane’s family has searched the neighborhood for answers. Tyesha Lane, 30, one of his sisters, hovered behind the police tape at the entrance to the Ralph Avenue building on Thursday, while investigators took photographs of an apartment on the first floor. The door had been broken down and the occupants had not returned. “My brother’s been through so much throughout his life,” Ms. Lane said. “And to learn that his life was taken from him that way, I’m heartbroken. He was never given a fair shot at life. ” Their mother, Isis Lane, laid a Bible on the sidewalk opened to Psalm 23, which portrays God as a shepherd guiding his flock. At night, the candles that surrounded the book flickered as the wind lifted its pages. Ms. Lane had been addicted to crack cocaine when her son was born on Oct. 12, 1989. He had schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression and attention deficit disorder. Mr. Lane and two of his sisters were raised by their aunt Marvenus Lane Nicholson, who took him to church, where he sang in the choir, her daughter Tanya Ragoonanan, 39, said. Ms. Nicholson died in June 2012 after a heart attack. By then, Mr. Lane had dropped out of high school and had been arrested several times for jumping subway turnstiles, arguing with police officers and fighting, Ms. Ragoonanan said. He was an adult, and it had become much harder for his family to get him help, she added. “He was hyper, but they didn’t care because he was grown,” Ms. Ragoonanan said. “The system really railroaded him. ” Six months after Ms. Nicholson’s death, Mr. Lane was in solitary confinement at Rikers on a cellblock reserved for mentally ill inmates. He was beaten by guards on Dec. 17 after splashing a liquid on them after the inmates were told they might not be fed dinner that night. Mr. Lane was one of 129 inmates who sustained serious injuries in altercations with guards at Rikers Island in cases that were documented in a secret study by the city’s health department, which handles medical care there. The study, which revealed a culture of brutality perpetrated by correction officers at the jail complex, was uncovered in 2014 during a   investigation by The New York Times. Prosecutors declined to bring criminal charges against the officers who beat Mr. Lane. The city has hired a consulting firm to plan reforms at its troubled jails. After his release, Mr. Lane told his family he never wanted to go back to jail. But he struggled to find stability and to stay out of trouble. He was due back in court as soon as Tuesday to face misdemeanor charges stemming from six different arrests, one from February 2013 and five between October 2015 and May 2016, according to court records. On May 18, he was arrested after the superintendent of an apartment building on Ralph Avenue said he broke the glass entry door, according to court records. Samira Hickman, 49, said it took about a dozen police officers to subdue him. His strength, she said, was “unbelievable. ” After he was released on May 24, he got a job at the J. Q. Grocery Store, a deli where a picture of a smiling President Obama hangs near a painting of the Last Supper in which Jesus and his disciples all have brown skin. Earl Morgan, the cashier, said Mr. Lane stocked the freezers and did odd jobs. Veronica, who lives in the neighborhood and declined to give her surname, said Mr. Lane had recently asked her to tutor him in math and reading. At a vigil on Friday on St. Mark’s Avenue in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, where Mr. Lane lived as a child, his family and friends erected a memorial for Dre Blacc, as he was known.

The event will feature protests outside over 200 Planned Parenthood facilities across the United States.

On top of that, Planned Parenthood is trafficking baby body parts. Taxpayers are sickened to see their money spent in support of these atrocities. ” Scheidler adds: This is a nationwide event, but at the same time it is a local community concern. As citizens gather to encourage Congress to quit sending money to an organization that specializes in killing children, they are also declaring that they do not want Planned Parenthood to continue operating in their neighborhoods. Citizens for a   Society director Dr. Monica Migliorino Miller also states, “The defunding of Planned Parenthood is a matter of moral principle. Not a single cent of American tax dollars should go to an organization that kills innocent human life. ” #ProtestPP #POTUS #maga, Until which time people have had enough of the attacks on our culture and way of life.

Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser. “Planned Parenthood is a     business that has performed more than 300, 000 abortions in the last three years for which data are available. They do not need or deserve taxpayer dollars, and redirecting their federal funding to rural and community health centers would be a victory for women’s health. ” Dannenfelser notes that FQHCs “outnumber Planned Parenthood facilities 20 to 1 nationwide and provide far more services.

9637,"Katy Perry, Cher Join Anti-Trump Women’s March on Washington","Singers Katy Perry and Cher will be among the thousands of women expected to travel to the nation’s capital for the Women’s March on Washington to protest   Donald Trump’s inauguration this month. [Ugly Betty actress America Ferrera, chair of the organization’s “artist table,” said the march is about standing up to the incoming administration.  “Since the election, so many fear that their voices will go unheard,” Ferrera said in a statement. “As artists, women, and most importantly dedicated Americans, it is critical that we stand together in solidarity for the protection, dignity, and rights of our communities. Immigrant rights, worker rights, reproductive rights, LGBTQIA rights, racial justice and environmental rights are not special interests, they affect us all and should be every American’s concern. ” Actresses Scarlett Johansson, Zendaya, Debra Messing, and Julianne Moore and talk show host Chelsea Handler are also expected to participate in the January 21 event. Comedian Amy Schumer  —   who initially vowed to move to Spain if Trump won, and later said the statement was a joke  —   took to Instagram last month to encourage her five million followers to join her at the march. “January 21 I’ll be there,” the Trainwreck star wrote. “Who’s coming with me? The group wants the event to “send a bold message to our new administration on their first day in office, and to the world that women’s rights are human rights. ” “The rhetoric of the past election cycle has insulted, demonized, and threatened many of us  —   immigrants of all statuses, Muslims and those of diverse religious faiths, people who identify as LGBTQIA, Native people, Black and Brown people, people with disabilities, survivors of sexual assault  —   and our communities are hurting and scared,” the organization says. Handler, who wrote a   essay shaming “white female” Trump supporters, is expected to host a separate march in Park City, Utah during the Sundance Film Festival. “I’m honored to join the Women’s March on Washington Artist Table,” Handler said. “By hosting a sister march in Park City, our Women’s March on Main will help send a message to the incoming administration that attacks on Planned Parenthood and our fundamental human rights are unacceptable and if we have to   for rights we have already fought for and won, we will do it louder and stronger, with men by our side. ” Actress Scarlett Johansson said: “The new administration may be very vague about specifics, but one thing has been made very clear their intentions of reducing the availability of Women’s Healthcare and attacking her reproductive rights. I am marching on Washington to let our next president know that we, men and women alike, will not stand down or be silenced and will fight to protect our bodies and our choices. ” The   Women’s March on Washington has not been without controversy. As the New York Times reports, some organizers of sister protests across the country and volunteers for the Washington D. C. march believe that the “march for all women” has, in manny cases, turned “into a march for black women. ” Between committed supporters and online RSVPs, the event organizers are expecting over a million marchers in the nation’s capital and across the country to support their   efforts.

9639,Why Trump Won; Why Clinton Lost,"Why Trump Won; Why Clinton Lost November 9, 2016 
Exclusive: Hillary Clinton’s stunning defeat reflected a gross misjudgment by the Democratic Party about the depth of populist anger against self-serving elites who have treated much of the country with disdain, writes Robert Parry. 
By Robert Parry 
In the end, Hillary Clinton became the face of a corrupt, arrogant and out-of-touch Establishment, while Donald Trump emerged as an almost perfectly imperfect vessel for a populist fury that had bubbled beneath the surface of America. 
There is clearly much to fear from a Trump presidency, especially coupled with continued Republican control of Congress. Trump and many Republicans have denied the reality of climate change; they favor more tax cuts for the rich; they want to deregulate Wall Street and other powerful industries – all policies that helped create the current mess that the United States and much of the world are now in. A sign supporting Donald Trump at a rally at Veterans Memorial Coliseum at the Arizona State Fairgrounds in Phoenix, Arizona. June 18, 2016 (Photo by Gage Skidmore) 
Further, Trump’s personality is problematic to say the least. He lacks the knowledge and the temperament that one would like to see in a President – or even in a much less powerful public official. He appealed to racism, misogyny, white supremacy, bigotry toward immigrants and prejudice toward Muslims. He favors torture and wants a giant wall built across America’s southern border. 
But American voters chose him in part because they felt they needed a blunt instrument to smash the Establishment that has ruled and mis-ruled America for at least the past several decades. It is an Establishment that not only has grabbed for itself almost all the new wealth that the country has produced but has casually sent the U.S. military into wars of choice, as if the lives of working-class soldiers are of little value. 
On foreign policy, the Establishment had turned decision-making over to the neoconservatives and their liberal-interventionist sidekicks, a collection of haughty elitists who often subordinated American interests to those of Israel and Saudi Arabia, for political or financial advantage. 
The war choices of the neocon/liberal-hawk coalition have been disastrous – from Iraq to Afghanistan to Libya to Syria to Ukraine – yet this collection of know-it-alls never experiences accountability. The same people, including the media’s armchair warriors and the think-tank “scholars,” bounce from one catastrophe to the next with no consequences for their fallacious “group thinks.” Most recently, they have ginned up a new costly and dangerous Cold War with Russia. 
For all his faults, Trump was one of the few major public figures who dared challenge the “group thinks” on the current hot spots of Syria and Russia. In response, Clinton and many Democrats chose to engage in a crude McCarthyism with Clinton even baiting Trump as Vladimir Putin’s “puppet” during the final presidential debate. 
It is somewhat remarkable that those tactics failed; that Trump talked about cooperation with Russia, rather than confrontation, and won. Trump’s victory could mean that rather than escalating the New Cold War with Russia, there is the possibility of a ratcheting down of tensions. 
Repudiating the Neocons 
Thus, Trump’s victory marks a repudiation of the neocon/liberal-hawk orthodoxy because the New Cold War was largely incubated in neocon/liberal-hawk think tanks, brought to life by likeminded officials in the U.S. State Department, and nourished by propaganda across the mainstream Western media. Donald Trump speaking with supporters at a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona. June 18, 2016. (Photo by Gage Skidmore) 
It was the West, not Russia, that provoked the confrontation over Ukraine by helping to install a fiercely anti-Russian regime on Russia’s borders. I know the mainstream Western media framed the story as “Russian aggression” but that was always a gross distortion. 
There were peaceful ways for settling the internal differences inside Ukraine without violating the democratic process, but U.S. neocons, such as Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, and wealthy neoliberals, such as financial speculator George Soros, pushed for a putsch that overthrew the elected President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014. 
Putin’s response, including his acceptance of Crimea’s overwhelming referendum to return to Russia and his support for ethnic Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine opposing the coup regime in Kiev, was a reaction to the West’s destabilizing and violent actions. Putin was not the instigator of the troubles. 
Similarly, in Syria, the West’s “regime change” strategy, which dates back to neocon planning in the mid-1990s, involved collaboration with Al Qaeda and other Islamic jihadists to remove the secular government of Bashar al-Assad. Again, Official Washington and the mainstream media portrayed the conflict as all Assad’s fault, but that wasn’t the full picture. 
From the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011, U.S. “allies,” including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey and Israel, have been aiding the rebellion, with Turkey and the Gulf states funneling money and weapons to Al Qaeda’s Nusra Front and even to the Al Qaeda spinoff, Islamic State. 
Though President Barack Obama dragged his heels on the direct intervention advocated by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Obama eventually went in halfway, bending to political pressure by agreeing to train and arm so-called “moderates” who ended up fighting next to Al Qaeda’s Nusra Front and other jihadists in Ahrar al-Sham. 
Trump has been inarticulate and imprecise in describing what policies he would follow in Syria, besides suggesting that he would cooperate with the Russians in destroying Islamic State. But Trump didn’t seem to understand the role of Al Qaeda in controlling east Aleppo and other Syrian territory. 
Uncharted Territory 
So, the American voters have plunged the United States and the world into uncharted territory behind a President-elect who lacks a depth of knowledge on a wide variety of issues. Who will guide a President Trump becomes the most pressing issue today. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaking with supporters at a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona. March 21, 2016. (Photo by Gage Skidmore) 
Will he rely on traditional Republicans who have done so much to mess up the country and the world or will he find some fresh-thinking realists who will realign policy with core American interests and values. 
For this dangerous and uncertain moment, the Democratic Party establishment deserves a large share of the blame. Despite signs that 2016 would be a year for an anti-Establishment candidate – possibly someone like Sen. Elizabeth Warren or Sen. Bernie Sanders – the Democratic leadership decided that it was “Hillary’s turn.” 
Alternatives like Warren were discouraged from running so there could be a Clinton “coronation.” That left the 74-year-old socialist from Vermont as the only obstacle to Clinton’s nomination and it turned out that Sanders was a formidable challenger. But his candidacy was ultimately blocked by Democratic insiders, including the unelected “super-delegates” who gave Clinton an early and seemingly insurmountable lead. 
With blinders firmly in place, the Democrats yoked themselves to Clinton’s gilded carriage and tried to pull it all the way to the White House. But they ignored the fact that many Americans came to see Clinton as the personification of all that is wrong about the insular and corrupt world of Official Washington. And that has given us President-elect Trump.

9640,"New Ascension Symptoms: The Plasma Wave, Timelines and the Dream","By Alexa Person
Friday, October 14, 2016, one day after President Obama issued an Executive Order regarding space weather events , the Earth’s magnetic shields collapsed and the energetic streams of energy flowing around Earth (solar winds) completely changed direction. These events corresponded with a severe geomagnetic storm that can be tracked in the satellite video below.
A massive plasma wave literally washed over our planet. This wave consisted of high frequency energy bearing Ascension codes and these codes arrived in the form of Light, otherwise known as photons. My ascended Twin Flame, Ahy, has taught me a great deal about these photon packets, which I now understand to be Amplituhedrons.
Satellite Imagery and Executive Order regarding Space Weather 
Since this event took place, I’ve seen a dramatic rise in a number of unexpected side effects:
Stillness. More than usual. It’s as if Gaia is allowing us to experience a “pause” while we are given a chance to integrate the energy bombarding her 4th Density. Time has vanished. And along with it, urgency has disappeared. Everything is getting done, but any anxiety associated with the completion of tasks is nonexistent. Profound sense of peace. Conscious contact with our Higher Dimensional Selves. Body temperatures rising unpredictably and dramatically while at rest. Powerful Light energy intermittently discharging through the skin and/or spine causing intense tingling sensations. Increased focus. Unconsciously shielding the Mind/Body/Soul. Increased contact with the Higher Self. Appetite fluctuations paired with conscious eating. Fatigue. Increased sensitivity, joy and clairvoyant abilities. Due to the onset of my own side effects earlier last week, I cancelled appointments and managed only the most pressing responsibilities. Knowing it was important to be still with this energy, I chose to isolate myself with the intention of integration. I noticed that within the stillness, I desired my own energy. Pushing back all my Guides and other external energies, I found myself hibernating within the stillness of my own I AM Presence.
I normally do not review journal entries once they are written, but I was specifically guided to share these two entries.
The following writings took place before and after the plasma wave moved over our planet. The passages are excerpts taken directly from my journals. For the sake of authenticity, I have kept the copy in tact and have not altered it in any way. It is my prayer that they are of some assistance. If only one person finds any guidance in what I share, I will consider these efforts a success.

Journal Entry I I entered a deep meditation and experienced an intense connection with the Amplituhedon. Elementals and the Cardinal Directions gathered and assisted me in moving it [Amplituhedron’s energy] outward in every direction; 360 degrees it moved away from the Earth’s core. Multiple crystalline Amplituhedrons swirled away from the center at tremendous speeds. As they moved, I felt a rush and connection with them.
Working with the Amplituhedrons was different this time. Instead of moving through each individual layer of the Earth, I connected intensely and instantaneously [with the energy], moving it upward into the Christos Grid and the Magdalen Grid, only to turn my attention outward to reconnect this radiant pink light with the Sun and the Great Central Sun.
I had an epiphany. I felt my consciousness proclaim: “I am fine. I am where I need to be. I am in Service of Others. I am positioned exactly where we decided I would be.”
No longer do I yearn to fly off the Earth and leave her for my higher, familiar realms. I know my job is right here in the NOW. This is the moment I’ve been waited for, the one we have all waited for: the Harvest.
My mind continually wanders past the multiverses and I consider who or what gazes down at the honeycomb mazes of life and wonders, “Do they have any concept of anything grander?”
And so it goes, I guess: one atom building against another and so on-the Divine Matrix.
Shortly after this entry, I had another moment with the Amplituhedron that directly related to everyone on the planet.
Journal Entry II As it connected to Gaia, I wondered if I needed to visualize the Amplituhedrons. Suddenly, I began moving the energy upwards from the center Earth’s Amplituhedron and called upon the Elementals and cardinal directions for assistance. It wasn’t as dramatic as before, but it moved incredibly fast, much faster than other times.
As I got to the surface where I joined with all mankind again, something different took place. I found myself standing with hands cupped open in front of me, manifesting another Amplituhedron. This one revolved in the air, spinning just in front of the heart chakra of every human being. It remained there, revolving in a holding pattern, waiting to be accepted.
We are all being asked to consciously step into the new frequencies coming into the planet. It is accepted by Free Will.
I watched and marveled at the beauty of this geometry floating before the abstract representation of ALL people.
The Amplituhedron then rose into the blue sky and lowered itself into brilliant blue water where it turned 45 degrees to the right and lodged itself into the Earth. A second Amplituhedron revealed itself and remaining upright, hovered far in front of the one buried beneath the water in the soil.
Two identical Amplituhedrons remained before me. One buried at a right angle within the Earth and a second levitating in another realm, completely unhindered by the other.
Confused, I asked my Higher Self what this scene meant and I received a brief, yet lengthy (this is how it works) explanation of how 3rd Density will phase out.
The Earth’s timelines are wobbly, splicing, and we are being asked to choose our path. Some people will bury themselves in the gravity of the Earth’s illusion and others will transcend it. But all is in order and perfection, as there is no judgment. All paths ultimately lead to the same place-Source. Some paths are merely shorter than others.
The time has come. Frequencies are being evaluated and put into order. There is little time to reevaluate and alternate paths. The difficulty lies in the trajectory of assimilating the lessons of Unity Consciousness.
Holding Space for the Higher Self Immediately after experiencing the double Amplituhedrons, I thought about an exercise I did a long ago:
My cells were in solitude I spoke to my cells I brought Light into my cells Activating the “junk DNA” As a result, my body became conscious of me, thus I “awakened to myself”. Just as my cells became aware of me, it was my job to hook into the greater sea of Unity Consciousness and look past the 3rd Dimension. I strove to higher ground, ever-seeking a higher frequency of consciousness, praying my Higher Self would bless me with a “sign”. Thankfully, I quieted my mind long enough to allow this “sign” into my consciousness.
The irony is our Higher Self is always communicating with us. The problem is that we are so contaminated by the illusion of the 3rd Dimension and everything it offers that we don’t listen. Distractions have the intention and priority to become unavoidable. Technology, addictions, entertainment and vices never sleep. They rage 24 hours a day. In an age of instant gratification, Stillness is not rewarded. So how does the Higher Self reach us?
If we are wise enough to practice stillness via meditation or other sacred practices, the Higher Self will communicate and the threshold between the illusory offerings of this dimension and higher ones will be broken. Contact made, the upward reaching cycle continues. As activated beings we begin to see the Universe(s) through the lens of Unity Consciousness.
The Solar System then becomes a multiverse. The multiverse soon becomes part of a system of multiverses, and so on, whereas before releasing fear, there was merely one Solar System-the ego.
And so, the cycles continue, but where do they end? What happens after we traverse multiverses? Is there a designer? Multiple designers? Are they wondering when we will begin to ponder their existence?
If Nassim Haramein’s model is correct, there is no ending. The fractal can be drilled down in either direction. Density is irrelevant.

Something to ponder… We are all dreamers dreaming the dream, so why not make it a loving one?
We ALL have the opportunity to raise our frequency, step into these new algorithms of Light and integrate them into our resonate fields. It merely requires dropping fear and embracing Love. Forgive. Be more kind to people.
Love & Light,

9641,Let’s Say Obamacare Is Repealed. What Then? - The New York Times,"The election of Donald J. Trump gives the Republicans in Congress a chance to act on their   desire to get rid of Obamacare, a wish that Mr. Trump mostly says he shares. Aaron E. Carroll and Austin Frakt, the health policy analysts for The Upshot, discuss: Then what? Aaron: I think it’s safe to say few in Congress thought they would have this opportunity. But like the proverbial dog who has finally caught the car, after untold futile attempts, Republicans have finally come within reach of repealing the Affordable Care Act. Now comes the essential question: Will they actually do it? They’ve been promising it forever, but I am still skeptical that it will happen. I believe you disagree. I’m going to let you go first. Why do you think they’ll do it? Austin: I think they’ll do it because they so thoroughly own the idea of repeal, having passed bills to repeal, partly repeal, delay or defund the A. C. A. in the House something like 60 times. Just the other day Senator Mitch McConnell endorsed repeal (again). The House and Senate also agreed to do so, in large part, in a budget reconciliation bill earlier this year. The only thing that prevented it was that President Obama vetoed it. I doubt Mr. Trump would do the same if given a similar opportunity. Now, I know that a budget reconciliation dismantling of the law is not a full repeal, because according to the rules it can only touch   provisions. This excludes things like requiring insurers to take all comers for premiums that vary only by age and smoking status or preventing them from imposing coverage caps and lifetime limits, among other measures. I also must add that I’m much less confident of a repeal (or partial repeal) without agreement on a replacement. But I’ll turn it back to you, Aaron. Do you think the G. O. P. has to offer a full replacement to get its members to sign on to repeal? Or can it offer something that would cover fewer people and with fewer benefits? Aaron: I think they can get away with slightly fewer people and somewhat skimpier benefits, but not too much. There’s a part of me that thinks many in Congress were always so willing to vote for a “repeal” because they knew it had no chance of being signed into law. They got credit for the vote without ever having to face the downside. Actually repealing without replacing would mean effectively stripping more than 20 million people of their health insurance, without anything in return. This would be an unmitigated political disaster. The stories  —   of people with cancer, diabetes and more who were suddenly stripped of their insurance and left out in the cold  —   would very likely dominate our discussion for months. That leaves more than enough time to lead to significant repercussions in the 2018 midterm elections. With no Democratic leaders in any branch of government to blame, I think this would be akin to what happened in the 2010 elections, but in reverse. Now, if they can coalesce around a “replace” plan that doesn’t leave too many people out, then I think they could move forward. But in all the years since the A. C. A. was passed, Republicans haven’t been able to do that. Do you think they can? What do you think that plan would look like? Austin: One way to get from repeal to replace that minimizes immediate political risk is to pass a plan that doesn’t call for repeal for several years, at least after the 2018 midterms, though possibly after the 2020 election. Between now and then, there would need to be some kind of transition to whatever replaces Obamacare that didn’t just dump people off coverage with no alternative. But the alternatives could just be not as comprehensive or costly. Absolutely there will be bad stories. But keep in mind, there will be bad stories under Obamacare, too. Rocketing premiums, huge cost sharing and markets with few choices is not a recipe for political success. Republicans now own the task of fixing those things and doing so in a way that does not look as if they’re making Obamacare better. They’re actually in a tough policy spot. They’ll get the blame if they don’t fix or repeal the A. C. A. and they’ll get the blame if they don’t replace it with something people like better. Health policy is a very difficult and thankless task. I think they’ll opt for something they can call repeal and replace, but they could also just let Obamacare struggle and die. Neither looks good. One other way to get out from under the issue is to kick it to the states. Do you think a Trump administration, working with a G. O. P. Congress, will offer greater flexibility to states to design their own coverage plans that could diverge from Obamacare? If so, what are some ideas states might try? Aaron: I think it’s very likely those in Congress could punt Medicaid to the states. For years, they’ve been trying to change Medicaid funding to a block grant that they can then constrain over time. This will be enticing for them because it will allow them to reduce Medicaid spending in the future, while forcing states to make the tough decisions  —   and take the blame  —   for cuts in either beneficiaries or services. Fixing the markets for those who are getting health insurance through the Obamacare exchanges, though, is a different story. Without some sort of market regulation, which they’ve generally been opposed to, the same problems that existed  . C. A. with respect to   conditions and individual ratings will exist. Many people will become uninsured. Annual and lifetime limits could reappear. Lots of people will have problems getting insured. Moreover, I have yet to be convinced that a significant number of Republicans in the House might coalesce around such a plan. Maybe for Medicaid, but I’m not sure about the exchanges. Even if they could, it’s likely the Democrats in the Senate would try to filibuster either of these plans. Don’t you think? Austin: Yes, I think Democrats would filibuster anything they could. The filibuster is not set in stone. A Senate majority can change it, and some are already calling for the G. O. P. to do so. But that doesn’t appear to be what the Senate will do  —   they’ll retain the filibuster. This could play to their favor, since they can propose things they like, let the Democrats filibuster them and take the blame when repeal kicks in with no replacement. Perhaps that’s another way for Republicans to get out of their political bind. Aaron: I’m sure we’ll have more to discuss as President Trump’s administration comes into power.",0
9642,Broadway Breaks Multiple Records Through New Year’s Weekend - The New York Times,"Broadway rang out 2016 with a very big bang. The 33 plays and musicals running last week brought in a whopping $49. 7 million, making it the   week in Broadway history. It was also the   week on record, with 359, 495 people seeing Broadway shows. All around Times Square, records were toppled like pins in a bowling alley: It was the best week ever for   shows like “Chicago,” “Jersey Boys” and “The Lion King” the most money ever grossed at multiple theaters built more than a century ago (for example, $911, 000 by “Oh, Hello” at the Lyceum, which was built in 1903) the most performances ever by a single show during a   period (17, by “The Illusionists”) and the most money ever grossed by a single show ($3. 3 million, by “Hamilton”). An astonishing 24 shows grossed more than $1 million last week, including seven that grossed more than $2 million, according to figures released Tuesday by the Broadway League. Three shows topped the $3 million mark: “Hamilton,” “Wicked” and “The Lion King. ” The grosses for the week ending Jan. 1 were 63 percent higher than the previous week, and 15 percent higher than the same week the previous year (even though there were five more shows playing at the same time last year). Why? The most significant factor appears to be pricing: The base prices for many Broadway shows are high, and the premium prices charged over the holiday period were even higher.   shows had an average price over $100. And for “Hamilton,” now the industry leader in pricing, the average price was $310, and the top price was $998. (That’s the price charged by the box office the first time a ticket was sold many people paid higher prices purchasing from resellers.) There were other factors contributing to the Broadway bonanza. New York City was wrapping up a banner year for tourism: an estimated 60. 3 million visitors, up from 58. 5 million the previous year, according to Christopher Heywood, a spokesman for NYC  Company, the city’s tourism agency. The period between Christmas and New Year’s is always popular for tourists  —   and lucrative for Broadway  —   but especially so this winter, because Christmas and New Year’s fell on weekends, and many people took off work the week in between. Multiple shows that aim heavily at tourists did extraordinarily well. For example: Cirque du Soleil’s first Broadway venture, “Paramour,” had its best week yet, at $1. 9 million, and “The Phantom of the Opera,” the   Broadway show and a reliable barometer for tourist traffic, had its best week too, also at $1. 9 million. Broadway took advantage of the expected high tourism last week by staging more performances. The usual Broadway schedule sees shows staged eight times a week, but last week 25 shows had nine performances. And then there was “The Illusionists,” a holiday season magic show, which managed to have 17 performances by scheduling shows three times a day Monday through Friday, and then twice on Sunday. Other factors: Broadway is on an upswing. Grosses and attendance have been growing for several years, and the current season has already featured strong starts for three new musicals: “Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812,” “A Bronx Tale” and “Dear Evan Hansen. ” “The record just broken for both attendance and grosses for the last week reflects the continuing success of the range of theater being produced on Broadway,” said Charlotte St. Martin, the president of the Broadway League. Several shows that had announced closing dates had a surge of   patrons. “Matilda” closed on Sunday after its best week ($1. 9 million) and “Jersey Boys,” which closes on Jan. 15, set a record, too ($1. 8 million). Some plays benefited as well: “The Humans,” which won the Tony for best new play last year, grossed an impressive $815, 000 as it prepared to close on Jan. 15. Of course, the good news is not likely to last. January and February are generally soft months for Broadway. Thirteen shows are scheduled to close between Dec. 31 and Jan. 29, as theaters clear the decks for a round of openings in late winter and spring.",0
9644,Massive Spherical Space Object Disturbed NASA’s Satellite H1,"Massive Spherical Space Object Disturbed NASA’s Satellite H1 

NASA still won't talk about a giant mysterious spherical object that sometimes becomes visible in the vicinity of the Sun.

Now, it seems a massive unknown force disturbed NASA’s satellite H1 on November 17, 2016 which almost led to an equipment malfunction.


On November 16, the satellite was still functioning normally then on the 17th something disturbed the satellite but the H1 camera still managed to capture images and one day later the 18th everything returned to normal.

Images captured on the 17th show a giant spherical object which was probably the cause of the incident.

Whether the object is one of the giant extraterrestrial or interdimensional spacecraft, which are accessing our solar system, using the Sun as a stargate or an unknown celestial body like the famed planet Nibiru, it is clear what happened on the 17th was not the result of an equipment failure.

Note: Planet Nibiru – This mysterious object has been researched by Intellihub’s Shepard Ambellas for over 25 years and is likely the basis for all emergency preparations by world governments which we’ve seen transpire over the last three decades after the object was discovered during the Regan Administration by NASA’s IRAS telescope.

9645,"To Bolster KLM’s Identity, a ‘Charmingly Clueless Approach’ to Humor - The New York Times","QUICK, IS KLM a brand of milk, the call letters for a radio station or a    Dutch airline? Frequent fliers probably know the correct answer, but market research shows that many Americans often think KLM means either milk or music. So the airline, which is formally known as Royal Dutch Airlines, is embarking on an advertising campaign that is heavy on   humor to explain what the letters mean. “The brand has not been so visible, but we want people to know it’s an airline, and that it’s Dutch,” said Christophe Attard, the vice president of marketing for Air  . The carrier, whose name in Dutch is Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij, merged with Air France in 2004, but the branding for the two airlines is separate. “We wanted KLM to reflect the nationality of the country,” Mr. Attard said. “It’s friendly and innovative. ” And the humor is  . Ken Marino, an American actor who starred in the NBC sitcom “Marry Me,” wryly comments on questions such as “What is an airline?” and “What is a flight attendant?” He delivers his remarks with an exaggerated sincerity intended to provoke a smile or a chuckle from social media viewers, who are the target audience of the video. The humor makes a product or service more approachable, said John Limotte, chief executive of Mustache, a video production company based in Brooklyn that worked with KLM on the campaign. “It’s not a   or broadly comedic humor, but more of a charmingly clueless approach where stating the obvious is likable,” he said. The approach underscores KLM’s effort to solidify its American market, where it currently has eight gateways for passengers to fly directly to Amsterdam. The Dutch carrier is striving to keep its footing against competition from   rivals, as well as carriers based in the Middle East that are trying to expand their service networks. And, like other airlines, KLM must contend with the impact of terrorist attacks on its leisure travel business. KLM said   traffic is 15 percent of its   business, and it has experienced a 7 percent increase in traffic between the United States and Europe since 2014. “The United States, for decades and in the future, serves as the backbone of our worldwide operations outside of Europe,” said Pieter Elbers, KLM’s president and chief executive. “It is an incredibly important market to the company. ” Last year, KLM expanded its business between Amsterdam, Atlanta and Los Angeles, and began direct service between Salt Lake City and Amsterdam this year. In November, the carrier plans to introduce direct service between Amsterdam and Miami. The airline must first ensure that American travelers know what it is. The company commissioned a consumer awareness survey two years ago to gauge familiarity with its brand. The survey, conducted by phone and in person at airports, found that potential customers did not have a clear idea that KLM was an airline, Mr. Attard said. One reason could be that KLM and Air France partner with Delta Air Lines on   flights, so tickets show Delta’s name first. The Dutch carrier’s name was little seen in the United States for years because of a joint venture from 1997 to 2009 with Northwest Airlines, which handled sales in North America. That ended after Northwest’s merger with Delta. Currently, KLM and Air France  —   members of the SkyTeam global airline alliance  —   offer a points program called Flying Blue but market their brands individually. To distinguish KLM’s separate identity, the carrier decided to refresh its brand: It retained its blue letters on a white background and longstanding logo, a crown, but enlarged it. Mustache developed four brand identity videos with the   droll humor KLM was seeking. The creative agency drew attention to its understated humor with its   2014 travel video series on the Netherlands, called “Holland. The Original Cool. ” The first video in the series received more than a million views on YouTube. Humor in advertising is appealing “because the entertainment aspect is the hook to get people to watch,” said Michael Lewis, an associate professor of marketing at Emory University’s Goizueta Business School. “It gives legitimacy to a brand that’s less familiar,” he said. “That is more important for KLM than for carriers like Air France or British Airways, which have the country in their name. ” Mr. Lewis added: “But while differentiating brands has been a holy grail for airlines, more consumers are viewing the airline trip as a commodity product. It’s the ability to go to point A, then to point B, except, perhaps, for frequent fliers who still want to have access to upgrades and airport lounges. ” Mr. Attard, however, said market research showed a perceptional difference between KLM and Air France, which he said was viewed as snobbish and expensive. KLM wanted to underscore its innovation, which the airline had demonstrated through a partnership with Facebook that enabled booking flights via the Messenger app, he said. KLM’s new campaign will appear on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, as well as on a site, ItsAnAirline. com. It will feature interactive elements, including letting visitors earn loyalty points by finding hidden objects.",0

9647,World’s Oldest Fossils Found in Greenland - The New York Times,"Geologists have discovered in Greenland evidence for ancient life in rocks that are 3. 7 billion years old. The find, if confirmed, would make these fossils the oldest on Earth and may change scientific understanding of the origins of life. Experts are likely to debate whether the structures described in the new report were formed biologically or through natural processes. If biological, the great age of the fossils complicates the task of reconstructing the evolution of life from the chemicals naturally present on the early Earth. It leaves comparatively little time for evolution to have occurred and puts the process close to a time when Earth was being bombarded by destructive asteroids. The fossils were discovered four years ago but not publicized while the geologists, a team led by Allen P. Nutman of the University of Wollongong in Australia, checked out their find. “Of course one felt very excited, but we’re not the rushing types and we took our time,” Dr. Nutman said. “We kept it secret because we wanted to present it in the most robust way we could manage. ” The fossils were part of an outcrop of ancient rock that had lost its usual snow cover. The rock layer forming the outcrop, known to geologists as the Isua supracrustal belt, lies on the southwest coast of Greenland and is some 3. 9 to 3. 7 billion years old. Researchers earlier had claimed that Isua rocks had a chemical composition indicative of life, but critics said this mix of chemicals could have arisen through natural processes. The new fossils, described on Wednesday in the journal Nature, are the first visible structures found in the Isua rocks. They are thought to be stromatolites, layers of sediment packed together by microbial communities living in shallow water. They are some 220 million years more ancient than the oldest previously known fossils, also stromatolites. Those are 3. 48 billion years old and were discovered in the Pilbara Craton of Western Australia. The new report “provides the oldest direct evidence of microbial life,” said Gerald Joyce, an expert on the origin of life at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif. Dr. Nutman said there was a “diminishing probability” that older fossils will ever be found. Rocks from this period are very rare. Those that survive have been cooked to such high heats by geological processes like   that evidence of fossils and sedimentary layers is destroyed. Most of the Isua rocks have been cooked in this way. Only the small outcrop now discovered, measuring some 98 by 230 feet, avoided intense heating. Through this chance escape, the little patch throws a narrow shaft of light onto events close to the dawn of life on Earth. The rocks contain several small cones, the tallest just over an inch and half. The cones have a layered structure that resembles the bands of sediment gathered and cemented together by the microbial communities that form today’s stromatolites. Because of the importance of the claim made by Dr. Nutman and his colleagues, considerable discussion can be expected before their interpretation of the structures as evidence of life is generally accepted. Certain features “are fairly credible hallmarks of microbial activity,” Abigail C. Allwood of Caltech’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory wrote in a commentary accompanying the Nature article. They have a few features that make them “interesting and possibly biological,” she added in an email. Another expert in the early Earth’s environment, Tanja Bosak of M. I. T. said the structures do resemble modern stromatolites but their origin “will be hotly debated,” given there is no sign of certain features that might bolster the case for biological origin, such as crinkling in the layers of sediment. Several different species of microbes are involved in stromatolite creation. The Isua structures, if indeed stromatolites, would represent fairly evolved organisms. Dr. Nutman argues that life must therefore have originated even earlier, probably in the late Hadean stage of Earth’s history, which lasted from 4. 65 billion years ago  —   when the planet formed from debris in orbit around the sun  —   to 4 billion years ago. But the Hadean was so called because of the hellish conditions thought to have prevailed, including cataclysmic meteorite impacts that boiled the oceans into steam and turned Earth’s surface into molten lava. The largest of these impacts, at 4. 5 billion years ago, tore a piece from Earth that became the moon. It is difficult to see how life could have begun under such circumstances. But some geologists now favor a milder version of the Hadean, with the rain of asteroids quickly tapering off after the moon was formed. The early sun was much weaker then, and the threat to life, in this view, would not have been molten lava but frozen oceans, a calamity that may have been averted by a surge of greenhouse gases. “The largest Hadean impacts may have been severe, but not  . Once life had developed to the point that it could spread across the planet, it would have been hard to wipe out,” said Jack Szostak, an expert on life origins at Harvard Medical School. But the chemistry of life favors an origin on land, not the deep ocean, he said. Still, even when the Hadean ended, a final rain of large asteroids descended on Earth at the beginning of the ensuing Archaean stage, possibly set loose when the giant planets Saturn, Uranus and Neptune drifted out into the Kuiper belt of asteroids. This cataclysm, known as the Late Heavy Bombardment, hit Earth between 3. 9 and 3. 8 billion years ago. Dr. Nutman believes life could have survived through the end of the Hadean and the bombardment. Some geologists, he notes, now think the asteroid impacts were spread over time, lessening their effects. “The Late Heavy Bombardment is becoming less heavy as the years go by,” he said. But others believe the bombardment was no light peppering. Evidence of these ancient craters has vanished from Earth but is still evident in the pockmarked face of the moon. And for every crater on the moon, 20 would be expected to have been made on Earth. The moon has two craters more than 600 miles across that were created during the Late Heavy Bombardment. Some 40 craters this size may have been gouged out of our planet in the same interval, said William F. Bottke, an asteroid expert at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo. By comparison, the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago left a crater only 110 miles in diameter. If life on Earth did not begin until after the Late Heavy Bombardment, then it had a mere 100 million years in which to evolve to the quite advanced stage seen in the new fossils. If so, Dr. Allwood wrote, then “life is not a fussy, reluctant and unlikely thing. ” It will emerge whenever there’s an opportunity. But the argument that life seems to have evolved very early and quickly, so therefore is inherently likely, can be turned around, Dr. Joyce said. “You could ask why, if life were such a probable event, we don’t have evidence of multiple origins,” he said. In fact, with trivial variations, there is only one genetic code for all known forms of life, pointing to a single origin.",0
9648,"Orlando Aftermath: Red Flags, Yet Legally Able to Buy a Gun - The New York Times","The gunman in a shooting rampage at a Florida nightclub, identified as Omar Mateen, would seem, in retrospect, to have been the kind of person who should not have been able to buy a gun. His former wife described Mr. Mateen as mentally unstable and abusive. A   at the security company where he worked recalled him talking “about killing people all the time. ” And the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated him for possible ties to terrorism. Yet, just as was the case with a long line of other mass shootings, nothing prevented the Orlando gunman from legally buying the weapons he used. The explanation, as confounding as it may be for those who favor tougher gun restrictions, has its roots in a civic value that crosses the political divide: the right to due process. The pattern is, by now, numbingly familiar. Jared Loughner, who in 2011 shot Representative Gabrielle Giffords in the head and killed six others in Tucson, had exhibited alarming signs of mental illness, yet legally bought the Glock handgun used in the shooting just a few weeks earlier. A month before Aaron Alexis killed a dozen people in 2013 at the Washington Navy Yard, the police in Rhode Island visited him after he called them to complain that he was hearing voices and that people were following him and harassing him with a microwave machine. Nevertheless, shortly after, he was able to legally buy the shotgun he used in the shooting. The phenomenon occurs again and again on a more humdrum, daily basis, involving far less spectacular shootings. In 2010, in Oklahoma, Barbara Diane Dye was shot and killed by her husband in a bank parking lot. Two weeks earlier, she had filed an emergency order of protection against him, explaining that her husband had repeatedly threatened to kill her and that she feared he would turn violent when he received divorce papers. As they waited for a court hearing needed for a full protection order, Ms. Dye and her family begged the local police to take away his guns. The issue with these cases and countless others is the way federal gun prohibitions have been drawn up, seeking to balance what the Supreme Court decreed in 2008 was a constitutional right to bear arms against the potential threat to public safety. Most of the federal criteria that bar people from buying or possessing guns under federal law require some sort of legal adjudication: a felony conviction, for instance an involuntary commitment to a mental institution, a process that typically requires a judge’s decree a full protection order that includes the opportunity for a hearing. It is a relatively high bar, given the range of behaviors that might set off alarms about someone having a gun. While Mr. Mateen might have exhibited worrisome red flags, his behavior had never risen to the level that involved a   court process, or some other official proceeding, that would have blocked him. The same applies to Mr. Loughner and Mr. Alexis, as clearly mentally unstable as they both were in retrospect. In Ms. Dye’s case in Oklahoma, her husband had not yet been given the opportunity to contest the allegations against him in a court hearing on the order of protection, which could have led to his being barred him from having guns. The issue of due process, in fact, is at the heart of why gun rights advocates have resisted so strenuously a proposal to bar people on federal terrorism watch lists, or who have otherwise been suspected by the authorities of ties to terrorist groups, from buying guns. (Mr. Mateen was on a watch list from 2013 to   James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director, said, but not earlier this month when he bought the guns used in the shooting.) People on the watch lists, which can include tens of thousands of names, have no opportunity to contest their inclusion in a court of law, gun rights proponents point out. And taking away a constitutionally protected right, they argue, should carry a much greater legal bar. The measure was defeated six months ago by Republicans in Congress, but Senate Democrats, including Dianne Feinstein of California and Bill Nelson of Florida, said on Monday that they would renew their push for a vote on the legislation. “I hope every member of the House and Senate had time for quiet reflection yesterday to ask what we could have done to prevent this tragedy,” Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said on Monday. “I’m so sorry. I’m heartsick, I’m basically sick by our inaction. It’s shameful the United States Senate has done nothing  —   nothing  —   to stop these mass shootings. ” Just one Republican, Senator Mark S. Kirk of Illinois, voted in favor of the proposal in December, but Democrats said that they believed that Republicans would come under new pressure. It is a sign of where the gun debate is in this country at the moment that even the   gun bill of 2013, the most ambitious proposal for tightening federal gun laws in recent years, would have been powerless to block Mr. Mateen’s purchase of a gun. That is because the measure, proposed after the school shooting in Newtown, Conn. was focused on expanding existing federal background checks on guns to a greater array of gun transactions, particularly those made through “private sales” at gun shows or online. Only in a handful states  —   New York and California are among those that stand out  —   have lawmakers sought to tighten the legal threshold to include red flags that extend substantially beyond the federal criteria. New York passed a law in 2013 after Newtown that compelled mental health professionals to report any patient “likely to engage in conduct that would result in serious harm to self or others,” a process that could lead to the person being prohibited from buying and possessing firearms. But, by late 2014, the list had swelled to some 34, 500 names, raising concerns even among some mental health professionals that some in the database were not truly dangerous. California, for its part, introduced this year something lawmakers called a “gun violence restraining order,” in which family members or law enforcement officials can petition a judge on an emergency basis to order people to surrender their firearms, pending a full hearing, because the individuals pose a danger to themselves or others. The weapons could then later be returned, if a person successfully contests the removal in court. Gun control proponents, seeking to expand the restraining orders to other states, hope the hearing process for the orders give them a convincing way to counter the due process arguments from opponents. An alliance of gun control supporters are now trying to secure enough signatures to get a similar firearm restraining order on the ballot in November in Washington State. Ultimately, it is a question that promises to resurface, given the protracted nature of the gun debate in the United States: Where should the line be drawn?",0
9649,Сможет ли Трамп положить конец потоку нелегального оружия в Сирию? | Новое восточное обозрение,"Регион: США в мире Как отмечает в своей новой статье ветеран боевых действий США Гордон Даф, остается до сих пор неясно, как Трамп собирается навести порядок с непрекращающимся потоком американского высокоточного оружия в Сирию, когда он находится в прекрасных отношениях с Тель-Авивом, который поддерживает террористическую группировку ДАИШ. Точно также у автора не получается понять, как Трамп собирается «дружить» с Россией, когда он окружил себя ярыми русофобами. Особые надежды автор в этом вопросе возлагает на генерал-лейтенанта Майкла Флинна, который стал советником по национальной безопасности в будущей администрации. Автор отмечает, что, несмотря на ожесточенную критику этого назначения со стороны ряда обозревателей, Флинн не только прекрасно осведомлен о «всех проделках» таких государств, как Саудовская Аравия, Турция и Катар в сирийском конфликте, но он также хорошо понимает, какую роль играет Москва в попытке прекратить вооруженную агрессию против сирийского государства и во многом разделяет её позиции. Тем не менее старая поговорка гласит: «Нельзя приготовить омлет, не разбив яиц». А потому для возвращения статуса-кво на Ближнем Востоке, Трамп будет вынужден рассмотреть возможность уголовного преследования семейства Бушей, равно как и внимательно изучить деятельность своего однопартийца — сенатора Джона Маккейна по продаже сирийской и иракской ворованной нефти. Хватит ли у него на это смелости — покажет только время. С полной версией статьи вы можете ознакомиться здесь . Популярные статьи ",0
9650,Obama in Harvard Law Review: Prayer Won’t Do It We Need Gun Control,"Nearly nine years after mocking “bitter” Americans who “cling to guns or religion,” President Obama used a column in the Harvard Law Review to assert that prayer in America is insufficient America needs gun control. [Politico reports it was April 5, 2008, when Obama spoke to Democrat Party donors in San Francisco, saying:  You go into these small towns in Pennsylvania and, like a lot of small towns in the Midwest, the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothing’s replaced them. And they fell through the Clinton administration, and the Bush administration, and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate and they have not. And it’s not surprising then they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren’t like them or   sentiment or   sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations. On January 5, 2017, he wrote in the Harvard Law Review: But as I’ve said many times: “[O]ur thoughts and prayers are not enough. ” They alone won’t “capture the heartache and grief and anger we should feel,” and they do “nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America. ” We have a responsibility to act. Obama went on to make clear that his emphasis on acting —  on doing something —  was an emphasis on passing more gun control: Congress should pass the kinds of commonsense reforms supported by most of the American people —  from investing in access to mental health care, to expanding background checks, to making it possible to keep guns out of the hands of suspected terrorists. The actions we take won’t prevent every act of violence —  but if even one life is spared, they will have been well worth it. He did not mention that the United States already has background checks, and such checks have proven to be mass attackers’ method of choice for acquiring firearms. Nor did he mention that all the hype about using   lists to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists is just that: hype. After all, the San Bernardino attackers, the Orlando Pulse attacker, and the recent Ft. Lauderdale airport attacker were not on any such list. Obama and Democrats’ methods, therefore, are not measures that will stop crime or make Americans safer.

9651,U.S.-Led Coalition Counts 229 Civilian Deaths Before Mosul Strike - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Facing mounting pressure over civilian casualties in American airstrikes, the United   coalition fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria said on Saturday that it was likely that at least 229 civilians had been unintentionally killed by its operations since they began in August 2014. In February, the last month covered by the report and the first full month of the Trump administration, four such civilians were killed, the coalition said. The assessment, issued monthly, therefore does not include the March 17 strike against a building in Mosul in which scores if not hundreds of civilians were killed, according to Iraqi witnesses. That strike is under investigation. The coalition’s overall count is far less than estimates by some human rights groups. Airwars, a nongovernment organization that monitors reports of civilian casualties in international airstrikes, has asserted that at least 2, 831 civilians are likely to have been killed as of March 28 by the coalition’s air attacks since August 2014. The worries about civilian casualties have grown as Iraqi forces push to take western Mosul from the Islamic State with the help of American and allied air power, rockets and artillery. President Trump has vowed to step up the fight against the militants, though the basic strategy in Mosul was set by American commanders during the Obama administration. “We take the issue of civilian casualties seriously, every day, not just when it makes news,” said Col. John J. Thomas, the spokesman for the United States Central Command, which oversees American military operations in the Middle East. Colonel Thomas added that the command, in an effort to be “fully transparent,” was sharing information on unresolved cases and was even describing episodes that military personnel had reported up the chain of command but had not received public attention. Chris Woods, the director of Airwars, asserted that while the Central Command had been working to improve its casualty counts, it was still lagging behind. “Certainly, both Centcom and the coalition have put a lot of effort into improving their casualty monitoring process, and we have been in extensive dialogue with them,” Mr. Woods said in a telephone interview from London. “But despite these improved resources, both Centcom and the coalition appear unable to keep up with the number of allegations,” Mr. Woods added. “Given the intensity of operations in Mosul and around Raqqa, that gap continues to grow. ” Raqqa, in Syria, is the Islamic State’s   capital. In western Mosul, hundreds of thousands of civilians are trapped, and airstrikes are an essential part of the operation. The Iraqi military has suffered enormous casualties  —   284 Iraqi troops were killed in the first 37 days of the offensive to take western Mosul  —   and it depends on American firepower to advance. American military officials also allege that Islamic State fighters have herded Iraqi residents into buildings, calculating that escalating civilian casualties would prompt American commanders to slow the pace of airstrikes. But critics say that the firepower that is being applied is so extensive that civilians are being put in danger. During a recent week in Mosul, the United   coalition carried out attacks with 700 bombs and rockets and 400 more strikes with   Himars missiles, according to military officials. With the United States unwilling to play a major ground combat role in Iraq and Syria, air power has become increasingly important. Between August 2014 and February 2017, the   coalition carried out 18, 645 strikes. According to data made public on Saturday by the   command that is directing the campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, there were 37 reports of possible civilian casualties related to the operation to evict the Islamic State from the eastern half of Mosul, which began in  . But 12 of these were deemed upon investigation to be “noncredible,” sometimes because no coalition strikes had been carried out in the area. In five cases, the command found that the reports of civilian casualties were “credible. ” In a Feb. 16 strike on a site that the military said was being used to make or hide an Islamic State car bomb, two civilians were killed when they entered the target area after the munition was released.   cases of possible civilian casualties are still being assessed, including an April 2015 strike near Mosul. That case was reopened after new information was received. In the March 17 strike in Mosul, which led to the building collapse, American officials have acknowledged that the United States had a role, but said that the munition used should not have been powerful enough to bring down a building. They are examining whether the American strike might have set off a larger blast from explosives set by militants.",0
9652,Syria’s Paradox: Why the War Only Ever Seems to Get Worse - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   There is a basic fact about Syria’s civil war that never seems to change: It frustrates any attempt at resolution. Despite many offensives, peace conferences and foreign interventions, including this week’s Turkish incursion into a border town, the only needle that ever seems to move is the one measuring the suffering of Syrians  —   which only worsens. Academic research on civil wars, taken together, reveals why. The average such conflict now lasts about a decade, twice as long as Syria’s so far. But there are a handful of factors that can make them longer, more violent and harder to stop. Virtually all are present in Syria. Many stem from foreign interventions that were intended to end the war but have instead entrenched it in a stalemate in which violence is   and the normal avenues for peace are all closed. The fact that the underlying battle is multiparty rather than   also works against resolution. When asked what other conflicts through history had similar dynamics, Barbara F. Walter, a University of California, San Diego, professor and a leading expert on civil wars, paused, considered a few possibilities, then gave up. There were none. “This is a really, really tough case,” she said. Most civil wars end when one side loses. Either it is defeated militarily, or it exhausts its weapons or loses popular support and has to give up. About a quarter of civil wars end in a peace deal, often because both sides are exhausted. That might have happened in Syria: The core combatants  —   the government and the insurgents who began fighting it in 2011  —   are quite weak and, on their own, cannot sustain the fight for long. But they are not on their own. Each side is backed by foreign powers  —   including the United States, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and now Turkey  —   whose interventions have suspended the usual laws of nature. Forces that would normally slow the conflict’s inertia are absent, allowing it to continue far longer than it otherwise would. Government and rebel forces are supplied from abroad, which means their arms never run out. They also both draw political support from foreign governments who do not feel the war’s costs firsthand, rather than from locals who might otherwise push for peace to end their pain. These material and human costs are easy for the far richer foreign powers to bear. This is why, according to James D. Fearon, a Stanford professor who studies civil wars, multiple studies have found that “if you have outside intervention on both sides, duration is significantly greater. ” The ground battles also include Kurdish militias, who have some foreign backing, and the Islamic State, which does not. But   and opposition forces are focused on one another, making them and their sponsors the war’s central dynamic. Foreign sponsors do not just remove mechanisms for peace. They introduce   mechanisms for an   stalemate. Whenever one side loses ground, its foreign backers increase their involvement, sending supplies or air support to prevent their favored player’s defeat. Then that side begins winning, which tends to prompt the other’s foreign backers to up their ante as well. Each escalation is a bit stronger than what came before, accelerating the killing without ever changing the war’s fundamental balance. This has been Syria’s story almost since the beginning. In late 2012, as Syria’s military suffered defeats, Iran intervened on its behalf. By early 2013, government forces rebounded, so wealthy Gulf states flooded support to the rebels. Several rounds later, the United States and Russia have joined the fray. These foreign powers are strong enough to match virtually any escalation. None can force an outright victory because the other side can always counter, so the cycle only continues. Even natural fluctuations in the battle lines can trigger another round. Over the last year, for example, the United States has supported Syrian Kurds against the Islamic State. As the Kurds grew strong, this alarmed Turkey, which is fighting its own Kurdish insurgency. This week, Turkey intervened to seize the Syrian town of Jarabulus, backed by the United States, in part to prevent Kurds from taking it first. (The United States backed this effort, too, in case the alliances weren’t complicated enough already.) “We tend to think this is as bad as it can get,” Professor Walter said. “Well, no, it could get a lot worse. ” Syria has seen repeated indiscriminate mass killings of civilians, on all sides. This is not driven just by malice, but by something more powerful: structural incentives. In most civil wars, the fighting forces depend on popular support to succeed. This “human terrain,” as counterinsurgency experts call it, provides all sides with an incentive to protect civilians and minimize atrocities, and has often proved decisive. Wars like Syria’s, in which the government and opposition rely heavily on foreign support, encourage the precise opposite behavior, according to research by the political scientists Reed M. Wood of Arizona State University, Jacob D. Kathman of the State University of New York at Buffalo, and Stephen E. Gent of the University of North Carolina. Because Syria’s combatants rely on foreign sponsors, rather than the local population, they have little incentive to protect civilians. In fact, this dynamic turns the local population into a potential threat rather than a necessary resource. The incentives push them to “utilize collective violence and terror to shape the behaviors of the population,” the researchers found. The images we see of dead mothers and children may represent not helpless bystanders but deliberate targets, killed not out of madness or cruelty but out of coldly rational calculation. Severe, indiscriminate attacks on civilians bring little   risks and substantial benefits: disrupting the enemy’s control or local support, pacifying potential threats, plundering resources and others.   forces have conducted by far the most attacks against civilians, but opposition fighters have led some as well. Among the insurgents, individual groups that refuse to attack civilians end up at a disadvantage compared with the groups that will. Stalemate is also driven by uncertainty. No one is sure what a postwar Syria would look like or how to get there, but everyone can imagine a worse situation. This creates a status quo bias, in which combatants are more worried about preserving what they have than risking it to pursue their broader goals. As Professor Fearon of Stanford put it, “It’s more important to stop the other side from winning than it is to win yourself. ” Each foreign power understands it cannot win, but earnestly fears that a victory by the other side would be unbearable. Saudi Arabia and Iran, for example, see Syria as a battleground in their regional power struggle, the loss of which they believe could endanger their own regimes. Even if Syria’s war hurts everyone in the long term, guaranteeing more extremism and instability,   fears of defeat pull everyone toward maintaining a perpetual, unwinnable draw. This is exacerbated by the   dynamics of loose coalitions. Each side consists of several actors with wildly different agendas and priorities. Often, all they can agree on is that they wish to avoid defeat. It is strategy by least common denominator. There is reason to believe that Russia, for example, would like President Bashar   of Syria to step down, or at least make some concessions for peace. But Russia can’t force him to act, nor can it simply quit Syria without abandoning its interests there. Mr. Assad, meanwhile, might want a fuller Russian intervention that brings him victory, something Moscow is unwilling to provide. The result: Mr. Assad stays in place, and Russia intervenes only enough to keep him there for now. The Syrian government and the insurgents fighting it are internally weak in ways that lead them to prefer a stalemate, no matter how terrible, over almost any viable outcome. Syria’s top leaders belong mostly to the Alawite religious minority, which makes up a small share of the country’s population but a disproportionate share of security forces. After years of war along demographic lines, Alawites fear they could face genocide if Mr. Assad does not secure a total victory. But such a victory appears extremely unlikely, in part because the Alawites’ minority status gives them too little support to restore order with anything but violence. So Syria’s leaders believe that stalemate is the best way to preserve Alawite safety today, even if that increases risks for their   future. Syria’s opposition is weak in a different way. It is fractured among many groups, another factor that tends to prolong civil wars and make them less likely to end peacefully. A study of every United Nations peacemaking effort since 1945 found that it succeeded in resolving   of   civil wars, but only   of multisided ones. Syria’s battlefield is a complex polygon, with an array of Syrian rebel groups that include moderates and Islamists affiliates of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State Syrian forces and outsiders like the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah and foreign fighters who join in the name of jihad. Each of these factions has its own aims, which narrow the terms of any possible peace deal. Each also has an incentive to compete with other groups for resources during the war, and for concessions afterward. This is why multisided oppositions tend to fail. Even if they overthrow the government, they often end up in a second war among themselves. The only certain way to break the logjam is for one side to surge beyond what the other can match. Because Syria has sucked in two of the world’s leading military powers, Russia and the United States, that bar could most likely be cleared only by a   invasion. In the best case, this would require something akin to the yearslong American occupations of Iraq or Afghanistan. In the worst, invading a war zone where so many foreign adversaries are active could ignite a major regional war. Another way that such wars can end is that one foreign backer changes its foreign policy and decides to withdraw. This allows the other side to win quickly. But in Syria, because each side is backed by multiple foreign powers, every sponsor on one side would have to drop its support at the same time. Peace deals often succeed or fail on the question of who will control military and security forces. In Syria, this may be a question without an answer. It’s an issue not of greed, but of trust. After a war as brutal as Syria’s, in which more than 400, 000 people have been killed so far, the combatants reasonably fear they will be massacred if the other secures too much power. But a deal that would give the parties equal military power creates a high risk of relapse into war. So does allowing rebels to keep their arms and independence  —   a lesson the world learned in Libya. At the same time, there has to be some sort of armed force to restore security and clean up any remaining warlords or militias. Often, the solution has been for an outside country or organization, such as the United Nations, to send peacekeepers. These forces keep everyone in check during the country’s transition to peace and provide basic security in a way that won’t spur either side to rearm. But what country would volunteer its citizens to indefinitely occupy Syria, particularly with the cautionary tale of America’s experience in Iraq? Any foreign force would make itself a target for jihadist terrorists, and most likely face a yearslong insurgency that could cost it hundreds or thousands of lives. Professor Fearon, listing the ways that Syria’s war cannot end, said that in the best case, one side would slowly grind out a   victory that would merely downgrade the war into “a somewhat   insurgency, terrorist attacks and so on. ” The worst case is significantly worse. According to a 2015 paper by Professor Walter and Kenneth M. Pollack, a Middle East expert, “Outright military victory in a civil war often comes at the price of horrific (even genocidal) levels of violence against the defeated, including their civilian populations. ” This could bring entirely new conflicts to the Middle East, they found: “Victorious groups in a civil war sometimes also try to employ their newfound strength against neighboring states, resulting in interstate wars. ” This is not a drift that anyone wants, but it is the direction that Syria’s many domestic and foreign participants are pulling the country, whose darkest days may still be ahead.",0
9653,Ethics Questions Dogged Agriculture Nominee as Georgia Governor - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   In Sonny Perdue’s telling, Georgians were growing weary of the corruption and scandals in their state when he took over as governor in 2003  —   a time when he gave his own version of a “drain the swamp” pledge. “My first goal as governor is to restore public trust in state government by changing the culture of state government,” Mr. Perdue told a leadership conference at Kennesaw State University in April 2003. “Our form of government depends on a mutual bond of trust between the people and their government. But people have become cynical about their government. ” But Mr. Perdue, a Republican who is awaiting confirmation to serve as President Trump’s agriculture secretary, became a target of frequent criticism that he was failing to honor his own ethics pledge during his eight years as governor. The criticism centers on the fact that, as Mr. Trump has, he continued to own or help run his family business ventures  —   four   companies  —   while serving as governor. Mr. Perdue is one of the last cabinet members awaiting Senate confirmation. No date has been set for his confirmation hearing a holdup in the release of paperwork accompanying his nomination by the federal Office of Government Ethics has been blamed for the delay. The office must examine Mr. Perdue’s proposal to avoid conflicts of interest while running the U. S. D. A. as the department is known, which may include selling off some of his farming assets. Before his tenure as governor ended in 2011, 13 complaints had been filed against Mr. Perdue with the State Ethics Commission, which on two occasions ruled that the governor had violated state ethics laws. The commission took the unusual step of fining Mr. Perdue while he was governor. There were numerous other questions, including some about the role of Mr. Perdue’s personal lawyer  —   also a state legislator  —   in pushing a bill through the legislature that included a special provision that gave Mr. Perdue $100, 000 in state tax relief. And, when his tenure as governor was coming to a close, Mr. Perdue met with Georgia officials who oversee the state’s ports to discuss use of a terminal for a family business, according to documents obtained by The Atlanta  . Soon after he left office, in fact, he opened a new company that specialized in exporting products through Savannah. “When you are a public official you are supposed to be acting entirely on behalf of the public and not for ” said Yasha Heidari, former senior legal counsel to the State Ethics Commission. “Looking at his record, as both an attorney and a citizen of the state, I had serious concerns. ” In a written statement, a spokeswoman for Mr. Perdue rejected that assessment, saying that the frequent criticism he faced while governor was largely politically motivated. “There hadn’t been a Republican governor in Georgia for 135 years,” the statement said. “Governor Perdue was the David who slew the Democrats’ Goliath. ” During the wait for Mr. Perdue’s confirmation hearing, some in the farming industry have come to his defense. “I don’t think you are going to find a man any more honorable than Sonny Perdue,” said Zippy Duvall, a Georgia cattle and poultry farmer who is the president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, adding that he had known Mr. Perdue for about a decade. “He is as ethical as they come. ” Born into a family of farmers, Mr. Perdue played college football as a   at the University of Georgia, and later worked briefly as a practicing veterinarian. He rose through the ranks of the state legislature and, in the late 1990s, switched his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican because, he said, the state party had lost its focus on family values. One of Mr. Perdue’s first acts after he was sworn in as governor in January 2003 was to sign an executive order establishing a new code of ethics for executive branch employees. The order, which applied to the governor himself, prohibited state employees from using their powers for “any financial or other personal benefit” and barred them from taking any gifts worth more than $25. “In carrying out their official duties and obligations, all officers and employees of state government must work solely for the public good, striving vigilantly to avoid even the appearance that their actions are motivated by private or personal interest,” the 2003 executive order said. But Mr. Perdue ended up collecting at least $25, 000 worth of benefits or gifts during his years as governor, state records show. The gifts ranged from tickets to a Nascar race and football games to flights paid for by Altria, the tobacco company, and by CSX, the railroad giant, according to a 2010 report by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal nonprofit group. Mr. Perdue’s spokeswoman, in the written statement, said that none of these gifts violated the ban because the “trips were for official state business and were perfectly acceptable as saving taxpayer funds. ” “The gifts were to the state,” the statement read, “not to the governor. ” The fine by the State Ethics Commission in 2005 came after the commission concluded that Mr. Perdue had failed to properly report the use of an airplane owned by one of his family’s businesses for a   trip. The commission also found that he had taken campaign contributions in amounts that exceeded state limits from several donors  —   including a political action committee run by SunTrust, the   bank. Mr. Perdue called the violations technical, and the investigation politically motivated. Teddy Lee, the executive secretary of the State Ethics Commission, was fired from his job in January 2006, and in an interview he blamed Mr. Perdue for his firing. Mr. Lee had served in the job under four governors. “This looked like a political hit to me,” Mr. Lee said. Mr. Lee’s dismissal came as Mr. Perdue was seeking   and just months before his largest scandal emerged, over a $100, 000 state tax break he received thanks to a legislative maneuver engineered by a lawmaker who was also his personal lawyer. The focus of the controversy was a piece of property in Florida that Mr. Perdue purchased in 2004. The purchase allowed him to defer paying federal capital gains taxes on a separate piece of Georgia land  —   which he had previously sold at a profit. When that transaction was completed, Mr. Perdue still owed Georgia about $100, 000 in state taxes. Then, Mr. Perdue signed a bill the following year eliminating that state tax obligation  —   as state law was changed to allow   rollover relief on capital gains, even if the new property being purchased was out of state. During deliberations on the legislation, Larry O’Neal, a member of the Georgia House of Representatives who also worked part time as a personal lawyer for Mr. Perdue, intervened to make the change in that provision retroactive. That meant it would cover Mr. Perdue’s 2004 land deal, saving the governor $100, 000, The   reported at the time. Mr. Perdue’s spokeswoman said the change in state law was not intended to benefit Mr. Perdue. “It benefited all Georgians,” the statement said. Scott Faber of the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit organization that keeps a close watch on policies at the Agriculture Department, said he had questions about Mr. Perdue’s fitness to take over the department. “Given his record of   and conflicts of interest as governor of Georgia, it is fair to ask if he is fit to run a $    federal agency,” Mr. Faber said. But Mr. Duvall, of the American Farm Bureau Federation, believes the opposite. Mr. Duvall said that as a former farmer, Mr. Perdue is just what the nation needs to run the department. “He has worked on a farm and owned businesses that buy and sell grain domestically and internationally,” Mr. Duvall said. “It ought to be a requirement that someone who runs the U. S. D. A. knows something about farming. And Sonny certainly does. ”",0
9654,Mexican Cops Arrest Gunman Tied to Beer Delivery Murders,"MONTERREY, Nuevo León  —   Authorities in this state have arrested one of the men allegedly responsible for having robbed, kidnapped and murdered two beer delivery men earlier this month. [As Breitbart reported, since early February, families from Nuevo Leon have been reporting robberies at gunpoint by highway men. The robberies and kidnappings have taken place along the   highway and near the international bridges in Reynosa. The crimes have also been reported near the city of San Fernando, Tamaulipas, along the roads that connect Ciudad Victoria with the Texas border.   Recently,    Jose Alberto Torres Gomez and    Romel Guadalupe Cano Hernandez, both beer delivery men with the Cuauhtemoc Moctezuma beer company, had left the warehouse in San Fernando, Tamaulipas. The two employees were making their regular beer deliveries when they were kidnapped.  Three days later, authorities in Nuevo León received a phone call about two bodies dumped near the 30 kilometer marker along the highway that connects China, Nuevo Leon, with Mendez near the Tamaulipas border. The men’s clothing, along with their physical appearance, helped Nuevo León’s ministerial police connect the bodies with the kidnapping report. Relatives of the victims took to social media for information about the fate of their loved ones.  A law enforcement official with the Nuevo León Attorney General’s Office revealed to Breitbart Texas that the beer delivery truck had a GPS tracker which helped authorities locate the vehicle in the town of General Bravo.  Based on the investigations of the case, authorities in this state were able to arrest    Ricardo Gonzalez Flores near General Bravo. Gonzalez remains in police custody on two homicide counts and one count of robbery. Authorities revealed that they are working on arresting a second gunman tied to the case.  Gonzalez is also under investigation for his role in the theft of fuel in the region. Such acts have long been used by Mexican cartels to supplement income.

9655,WaPo’s Ruth Marcus: Trump ’Doesn’t Understand the Role of America’ - Breitbart,"Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus said President Donald Trump did not have an “understanding” of the role of courts” and added that he didn’t “understand the role of America. ”  Marcus said, “I think there there is a lot of fallout here. Mike talked about how you can’t run the government by improv, and Vice President Pence talked about Washington niceties. These aren’t just Washington niceties, they are questions about whether you can run this government. And there is lasting damage here in his relationships with congress, in his relationship with the country, which saw these terrible stories of people needing medical treatment being denied, in the relationship with his court, in his relationship with the world. ” “And a more fundamentally, the lesson of the week to me is that we have a president who fundamentally is not understanding the role of courts, this tweet about   judges was not just, you know, something that we should ignore, and he doesn’t understand the role of America as it has historically been in the world as a beacon of hope and welcoming place for refugees,” she added.

9656,Scientists Say Signals From Space are Probably Aliens,"Scientists Say Signals From Space are Probably Aliens 
Andrew Anglin Daily Stormer October 29, 2016 Some of these aliens live to serve and don’t act like the Blacks at all. 
Aliens! 
New York Post : 
A team of astronomers believes that strange signals emanating from a cluster of stars are actually aliens trying to tell the universe they exist. 
The study, which appeared in the Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific , analyzed the odd beams of light from 234 stars â a fraction of the 2.5 million that were observed. 
The bizarre beaconsÂ led the paperâs authors, Ermanno F. Borra and Eric Trottier from Laval University in Quebec, to conclude that itâs âprobablyâ aliens. 
âWe find that the detected signals have exactly the shape of an [extraterrestrial intelligence] signal predicted in the previous publication and are therefore in agreement with this hypothesis,â wrote Borra and Trottier. 
They also note that their findings align with the Extraterrestrial Intelligence (ETI) hypothesis, since the mysterious activity only occurred in a tiny fraction of stars. The hypothesis also suggests that an intelligent life force would use a more sophisticated optical beacon than, say, radio waves to reveal its existence. 
Researchers sifted through data collected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey â an 8-foot-diameter telescope in Sunspot, New Mexico â to separate natural signals from ones that appeared generated. 
But there are more skeptics than not , including the authors themselves, who acknowledgeÂ the hypothesis still needs work. For starters, the data need to be verified by at least two other telescopes and all natural causes need to be ruled out. 
âAlthough unlikely,â the study notes âthere is also a possibility that the signals are due to highly peculiar chemical compositions in a small fraction of galactic halo stars.â 
The chief of NASA, Charles Bolden, has released a statement on the potential aliens, saying: “If dey aliems wanga pop-off, we ready to pop-off. Dem muffugguhs ain’t no shit. We her in da earf, we strait muffuggen rawl-oot. Da fug dem aliems fink dey is? Muffugguh all fugg u ass up, nigga, shit bitch. We killen erebuddy out here, we dont giv a fuq.” NASA head Charles Bolden responded to the potentiality of aliens with what appear to be violent threats. 
Barack Obama backed-up Bolden’s statements, saying “He be a stone-cone nigga, dat Bolden. Ah aint fux wif dat nigga. Ifn dem aliems gon fux wif dat nigga, it be like w . Nigga bitch out this muffuggeh, shii t.”",0

[James Lowell Pennington, 57, who does not have a license to practice medicine in Colorado, was arrested Thursday and charged with felony reckless aggravated assault causing serious bodily injury, the Denver Post reported.  Police called Pennington in for an interview, which he agreed to after the victim was taken to a hospital for excessive bleeding. Pennington told investigators that he willingly performed the procedure at the victim’s apartment in Denver, KUSA reported. Detectives said he used an Army surgical kit that contained a scalpel, lidocaine, medical dressing, and other medical equipment. According to a record of the interview, the suspect “used the scalpel and surgically disconnected and removed the victim’s two testicles and then sutured the opening back up. ” The victim’s wife was with the victim throughout the   procedure. Pennington allegedly told them to call 911 if any problems occurred after the procedure. The victim’s wife told police she called 911 after a large amount of blood poured out from the wound when she was changing his dressing. Paramedics called the police. Doctors could not reattach the testicles because of the time that passed between the procedure and the 911 call. The victim suffered serious injuries that run the risk of “permanent disfigurement,” according to the affidavit. Police say Pennington is a licensed pilot, not a medical professional in Colorado.",0
9660,"Yes, 'Jihad' Means Warfare Against Unbelievers","Go to Article 
Nothing ought to be plainer, and yet nothing is more obscured, than the meaning of the Islamic concept of jihad. Even if its meaning were at all unclear, every day Islamic jihadists do their best to remind us of what it is. The confusion arises, of course, from the fact that jihad and related concepts are the object of a massive misinformation and disinformation campaign, making books such as William Kilpatrick’s The Politically Incorrect Guide to Jihad so vitally necessary. 
Kilpatrick covers that propaganda campaign ably in this lucid and genial book, which not only explains from Islamic texts and teachings why ISIS and Boko Haram (and other jihad terror groups) are not only not un-Islamic, as is frequently claimed, but quintessentially Islamic – for the Qur’an, as Kilpatrick explains, commands jihad, and Muhammad, who is considered in Islamic theology to the perfect man, to be imitated by Muslims whenever, wherever, and however possible, not only commanded jihad warfare but waged it himself. 
Kilpatrick also helpfully takes up common objections to this line of argumentation – notably the question of why, if Islam really teaches warfare against unbelievers and their subjugation under the hegemony of Islamic law, most Muslims are peaceful. “Peaceful Islam,” Kilpatrick points out, “which Western leaders are counting on to win out over the more violent versions touted by the terrorists, is a holdover from the long-dead colonial era.” Indeed so: the formulation of jihad as primarily an interior spiritual struggle was touted by Islamic scholars at the height of the colonial period, so as to allow for accommodation of the colonial occupiers, who weren’t going away in the foreseeable future. Once they did abscond, however, the conditions that called forth such accommodative teachings no longer existed, and Saudi-funded jihad preachers traversed the globe calling Muslims back to jihad, “the forgotten obligation” of warfare against unbelievers. 
The Politically Incorrect Guide to Jihad shows that this transition had nothing to do with poverty among Muslims or discrimination against them, and indeed, that no conciliation or concession on the part of Western non-Muslims will ever blunt the force of the jihad imperative, since it is rooted in Islamic theological principles that are not susceptible to the prevailing political winds. 
The most valuable sections, however, of this useful and engaging book are the second, “Jihad Without Bombs,” and the third, “Defeating Jihad.” For even as violent jihad becomes an increasingly common feature of the Western landscape, more insidious and damaging in the long run may be the stealth jihad that proceeds due to the appeasement policies that Western governments indefatigably pursue, and the politically correct straitjacket on the public discourse that has for well over a decade now hindered, and usually prevented outright, honest discussion in the mainstream media of the nature and magnitude of this threat. Kilpatrick points out that “according to Reporters Without Borders, the U.S. has dropped to forty-sixth place in press freedom.” One of the principal ways in which the press today reveals itself to be a mouthpiece of moneyed elites is in its deliberate attempts to obfuscate the ideological roots of the jihad threat, and its ongoing campaign, every time there is a jihad attack, to inundate us with articles explaining that Islam is really quite wonderful and has nothing to do with this violence, nothing at all. 
But Kilpatrick details how the media and governing elites are not in the least singular in appearing determined to foster complacency and ignorance among the people they should be enlightening and protecting. The churches are in on the act as well: “Christians,” writes Kilpatrick, “have been lulled into complacency by the oft-repeated emphasis on the similarities between their faith and the faith of Muslims” – an emphasis all too many Church leaders, including, of course, Pope Francis, relentlessly hammer home, heedless of the danger in which they are putting their flock by leaving them intellectually, spiritually, and physically defenseless in the face of an advancing and growing threat. 
That’s why the most apposite sentence in this entire book is the second sentence of the chapter headed “Strategies for Victory”: “First we’ve got to get serious.” The West suffers from a collective lack of seriousness that could, in the end, be fatal. The frivolity is at the top, fueled by globalist internationalists who are using the complacency the media, the government and the Church are fostering for their own ends. The Politically Incorrect Guide to Jihad is the perfect book for those who don’t know just how bad things are, and how likely they are to get even worse – as well as for all who wish to chart a way out of this madness. It can be done. William Kilpatrick does it, quite well, in this book.  ",0
9661,"EXCLUSIVE: Cartel Smugglers, Migrants Growing More Violent Against Border Patrol Agents","TUCSON, Arizona  —   Sinaloa   smugglers and migrants are growing more violent against U. S. Border Patrol agents in the Tucson sector as penalties for their crimes stiffen. Realizing that being caught now means almost certain prosecution and incarceration, the smugglers and migrants are increasingly becoming violent with Border Patrol agents in remote border regions in efforts to escape and evade justice. [Border Patrol Agent Art Del Cueto, speaking to Breitbart Texas in his role as National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) spokesman, stated, “The smugglers are definitely becoming more violent with our agents. They now try to evade arrest and even use force to get away from us where during the Obama years they would joke with us and not mind being caught. They knew, back then, that they would get away with violating our laws. ”  Agent Del Cueto continued, “We are talking about significant force and violence being used against our agents. Very recently, one smuggler slammed a large rock into the side of an agent’s head. ” The growing violent tendencies are not limited to the cartel’s drug smugglers, according to Agent Del Cueto. “Even the illegal aliens who aren’t smuggling dope are growing more violent as they now face consequences for illegally entering. Before they would be let go the next day or so, now they face incarceration for illegally entering. They are willing to do anything possible to evade us. ” With the increased aggression levels on the part of the foreign nationals, the agents are forced to be on a higher alert level and willing to use higher level of force to defend their lives. Agent Del Cueto stated, “It’s a concern because when we use force we are put under a microscope and everything we do is scrutinized by different investigative bodies. There was a culture of destroying the lives of Border Patrol agents during the past presidential administration and unfortunately, that culture hasn’t yet completely dissipated. ” Though the Sinaloa Cartel or Federation controls the U. S.  border in this sector, the cartel is actually a collective of numerous regional criminal groups that simply operate under the banner of “Sinaloa Cartel. ” The Tucson sector is largely controlled by two of such regional groups, Los Memos and Los Salazar. The groups are engaged in frequent clashes with each other and Los Salazar has begun using armed scouts to enter U. S. territory, according to sources in Border Patrol who asked to remain anonymous. One source told Breitbart Texas, “We have them on video with   but we haven’t caught them. They most likely wouldn’t use them on random U. S. citizens, but have them for rip crews and to prevent Los Memos or U. S. gangs from stealing their drug loads.

9662,"Justices Lean Toward Bob McDonnell, Ex-Virginia Governor, in Corruption Case - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   The Supreme Court on Wednesday seemed ready to side with Bob McDonnell, the former governor of Virginia who was convicted of public corruption and faces two years in prison. Justices across the ideological spectrum said the laws under which he had been convicted gave prosecutors too much power to say that routine political favors amounted to corruption. “It puts at risk behavior that is common,” said Justice Stephen G. Breyer. “That is a recipe for giving the Justice Department and prosecutors enormous power over elected officials. ” Mr. McDonnell, a Republican, was prosecuted on charges that he had used his office to help a businessman, Jonnie R. Williams Sr. who had showered the governor and his wife with luxury products, loans and vacations worth more than $175, 000. The gifts themselves were legal, and the question in the case was whether they were part of a corrupt bargain in which Mr. McDonnell reciprocated by using the power of his office to help Mr. Williams. Mr. McDonnell, who attended the argument on Wednesday, arranged meetings for and attended events with his benefactor. But Mr. Williams, whose company made a diet supplement, did not have any real success in obtaining support for his product from the state. A jury found that Mr. McDonnell’s actions amounted to corruption, and a federal appeals court upheld the conviction. Noel J. Francisco, a lawyer for Mr. McDonnell, said his client should not have been convicted, as he did not “make a government decision or urge someone else to do so. ” The corruption laws, he added, were “not meant to be comprehensive codes of ethical conduct. ” Michael R. Dreeben, a lawyer for the federal government, said such a narrow definition was “a recipe for corruption” that would “send a terrible message to citizens. ” Justice Breyer responded that “I’m not in the business of sending messages in a case like this,” adding, “I’m in the business of trying to figure out the structure of the government. ” Justice Anthony M. Kennedy also sounded frustrated, saying that “the government has given us no workable standard” to distinguish political favors from criminal acts. Mr. Dreeben took a hard line, saying that a vacation or an expensive lunch traded for arranging a meeting could be sufficient. But he added that it was hard to prove criminal intent. Justice Kennedy reacted with sarcasm. “You’re going to tell the senators, the officials with the lunches, that ‘don’t worry, the jury has to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt,’” he said. Some justices said that even the standard urged by Mr. McDonnell’s lawyer converted too much ordinary conduct into a crime. “The word ‘influence’ is too broad,” Justice Breyer said, “because every day of the week politicians write on behalf of constituents letters to different parts of the government, saying, ‘Will you please look at the case of Mrs.    who was evicted last week? ’” Justice Kennedy said he would limit the definition of unlawful corruption to the “exercise of governmental power to require citizens to do or not to do something, or to shape the law that governs their conduct. ” Asking another official to have a meeting with a donor, he suggested, was not enough. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who seemed sympathetic to the government, probed the implications of such a standard, asking Mr. Francisco whether it would be lawful to charge $1, 000 for a meeting. “If there’s no indicia that you’re actually trying to influence the outcome, and it really is just a meeting, yes,” Mr. Francisco said. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said it might matter who was arranging the meeting. “If it’s the president who calls and says, ‘I want you to look at this matter for my constituent,’ that might exercise considerably more influence,” he said. But Chief Justice Roberts was considerably more animated and skeptical in questioning Mr. Dreeben, the government’s lawyer. The chief justice quoted from a supporting brief filed by several former White House counsels of both parties who warned that if the decision were upheld, it would “cripple the ability of elected officials to fulfill their role in our representative democracy. ” “I think it’s extraordinary that those people agree on anything,” Chief Justice Roberts said. Last year, the Supreme Court allowed Mr. McDonnell to stay out of prison while the court considered whether to hear his case, McDonnell v. United States, No.  . That unusual order was a powerful hint that the court might be inclined to rule in his favor. In their Supreme Court briefs, Mr. McDonnell’s lawyers relied on the Citizens United decision in 2010, in which the Supreme Court said that “ingratiation and access” were “not corruption. ” That year, the court ruled in favor of a former Enron executive, Jeffrey K. Skilling, saying that a federal anticorruption law governing “honest services” applied only to bribes and kickbacks. On Wednesday, Chief Justice Roberts noted that three members of the court  —   Justices Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia, who died in February  —   would have gone further in the Skilling case and ruled that the law was unconstitutionally vague. “Maybe the experience we’ve had here,” the chief justice said, “and the difficulty of coming up with clear enough instructions suggests that the caution the court showed at that point”  —   in construing the law narrowly rather than striking it down  —   “was  . ” Mr. Francisco, who had a good day, stumbled near the end of his presentation, referring to Justice Ginsburg as “Justice O’Connor. ” “That hasn’t happened in quite some time,” Justice Ginsburg said. Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, the first woman to serve on the Supreme Court, retired in 2006. Mr. Dreeben’s outing was rockier, but it ended in a tribute from Chief Justice Roberts, who congratulated him on presenting his 100th Supreme Court argument, a rare achievement. While a majority of the justices seemed inclined to vote in Mr. McDonnell’s favor, it was not clear that they would agree on a rationale. As Justice Breyer put it, Mr. McDonnell’s case presented “as knotty and complicated and difficult and basic a problem as I can think of. ”",0

John Podesta’s Wiki-leaked Gmail shows that would-be-staff of Hillary Clinton’s campaign openly discussed her use of the private email account back in Summer 2014, but were told not to worry because “everything was taken care of.” John Podesta, Clinton campaign chairmen: “Did you have any idea of the depth of this story?” Robby Mook, Clinton campaign manager: “Nope. We brought up the existence of emails in reserach [sic] this summer but were told that everything was taken care of.” At the time of the exchange, Clinton had not officially announced her candidacy. According to NY Times: Clinton exclusively used a private email account while serving as secretary of state. Clinton violated State Department and Obama administration policies regarding email use. Clinton also flouted the Federal Records Act, which requires government officials to return their work product to their governing agency. Clinton did not give the State Department her work-related emails until Dec. 5, 2014. The State Department and Clinton’s legal team began negotiating the hand-over of Clinton’s emails in Summer 2014. Cheryl Mills, Clinton’s State Department chief of staff and her personal attorney: Led discussions with State Department about the email hand-over. Mills was also in frequent contact with Podesta and Mook in 2014. 
(WASHINGTON, DC) Members of what would become Hillary Clinton’s campaign team discussed her use of a private email account as secretary of state in Summer 2014, months before her email practices were publicly revealed. But an email released on Thursday shows that Robby Mook, Clinton’s campaign manager, was not overly concerned about the issue at that time because he was told that “everything was taken care of.” 
It is not clear what Mook meant by the cryptic statement, which he made in an exchange with Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. 
The email, which was hacked from Podesta’s Gmail account and released by WikiLeaks, is the first to show that the Clinton team was caught almost completely off guard by The New York Times’ March 2, 2015 story about Clinton’s email usage. 
“Did you have any idea of the depth of this story?” Podesta asked Mook in the email. 
“Nope,” wrote Mook. “We brought up the existence of emails in reserach [sic] this summer but were told that everything was taken care of.”",0
9665,California Today: A New Target of Gun Control Advocates — Bullets - The New York Times,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Sign up.) California has the nation’s strictest gun laws. There is a waiting period, a written test and a number of restrictions on guns and gear. Some voters pondering Proposition 63 have asked: Haven’t we done enough? Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor, says no. He’s developed the initiative that would push the state’s gun limits even further. Under Proposition 63, ammunition purchasers would be treated similar to gun purchasers. Before a Californian could buy even a single bullet of any kind, he or she would need to pay a fee of up to $50 and wait up to 30 days to obtain a   permit. “The game changer in the country is going to be ammunition background checks,” Mr. Newsom, who is running for governor in 2018, said in a phone interview. Proposition 63 has drawn vehement opposition from civil liberties and policing groups who argue that it would make Californians less safe and impede law enforcement. What’s more, they note, the state already created a law this year that added background checks for bullet buyers at the point of sale. (Mr. Newsom said that bill did not go far enough.) Critically, opponents say, the wait time could put people in danger. In one of the opposition group’s campaign ads, a lone woman is depicted pulling a gun against an attacker in a dim parking lot, only to pull the trigger and hear the “click” of an unloaded weapon. “All Proposition 63 seeks to do is pile on 34 more pages of more complex legalese on an already byzantine system of gun laws,” said Sean Brady, counsel for the Coalition for Civil Liberties. Proposition 63 also adds new felony charges for stealing firearms, broadens a ban on large capacity magazines and requires all felons to surrender their guns, among other measures. Since 2000, the rate of gun violence in California has fallen by about 20 percent, according to Garen J. Wintemute, an epidemiologist who studies firearm violence at U. C. Davis. Whether that can be credited to tough gun measures is a subject of disagreement. But firearm dealers say at least one outcome of the debate is certain: more sales. Californians have been buying more guns than ever  —   last year, more than 890, 000.

9667,"In the Olympic Pool, Contempt for Drug Cheats Rises to the Surface - The New York Times","RIO DE JANEIRO  —   The president of the International Olympic Committee made a plea for unity at the opening ceremony of the Rio Games last week. But that hope is fraying as a growing number of athletes are openly criticizing competitors who have a history of using   drugs. The friction has been most pronounced at the swimming competition, where Yulia Efimova of Russia and Sun Yang of China, who have served suspensions for doping, have been vilified by rivals. Whether it is vigilantism or antidoping activism by athletes who do not trust the Olympic committee, the denouncements have overshadowed some of the athletic performances. Where once there was polite, if sometimes awkward, silence, there is now direct confrontation. Much of it is along old political fault lines from the Cold War as, coincidentally or not, athletes from the West go after   athletes from Russia and China. “Antidoping is all about trust: trusting your competitors, trusting the drug testers, trusting the sports admin types,” said Richard Ings, a former antidoping official from Australia. “What I believe you are witnessing is evaporated trust. Remember, nearly 100 positives have now been found at the Beijing and London Games. ” “Sochi was corrupted,” he continued, referring to the Russian city that hosted the 2014 Winter Games. “Russia had   doping, and the International Olympic Committee caved in, unlike the International Paralympic Committee. ” The I. O. C. did not apply a blanket ban on Russian athletes for the Rio Games after the release of a damning report by the World   Agency the Paralympic committee did bar the Russians from this year’s Paralympics, which begin next month. More and more athletes have clearly had enough, turning typically pro forma news conferences into morality plays. On Saturday, the Australian freestyler Mack Horton was in the   pool before the competition when Sun, his main rival, vigorously splashed him, as if to get his attention. Sun served a   suspension in 2014 for taking a banned stimulant. “I ignored him,” Horton, 20, said, “because I don’t have time or respect for drug cheats. ” That night, Horton   Sun for the gold medal in the   freestyle. Horton did not acknowledge him in the water and later called it “a win for the good guys,” although he and Sun did shake hands during the medal ceremony. Members of the Chinese swimming team expressed outrage about Horton’s actions, with the team manager Xu Qi calling for an apology. None has been forthcoming. “Mack obviously has very strong views about the need for clean sport, as every single one of us does,” said the Australian delegation’s chef de mission, Kitty Chiller. “He has every right to express his views and his displeasure in that sense. ” Sun went on to win the gold medal in the   freestyle Monday night. “They don’t belong in a sport,” Camille Lacourt, a star French swimmer, said Monday night in comments reported by the French newspaper L’Équipe. “They should make up their federation of dopers and have fun among themselves. It disgusts me to see people who’ve cheated standing on podiums. Sun Yang, in the 200 free, he pees purple. ” That night, the American swimmer Lilly King, 19, cited Horton as an influence when she spoke out about Efimova. King entered the Rio Games with the top time in the world this year in the women’s   breaststroke. The   swimmer in the   to the competition was Efimova, a    Russian whose place at these Olympics was not confirmed until Saturday. Efimova, the reigning world champion, had served a   doping suspension handed down by swimming’s global governing body, known as FINA, a ban that ended in early 2015. Early this year, Efimova failed a test for the newly banned drug meldonium, but the result was overturned when she appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, arguing that she had already served her penalty. Every time Efimova has raced inside the Olympic Aquatics Stadium, she has been booed. King demonstrated her disapproval in another way. After posting the fastest time in qualifying on Sunday afternoon, King wagged her finger to remind everyone who was No. 1. As King looked on from the ready room, where swimmers gather before they race, Efimova won the first semifinal and mimicked King’s move. King went out and won the second semifinal and shook her finger again. In a postrace interview with NBC, King said, “You wave your finger No. 1, and you’ve been caught drug cheating?” She added, “I’m not a fan. ” In a group interview in the mixed zone, King defended her actions. “I’m not this sweet little girl,” she said. “That’s not who I am. ” All the finger wagging set the stage for the final on Monday night, when their score was settled in the pool. King occupied Lane 4. Efimova was in Lane 5. It was a duel at 100 meters. King turned first at the 50 and hung on to win with a time of 1 minute 4. 93 seconds. It was her best time and an Olympic record. Efimova was second in 1:05. 50,   of a second ahead of King’s American teammate Katie Meili. After the race, King hung on the lane line that separated her from Efimova and splashed twice in Efimova’s lane. King said she had not done it on purpose. But she also studiously avoided contact with Efimova. “I don’t think she really wants to be congratulated by me,” King said. The news conference featuring the medal winners felt more like a trial than a triumphant review. King sat at the opposite end of the table from Efimova. Meili was in the middle seat, normally reserved for the gold medalist. Neither King nor Meili looked at Efimova, who was on the verge of tears from the opening question about the boos directed at her. “I’m just happy I’m here and racing,” said Efimova, who looked miserable. She appealed to people “to try to understand me,” but King, who sat   through Efimova’s answers, did not appear moved. At one point, Efimova switched from English to Russian. The moderator nudged a pair of headphones toward King and told her she could use them to listen to the English translation. King declined, as did Meili. What is striking is that the antidoping chorus in Rio has consisted of newcomers and veterans alike, with Olympic rookies like Horton, of Australia, and King joining the    Lacourt and Michael Phelps, who is also 31 and is the most decorated athlete in Olympic history. “I think what you’re seeing is the desire of Olympic athletes to uphold the values of the Olympic Games without exception,” Adam Nelson, an American   and activist for athletes’ rights, said in an email Monday. Nelson was named the winner of the 2004 Olympic   competition eight years after it was contested when the original champion, Yuriy Bilonog of Ukraine, retroactively tested positive for a banned substance. “These athletes know, when an athlete cheats, he or she will experience a residual physical benefit for many years,” Nelson added. “But there’s also a residual sentiment that negatively impacts the sport moving forward. The clouds of suspicion that linger over doped athletes who return to competition continue to take a toll on the value of the clean athlete. ” There is not yet conclusive evidence on the   benefits to performance for athletes who took banned substances earlier in their careers. And as Thomas Bach, the I. O. C. ’s president, has repeatedly pointed out, lifetime bans from sports for doping offenses have not proved legally defensible. In the cases of men like Sun and Justin Gatlin, the   American sprinter who has been another target of athletes’ criticism since his return, they are being called out even though the system in place gives them every right to resume competing. King said Monday night that she believed any athlete with a doping offense  —   including Gatlin  —   should not be allowed to compete. The national governing body for track and field, U. S. A. Track  Field, issued a statement on Tuesday rejecting that notion. “The WADA code indicates that when an individual has completed their suspension, they are eligible to   in the sport,” the statement said. “The Amateur Sports Act stipulates that if an athlete is eligible to compete, they cannot be prevented from being on a national team. So in the United States, it is a matter of law. If you are not under a ban, regardless of what you may have served in the past, you are fully eligible to be on the team. ” Still, Nelson defended the right of athletes to criticize   competitors. “It’s not undermining the system,” he said. “It highlights a major flaw in the system. Ms. King could have lost out on an Olympic gold medal future had the events turned out differently yesterday, and she would have had to accept the fact that a known doper beat her. Where’s the spirit of Olympism in that outcome?”",0
9668,"Obama, Clinton and Putin Play on the Same Team-America Has Been Betrayed","Previous Obama, Clinton and Putin Play on the Same Team-America Has Been Betrayed 
Obama and Putin are playing on the same team. They have a mutual goal. A close examination of the facts reveal that Obama is in bed with the Communists and is intent on the destruction of America. Hillary Clinton is part of the same cabal. If you don’t think so, ask yourself how she was able to sell 20% of America’s uranium to the Russians? 
This article will demonstrate that B. Obama (Soetoro) is the manifestation of a decades-old plot designed to subvert the leadership of the United States, thus making America vulnerable to being conquered. Is America Worth Dying For? 
I loathe the government that we are forced to endure every day, don’t you, with every communication you engage in being monitored by a bunch of government voyeurs? However, I do love my country, the American people and the ideals for which we stand (e.g. one nation under God). America’s present government is not worthy of one ounce of respect. However, the American Constitution and our traditions are indeed worth fighting for, but not with Obama at the helm. 
I have often wondered if I had been a soldier in the Texan Army, would I have stayed, fought and died at the hands of Santa Anna’s forces at the Alamo? If I had been a defender at Bataan, Wake Island, or Guam, in the early days of World War II and I knew death was certain, would I stand my post to the last minute? I would, if I knew my sacrifice was honorable and my leadership was patriotic and willing to make the same sacrifice. America Will Soon Stand Alone 
As I have documented over the past several weeks, America will soon stand alone , with perhaps, only England as our last ally. Europe will soon be under the Russian sphere of control because of energy dependence on Russia. As a result, NATO will disintegrate. China has married their economy to the Russians based upon gas and oil and we will someday soon face their soldiers on the battlefield which will take place in our neighborhoods. Seemingly all of Latin America has turned their backs on the US and is allowing for Russian military bases and accepting Russian military equipment, thus, making a Red Dawn scenario a near certainty. 
America stands on the edge of virtual extinction. The only question is whether Putin, after totally destroying the Petrodollar, will allow America to slowly crumble, or use the combined forces of the United Nations (e.g. North Korea, China, Latin America and Russia to invade). Either way, people like ex-CIA agent, Dr. Jim Garrow boldly proclaim that eventually 90% of all Americans will be left dead. And isn’t that figure consistent with the globalist expressed desire to reduce the North American population by 90%? 
And how does Obama respond to these threats? He has announced that he is reducing the American military to pre-World War II levels in yet another act of treason against the American people. 
Back to the fundamental question, should we stand our ground and fight to the death? The answer is yes. However, I will not follow the psychopathic criminal that is in the White House. If America is to fall, and most of us will perish, we should not fall with a traitor at the helm. Though the heavens may fall, treason must not be allowed to prosper. The man with 11 social security numbers, several names (e.g. Barry Soetero) must not be allowed to remain in power. If I am to fall in defense of my country, I will do so with fellow Americans, not by following some mongrel masquerading as an American. Obama Is the Soviet Fulfillment of Generations of Planning 
After Viktor Suvorov, a former Russian intelligence analyst, defected to England, he revealed Russia’s top-secret plans to attack the United States at some future date after undermining the United States from within through the subversion of their political leadership. Suvorov had worked as a Russian intelligence analyst as well as having worked for the GRU and with elite Russian special forces, Suvorov, warned the Americans of Russia’s true intentions after the Russian high command had succeeded in getting Pentagon officials to let down their guard and engage in a high level, but mostly one-sided, technology transfer . And under the wrong President (i.e. Obama), America would be weakened to the point to where it could not adequately defend herself. 
Anatoliy Golitsyn, a high-ranking KGB defector fled to the United States in order to warn Americans about the secret Russian plan to attack the United States. Golitsyn is generally considered to be among the first and most revealing on the subject of the secret Russian plans to attack America after faking the demise of the old Soviet Union. He authored the The Perestroika Deception in which Golitsyn wrote about the deceitful intent behind the Leninist strategy which the present-day Communists are actively pursuing as they fake American style democratization efforts in Russia. From within, American leadership would be compromised in key positions, and the fall of America would be orchestrated from within and under the leadership of an Obama type of President. Golitsyn and Suvorov were only two of dozens of Soviet defectors who told exactly the same story dating back to the 1960’s. Obama Is the Pawn of the Russians to Conquer America 
From the official files of Sheriff Joe Arpaio, we find Allen Hulton , a 39 year veteran of the postal service, who provided a sworn affidavit to Maricopa County, AZ. Sheriff investigators. 
Arpaio was leading an investigation to determine whether or not former foreign college student , Barack Obama, was eligible to be placed on Arizona’s 2012 election ballot. After reviewing Hulton’s affidavit, it is apparent that 1960’s communist agitators and revolutionaries from the communist-inspired Weathermen Underground, Bill Ayers and Bernadine Dohrn were in fact the de facto adoptive parents to this foreign student destined to become the first illegitimate President of the United States. As a result, Obama was treated to the finest Ivy League education that communist backed money could buy as Hulton maintains that the Ayers told him that he was financing the education of a promising foreign student at Harvard. Hulton also testified that he met Obama while at the Ayer’s home and he asked Obama what he going to do with all his education, to which Obama politely answered, “I am going to become the President”. Readers should take note that this is an affidavit, and as such, is formally considered to be evidence, not conjecture or hearsay. There can be no other conclusion that the criminally convicted communist terrorist, Bill Ayers, began grooming Obama to become America’s first communist President during Obama’s college years. Their relationship continues into the present time as it is on record that Ayers visited the White House in August of 2009. Please note the words “foreign student”, which makes Obama ineligible to be in the White House. 
Obama’s communist affiliations continued well into his adulthood and because of the good work of Joel Gilbert who discovered that Obama was active with a Weathermen Underground support group known as The May 19th Communist Organization, in New York. Perhaps, this is why Ayers was visiting the White House. And speaking of Ayers and Dorne, adding more fuel to this communist fire, it is interesting to note that both Senior White House Advisors, David Axelrod and Valerie Jarrett were both Weatherman Underground “ Red Diaper Babies , in which they were the sons and daughters of well-to-do parents who desired communism and lived out their dreams through their children’s revolutionary activities. Other notable red-diaper babies also include such notables as Rahm Emanuel and Eric Holder . Jarrett’s situation is particularly interesting in that her family and the Ayers family have been multi-generational friends which also included a marriage between the two families. Much of the Obama administration is a nest of communists and this should serve to gravely concern every American citizen. It was Ayers and Dorne who launched State Senatorial candidate Obama’s political career from their Hyde Park, IL. living room according to the late Larry Grathwohl a former FBI undercover operative who penetrated the Weathermen Underground. Hollywood could not write a movie this good, with this much intrigue. 
Frank Chapman , a communist activist and a member of the communist front group known as the World Peace Council. Chapman clearly used the term “mole” to describe Obama. He said Obama’s political climb and subsequent success in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries was “a dialectical leap ushering in a qualitatively new era of struggle.” Chapman further stated that, “Marx once compared revolutionary struggle with the work of the mole, who sometimes burrows so far beneath the ground that he leaves no trace of his movement on the surface. This is the old revolutionary ‘mole,’ not only showing his traces on the surface but also breaking through. “ The Communist Party USA backs Obama to the hilt. ” It is clear that Obama is their man! Obama is Putin 2.0. 
The Middle East is turning away from the Petrodollar. Europe will soon abandon the dollar to buy Russian gas. The Petrodollar is the only thing of value backing the dollar. When the fall of the Petrodollar is complete, it will not take 30 days to witness the complete and utter destruction of this economy. Dr. Garrow believes when the economic collapse arrives, it will be masked with an EMP attack designed to accelerate the process of decline. In this scenario. the Naval War College predicts 90% of us will be dead within two years under these circumstances! And what is Obama doing about all of this? He is doing nothing! 
To those who think this is far-fetched, read on and see what the defectors tell us is coming and it will be hard to deny Obama’s complicity. Golitsyn’s Blueprint for Obama 
According to Golitsyn, the short-term strategic objective of the Russians is to achieve a technological convergence with the West solely on Russian terms and mostly through a series of one-sided disarmament agreements. He also stated that the Russians and the Americans would engage in joint military exercises just prior to America’s fall and this is exactly what we find when we look at the historical record under Obama. 
“In 2010, American soldiers participated in the 2010 Moscow Victory Day Parade alongside its European allies and members of the CIS , marking the first time American soldiers have ever participated in the annual event on May 9.

In 2012, Russia sends aid to the United States in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy on November 11. 
In 2013, American, Russian and NATO military forces perform a counter piracy exercise in the Gulf of Aden on February 26. 
In 2014, The United States, Russia and NATO announce plans to conduct a joint naval operation in the Mediterranean to protect a U.S. ship that will destroy Syria’s chemical weapons on February 14.” 
There are literally dozens more of these bilateral cooperative efforts involving the military forces of Russia and the United States. This is following a time when leaders like George Bush placed a missile shield in Poland and beefed up our support of NATO. It is clear that Obama is in bed with the Russians. AND PUTIN, OBAMA AND CLINTON ARE IN BED WITH THE GLOBALISTS WHO WANT WORLD WAR III. Golitsyn and the Scissors Plan 
Golitsyn stated that Russia, after lulling America to sleep, will join with China in order to attack the United States from both the outside and inside as he detailed that “ In each of these the scissors strategy will play its part; probably, as the final stroke, the scissors blades will close. The element of apparent duality in Soviet and Chinese policies will disappear. The hitherto concealed coordination between them will become visible and predominant. The Soviets and the Chinese will be officially reconciled. Thus the scissors strategy will develop logically into the ‘strategy of one clenched fist’ to provide the foundation and driving force of a world communist federation…before long, the communist strategists might be persuaded that the balance had swung irreversibly in their favor. In that event they might well decide on a Sino-Soviet ‘reconciliation.’ The scissors strategy would give way to the strategy of “one clenched fist.” The enemies now are gathered from within . At that point the shift in the political and military balance will be plain for all to see. 
The inking of the recent energy deal which married the economies of the Russians and the Chinese is the manifestation of Golitsyn’s revelations. 
As I stated earlier, the death of the Petrodollar means that you will not a have job to go to tomorrow. Because of Obama, the Chinese own our money. Which means they own your mortgage, retirement and savings accounts. Everything you own, is controlled by the Chinese. Soon, they will be coming to collect. 
My insider military sources, as well as Dr. Garrow, tell me that plans for an American guerrilla warfare resistance are being put into play as we speak. This means that millions of us are going to die at the hands of foreign invaders and from being caught in the crossfire. Conclusion 
I no longer believe in the America political process and for good reason (e.g. electronic voting machines). George Soros has proven what a rigged system we live under. Remember, Traitor-In-Chief #1 is Obama. Traitor-In-Chief #2 is Clinton and Hillary is the closer. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SOLD OUT FROM EVERY POSSIBLE ANGLE.",0
9669,"Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, Cleveland Cavaliers: Your Wednesday Evening Briefing - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. “Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?” More than 46 million Britons have registered to vote  in Thursday’s referendum, and polls show a statistical dead heat. Proponents and opponents frantically campaigned for a final day. Twitter users tried to lighten the bitter debate, posting photos of their pets as #CatsAgainstBrexit, #DogsForBrexit and the like (even a few hamsters). _____ 2. Dozens of Democratic representatives staged a   on the House floor to demand that the Republican majority hold a vote on a   measure before a weeklong recess begins Friday. The Republican House leaders halted the session, cutting off the   broadcast of the Democratic protest. _____ 3. Donald Trump tried to refocus his campaign after a rough few days. He made his most sustained attack on Hillary Clinton, calling her “a   liar” in a speech that included many inaccurate and misleading statements. Mrs. Clinton, who on Tuesday criticized Mr. Trump’s business and economic ideas, laid out her vision for the U. S. economy. And the Libertarian Party’s candidates, former Gov. Gary Johnson of New Mexico and former Gov. Bill Weld of Massachusetts, held a town hall tonight. _____ 4. Wildfires burned in at least eight Western states and Alaska, with 31 clustered in a swath of Arizona and New Mexico blistered by a heat wave. Above, Los Angeles clouded in smoke. The Midwest braced for severe thunderstorms that could push across to the Eastern Seaboard. _____ 5. Sunday will see the formal opening of a new set of locks meant to ensure that the historic Panama Canal can handle the new, giant ships crucial to a hyperglobalized world of trade. But our investigation  —   interviews with contractors, canal workers, maritime experts and diplomats, and reviews of public and internal records  —   reveals construction flaws that leave the $3 billion project’s safety and economic viability in doubt. _____ 6. The golfer Rory McIlroy withdrew from the Rio Olympics because of concerns about the Zika virus, a   loss that may encourage more athletes to skip the Games. The event, set for August, has been diminished by the banning of Russia’s track and field team and Bulgaria’s   over doping. It has also been plagued by construction, pollution and national economic troubles in Brazil. _____ 7. One of the world’s longest conflicts appears to be nearing an end after more than 50 years. The Colombian government and FARC rebels said they had agreed to a   at talks in Havana and would hold a ceremony on Thursday. Peace is “not an illusion now, it’s a promise,” the rebels tweeted. _____ 8. A woman close to Prince described for the first time publicly what happened the night he blacked out on a private jet, just days before his fatal overdose. The singer Judith Hill, who was on the plane, said she raised an alarm after “his eyes fixed” and he became unconscious, forcing an emergency landing, treatment with an opioid blocker and hospitalization. She said he promised her that he would get help: “That’s the part that breaks my heart, because he was trying. ” _____ 9. Scientists reported an unnerving discovery: three species of clam that suffered from contagious cancer. The worry isn’t that they could infect humans  —   rather, that infectious cancers may be more widespread than previously understood. _____ 10. Discussions of   measures proliferated a day after a   visitor to Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook page noticed that a photo showed his computer camera and microphone jack covered with tape. Security experts say those are sensible precautions everyone should consider, to prevent a takeover by a kind of malware called a   trojan  —   “ratting” for short. _____ 11. “i nvr felt this dark. ” One of our most riveting stories today retraces the steps of a    athlete from Columbus, Ohio, who committed suicide. A dedicated wrestler and football player proud of his tolerance for pain, Kosta Karageorge sustained at least 15 concussions. Tormented by erratic thoughts and excruciating headaches, he climbed into a garbage Dumpster and shot himself. _____ 12. Finally, more than a million fans flooded the streets of Cleveland to celebrate the Cavaliers’ N. B. A. title. Some slept on the streets overnight to get a good spot for the parade, which lasted more than four joyous hours. “I’m nothing without you all,” LeBron James said to crowds. “Get ready for next year. ” _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.

9670,Something Big Is Underway On All Fronts: “Within The Next Few Weeks The Future Of The United States Will Be Decided”,"
As of this writing, the increased U.S. troop presence in Eastern Europe includes a battalion-sized element of American troops being emplaced in the Suwalki Gap, Polish territory that borders Lithuania in a 60-mile stretch of corridor. The Russian Defense Ministry announced that 600 Russian and Belarussian airborne troops conducted training exercises in Brest, on the Belorussian-Polish border only a few miles from where the U.S. forces are deploying in Poland. This on the heels of Britain deploying 800 men, tanks, and jets to Estonia, along with pledges of Challenger 2 tanks, APC’s (Armored Personnel Carriers), and drones. Two companies of French and Danish Soldiers will join the British in the deployment to Estonia.
For the first time since 1945, Norway has violated its treaty with Russia (then the Soviet Union) not to station foreign troops on its soil. A company of U.S. Marines will soon be stationed for a 6-month deployment in Norway. The situation is heating up in Ukraine, according to a report on fort-russ.com entitled Ukraine Moves Massive Force up to Lugansk Frontline , published October 28, 2016 . The report reveals the Ukrainian Army is deploying 3,500 soldiers and 200 armored vehicles of the 15 th Motorized Infantry Brigade to Krasny Oktyabr in the district of Lugansk in Eastern Ukraine. For the first time in history, Romanian airspace is being patrolled by the RAF (Royal Air Force) of Britain.
In addition, the Ukrainian National Guard is deploying a tactical company equipped with 82 mm mortars and AGS-17 auto grenade launchers, along with APC’s and missile launchers. A separate reconnaissance battalion named the “Night Shades,” a nationalist volunteer battalion will be deploying to Lugansk as well. No doubt they will receive a “warm” reception, as the fighting has been ongoing in the region for more than two years. The area is a severe flashpoint, as the separatists are ethnic Russians of Ukrainian nationality who wish to secede in the manner that Crimea did…Russia annexed them after the popular vote to leave Ukraine. Now (since December 2015) the Congress gave the green light to send weapons and munitions to Ukraine; the “holdup” is due to Obama not wanting to jeopardize the election of Hillary Clinton, as the Russians have stated weapons to Ukraine means war with the U.S. and NATO.
Meanwhile the Varshankya-class stealth subs are deploying into the Black Sea as the Russian fleet is moving toward Syria. The Russian and Syrian armies continue to bomb and attack the al-Nusra/Jabhat Fatah ash-Sham fighters emplaced in the city of Aleppo. The mainstream media, meanwhile, is faltering in its attempt to create a “sacred U.S.-coalition crusade” to “free the city of Mosul,” as the offensive is not working quite as planned. There are also reports that the U.S. government has plans to “navigate” Islamic terrorists from Mosul into Syria, to cause more problems for Assad and the Russians; the mainstream media is notoriously silent on the collateral damages being caused by the U.S.-led Mosul attacks, in which U.S. aircraft are supporting with bombing missions.
Let’s be clear on this: The U.S. is beefing up conventional forces of American troops into Eastern Europe and convincing NATO countries to augment these deployments with soldiers and equipment. The Russians have been responding with opposing counter-deployments to offset the U.S.-NATO movements. The aggressive stance is being taken by the U.S.-NATO-IMF hegemony in its military buildup in Eastern Europe and the Baltic States, the very “backyard” of Russia.
The bottom line: the stage is being set to start WWIII on the slightest provocation. 
The domestic perspective yields that just a few weeks after the ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) transfer from U.S. control to (basically) the UN on October 1, 2016, the U.S. has had a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack from hackers on October 21, 2016 affecting the east and west coast of the U.S. as well as Texas and part of Europe. Just one week before, on OCtobr 13, 2016 Obama signed an Executive Order for Space Weather anomalies just “in case” some “space weather anomaly” were to cripple the power grid and electrical infrastructure of the United States.
Something even worse that happened may really tie into this. 
Last week it was reported by the U.S. Army that Major General John Rossi had committed suicide . Rossi had been slated to take over as the Commander of U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command, and the Army Forces Strategic Command. General Rossi was about to complete 33 years of service and was only 55 years old. He was “found” at Redstone Arsenal, and the Army just ruled it a suicide. The Daily Mail on dailymail.co.uk reported that a U.S. government official told USA Today: “It seemed that Rossi was overwhelmed by his responsibilities” as a potential reason for his suicide.
The problem is, he committed suicide on July 31, 2016…and it’s taken two months for the Army to rule it as being a suicide? 
With the command assignment, Rossi would have been privy to every procedure and protocol to defend the United States against an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) attack or an EMP (electromagnetic pulse) attack or event . He would know everything from the “top” down: that is, the Commander-in-Chief (Obama) would have to foster a one-on-one relationship with the man who would hold the key post to defending against a foreign missile attack.
Maybe this time the missile would not have been foreign, or if it was? It may not have been the leader of a foreign country to direct it against the United States. 
It is almost impossible to believe that a Major General of the United States Army just receiving a top command post, a 55-year-old soldier…a general officer…with 33 years of service, a wife, and a loving family would “off” himself because of being “overwhelmed by responsibility.” Men such as Rossi (the highest-ranking member of the military to do such a thing) do not shirk responsibility: they meet it, head on. The whole thing stinks of a purge , in the manner that the entire military of the United States has been purged of hundreds of senior General Staff officers, Admiralty, and Senior Noncommissioned Officers…replaced by “yes” men over the course of Obama’s term.
The whole thing stinks of an assassination : no suicide note, no real press coverage, and nothing from his friends, family, or fellow soldiers. This occurs, and then Obama signs his Executive Order to “protect” us from the dreaded space anomaly that will take down our infrastructure. Could this have possibly been a suicide? Think of all of the heartache and grief his family is going through with his loss. What about the benefits and retirement that his family would lose with such an act? If he really committed suicide, then it was probably because he found out about something so heinous, so vile that would occur to the U.S. that he couldn’t live with it and probably couldn’t stop it.
Bottom line: Was he terminated when he wouldn’t go along with a false flag EMP-plan conceived by Obama to take down our grid, cripple our response time, and set the stage for martial law and the suspension of all rights under the Constitution of the United States? 
As I have mentioned in the past, I repeat once again:
The next war will be initiated by an EMP device detonated above the continental United States followed by a limited nuclear exchange and then conventional warfare. 
I never said that it wouldn’t be Obama who initiated the EMP device, and in all probability if he doesn’t initiate it…he’ll either provoke it, allow it, or request it. We haven’t even mentioned the voting (early voting) taking place where fraud is occurring in Maryland, Virginia, Illinois, and Florida, among others. The illusion of the vote: the joke of the year, but the joke is on us.
And Obama is the joker, setting the stage for the transfer of power. That transfer is not going to occur with the losing candidate (in either case) going gently into that good night. The stage is set for a war to begin. The stage is set for a false flag operation to take down our grid. The stage is set to steal the election for Clinton or declare it null and void. Within the next few weeks, the future of the United States will be decided…with or without the consent of the governed.

This guy is real genius isn’t he? He is too stupid to realize all of those tweeter posts and Youtube videos are going to come back and bit him in the rear? Oh well, he will have plenty of time to think about his stupidity while he sits in a jail cell. doodaa 
Would you hire this guy? Lancifer Wildwood 
You don’t need a job when soros the nazi funds you….geesh I don’t even live in the US and I know that! Koolz 
Jews created Black Lives matter and these guys get paid pretty well for there acting up at any protest. Black Lives Matter the very name creates violence. Purple lives Matter Hunter 
Bingo!!! 
You know, I wonder if / when “somebody in the know”, were to release nasty-jew George Soro’s travel itinerary…to the “right people”… 
…hey Georgie…watch-out…payback can be a BITCH Zone43 
50 Rabbis marched with them in Ferguson. owr 
Jews are truly racist. M Saurette 
so, the plan is to be more violent, more racist, more destructive. And the goal is to have blacks NOT be targeted by police? Good luck with that. owr 
It won’t just be the police targeting rioting blacks.The average white is ready fearfully cautious of black thugs. The thugs know this and they try to intimidate whites by flaunting theirs MTV image of the ‘Gangsta’ by learning the right facial expressions, and wearing their pants on their ass. Stacking gang signs, even if not in a gang to appear knowledgeable about such things. It might work with some of the girls, but to the average young white male it is perceived as a potential threat. The primary difference between white males and black males is that only 30%, on average, black males are not convicted felons, and cannot legally possess a firearm. On the other hand nearly 80% of white males have no felony conviction, and can, or do possess legal firearms. Blacks are 13% of our population. Whites are a little under 70%. There are also a huge number of pissed off white veterans of Vietnam, Bosnia, Iraq, and Afghanistan, who would not mind a little domestic house cleaning. You can bet your ass, and not be afraid of losing it, that these Vets are Trump supporters. Be careful what you wish for. The real world is not MTV, or a gangsta movie. Cornczech 
This morning on my walk to the Howard Redline stop in the Rogers Park neighborhood in Chicago, IL…..I was called out to by a black woman: “Hey, F* YOU, White B#tch!” The sad part, because I had to stop acting and looking scared a few years back when I first MOVED to this hood, (sometime after Obama became King), is that I am USED to this kind of thing, so I started to giggle after that outburst…yes, the abuse got worse …but…I get this at least once a week when I walk to the store, to the EL….to the bank……so (shrug). 
I have never called a black man or woman a nigger…(I bet I get blasted or removed or censored for that…but I get called whitey, hillbilly…(I’m a Cracker, let’s get THAT straight!), and a myriad of other race specific names…..I have even been assaulted for being white and standing up for myself…(I am a female, by the way….so, I have OTHER stories about my lovely experience living in CHICAGO…the next Detroit….) 
So how am I a racist? I grew up in Texas and never had problems or saw violence..or had violence perpetrated against me…..since I came here… 
So tell me again how I am a racist? 
My LAST question is: WHEN DID AMERICA come to such a SAD STATE? owr 
My suggestion is to get out of Chicago, it will be a pure hell-hole in the coming depression. Go back to Texas, the economy is much better there, and race relations are as well. Ted Dura 
oh joy Trump to dump 40 million mexicans and open season on rioting niggas–See its True ! 
TRUMP WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !! Guillotine_ready 
Why wait? Burn your houses down now!! doodaa 
And your liquer store! GORDON 
Sheesh can we all just get along , we’ve seen how well having a black president worked out ? Thank God I live where it’s cold and the black populous is to a minimal ! Thank God all you do is kill each other anyway ! 
Will the HUMAN RACE ever grow up? Sheesh! This is so stupid. Does a Siamese cat hate the Prussian Blue because it’s a different ‘breed’? Does and Irish Setter hate the Black Lab because. . . 
Man, people are the most un-evolved, unreasonable. . . doodaa 
Unfortunately, this has been going on since humans became self aware. Will we ever evolve? Not in our genes. Jo Peter 
Actually the ‘good fences make good neighbors’ tendency toward self segregation followed by more or less peaceful voluntary trade appears more or less universal, and it’s only the radical liberal cultural Marxism nonesense that is making this unworkable in the west (and this is mostly to blame on the mechanations of one particular tribe that’s ‘white’ when it benefits them but who hold no actual allegiance to the white race, we all know who they are.) doodaa 
Do you think maybe “GOD” knew what he was doing when he segregated races by continents? Jo Peter 
That is certainly a valid way to look at it. Some people view the order of the universe as through an impersonal ‘nature’ force, and others consider it a conscious design by an intelligent creator. In the end there is little practical difference when it comes to the specifics like this, since either way it worked before we broke it. 
Well, some of us are OK. I’ve dated outside my race, and I miss my buds of the past who I spent time with who weren’t fellow ‘honky-gringo-crackers’. fujak 
typical….blacks want democracy but only if and when it suits them woody 
This country needs a good cleansing, bring it on brotha! Bruce Regael 
We need LA Riots everywhere with police standing down. I’d love for them to bring the riots to the nice white liberal neighborhoods where those agent provocateurs riling up minorities always tend to hide after they fan the flames. If anyone needs to pay its white liberals. They’ve been playing puppet master for far too long using racial politics against conservative white people. 
Time is coming where we’re going to have to put the boots to their throats or force the minorities to kick their teeth in. doodaa 
Black folks will be OK. There is no bag limit on dumb niggers. Jo Peter 
Indeed. The ones that long ago accepted the cultural superiority of the west are allies. They can’t choose what genes they’re born with but they can side with good against radical liberal insanity. doodaa Zaphod Braden 
AMEN !!! Sanders was born and raised in the New York City borough of Brooklyn and graduated from the University of CHICAGO in 1964. While a student, he was an active civil rights protest organizer for the CONGRESS OF RACIAL EQUALITY and STUDENT (not really)NONVIOLENT COORDINATING COMMITTEE. Bernie ran to Vermont in 1968, to get away from BLACKS to raise HIS family in SAFETY Sanders switched PARTIES, BETRAYED the Veterans, and instigates the Blacks and then RUNS AWAY. In January 1962, Sanders led a rally at the University of Chicago administration building to protest university president George Wells Beadle’s segregated campus housing policy. “We feel it is an intolerable situation when Negro and white students of the university cannot live together in university-owned apartments,” Sanders said at the protest. But then Sanders ran to SAFE LILLY WHITE VERMONT to raise HIS children far away from those Blacks he wants you to live with. doodaa Cindyejohnson1 “my .friend’s mate Is getting 98$.

This is the classic ” lets get dumb ass to do the dirty work for us” trick. This dude is being played by the same people who will drop his ass on the street when theyre done with him.

Someone give this dude a hug and ask him if hes making the world a better place by being a dick. Jolly Roger 
This moron is just a tool, paid by rich people to incite racial tensions, with the usual hollow threats designed to intimidate white people as part of their ongoing divide-and-conquer agenda. 
“We don’t want to work. We don’t want to go to school. We demand to be handed everything we want, and if we don’t get it, we’ll attack white people.” 
Shut up, you idiot, and go back to your zoo. 
No intelligent debate. No civilized discussion. Just a gang of RACIST thugs trying to intimidate people based on their skin color. Tell me more about “equality”.

To help payoff my student-loans I worked as a NYC teacher in “troubled” neighborhoods for ten years. During those ten years I saw delinquents call each other “niggas” hundreds of times every single school day. If I had done it once, I would have been fired that same day. They punched each other, stole from each other, and from the faculty, vandalized the school, threw brand new text books out the window but the state and federal funds continued to pour in, very much contrary to popular belief. 
They actually got more money then the nicer areas. When I was finally able to move to a “good” school district, I couldn’t believe it. When I told the children (99% Caucasians) to take a a book and read quietly they actually did it. No exaggeration, you good actually hear your own respiration, that’s how quiet it was!!! And yes, you can find some schools with 95-99% white student population. I was never a “racist” but this was too much. The difference is incredible!!! Unfortunately if you notice a obvious behavioral difference between races, you are labeled as some kind of a bad person and the general public has learned to accept this word “racist” as derogatory regardless of the evidences that may exist, and we all know that they do exist. This denial has successfully forced illogical integration, the destruction of our liberty and country and the rise of economic fascist billionaires. Donald Trump, the only billionaire to go against is fellow elites is being completely typecast as “the rich white guy that must be a racist.” He is probably the one and only chance the middle class and the poor class will ever see again for justice in this country. The last man to have had his courage was President JFK. owr 
To actually be a nigger, one must learn to be one. They have plenty of role models to copy. It’s a matter of choice. nobody 
Lol… what a dumb ass! It’ll be a hoot watching video of these “tough” guys(gals?) getting their butts whomped after they destroy mostly their own slums, and if we’re lucky a few other choice places. desertspeaks 
“we will incite riots everywhere if trump wins” translation, we know if trump wins, we’ll have to get jobs to pay rent, food etc. and being societal parasites, we don’t want actual jobs, just free shit! owr 
Culture is learned in the home, and in school. “Granny was on total entitlements, so was momma, so is sista, so is my daddy where-ever and who-ever he is. So why I has ta lern all this white shit in school, I quit when I’m 16 and be worken the streets, the man..he be givn me food-stamps evey month that I can sell fo beer and cigarettes. Man, we got it fucken made.” Zone43 
They will stay in the cities, cry baby’s. Strayhorse 
What government really fears is when other than people of color, were to take to the streets. That’s why the government and the controlled media hide the truth about crime, racist crime perpetrated against other than people of color. When other than people of color awakens to the truth about crimes against them, L.A., Ferguson, and riots of their kind would pale against the response levied against the government for allowing the crimes against other than people of color to continue as it does today. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 DOES NOT offer any protection for other than people of color. That’s NOT was it was passed for! Other than people of color have NO federal or state protections against prejudice, injustice and inequality. nightwisp 
The 14th amendment and the civil rights act of 1964 made their rights equal to the white man. If the white man is gone, they are equal to nothing. They will have no rights. owr 
We are all slaves to the corporations, debt slaves. owr 
That is precisely why the libs began the fake and un-natural PC agenda, to erode the 1st amendment. Raymond McGraw 
You are surely as you called it…“NIGGA’S.Does not make a hill of difference who.what where or why.You were just born to riot.You have failed to look at the true one who has enlslaved you the last 8 years in the liberals and there government.Now you have become pawns working for them.Of course you have not realized that either.When the true one wins this and he will.

That would be instant death for the 3/5th’s, 14th amendment black United States citizens. This country was created by old white men to protect the white race. This is why the Jewish run media are promoting the blacks to riot. In fact black folks if your going to go after a group you might want to think about going after the Jews in the media. As they’re the one’s that have set you up to fail. Here’s a sweet piece of history the majority of the Negroes don’t know. Israel Cohen, the General Secretary of the World Zionist Organization, in his 1912 book “A racial program for the 20th Century”. And, read into the Congressional Record by Congressman Thomas Abernathy, U.S. House of Representatives Mississippi, 4th District on June 7, 1957, Volume 103, top of page 8559: Israel Cohen penned “We must realize that our party’s most powerful weapon is racial tension. By propounding into the consciousness of the dark races that for centuries they have been oppressed by the whites, we can mould them to the program of Negro minority against the whites, we will endeavor to instill in the whites a guilt complex for their exploitation of the Negroes. We will aid the Negroes to rise in prominence in every walk of life, in the professions and in the world of sports and entertainment. With this prestige, the Negro will be able to intermarry with the whites and begin a process which will deliver America to our cause.” So black folks before you embark on a suicide mission learn some real history and the true cause of your plight. As your anger is miss directed and you will be engaged as belligerents and enemy combatants. Live in peace, be well, and do your homework before you attempt something rash and dangerous. Rick

While a student, he was an active civil rights protest organizer for the CONGRESS OF RACIAL EQUALITY and STUDENT (not really)NONVIOLENT COORDINATING COMMITTEE. Bernie ran to Vermont in 1968, to get away from BLACKS to raise HIS family in SAFETY Sanders switched PARTIES, BETRAYED the Veterans, and instigates the Blacks and then RUNS AWAY. In January 1962, Sanders led a rally at the University of Chicago administration building to protest university president George Wells Beadle’s segregated campus housing policy. “We feel it is an intolerable situation when Negro and white students of the university cannot live together in university-owned apartments,” Sanders said at the protest.

9672,"Your Evening Briefing: EgyptAir, Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. EgyptAir Flight 804, an Airbus A320, veered suddenly en route from Paris to Cairo and crashed into the Mediterranean with 66 people aboard. Egypt’s civil aviation minister acknowledged that the cause might be terrorism. That was in a sharp contrast to Egypt’s reticence last October, when a Russian airliner went down over the Sinai Peninsula, killing all 224 people on board. _____ 2. Our latest New York   News poll shows that, despite Bernie Sanders’s fervent efforts to siphon support from Hillary Clinton, most Democratic voters think she will be able to unite the party. And most Republican voters believe their party leaders should support Donald Trump even if they disagree with him. Both candidates face major resistance from key voting blocs. Mrs. Clinton would win in a   with Mr. Trump, if it were held now, 47 percent to 41 percent. But Mr. Sanders would beat Mr. Trump  . _____ 3. “Unless you suspend the Constitution and instruct the police to behave as if we live in North Korea, it ain’t happening. ” That was a former secretary of Homeland Security, speaking of Mr. Trump’s promise to deport 11 million immigrants. Experts who have closely examined some of his pledges warn of astronomical costs and violations of basic rules of science, engineering and law. _____ 4. Federal prosecutors believe they know the secret of at least some of the financial success of William Walters, the high roller considered one of the best sports gamblers in the country: insider trading. They accused him of receiving   from Thomas Davis, the former chairman of the huge milk processor Dean Foods, who was also charged. _____ 5. Care for a little virtual space travel? The Times used data from NASA’s recent flyby of Pluto in a joint project with the Lunar and Planetary Institute and the Universities Space Research Association to build a detailed virtual planetary visit. Download our NYT VR app, and enjoy a pretty amazing show. _____ 6. Morley Safer, the genial fixture on CBS’s “60 Minutes” for more than five decades, died. He was 84 and had retired just last week. As a war correspondent in his youth, he was one of the few U. S. reporters covering Vietnam who broke away from scripted press briefings and brought battles  —   and official contradictions  —   into Americans’ living rooms. _____ 7. As it happens, some Vietnamese are so nervous about Chinese expansionism that they are lobbying for U. S. forces to return to their   base at Cam Ranh Bay. President Obama arrives in Vietnam on Sunday, and a return may be part of talks over a deal to allow the country to buy lethal arms. _____ 8. And a Vietnam veteran, Herbert Donahue, helped inspire   law students to join him in trying to win clemency for U. S. service members convicted of killing Iraqi and Afghan civilians. One of the students said he had come to understand “how confusing things were on the ground in Iraq, how arbitrary the brutality was. ” A surge of bombings there over the last week killed more than 200 people. _____ 9. A storied golf club in Scotland was dropped as an official site of the British Open after voting narrowly to continue to exclude women as members. A significant majority of the Muirfield Golf Club’s members wanted to open the doors, but the measure fell 35 votes short of the required   majority. _____ 10. One of our   stories today is about a new trend in weddings. Or rather, in breaking them off. Where jitters were once focused on doubts about one’s partner, young people now appear to be discovering   disquiet about the institution of marriage itself. “A pending marriage brings up issues of personal identity,” explained a psychotherapist with a premarital coaching practice. _____ 11.

9673,THE VISION THING 16    : Information," The Vision Thing
By Paul Edwards
That this election is an abysmal disgrace is nationally acknowledged; that it is absolutely unique is not, although its undeniable. Never before has virtually the entire mainstream media avidly, emphatically endorsed one Presidential candidate while furiously, contemptuously vilifying the other. Never has a sitting President joined in general denunciation of a candidate. With ten days to go its affirmed by most key sources that Donald Trump cant win and Hillary Clinton will. Many pundits predict a landslide for her. Assume it. What then? The most hated President-elect ever will not be loved by the Congress she will confront. Even with a majority in the Senate--just possible--and in the House--not--prospects for a legislative agenda, should she have one, are non-existent. What Obamas phony charm failed to achieve, Hillarys lack of it will scarcely obtain. This presages four more years of stasis and nullity, of social and economic rot, financial chicanery, and national decay. As regards the composition of the Supreme Court--the panicky Liberal pitch for being with her--unless she nominates hidebound conservatives, which is probable, not a single selection will be confirmed during her term. So... paralysis in Congress, reaction in the Court; two limbs of government neutralized, gives us rule by a disliked, distrusted figurehead with the full power of Wall Street and the Imperial War-loving Establishment behind her. What then will be accomplished? First, the interests of The Empire will be promoted at least as robustly as in Obamas eight years of sycophancy. Including his Rube Goldbergian Obamacare, still foundering and gouging, nothing of any benefit to Americans was achieved under this charlatan who perfected the skill of describing an airplane crash as a triumph of gravity. So what will she do in office? Well, start with what she wont do. She wont make any effort to restrain The Big Casino, the Gold Sacks Mafia. They made her an offer she couldnt refuse. She wont attempt any closing of the inequality gap. That would entail clipping her base--Our Crowd of the Hamptons, Palm Beach and Beverly Hills. She wont meddle with Sick Care--fool me once...--or, corporate tax enforcement. Her Big Donors dont want to pay them and why should they, right? She can just let Labor die of its own raging leukemia. College grads have to stay in their parents basements and service their college debt via Macdonalds because Arbeit Macht Frei. No need to do anything about Global Warming so long as you denounce it boldly at international meetings. Best leave the environment in the hands of those who can turn idle nature into money. Besides, the solution to pollution is dilution and clearcuts grow back in a millenium or so. On the minor agenda, she knows there are still small poor countries who require our R2P and cluster bombs. Others have resources that, with the odd military coup or assassination, should come on line nicely. Africa, say, has low-hanging fruit, and the Latin American mess needs our firm hand to prevent Lefty dictators diverting perfectly good profits to their own societies. Turning to the major crises, Exceptionalism requires that they be made far bigger. Our Defense Industries cant be expected to muck along forever on paltry brushfire wars: Iraq, Afghanistan--though in fairness theyve profuced steady income streams--and Libya, no bonanza, and Syria, which Putins diabolical meddling prevented blossoming as we hoped. Still, theres no earthly reason we cant achieve a profitable Third World War simply by refusing to take the bait of Satanic Putins wimpy peace offers and calling them what they really are: a mortal threat to our Capitalist System. So much for her first Hundred Days. Beyond the panicked cheerleading of the Imperial Elite--those that the late, great George Carlin referred to as your owners--and their failing organs of crowd manipulation, and beyond the day Clinton takes office if their hopes are consummated, America faces a cataclysmic crisis of governance; one of the order of magnitude of the secession of The South under Lincoln. Clinton and Trump are the physical, mental and emotional symptoms of that crisis. Our dead system must, and will, have catharsis. Which of them precipitates it may not greatly matter. Or it may mean everything. As Brutus said at Philippi: Oh, that a man might know the end of this days business ere it come; but it sufficeth that the day will end and then the end is known.

9674,"Crowds Are Out, Crates Are In as Louvre Takes Flood Precautions - The New York Times","PARIS  —   The square at the center of the Louvre, dominated by I. M. Pei’s glass pyramid, was desolate early Friday morning, save for a few tourists taking selfies. The museum was closed to visitors, as Paris experienced its worst flooding since 1982  —   but inside, staff members and volunteers had worked around the clock to remove artworks from the threat of the rising waters of the Seine River. I was part of a small group of journalists whom the French culture minister, Audrey Azoulay the museum’s president,   Martinez and other officials took on a tour of the strangely vacant museum on Friday afternoon. (Broadcast journalists were given priority we scribblers tagged behind, straining to hear what was said.) We were led through the Denon Wing, home of the “Mona Lisa” and usually the most crowded of the museum’s three wings. Rooms packed with Renaissance and Baroque Italian masterpieces were ghostly. The “Winged Victory of Samothrace” was bereft of its usual admirers. Inside the galleries containing Greek and Roman antiquities, the situation was more chaotic. Near the    “Venus de Milo,” storage boxes were piled atop one another. Boxes completely encircled some sculptures, like one of a crouching Aphrodite from the third century B. C. At the other end of the room, the goddess of wisdom, Athena, kept an eye on the metal drawers stacked to her side. The Hellenistic gallery had become just another storage room for treasures from elsewhere in the Louvre. Some 150, 000 artworks in storage rooms, and an additional 7, 000 pieces in galleries, were deemed vulnerable to flooding, and many of them were moved to higher floors starting on Thursday evening. Museum officials activated a   plan established in 2002. The plan includes, among other things, an inventory of all works that would need to be transferred to upper floors of the museum and plans to slow the spread of any water entering the museum. Although the Seine was expected to crest by Friday evening at around 20 feet, and no water had entered the museum thus far, officials were taking no chances. The works that were in storage were the easiest to handle. “It took us less time than we thought, because the artwork was already in containment boxes, so we just had to move them from one floor to an upper one,” said Adel Ziane, the museum’s deputy director of communications. The most painstaking work involved the removal of works from display cases. Yannick Lintz, the head curator of Islamic art at the Louvre, posted to Twitter images of the display cases, emptied after a long night of work, and of the plastic storage crates where the objects were wrapped and packaged. In some galleries, it looked as though a family was about to move in  —   or out. Boxes were subdivided by foam boards, creating spaces for vases and other precious objects. A seemingly abandoned ancient frieze sat on a wooden pallet on the floor of one gallery, half wrapped in plastic sheets. “For the artwork which was exhibited and not in storage, like for the department of Islamic art, we had to move the pieces from their window displays,” Mr. Ziane said. “We have a team of   managers who take care of handling the artwork, and a team of curators who watch over everything. ” For all its complexity, it was nothing like   when the museum was stripped of its masterpieces ahead of the German invasion of France in 1940. “Walls of Louvre Blankly Stare While Treasures Rest in Vaults,” a headline in the European edition of The New York Herald Tribune declared. The museum was partly reopened during the German occupation, but without its top masterpieces, which were hidden in secret locations across France. (Nazi officials eventually discovered the location of most of them, but decided to leave them in place.) The 2002   plan, for all its detail, does not prioritize among works of art. How, in a palace of treasures, can one select the very best? “It is difficult to say which one is more valuable,” Mr. Ziane said. “They are all priceless, and we decided the evacuation according to their risk of exposure. ” Besides Islamic art, the staff also moved works from Coptic displays and most of the Greek, Etruscan and Roman antiquities in storage. Mr. Martinez, the museum’s president, said it was difficult to estimate the total number of works moved, but he said it amounted to “thousands and thousands. ” Officials were monitoring the levels of the Seine constantly, he said, to see if they needed to move even more works. “The situation is changing hour per hour  —   it is still difficult to know when we are going to reopen,” he said. Earlier this year, the museum did a training exercise, simulating a flood situation, involving in the Islamic art department. That helped the process this week move more smoothly. But in the long run, the Louvre plans to move more artworks that are not on display to another location. By 2019, it intends to store nearly all those works in the regional branch of the Louvre in Lens, about 125 miles north of Paris. Tourism is a big driver of the French economy, and Ms. Azoulay, who became culture minister in February, took pains to emphasize that things were under control. ”For now, the artworks of the Louvre are not in danger,” she said. “We have anticipated the situation and the emergency plan worked quite well. ” Other institutions, however, were less fortunate, particularly those in the Loire Valley. The Musée Girodet in Montargis, devoted to the work of the Romantic painter   Girodet, was heavily damaged. In the Loire Valley, bridges sustained damage and antique furniture was destroyed at the   Château de la    which only recently reopened after a renovation. About 25 miles away, the Château de Chambord, a Unesco World Heritage site, was heavily damaged. And the gardens of the Château de    about 130 miles southwest of Paris, were completely submerged. “It is such a waste, because we had just finished two years of restoration work,” said Philippe Bélaval, the president of the National Monuments Center of France.",0
9675,Beijing’s Intervention in Hong Kong Election Could Face a Hurdle: Local Courts - The New York Times,"HONG KONG  —   There were no banners. No raised fists. As night fell on Tuesday, more than a thousand protesters dressed in black held a silent march through the central business area of Hong Kong. They took care not to jaywalk. Then they quietly dispersed into the night. Collectively, the participants in the march had more power than most demonstrators. They were Hong Kong lawyers, angered by China’s  move on Monday to effectively rewrite a clause in Hong Kong’s charter in order to prevent two young   politicians from taking office as legislators. As a group, Hong Kong’s lawyers say Beijing’s decision to step into a legal case in this city has dealt a blow to its judiciary, famed for its fairness and independence and central to Hong Kong’s success as a global financial hub. The local bar association called the decision, announced by China’s Parliament, “unnecessary and inappropriate” and damaging to the concept of “one country, two systems” that has allowed this former British colony to maintain considerable autonomy from the mainland since the 1997 handover of sovereignty. But many practicing lawyers and legal scholars here also say that Hong Kong’s judiciary will have to implement the decision, and in doing so will apply legal standards evolved over centuries of precedent  —   common law  —   that may soften or perhaps even stymie Beijing’s will. “We have to show the world that this is not the accepted norm,” said Dennis Kwok, a lawyer and organizer of the march who also serves on Hong Kong’s   Legislative Council. “It does damage to ‘one country, two systems’ but at the same time we do have faith in the legal system. ” It is a phenomenon that China may not have foreseen: the artful implementation of a Communist legal diktat in a delicate,   system where judges wear wigs, are often educated in England and are trained to make rulings that protect civil liberties. China’s government, accustomed to law being a mere appendage of state power, may be in for an unpleasant surprise. “I don’t think we should underestimate the power or resilience of the common law to protect the autonomy and rights of the Hong Kong people,” Cora Chan, an associate professor who focuses on constitutional law at the University of Hong Kong, said in an interview. “The irony here is Hong Kong courts, being common law courts, would be using common law techniques to interpret an interpretation handed down from a Leninist legal system,” Professor Chan said. Beijing’s interpretation, issued on Monday by a committee in the National People’s Congress, specifies that office holders in Hong Kong have to “sincerely and solemnly” take loyalty oaths or be forced to vacate their posts, with no chance for a redo. The ruling came after the two young politicians, Sixtus Leung, 30, and Yau   25, inserted a derogatory term for China in their oaths. That infuriated Beijing, which bristles at any talk of separatism. The interpretation of an article in the territory’s governing Basic Law was   to compel Hong Kong courts and its Legislature to force the duo to vacate their office, and no lawyer interviewed expected the courts to come to their rescue. But Eric Cheung, who teaches law at the University of Hong Kong, said it was possible that the Hong Kong court that is adjudicating their case could rule that Beijing’s interpretation was not retroactive. That may give the duo a chance to retake their oaths, though he said it would take a brave judge to make a ruling that could invite a new, even more specific, interpretation from Beijing. The Chinese interpretation was also aimed at preventing people who back Hong Kong’s independence from running for office. In July, Hong Kong’s government introduced a new loyalty pledge, requiring that candidates sign a document acknowledging that the city is an “inalienable part” of China. Several candidates were disqualified and went to court that case has not yet been decided. A judge could make a narrow ruling that Beijing’s interpretation applies only to taking oaths, which candidates, as opposed to officeholders, do not have to do. “If the Chinese government’s ultimate aim is to keep separatists out of the Legislature, then this interpretation is not going to be able to do that,” said Simon Young, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong. Several lawyers pointed out that Beijing’s ruling was novel because it effectively amended the Basic Law, which serves as Hong Kong’s Constitution. “If you look at it closely, it is more like an amendment, or an addition,” said Peter Chiu, who participated in Tuesday’s march. That is problematic, because amendments to the Basic Law must be approved by the entire National People’s Congress, which meets once a year, in March. That raises the possibility, however remote, that Hong Kong’s highest court, the Court of Final Appeal, may rule that Beijing’s interpretation, which has not been approved by the entire National People’s Congress, is an amendment and not enforceable, Professor Chan said. That is the nuclear option. In 1999, the Court of Final Appeal found that it had the power to declare “invalid” acts by the Chinese Parliament or its standing committee that violated the Basic Law, Professor Chan said. That kind of weapon  —   “hard legal controls,” in her words  —   is most effective when it is not used. “Simply claiming that courts in Hong Kong have those powers might well give an incentive to China to exercise restraint in issuing decisions or interpretations on Hong Kong,” she said.",0

9677,Comment on 6 Things Indian Guys Have To Understand When Learning Game by Game Is A Modern Rite Of Passage That Helps Turn Boys Into Men,"Home This Month Popular 6 Things Indian Guys Have To Understand When Learning Game 6 Things Indian Guys Have To Understand When Learning Game February 3, 2013 164 Comments Culture 
As a guy of Indian ethnicity there are some obstacles you have to overcome in order to have a balanced game. Circumstances can dictate what these are but following my last post a red pill infused Indian pal of mine and myself had a conversation about what these obstacles are: 1. Let go of limiting beliefs about being an Indian in the Western world 
What do I mean by “limiting beliefs”? There is a particular mindset among Indian guys that they can only get with Indian girls. You must let go of these fears dictating that your ethnicity holds you back in what you can do. Being Indian does not mean you have to work in IT, accounting, business, construction or own a corner shop as in the same way it does not mean you have to date Indian girls. 2. Let go of your mummy’s sari 
It’s something I’ve noticed among the large Indian community here in London: there are a large number of mummy’s boys, men who are afraid to stand up to their mothers and what they want themselves. No one wants to disrespect their parents but also at the same time standing up for what you want should be your primary objective. Many a man will ‘settle’ with their girlfriends due to pressure from their mothers. As one acquaintance said, he preempted conflict by just doing what his mother wanted, even though he does not love the girl he married. 3. Let go and expand beyond your Indian comfort zone 
Your extended family plays a large part of your life (not a bad thing), but a lot of guys also have their friends circle exclusively Indian. Expand your knowledge, gain new friends, travel, and learn new languages. It’s a difficult transition to move from becoming over reliant on this little setup to independence from all influence, but it can be done and it will benefit your internal well being. The thing to remember is you are the average of the five people you spend most of your time with. It is highly likely none of your existing five friends will agree with your path into game. They will tell what is ‘best for you’ but in essence this is them subconsciously pulling you back down to their value as you increase your own. 4. Stop putting white women on a pedestal 
White women are easy, white women are fun, white women are flirts, white women are great at sex or white women are sluts. Whatever white women are, as an Indian guy you must stop putting them on a pedestal for being all these sexually related things that you think Indian girls are not. There is no magical things that white women do that others do not. Besides, there is not a certain place in the world where white women will see you and jump on your cock as there is not a certain Bollywood film that will make a white woman gush all wet and demand you ravage her Aryan style. White woman pedestalization can be categorized as an inferiority complex displayed by Indian men. Stop thinking you’re inferior to any woman regardless of her ethnic/racial origins. 5. Understand that Indian girls are not different and are not more chaste 
Being constantly around these Indian girls at family gatherings, community events and religious events makes you programmed into believing that you will marry one for certain because of their chaste and low promiscuity. A strong belief that Indian girls don’t ride the cock carousel is blind faith because they do. In fact, all women in the western world do regardless of culture and their strong family traditional values. They are women, they get pussy tingles to the same game as white, black, Asian, orange, maroon and kiwi women. They have the same subconscious processes as all women that help them place a value on a man and inevitable slamming and spunk gobbling if he passes with flying colors. In a Western society these girls have the same external pressures and influences that appeal to their inner slut as much as any other woman. Your objective as a man is not to fall into the line of romantic thinking that they are different. 6. Do not be afraid of The Man 
There’s a man, a dominant man, somewhere in your family. He dictates, he dominates, and he makes the decisions. You have a fear of causing him displeasure. You do as he says as he’s done the leading since your father emptied his ball sack into your mother. Stop. As much as a lot of Indian men have pressures from being mummy’s little lad, there’s plenty of them that disintegrate under the pressure of their fathers or uncles. Avoiding conflict is prevalent in your attitude, you do as you are told even though your mind is telling you this is not in your interest and possibly not in the wider interests of those close to you but you do it, as Uncle or Dad has told you to. 
No one is telling you to fight, but start slowly, speak out, say what you think is best for you, get out of your shell and decide how you will live your life, not how Dad thinks you should live your life. You might be scared of the conflict and dissuade yourself from it but trust me when you finally grow some balls and exude some confidence and ability in yourself, these men will respect you, see you as equal, and place trust in your decisions. 
This list could also apply to other cultures who follow similar dynamics to Indian culture, but don’t stop at the above and think that’s all you have to do—you still have to hit the ground running and approach just like any other guy learning game.",0
9678,"‘Keep an Eye on Him,’ Ahmad Khan Rahami’s Father Says He Told F.B.I. - The New York Times","The father of the man accused of carrying out bombings last weekend in New York and New Jersey said that, two years ago, he warned federal agents explicitly about his son’s interest in terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda and his fascination with jihadist music, poetry and videos. In a series of interviews with The New York Times on Wednesday and Thursday, Mohammad Rahami, whose son Ahmad Khan Rahami has been charged with using weapons of mass destruction and bombing a place of public use, recounted his interactions with the Federal Bureau of Investigation after he raised his concerns about his son. While Mr. Rahami has spoken briefly about his contact with the F. B. I. the interviews this week provided his most detailed public account so far. His description of that contact differs starkly from the one given by law enforcement officials, who on Thursday challenged the father’s account, saying he did not provide the F. B. I. with many of the details about his son that he now says he did. Mr. Rahami’s contact with the authorities began in August 2014, when the local police in Elizabeth, N. J. responded to the family’s home after a domestic dispute in which Ahmad stabbed his brother, according to court records. Law enforcement officials familiar with the case who would discuss it only on the condition of anonymity said that Mr. Rahami called his son a “terrorist” when talking to local police, which led to the F. B. I. ’s involvement. Mr. Rahami said that during the course of the investigation he told agents from the bureau everything he knew about his son’s activities. “I told the F. B. I. to keep an eye on him,” he said. “They said, ‘Is he a terrorist?’ I said: ‘I don’t know. I can’t guarantee you 100 percent if he is a terrorist. I don’t know which groups he is in. I can’t tell you. ’” But he said he had laid out his concerns, specifically related to what he described as his son’s emerging infatuation with Islamic extremism. “The way he speaks, his videos, when I see these things that he listens to, for example, Al Qaeda, Taliban, he watches their videos, their poetry,” he said he told the federal agents. In the interviews, the elder Mr. Rahami spoke about his son’s admiration of Anwar   who was once Al Qaeda’s leading propagandist and is popular with followers of the Islamic State, and also recalled that his son watched Mr. Awlaki’s videos. The F. B. I. in a statement earlier this week, said it had conducted an assessment of Ahmad Rahami that included interviews with his father, a review of bureau databases and public records, and checks with other agencies. The assessment did not turn up anything that warranted further inquiry, and the matter was closed, the agency said. A senior law enforcement official familiar with the assessment said that “During its assessment on Ahmad Rahami, the F. B. I. initiated contact with his father, who had expressed concern over his son’s internet use as well as some of his associates. Ahmad Rahami’s travel revealed no information that tied him to terrorism” “At no time,” the official said, “did the father advise interviewing agents of any radicalization or alleged links to Al Qaeda, the Taliban or their propaganda. Furthermore, database and interagency checks, to include reviews of Ahmad Rahami’s travel, revealed no information that tied him to terrorism. ” When agents first interviewed the elder Mr. Rahami on Aug. 26, they asked him about his comments to the local police, according to some of the officials. The father told them that he was referring to gangsters and criminals, not terrorists, the officials said. But Mr. Rahami’s father told the F. B. I. that he had walked by his son’s room and observed him watching a YouTube video of explosions, the officials said. It was unclear what kind of explosions were in the video. On Sept. 12, 2014, the F. B. I. returned and told the father that his son had been cleared of any connection to terrorism, and on Sept. 19, the review was formally closed. The father said he was not surprised by the F. B. I. ’s findings. He repeated that his son was not a terrorist but had been hanging out with “bad people,” officials said. When told on Thursday that law enforcement officials contradicted his version of events, he said, “It’s a lie,” and that he stood by his account. Law enforcement officials said that investigators did not interview Ahmad Rahami because he was in jail when the F. B. I. was conducting its review. If he was represented by a lawyer, agents would have had to request an interview through the lawyer. It is unknown whether such a request was made, and it is far from certain that a lawyer would have agreed. By the time Ahmad Rahami was released from jail, the F. B. I. had concluded its review. “They didn’t do their job,” his father said in one of the interviews with The Times, which were conducted in his native language, Pashto. John Miller, deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism for the New York Police Department, outlined the challenges facing agents as they investigate such cases  —   especially given the number of people they look into and the threshold that must be met to take action. “If you have that many contacts with that many people over that period of time, it’s increasingly likely that the next time something happens, it’s going to involve somebody that you knew, heard about, investigated, bumped or otherwise checked out,” Mr. Miller said on Wednesday at a congressional hearing about the bombings. “Now, that’s a good thing in that, when you’re assessing who to look at first and they come up in those records, it gives you a basis to go forward. It’s also a liability in that people have somewhat of a misconception about our ability to put someone under surveillance, leave them there indefinitely. ” The F. B. I. ’s assessment of Ahmad Rahami was the second time he had to the attention of the federal authorities. Five months earlier, in March 2014, when he returned from a nearly yearlong trip to Pakistan, Mr. Rahami was flagged by customs officials, who pulled him aside for a secondary screening. Still concerned about his travel, officials notified the National Targeting Center, a federal agency that assesses potential threats, two law enforcement officials said. That report was reviewed by the F. B. I. when it conducted its assessment of Mr. Rahami in August. It is not known how much detail the report contained about Mr. Rahami’s activity while he was overseas. Investigators are focused on the time that he spent abroad and are looking into whether he received any training in   and whether he is connected to any wider terrorist network. “His travels give us these two distinct choices, both of which are bad,” said a senior counterterrorism official, explaining that a trip that Mr. Rahami took to Turkey raised the possibility that he crossed the border to Syria and met there with operatives from the Islamic State, while his travel to Pakistan raises the possibility that he had contact with Al Qaeda. The official said that some investigators involved in the case believe that the variety of explosive devices Mr. Rahami is suspected of constructing suggested that he did have some   training beyond reading instruction manuals online. Mr. Rahami is accused of building 10 bombs. One exploded in Lower Manhattan, injuring 31 people another exploded in Seaside Park, N. J. but no one was injured. Five were discovered on Sunday night outside a train station in Elizabeth, N. J. “Most guys who go on the internet make one type of bomb,” the official said. “Here’s a guy who did two types of pressure cooker bombs and two different kinds of pipe bombs,” he added. “It suggests to us that he didn’t just look up ‘Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom,’” the official said, referring to an instruction manual published in the Al Qaeda online magazine Inspire, “but that he might have been somewhere and learned to make this stuff. ” A notebook recovered from Mr. Rahami after he was shot and taken into custody by the police in New Jersey suggests that he took much of his inspiration from the Islamic State and one of their founders, Abu Muhammad    —   who recently called on Muslims around the world to spill the blood of Westerners and nonbelievers wherever they found them. Mr. Adnani was killed in an American drone strike in August. While much of the writing in the journal is illegible because the book was punctured by a bullet and splattered with blood, what can be read indicates that Mr. Rahami may himself have been frustrated in his attempts to reach Syria and was using that as justification for committing terror at home. One page has the word “blocked,” followed by: “You should have let us meet death overseas. ” Investigators have not been able to interview Mr. Rahami since his arrest because he remains “incapacitated and intubated,” according to Paul J. Fishman, the United States attorney for New Jersey. “As such, he is not in sufficient physical health for presentment to the Court  —   even at a bedside proceeding,” Mr. Fishman wrote in a letter filed in federal court on Thursday. Investigators hope to learn more about Mr. Rahami’s life and travels from his wife, Asia, who one of the law enforcement officials said was now back in the United States after being detained in the Middle East while traveling from Afghanistan. Another senior law enforcement official said the F. B. I. did not believe she had knowledge of the plot. The officials said she had bought tickets for her trip well before the bombings. Mr. Rahami’s father said he had been worried for some time about the direction his son was heading, well before he spoke to federal agents and well before his son’s domestic dispute. He described his son’s internet activities as “a disease,” akin to an addiction. After the 2014 dispute, he said, he visited his son in jail. Ahmad Rahami asked his father for forgiveness, but he said he would not forgive his son until he was sure that Ahmad was not a terrorist and that the F. B. I. had cleared him. “The F. B. I. came back to me and said he’s clean,” Mohammad Rahami said. “They didn’t find anything on him. But they didn’t interview him. ” “I still had my doubts,” he said. “I was never 100 percent clear. ” At that point, he said, he decided not to pursue the charges stemming from the domestic dispute. Court records show that a grand jury declined to indict Ahmad Rahami on the charges. The father said he believed he did his duty by sharing his concerns with law enforcement. “What was required of me, I did,” he said. “And he’s not a kid  —   he’s 28 years old. ”",0
9679,Germany Bans Cultivation Of GM Crops Under EU Opt-Out Law,"The Netherlands Poland Germany's GM ban is significant considering that biotech industry representatives have been trying to keep their stranglehold on the genetically modified crop market in the country. The news will likely not be taken well by DuPont Pioneer and Dow Chemical, who have been waiting for an EU executive permit for GMO cultivation in Germany and other EU countries for nearly 15 years. Likewise, Monsanto has criticized other member states for using their ‘opt-out’ vote to ban GMOs from their countries, stating that their decisions “contradict science.” It was just over six years ago that another EU country, Hungary, strongly enforced their GM ban by destroying 1,000 acres of GM maize that had been found growing illegally. The Hungarians were the very first to take a forceful position in the European Union in relation to the use of transgenic seeds. Germany's GMO ban is doubly important due to the planned merger between the Germany-based Bayer, and U.S.-based Monsanto. With ChemChina-Syngenta and DuPont-Dow Chemical forming their own multi-billion-dollar mergers, consumers and farmers still have a way to refuse genetically modified crops as they are increasingly incorporated into international treaties and trade agreements. As agricultural companies continue to consolidate , becoming larger and larger entities with greater capacity to lobby governments in their favor of monopolizing seed markets, the German opt-out sends a clear message to the makers of these seeds. They can grow bloated and powerful but in the end, the people will decide what they eat. Bill and Melinda Gates try to convince an EU country to embrace GMOs: Related:",0
9680,Alert on Russian border over alleged “Cyber Attacks” and “Propaganda”,"VIDEOS Alert on Russian border over alleged “Cyber Attacks” and “Propaganda” NATO is placing 300,000 troops on high alert near Russia's border who will be ready for deployment within two months By Whitney Webb - November 9, 2016 While the attention of the US public is decidedly focused upon the outcome of today’s presidential election, US-controlled NATO has announced an unprecedented escalating of its aggressive encirclement of Russia with military assets and troops. Secretary General of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement that 300,000 troops have now been placed in a state of “high alert” in order to deter Russia who, according to NATO, has been “much more active in many different ways.” This new activity includes “Russia using propaganda in Europe among NATO allies,” which Stoltenberg says is “exactly the reason why NATO is responding […] with the biggest reinforcement of our collective defense since the end of the Cold War.” Adam Thomson, an outgoing representative to NATO, has estimated that the new 300,000 troops would be capable of deploying within 180 days, adding that speeding up the speed of deployment is of great importance. Though “propaganda” was cited as the main reason for the latest NATO build-up against Russia, the measures also come on the heels of Russia’s alleged involvement in “cyber attacks” on the US, despite no concrete evidence, as well as the nuclear war drills it has held domestically. In addition, NATO accused Moscow of deliberately provoking NATO by sending hundreds of paratroopers to a Serbian airbase, just 150 miles from where NATO forces were involved in disaster relief exercises in Montenegro. In response, Igor Sutyagin, an expert at the Royal United Services Institute for Defense and Security Studies told the UK’s Sunday Express that if “Russia wants to show that it can intimidate NATO, NATO saying to Russia, “If you show up, we’ll be there as well.” Frankly, all of these latest accusations coming from NATO are completely absurd. For one thing, the accusation that Russia was involved in “cyber attacks” or recent hacks is admittedly based on speculation by various US intelligence officials as no concrete evidence has been found to date implicating the Russians. In addition, the statement that said US Intelligence was “confident” Russia was responsible due to such speculation was authored by James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence who lied to Congress under oath regarding NSA surveillance. If Clapper lied to the Congress once, what’s to stop him from lying to the American people? Furthermore, NATO are the clear aggressors here as they have been carrying out an unprecedented build-up on Russia’s border since 2014, placing numerous troops and military hardware in close proximity to Russia as well as carrying out massive military drills. This, along with this newly announced escalation and the rise of neo-McCarthyism in the West, has convinced many, including Russians, that NATO and the West are preparing for a full-scale war against Russia. However, most ridiculous of all is that this latest NATO announcement of troop deployment was spurred by the use of so-called Russian “propaganda,” a clear attack on news outlets related to Russia such as RT and Sputnik. RT has already been feeling the heat as their UK branch had its bank accounts closed without warning. Though Russia’s supposed use of “propaganda” prompts a military response from NATO, the US and the West have suffered no consequence for its own obvious use of propaganda against Russia and its allies, including this TIME magazine cover . Propaganda was once illegal within the US, but the passage of the 2012 NDAA changed all that, meaning that the West is also definitely using propaganda. Where’s the outrage? The fact that NATO’s narrative is so blatantly one-sided should be enough proof to us all that there’s more to the story than NATO is letting on.",0
9681,Eight Pro-Second Amendment Smackdowns from NRA Annual Meetings - Breitbart,"During the   Leadership Forum, speakers ranging from President Donald Trump to Sheriff David Clarke and NRA senior VP Wayne LaPierre put smackdown after smackdown on gun controllers and their surrogates in the media. [LaPierre made clear there would be no apologies for the smackdowns. Rather, he pointed out that one of the things the American people love about the NRA is the fact that the group speaks truth.  LaPierre said: For the last quarter of a century, in poll after poll, whether it’s Gallup or NBC or The Wall Street Journal, Americans have said they view the NRA more favorably than both chambers of congress or either national political party  …    . The majority of Americans admire and trust the NRA because we always say out loud what we believe. We speak the truth, even when it may be hard, and we fight like hell to defend it. In light of the NRA’s voice for truth, Breitbart News pulled together eight   Amendment smackdowns, along with a bonus smackdown at the end. Most of the smackdowns require no commentary. Colonel Allen West  —   West said, “Here I stand as a son of Atlanta, a native Georgian, and a board member of the oldest civil rights organization that this country has ever known: the National Rifle Association. ”  Sheriff David Clarke —  Clarke said: “We won a huge battle last November but we did not win the war. You see, our fight for freedom continues in earnest. You see, these rat bastards on the left never give up  …    for them defeat is never final, election defeats don’t matter. It’s simply a time to regroup and continue their assault on our constitution, the rule of law, liberty, and American exceptionalism. ” Chris Cox  —   Cox recounted a conversation he had with President Trump after the inauguration, saying, “[It got so] ridiculous that the media, they were even lying about the number of people who watched [[President Trump’s] inauguration. I told him that the only number that mattered was the number of people that watched Hillary Clinton’s inauguration —  ZERO!” Senator Ted Cruz  —   Cruz said, “When the election results came in we heard a piercing wail of agony, as mainstream media reporters shrieked in horror because the American people had risen up and defied Washington, defied the mainstream media, defied pundits, and said, ‘We will defend our constitution and we will defend our freedom. ’” Wayne LaPierre  —   After listing the mainstream media’s failure to report the truth regarding the devious goals of Democrats and gun control groups around the country, LaPierre asked, “When did the media stop being journalists and start becoming PR flacks for the destruction our country?” President Donald Trump  —   After recounting the way he ran and won on the Second Amendment with the NRA’s endorsement, President Trump laughingly told the thousands of attendees at the Leadership Forum to be ready to be wooed by Democrats, “I have a feeling that in the next election you’ll be swamped with candidates, but you’re not going to be wasting your time. You’ll have plenty of those Democrats coming over and you’ll say, ‘No Thanks’ or ‘No Sir’ —  ‘No Ma’am’ perhaps ‘Ma’am’ —  it may be Pocahontas, remember that. ” Amid applause Trump said, “You came through for me and I am going to come through for you. ” Chris Cox —  Cox stressed that while Trump’s election changed everything for   gun owners, it changed nothing for the media and Hollywood, And he made clear it didn’t change gun controllers’ determination either, saying, “Michael Bloomberg, he’s still short, rich, and angry. ” Colonel Allen West  —   “The oldest civil right, the oldest individual right, the thing that enables us to be this great independent country, is that we will not become subjects, we will not let anyone take away our guns we will not allow anyone to subjugate us under a tyrannical rule. ” BONUS SMACKDOWN  —   LaPierre said, “Bernie Sanders was not ‘a movement,’ as fawning media called his campaign. Bernie is a political predator of young voters who were lied to by school teachers and college professors” —  LaPierre said young voters were told “free, free, free, for me,” but “no one told the truth about how all that stuff was going to be paid for. ” Nevertheless, LaPierre made clear that the media was in on the play because socialism would have aided in the goal of disarming and enslaving the American people.

9682,Dying CIA Agent Confirms the White House’s Upcoming Alien Life Disclosure [INTERVIEW],"The deathbed confession of a former CIA operative once again confirms that aliens are a real presence on our planet, raising our hopes that 2016 will forever go down as the Disclosure Year. The former agent, who has chosen to maintain his anonymity, said that he was first introduced to the extraterrestrial quandary in the late 1950s.
“I was coming into the Army fresh off the farm, so I really didn’t have much knowledge of anything, so my boss filled me in on Project Blue Book and what they had found so far concerning Greys and aliens and the Roswell incident.” 
The secrecy of his mission was of the utmost importance, so the ex-CIA agent was forbidden from disclosing any details pertaining to his line of work, not even to his family. He claimed he was coerced into vowing he would not speak of this subject for a period of 50 years. That time interval ended in 2010, prompting the aging man to spill the beans. What he reveals is a complex mass of cover-ups leading all the way up to the highest governmental positions.
On one occasion, he recalls his superior being instructed by president Eisenhower to fly over to Area 51, find whoever was in charge and demand that he reported to Washington. The activity over there was so anomalous that even the chief of state was in the dark.
The information revealed by the former agent is on par with Bob Lazar’s disclosure of the S4 facility and the activities that took place at the base.
“They had different garage door openings and in these openings they had different saucer crafts. The very first one had the Roswell craft in. It was kind of crashed up but apparently every alien that was in it died except for a couple.” 
He describes the Roswell craft as a “really strange” UFO that looked like it was made up of “really heavy aluminum foil.” It only weighed around 150 to 300 pounds and the propulsion system was most likely antigravitic.
During the same visit, the CIA operatives witnessed a film showcasing the autopsy of one of the crash victims. But there were also live aliens being kept at S4 and his supervisor was allowed to participate in the interviewing of one such creature.
The agent described the alien as looking ‘oriental’, with a small body, a disproportionately-large head, large eyes and with small slits instead of ears.

There’s no way the CIA agents confused the UFOs they saw with whatever secret aircraft was being developed at that time. Following their visit to the S4 facility, the CIA agents also traveled to Area 51, located several miles north. There they saw the U2 spy plane, which of course, they didn’t know existed, but it was more than obvious that this was man-made while the other crafts clearly weren’t.
Afterwards, the CIA agent and his superior officer flew back to Washington, where they debriefed President Eisenhower on the situation. Richard Nixon and J. Edgar Hoover were also present.
“He [Eisenhower] was totally shocked. He appeared for the first time to be worried.”
The former agent’s admissions came at a cost, though. A short while after speaking with UFO investigator Linda Moulton Howe, he was apprehended by the Men in Black.
“I was going to a grocery store when two guys in black suits came out of a black Lincoln Town Car and came over to see me. They told me that I’d better not publish anything or talk to Linda about any more things.” 
They succeeded in intimidating him. But that was before the interview below took place. As an old man whose time is almost up, the former CIA operative felt he should ignore their warning and disclose what he knew.

“I feel much better having talked about it,” he told Richard Dolan. “I kind of feel like there’s a load off my shoulders because I have an awful lot of secrets I’ve kept over the years.”
More than 50 years have passed since the events described by the CIA agent took place. Nowadays, more and more people believe we’re on the brink of disclosure. Some even speculate that President Obama will take up this mission before leaving the White House or by the end of the year.
That is also the opinion of U.S. lobbyist Steve Bassett, director of the Paradigm Research Group and the only official UFO disclosure lobbyist in the United States. He is convinced the White House has known about the existence of extraterrestrials for several decades now. It’s about time the rest of the world knew.
“ET is real, we have got beyond that,” Bassett said. “We are going to get disclosure this year. I am not sure who will win the election, but I think Obama will be the disclosure president. He will be looking at a Nobel Prize for making an announcement like that. I am 85 per cent sur Obama will make the announcement before he leaves office and within days the [United Kingdom’s] Prime Minister will follow. I am trying to force Obama to make the disclosure. I think we are going to get there,” he added.
Lately, there’s been much talk of disclosure.
Leaked e-mails between former chief of staff John Podesta and astronaut Edgar Mitchell show that the two were planning to arrange a meeting with Obama to discuss releasing the truth from custody .
“Five decades of UFO information have dramatically shifted the public awareness of an extraterrestrial presence,” Mitchell wrote. “And yet, our government is still operating from outdated beliefs and policies. These are detrimental to trust in government transparency, science, religion and responsible citizenry embracing the next step in our country’s space travel and research.”
The former astronaut was one of the biggest proponents of alien life and his death in February of 2016 was a blow for the pro-disclosure community. But it looks like we might have a chance at winning this.
In an interview with CNN, Podesta let the world know that it’s high time the government “released any evidence” of alien life.

“The U.S. government could do a much better job in answering the quite legitimate questions that people have about what’s going on with unidentified aerial phenomena.”
Heck, even the Vatican’s on board with disclosure . Huh, who would’ve thought it possible?
In 2015, Father Jose Funes, the Pope’s chief astronomer said that the Vatican believed life on other planets is not only possible, but highly likely. Furthermore, he stated that the existence of aliens does not contradict the Bible or the Christian belief system.
“The Bible is not a scientific book,” Funes said. “If we look for scientific responses to our questions in the Bible, we are making a mistake. It answers great questions like ‘what is our role in the Universe?’”
Still don’t believe in the upcoming disclosure? Good, that means you’re prepared for anything.

9683,"Comment on If Clinton Goes Down, Loretta Lynch Will Go Down With Her by Truth Detector","Posted on October 31, 2016 by Daisy Luther 
Oh, Loretta. 
I’ll bet that AG Loretta Lynch is shaking in her boots right now, because when Hillary Clinton goes down, Lynch’s career will go down with her. Heck, maybe they’ll even be cellmates. 
Loretta Lynch’s ties to the Clintons go back to 1999 when then-President Bill Clinton appointed her to run the Brooklyn US Attorney’s office. She left in 2002 and went into private practice, but returned to the Brooklyn office in 2010 at the behest of President Barack Obama. ( Here’s her official bio. ) 
In 2015, she was sworn in to become the 83rd Attorney General of the United States, taking the place of the blatantly corrupt Attorney General, Eric Holder , who will probably be most famous for his roles in the Fast and Furious operation, inciting racial tensions, and his mishandling of the Lois Lerner/IRS debacle. First, there was the secret airplane meeting with Bill Clinton 
It all started to publicly go downhill for Lynch during the first investigation into Hillary Clinton’s carelessness with national secrets via her home email server . Right before FBI Director James Comey was to meet with Hillary Clinton to interrogate her about the subject, Lynch was busted having a secret meeting with Bill Clinton . The Washington Post reported: 
Clinton’s private, unplanned meeting with Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch at the Phoenix airport last week, coming at a time when the Justice Department should be nearing completion of its examination of Hillary Clinton’s use of a private server for her emails as secretary of state, will inevitably — and negatively — affect public attitudes about that investigation… 
…Lynch has tried to make amends, though not without leaving some confusion in her wake. In a conversation Friday with Washington Post editorial writer Jonathan Capehart at the Aspen Ideas Festival, she insisted again that the conversation was innocent — about grandchildren and golf and such — and did not touch on the investigation of the emails. But she said she recognized that others would not see it that way. “The fact that the meeting that I had is now casting a shadow over how people are going to view that work is something that I take seriously, and deeply and painfully,” she said. 
Lynch said that she would “be accepting” whatever recommendation the career prosecutors and FBI Director James B. Comey bring her — though she did not say she would remove herself completely from the case. She also said she had made that decision some months ago but was only now making it public. 
Of course, it was all much easier for Lynch to abide by the decision when Comey miraculously found that Hillary Clinton was not criminal in her negligence with national secrets. 
Now, though, people are asking questions about that ill-founded meeting. Judicial Watch has filed a lawsuit for “all records” related to the illicit meeting between Attorney General Lynch and former President Bill Clinton . 
“On June 29, 2016, Attorney General Loretta Lynch is reported to have met privately with former President Bill Clinton on board a parked private plane at Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, Arizona. The meeting occurred during the then-ongoing investigation of Mrs. Clinton’s email server, and mere hours before the Benghazi report was released publicly involving both Mrs. Clinton and the Obama administration. Judicial Watch filed a request on June 30 that the U.S. Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General investigate that meeting.” 
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump suggested that during that meeting, Bill Clinton may have offered to extend Lynch’s position in the AG’s office during a Hillary Clinton administration. Then she blocked a congressional investigation into the notorious Iranian ransom payment. 
Last week, AG Lynch blocked a congressional investigation into the cash payments that the Obama administration made to Iran by pleading the Fifth. The Washington Free Beacon reported: 
Attorney General Loretta Lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of Congress about the Obama administration’s secret efforts to send Iran $1.7 billion in cash earlier this year, prompting accusations that Lynch has “pleaded the Fifth” Amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments, according to lawmakers and communications exclusively obtained by the Washington Free Beacon … 
…“It is frankly unacceptable that your department refuses to answer straightforward questions from the people’s elected representatives in Congress about an important national security issue,” the lawmakers wrote. “Your staff failed to address any of our questions, and instead provided a copy of public testimony and a lecture about the sensitivity of information associated with this issue.” 
“As the United States’ chief law enforcement officer, it is outrageous that you would essentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries,” they stated. “The actions of your department come at time when Iran continues to hold Americans hostage and unjustly sentence them to prison.” 
How very judicial of her. Lynch tried to shut Comey up about the new investigation into the Clinton emails. 
Now, even the mainstream media can’t turn its head. 
Earlier I wrote about the fact that FBI Director James Comey made the decision on his own to go public about the new investigation into the Hillary Clinton emails. But let’s talk a little further about Lynch’s desperate attempts to shut him up. 
The New York Times reported that the Justice Department “strongly discouraged Comey” against releasing the information: The day before the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, sent a letter to Congress announcing that new evidence had been discovered that might be related to the completed Hillary Clinton email investigation, the Justice Department strongly discouraged the step and told him that he would be breaking with longstanding policy, three law enforcement officials said on Saturday. Senior Justice Department officials did not move to stop him from sending the letter, officials said, but they did everything short of it, pointing to policies against talking about current criminal investigations or being seen as meddling in elections. 
How interesting that it’s seen as “influencing the election” to investigate someone now but it wasn’t back when she was investigated and not charged. I’m not sure exactly how that works, but according to USA Today (emphasis mine), a “…federal official familiar with Comey’s decision said Saturday that the FBI director considered the attorney general’s advice during a spirited discussion of the matter Thursday and early Friday but felt compelled to act.” Do you remember Janet Reno? 
Poor Janet was another Attorney General who went down for the Clintons. She was also sworn in as AG under Bill Clinton, and many questioned her appointment at the time. According to a report in the Chicago Tribune : 
She arrived in Washington from Miami as Caesar’s wife, and so she has remained. She was ignorant and independent of insider D.C. and has stayed that way. Bill Clinton never much liked her and never confided in her, and she reciprocated. 
She became AG just in time to take the fall for the debacle in Waco , actually. According to History.com 
The Waco standoff had already begun by the time Janet Reno became the first female attorney general on March 12, 1993. She approved the FBI’s tear gas plan the following month, explaining that negotiations with the Branch Davidians had stalemated and that the children inside the compound were at risk. “We will never know whether there was a better solution,” Reno said in 1995. “Everyone involved … made their best judgments based on all the information we had.” Nonetheless, a Republican-led congressional report called her decision “premature, wrong and highly irresponsible.” She was also criticized when facts emerged contradicting some of her earlier statements. 
The Tribune post continued to discuss Reno’s position as a scapegoat: 
Every day since she took office , she has been supervising at least one probe embarrassing to Clinton–Whitewater, fundraising, Lewinsky, China espionage, etc. Clinton can’t afford the political beating he would take if he cashiered her. 
…But no such attorney general could have survived the Clinton scandals, much less survived them with her own reputation–and her department’s–intact. 
Attorney Generals who have anything to do with the Clintons don’t seem to fare too well. They end up so embroiled in Clinton scandals that they, too, are pulled down into the mire, regardless of what their intentions were when they started out. Lynch can see her future…and it has something to do with “Help Wanted” ads 
The last time Lynch was involved in the Clinton email kerfuffle, she promised to abide by FBI Director James Comey’s recommendation . 
I wonder if she’ll make that same promise this time? 
She really can’t, because if she does, it will show she was complicit with the Clintons the last time around, and also this time when she decried Comey’s release of information about the investigation. 
I wonder if she and Hillary Clinton will be able to get adjoining cells when/if the truth comes out.

9684,‘Going Flat’ After Breast Cancer - The New York Times,"Before Debbie Bowers had surgery for breast cancer, her doctor promised that insurance would pay for reconstruction, and said she could “even go up a cup size. ” But Ms. Bowers did not want a silicone implant or bigger breasts. “Having something foreign in my body after a cancer diagnosis is the last thing I wanted,” said Ms. Bowers, 45, of Bethlehem, Pa. “I just wanted to heal. ” While plastic surgeons and oncologists aggressively promote breast reconstruction as a way for women to “feel whole again,” some doctors say they are beginning to see resistance to the surgery. Patients like Ms. Bowers are choosing to defy medical advice and social convention and remain breastless after breast cancer. They even have a name for the decision to skip reconstruction: They call it “going flat. ” “Reconstruction is not a simple process,” said Dr. Deanna J. Attai, a breast surgeon in Burbank, Calif. and a past president of the American Society of Breast Surgeons, adding that more of her patients, especially those with smaller breasts before diagnosis, were opting out of reconstruction. “Some women just feel like it’s too much: It’s too involved, there are too many steps, it’s too long a process. ” Social media has allowed these women to become more open about their decision to live without breasts, as well as the challenges, both physical and emotional, that have followed. For a recent video created by wisdo. com, a social media platform, and widely shared on Facebook, Ms. Bowers and her friend Marianne DuQuette Cuozzo, 51, removed their shirts to show their scarred, flat chests. And Paulette Leaphart, 50, a New Orleans woman whose clotting disorder prevented her from having reconstruction after a double mastectomy, walked topless from Biloxi, Miss. to Washington this summer to raise awareness about the financial struggles of cancer patients. “Breasts aren’t what make us a woman,” Ms. Leaphart said. The nascent movement to “go flat” after mastectomies challenges   assumptions about femininity and what it means to recover after breast cancer. For years, medical professionals have embraced the idea that breast restoration is an integral part of cancer treatment. Women’s health advocates fought for and won approval of the Women’s Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998, which requires health plans to cover prosthetics and reconstructive procedures. Since then, breast reconstruction has become standard care. More than 106, 000 reconstructive procedures were done last year, a 35 percent increase since 2000, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. While it is not known exactly what percentage of women opt for breast reconstruction after a mastectomy, one study found that in 2011, 63 percent of women who were candidates for the procedure chose to have it. In some parts of the United States, the number is closer to 80 percent today. In promoting the surgery, doctors cite studies that suggest breast reconstruction improves a woman’s quality of life after cancer. But some women say that doctors focus too much on physical appearance, and not enough on the toll prolonged reconstructive procedures take on their bodies and their psyches. Up to   of women who undergo reconstruction experience complications. A systematic review of 28 studies found that women who went without reconstruction fared no worse, and sometimes did better, in terms of body image, quality of life and sexual outcomes. “That’s the dirty little secret of breast reconstruction: The risk of a major complication is higher than for the average elective surgery,” said Dr. Clara Lee, an associate professor of plastic surgery at Ohio State University who performs the procedure. Ms. Cuozzo, who appeared in the Facebook video with Ms. Bowers, spent a year having her breasts rebuilt after a double mastectomy, but after four infections in five months, she had the implants removed. The reconstruction, she said, “was getting worse than the cancer. ” While some states, including New York, now require physicians to tell women about the availability of breast reconstruction, women say they often are not informed of the option to remain flat. “I was never told there was a choice,” Ms. Cuozzo said. “I went from the breast surgeon to the plastic surgeon, and they said, ‘This is what you’re going to do. ’” Dr. David H. Song, chief of plastic surgery at the University of Chicago and immediate past president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, said that the risk of complications was real, but that focusing on them was like focusing on plane crashes when “millions of flights land safely. ” Given advancements in surgical techniques, “the aesthetic result can be better than the native breast,” Dr. Song said. “Patients can come out the other end looking more youthful, with a better aesthetic in her breast than before. ” But it is that kind of talk  —   suggesting that a reconstructed breast is an improvement on a woman’s natural breast  —   that enrages many women who have undergone mastectomies. For starters, a reconstructed breast is often numb and can no longer play a role in sexual arousal. It often lacks a nipple, since the nipple is usually removed in a mastectomy. After looking at photos of reconstructed breasts, “I was slightly horrified,” said Charlie Scheel, 48, of Brooklyn, who decided against implants after a double mastectomy. “You don’t have nipples and you have scars everywhere. ” Rebecca Pine, a cancer survivor from Long Island who   a photography and writing project called “The Breast and the Sea,” said, “It’s a tremendous amount to put your body through, and it’s not like we’re going to get our breasts back. ” Ms. Pine, 40, had reconstruction after her first mastectomy, but had the implant removed later when she had a prophylactic mastectomy on her other breast. “They don’t look or feel, in most cases, like our breasts,” she said. “The nerves are cut, so they’re not receptive to feel or touch. ” Dr. Susan Love, author of a   book about breast health, said that doctors aiming to expand access to reconstruction may have become overly enthusiastic about the surgery. “Surgeons became so proud of what we were able to do that we may have forgotten that not everybody may want it,” Dr. Love said. Dr. Marisa C. Weiss, founder of breastcancer. org, said doctors should not assume every patient wants reconstructed breasts. “I’ve had   dancers who do not want reconstruction and nuns who say, ‘I need reconstruction,’” she said. Some women say physicians pressured them to get implants. When Catherine Stapleton, of Florida, woke up after her mastectomy, she discovered that her breast surgeon, a woman, had left unsightly flaps of skin and tissue that could be used for breast reconstruction later, in case she changed her mind. “When I woke up from anesthesia, I was in shock,” said Ms. Stapleton, 58, who is now facing additional major surgery to correct the first procedure. Geri Barish, president of the Long Island advocacy group 1 in 9, said a doctor had chided her when she opted against reconstruction. “One doctor said to me: ‘How can you walk around like that? You look deformed,’” she recalled. Support groups and social media have allowed women to share stories about the realities of reconstruction. “A lot of the women in my support group had infections, and they were surprised at how many surgeries were involved,” said Alicia Staley, 45, who stayed flat after a double mastectomy. “As I compared notes, I wondered, ‘Why are all these women doing this to themselves? ’” Coming to terms with a flat chest after breast cancer can be difficult. While some women wear a prosthesis in their bra, it is not uncommon for them to stop using it. “They’re heavy, they’re uncomfortable, and they’re in a sensitive area where you have scars,” Ms. Pine said. Women say they take many of the clothes they wore before surgery to Goodwill and begin wearing scarves and long strands of beads to hide their flat chests. Others try to embrace their new form by having elaborate tattoos inked where they once had breasts. Ms. Pine has a lotus flower tattoo on one side and a dragonfly on the other. Sara   39, a technical writer in Kalamazoo, Mich. tried two types of implants but had a constant burning sensation and got rid of them. She then started a virtual support group called Flat and Fabulous. “We’re not ” she said. “But many women never feel it’s part of their body. ” For Kate Cloudsparks, 64, a farmer in southern Iowa who has been flat since a preventive mastectomy 21 years ago, discovering the Flat and Fabulous Facebook page this year led to her first communication ever with women who had made the same choice. “I didn’t know anybody else like me. I was carrying it around for 20 years without having anywhere to share it,” she said. “Finally, I had an opportunity to talk about what it’s been like to live as a woman without breasts. ”",0

“ Before Comey’s letter to Congress, Clinton’s campaign had watched with mixed feelings as her standing in poll after poll improved and Trump faltered amid a string of sexual assault accusations. ‘In the last week, I think the Clinton campaign was worried it was going to become too easy and that people would feel that,’ said Mo Elleithee, who worked on Clinton’s failed 2008 presidential campaign. ‘Now there’s a reason for all of our supporters to believe it’s going to be hard.'”

9687,3 Mineral Waters That Can Remove Aluminum from the Brain,"by PAUL FASSA report this ad 
There has been a dramatic increase in neurological diseases linked to aluminum toxicity . The blood brain barrier doesn’t stop aluminum’s intrusion into our gray matter. Aluminum accumulates and remains in tissue that doesn’t have a rapid cellular turnover. report this ad 
Apoptosis is the natural cell death and replacement process that occurs throughout the body, excluding cancer cells. Cancer cells keep reproducing and colonizing into tumors unless apoptosis is introduced or the cells are outright killed from chemical compounds, both natural and synthetic. 
Aluminum accrues to toxic levels over time in slow apoptotic cell turnover tissues, such as bone matter, the heart and the brain. The brain and its associated nervous system is where diseases such as Alzheimer’s , Parkinson’s, MS, chronic fatigue and other neurological or auto-immune diseases manifest, including the complete autistic spectrum, from learning disorders to full blown autism. 
There is no shortage of aluminum toxins in our environment. It’s in cookware, beverage containers, foil, cigarette smoke, cosmetics, antiperspirants, sunscreen, antacids, and those ubiquitous chemtrails that most ignore from which aluminum nanoparticles can be breathed into our lungs and routed directly into our blood or through the sinuses into our brains. 
Aluminum is in all vaccines. Injecting aluminum bypasses the possibility of eliminating it through normal channels. Straight into the blood it goes to be carried into the brain and heart, adding to their accumulated aluminum toxicity loads. report this ad 
According to Dr. Chris Exley, PhD, we have come into the aluminum age. Many trolling commentators love to explain how aluminum is the must common mineral on the planet and therefore it’s harmless. Dr. Exley has dedicated over two decades of his scientific life to researching aluminum toxicity. He calls the period of time from the early 20th Century to now the “Age of Aluminum.” 
Before then, aluminum remained in the ground as the most abundant mineral in earth that hadn’t yet been mined. Dr. Exley claims mining aluminum and using it in so many ways corresponds to the marked increase of neurological diseases. 

Dr. Chris Exley’s Message to the 2011 Vaccine Safety Conference 
A key aspect of his conference delivery concerned helping vaccinated kids improve their neurological damage. Ironically, it involves the second most abundant mineral in mother earth – silica. Exley has put kids who had autism spectrum disorders or other neurological damage from vaccinations on a form of silica known as silicic acid with excellent results. 
Silicic acid is basically oxygenated silica. Exley considers this the best and most bio-available way to get silica through the gut and into the blood, then into brain matter where it binds with the aluminum molecules and leads them out of brain cell tissue safely through the urine. 
He had used a Malasysian mineral water called Spritzer on aluminum toxic children suffering from autism spectrum disorders with significant success. Aluminum is in almost all vaccines. Later he and his team had 15 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients use that water at the same rate of one liter per day for 13 weeks. 
Aluminum levels were lower by anywhere from 50 to 70 percent in all the subjects involved, and of the 15 AD patients, eight no longer deteriorated and three actually showed substantial cognitive increase. Perhaps coconut oil is better for reversing AD, but mineral waters high in Orthosilicic or ionic silicic acid will reduce aluminum toxicity in the brain to help ward off AD. 
The more USA accessible mineral waters with similar levels of silicic acid to Spritzer, which can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, are Volvic and Fiji. My personal favorite is Fiji because it has the highest level of ionic suspended silica as silicic acid and is the least expensive. I’ve seen it in WalMart at $1.99 per liter. 
Also, People’s Chemist Shane Ellison analyzed various water bottles and said Fiji water bottles are free of BPA and “its chemical cousins”. Others he rates highly as BPA free are Voss, Evian, and Smart Water. 
The suggested protocol is at least five days consuming a 1.5 liter bottle of water daily. More is required for high levels of aluminum toxicity. Dr. Exley considers drinking the whole bottle within an hour as the most efficient method of detoxing aluminum from the brain. 
Dr. Exley explains that there are three commercial bottled waters listing silica amounts as milligrams (mg) per liter on the bottle. Fiji has the highest amount of the three. Neither of us is affiliated with Fiji. 
Silica mineral waters can be supplemented to help prevent dementia. Obviously it can also be used as an adjunct with pure cold pressed coconut oil to stop early onset Alzheimer’s or even reverse most of the symptoms after AD symptoms appear. More on coconut oil for Alzheimer’s can be found here . 
Aluminum (Al) is passed out through the urine when one supplements silica sufficiently. It seems there’s little danger of taking too much, as long as adequate water is consumed and vitamin B1 and potassium levels are maintained. 

More About Silica 
Silica helps ensure collagen elasticity of all connecting tissues in the body, including tendons and cartilage. This reduces aches and pains and maintains your body’s flexibility. It has also been determined that high levels of blood serum silica keep arterial plaque from building and clogging blood vessels. 
A major culprit for arterial plaque has recently shifted from cholesterol buildup to arterial calcification from serum calcium that is not absorbed as bone matter. It’s known that silica is an important part of building bone matter. 
Without sufficient silica, magnesium, and vitamin K2, calcium doesn’t become part of bone matter and remains in the blood to potentially calcify in the soft tissue of inner artery walls and the heart. 
Silica is vital for keeping strong bones and a healthy cardiovascular system. This qualifies silica as an essential anti-aging mineral that is much more than a skin deep beauty mineral. Other good sources of silica are the herb horsetail, cucumbers, and diatomaceous earth powder. 
Although these three other sources are helpful for the recent aforementioned reasons, they lack the ionic suspension of silicic acid found in the mineral waters to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. I just found these other sources for ionic silica or silicic acid as well, here and here .

9689,Kansas Supreme Court Says State Education Spending Is Too Low - The New York Times,"The Kansas Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that the state’s spending on public education was unconstitutionally low, dealing a new blow to Gov. Sam Brownback, who is facing a rebellion from his own Republican Party over his trademark   doctrine. In a unanimous ruling, the court said black, Hispanic and poor students were especially harmed by the lack of funding, pointing to lagging test scores and graduation rates. The justices set a June 30 deadline for lawmakers to pass a new constitutional funding formula, sending them scrambling to find more money to pay for a solution. This is the second time in about a year that Kansas’ highest court has ruled against the state’s approach to paying for schools, just as Mr. Brownback finds himself wrestling with growing budget deficits and as his relations with fellow Republicans have deteriorated to new lows. Mr. Brownback, who has made cutting taxes and shrinking government the centerpiece of his administration since taking office in 2011, championed the largest tax cuts in state history, turning Kansas into a national testing ground for his staunchly conservative philosophy. But the state has since struggled with gaping deficits, and patience has run thin, even among some former allies. Just last month, the   Legislature approved a tax increase that would have raised more than $1 billion to help narrow the budget gap  —   a bold rejection of Mr. Brownback’s vision. In the end, the governor vetoed the measure, and he barely survived an override attempt. The school funding ruling now adds yet another layer of fiscal trouble for Kansas and political tumult for Mr. Brownback. “Either the governor will have to bend, or we have to get enough votes in the House and Senate to override him,” Dinah Sykes, a Republican state senator, said, noting that lawmakers will have to get to work immediately to find money in the budget to satisfy the court’s requirements. “I thought that the tax plan that we put on his desk that was vetoed, I thought that was a compromise,” Ms. Sykes said. She added that lawmakers now had to prepare to find a legislative solution  —   with or without the governor. “We just have to dig in and figure out how to solve this problem,” she said. The court did not specify how much more money was needed for the state’s schools, but finding any could prove difficult. Current budget deficits reach into the hundreds of millions. “I think there’s a clear supermajority of legislators that want to move away from Brownback economics and the failed tax experiments,” said State Representative Jim Ward, the Democratic leader in the Kansas House. “Now the school decision expedites the importance of getting that done sooner rather than later. ” Mr. Brownback, who is barred by term limits from seeking   next year, has faced plunging approval ratings and increasingly criticism from the moderate wing of the Republican Party. In a statement, he acknowledged that some students in Kansas had not received a suitable education, calling for a new funding formula to “right this wrong. ” “The Kansas Legislature has the opportunity to engage in transformative educational reform by passing a school funding system that puts students first,” Mr. Brownback said. “Success is not measured in dollars spent, but in higher student performance. ” He made a pitch for schools outside of the public education system, suggesting that parents “should be given the opportunity and resources to set their child up for success through other educational choices. ” School funding consumes about half of Kansas’ budget, and its political salience cuts across party lines. Kansas prides itself on its public schools, and, in many small towns, the high school serves as a community anchor. The right to a suitably funded education is enshrined in the state Constitution. The current lawsuit was prompted by a slide in education financing that began after the recession under Mr. Brownback’s predecessor as governor, Mark V. Parkinson, a Democrat. But the school funding mechanism has been litigated in Kansas courts for years, and there are sharp regional distinctions in how the issue is viewed. In the affluent Kansas City suburbs, where test scores are high, many want to preserve special taxes that benefit their local school districts. In rural and urban parts of the state, where incomes are lower and academic performance sometimes lags, plans to provide more   funding for minorities and poor students have greater resonance. “Because of the budget cuts, frozen budgets, we’ve had to eliminate almost all of our extended learning time,” said Alan Cunningham, the superintendent of Dodge City Public Schools, a district where the first language of a majority of students is not English. “Those kids are not able to get the time they need to learn the things that they need to learn to be successful,” Mr. Cunningham said. In its ruling, the court detailed statistics that showed   and Hispanic students, as well as poor students and those learning the English language, lagging behind their peers academically. Cynthia Lane, the superintendent of public schools in Kansas City, Kan. where more than 80 percent of students come from   households and qualify for free or   lunches, said lawmakers needed to make special provisions for disadvantaged children in the new funding plan. “For a decade, we have been cutting support  —   we have been offering less tutoring, less support, less enrichment,” said Dr. Lane, whose school district was one of the four plaintiffs in the case before the Supreme Court. “So this ruling today gives me great hope that we can start talking about our aspirations, not just worrying about protecting where we are. ” James E. Ryan, the dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, said that courts in school finance cases frequently order state legislatures to come up with funding formulas that are fair  —   and Kansas was no exception. “What you see in Kansas you see in states across the country,” he said. “Namely, that there is an achievement gap between poorer kids and more   kids, and between white students and students of color. ” Mark Tallman, a lobbyist for the Kansas Association of School Boards, said he was pleased with the court’s ruling and hopeful that it would result in more resources in schools. He also said the ruling was an indication that the political winds in Kansas had shifted against Mr. Brownback, particularly with a more moderate Legislature voted into office in November, when Democrats gained 13 seats. “I do think that this Legislature is much more interested in funding education,” Mr. Tallman said. “I think the election results suggest that voters are seeing problems with our funding system that they want to address. ” For now, Mr. Brownback has shown a willingness to use a veto pen, leaving it uncertain whether lawmakers can agree on a new school funding plan by the June deadline, and whether they can raise enough revenue to support it. “You have enormous political will in Kansas to make the changes necessary,” Mr. Ward, the Democratic lawmaker, said, “and any politician obstructing that does it at their own peril. ”",0

When you try to cut Meals on Wheels, when you cut investments in education, when you propose to cut the budget of the National Institute of Health by billion dollars, you are cutting that lifeline of research investment that saves lives. Right now what we are seeing plain and simply is that the Republicans are overreaching. That is why we are going to win seats like the congressional seat in District 6 down in Georgia.

9692,Free Market Economic Recovery with Trump or Global Collectivism with Hillary,"Print 
Two weeks before the most outrageous presidential election in history, the stakes for the economic future of our country are high. There is no question that the U.S. economy is in terrible shape and that the policy decisions made in the last ten years have negatively affected everyone who trades, invests, and use the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency. Are voters going to choose free market economic recovery with Trump or global collectivism with Clinton? 
The government statistics claim that there are officially 8 million unemployed but the actual unemployment numbers are closer to 16 million people. The reported labor force of almost 156 million in 2000 has shrunk to 152 million today. The reported number of Americans “not in the labor force” is an astonishing 94 million. These are discouraged workers who are no longer counted as unemployed. This explains why this administration’s unemployment numbers are so rosy and low. For up to date numbers, visit the national debt clock here. http://www.usdebtclock.org/ 
Our national debt is astronomical, approaching $20 trillion while GDP is below $19 trillion. We already owe more than we make in a year in final goods and services. Gross debt to GDP ratio is 106.38 percent. The U.S. total debt is $67 trillion. However, if we add all the unfunded liabilities such as Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, and Obamacare , the figure jumps much higher. 
The federal budget deficit (the difference between taxation and spending) is almost $6 trillion for this year. The more indebted we are to the rest of the world and to each other, the less money will be available for future generations to improve their standard of living and to defend themselves. 
There are approximately 119 million U.S. taxpayers and approximately 124 million full-time workers. The biggest part of the revenue from taxation is spent on entitlements. Somehow, Social Security, a fund established with automatic paycheck contributions, has been lumped in with entitlements as if the Social Security fund did not belong to the tax payers but to the government. 
Our Congress loves to spend money on entitlements because the recipients vote them back into office. Revenue to GDP ratio is a positive 35.6 percent but spending to GDP ratio is a red 36.04 percent. 
During the third presidential debate, Hillary Clinton said that she would make sure public college education will be free, that parents will not receive a bill for their children’s college degree, and she will do it by not adding one penny to the national debt. 
After fact checking the statement, it turns out to be not true. One source claims that $500 billion will be added to the national debt in the next 10 years while the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that “$200 billion will be spent on infrastructure, financial aid for college students, and early childhood education.” 
The current student loan debt is $1.4 trillion and growing. There are 50,182,018 public school students who will eventually take advantage of this “free” college offer Hillary Clinton has made. Who is going to pay? Taxpayers, of course, will be saddled with the cost. 
Additionally, how is she going to create jobs to employ college graduates if her plan includes raising taxes? Employers create jobs when their taxes are decreased. NAFTA, which was President Bill Clinton’s achievement, has exported many manufacturing jobs overseas. Hillary Clinton supports the highly secretive Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), which would finish off the manufacturing sector in this country, leaving the United States as a service economy. 
We now have 12,500,256 manufacturing jobs left in this country. In 2000 we had 19,462,745 manufacturing jobs. There are about 120 million private sector jobs but large companies are pushing for more H-1B visas to import cheap technical labor from India and other foreign nations, leaving seasoned employees out of a job and having to train their replacements. More college graduates living in their parents’ basement will have to work as baristas in coffee shops. 
Trump is in favor of school choice and wants to end Common Core. He favors the reintroduction of Vocational and Technical education, as well as making two and four-year college education affordable. 
Donald Trump wants to renegotiate NAFTA and to withdraw from TPP. He wants to end foreign trade abuses and currency manipulation by China. He wants to repatriate our own companies by reducing corporate taxation significantly and by establishing tariffs to prevent companies from leaving in the first place. He wants to offer middle class tax relief that would help create 25 million jobs. He wants to simplify the tax code. 
Trump wants to create jobs by lifting regulatory restrictions on fossil fuel exploration and all mining. He wants to “lift road blocks that prevent the Keystone pipeline from moving forward.” 
Trump wants to cancel payments to the United Nations Climate Fund and use the money to fix our water and environmental infrastructure. 
Hillary Clinton wants to expand illegal immigration and open borders while Trump wants to cancel federal funding of sanctuary cities that harbor criminal illegal aliens. He will “suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur.” 
He will establish punishments for visa overstays, for repeat criminal offenders, and multiple illegal border crossings. Adamant that he will build the wall with Mexico, Trump promises to remove criminal aliens from the U.S. and to cancel visas to countries that won’t take them back. 
Restoring the rule of law, dismantling criminal gangs, establishing a task force on violent crime to help police, cleaning up corruption, and admitting immigrants who have been thoroughly vetted, who want to be a contributing part of our country, should go a long way to begin the process of healing our nation. 
Hillary wants to continue President Obama’s policies, including the admittance of many more “refugees” from countries that are inimical to us. 
While Hillary wants to develop Obamacare into a one payer system, Trump wants to “repeal and replace” the very costly and unaffordable Affordable Care Act which has made healthcare premiums unaffordable for so many Americans who were forced to drop their insurance and just pay the tax penalty. 
Trump favors health savings accounts, letting states manage Medicaid funds, and allowing Americans to buy insurance across state lines. Cutting the red tape at the FDA is also on his radar. He promises to fix VA hospitals and to allow veterans to be treated by their chosen doctor in any private or public hospital. 
Will Trump have the opportunity to replace Justice Scalia or will Hillary alter the composition of the Supreme Court, turning it into a bastion of progressivism for generations to come? 
Trump promises to expand and strengthen our military, to guard our First and Second Amendments, and to protect our Constitution. 
It is time that American hard-earned dollars take care of Americans first instead of providing for the rest of the world to the detriment of poor Americans, redistributing our wealth through schemes that the globalists behind Hillary Clinton have devised. Americans want to have secure borders, sovereignty, one language, self-determination, and economic prosperity through free markets not through collectivism. shares",0

Meanwhile, Fezile Mustafa from the village of Terzilla near Mosul which was recently liberated from Daesh terrorists told Sputnik that she and her five children would only return to the village after the Iraqi army drives Daesh out of Mosul. © Sputnik/ Hikmet Durgun She said that ""it is simply impossible"" to return to Terzilla now that the village had been sacked and her home destroyed. ""We will return only after Mosul is liberated. Perhaps more than anything else, we want two things, namely, the liberation of Mosul from Daesh and to return home,"" she added. © Sputnik/ HİKMET DURGUN Hezale Mustafa On October 17, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Abadi announced the start of a military operation to retake Mosul from Daesh. According to local media, about 30,000 Iraqi soldiers and 4,000 Kurdish Peshmerga fighters are taking part in the operation, which is backed by the airstrikes being carried out by the US-led international coalition. Earlier this week, Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said that Turkish artillery and tanks are supporting Peshmerga's efforts to liberate Mosul, adding that if necessary Turkish air forces may assist in in the military operation. Comment: The US also seems optimistic retaking Mosul: US Central Command Expects More Resistance From Daesh Militants in Mosul US Central Command's Gen. Joseph Votel said that despite obstacles he is confident that Mosul would be retaken. The US Central Command's Gen. Joseph Votel warned Wednesday that, as an operation to liberate Mosul progress, the resistance of Islamic State (ISIL or Daesh) terrorists will increase. ""I would expect we are going to run into more obstacles [and] more VBIEDs [vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices]. They've had a long time to prepare for that fight, so all of that we're going to contend with here very, very soon,"" Army Gen. Joseph Votel, commander of the Pentagon's unified command for the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia, told NBC. Army Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, commander of the US-led Combined Joint Task Force fighting Daesh, confirmed the information, adding that the Daesh deployed an ""extraordinary"" number of rockets and VBIEDs in Mosul. Nevertheless, he expressed confidence that Mosul would be retaken.",0

9695,Contaminated food from China now entering the U.S. under the ‘organic’ label,"Natural News 
(NaturalNews) The Chinese food production industry is one of the world’s least-regulated and most corrupt, as has repeatedly been proven time and again. Now, it appears, there is no trusting anything that comes from China marked “organic.” 
Natural Health 365 reports that several foods within the country are so contaminated that Chinese citizens don’t trust them. What’s more, the countries that import these tainted foods are putting their citizens at risk. 
U.S. Customs personnel often turn away food shipments from China because they contain unsavory additives and drug residues, are mislabeled, or are just generally filthy. Some Chinese food exporters have responded by labeling their products “organic,” though they are far from it. 
There are several factors at play which make Chinese claims of organic unreliable. First, environmental pollution from unrestrained and unregulated industrial growth has so polluted soil and waterways with toxic heavy metals that nothing grown in them is safe, much less organic. Also, there is so much fraudulent labeling and rampant corruption within the government and manufacturing sectors that it’s not smart to trust what is put on packaging. 
In fact, farmers in China use water that is replete with heavy metals, Natural Health 365 noted in a separate report . In addition, water used for irrigation also contains organic and inorganic substances and pollutants. Chinese “organic” food is so contaminated that a person could get ill just by handling some of it. ‘Dirty water’ is all there is 
The report noted further: 
“This is reality – all of China’s grains, vegetables and fruits are irrigated with untreated industrial wastewater. The Yellow River, which is considered unusable, supports major food producing areas in the northeast provinces.” 
Many Chinese farmers won’t even eat the food they produce, if you can believe that. That’s because it’s clear that China’s water pollution issues are so pronounced that it threatens the country’s entire food supply . 
Chinese farmers have said there is no available water for crops except “ dirty water .” As part of the country’s industrial prowess, it is also one of the largest producers (and consumers) of fertilizers and pesticides, Water Politics reported. 
The site noted further that as China’s industrial might grows, so too does the level of contaminants in the country’s water supply. Lakes, rivers, streams and falling water tables are becoming more polluted by the year. 
In addition to man-made pollutants, animals produce about 90 percent of the organic pollutants and half of the nitrogen in China’s water , say experts at the Chinese Academy for Environmental Planning. There are times when water is so polluted it turns black – yet it is still used to irrigate crops, and of course, that affects so-called organic farming operations as well. 
These nine foods are particularly vulnerable to becoming tainted, Natural Health 365 noted: 
Fish: Some 80 percent of the tilapia sold in the U.S. come from fish farms in China , as well as half the cod. Water pollution in China is a horrible problem, so any fish grown there are suspect. 
Chicken: Poultry produced in China is very often plagued with illnesses like avian flu. 
Apples and apple juice: Only recently has the U.S. moved to allow the importation of Chinese apples, though American producers grow plenty for the country and the world. 
Rice: Though this is a staple in China and much of the rice in the U.S. comes from there, some of it has been found to be made of resin and potato. 
Mushrooms: Some 34 percent of processed mushrooms come from China. 
Salt: Some salt produced in China for industrial uses has made its way to American dinner tables. 
Black pepper: One Chinese vendor was trying to pass off mud flakes as pepper. 
Green peas: Phony peas have been found in China made of soy, green dye and other questionable substances. 
Garlic: About one-third of all garlic in the U.S. comes from China.

9697,One Photo Sums Up How Differently America Treats People Of Color And The White Bundy Militiamen,"Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr 
Two stunningly depressing things happened in America on Thursday evening that demonstrate just how differently the country treats its citizens based on race – and they happened more or less at the same time. 
In North Dakota, police driving armored vehicles (yes, like tanks) and armed with rifles, sound cannons, and shotguns loaded with “nonlethal” beanbags marched in formation to shut down peaceful protesters opposing an oil pipeline. A few states over in Oregon, a jury found that the violent militia group which led an armed occupation of a federal wildlife reserve was innocent of all charges and free to go . America is two countries with two different sets of rules, and Thursday evening highlighted that fact in stunning detail. 
On Twitter, user @theshrillest put the juxtaposition in all its glory in a single screengrab. His twitter feed was a mixture of stories about the violent suppression of a peaceful protest led by a Native American tribe directly affected by the environmental impact of the oil pipeline and news of the release of the Bundy militia – a group of out-of-state rabblerousers who believe the federal government should be disbanded. 
— 🇺🇸 (@theshrillest) October 27, 2016 
This is the second time the Bundy family threatened to kill federal agents and expressed a desire to lead a revolution only to see zero charges stick to them. The group will now get to return to Nevada, just in time for an election in which many conservatives are openly stating that they plan on taking up arms if Trump loses. On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump. 
On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket. 
You in? 
— Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 
In short, it’s a scary time to be a democracy. An Oregon jury just gave every white male in the country a not-so-subtle nod that violence against the government will be met with a look the other way when it comes time to a trial.

9698,Trump Called National Park Chief Over Twitter Post on Inaugural Crowd - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump spoke by telephone with the acting director of the National Park Service the day after his inauguration to ask why someone from the agency had shared someone else’s Twitter post giving an unflattering comparison of his inaugural crowd, according to Mr. Trump’s deputy press secretary. “It was a, ‘What’s going on?’ type of thing,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House spokeswoman, said on Thursday evening. “Why is the National Park Service tweeting out comparison photos? That was the bigger issue there. ” During the call, Mr. Trump also asked the National Park Service’s acting director, Michael T. Reynolds, if he could produce further photographic evidence of the size of his inaugural crowd, according to a second person briefed on the Jan. 21 telephone call between the two men. Since becoming president, Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed outrage toward the news media for what he believes is a deliberate attempt to undermine his legitimacy by understating the size of the crowd that attended his   and speech. One of those instances happened on Inauguration Day, when an employee of the National Park Service used the agency’s Twitter account to share someone else’s post of images comparing the inaugural crowds in 2009 and 2017. The images, originally posted by a New York Times reporter, showed the 2009 crowd to be much larger. Mr. Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, expressed outrage the next day during a forceful statement at the White House in which he lashed out at the press and claimed, inaccurately, that Mr. Trump had drawn “the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration. ” Mr. Spicer later said he was talking about a combination of   television and online audiences. That same morning, before Mr. Spicer’s statement, Mr. Reynolds received a message from the White House that the president wanted to talk to him. They connected in the early afternoon, according to one of the people who was briefed on the call and asked for anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss it. The new president asked for additional photos that could confirm his view of his crowd size. A park service spokesman, Tom Crosson, said he could confirm that a call took place between Mr. Reynolds and the president, but he would not describe the content. The call was first reported by The Washington Post. Mr. Reynolds could not be reached for comment. The fact that Mr. Trump sought out Mr. Reynolds to discuss the Twitter message and seek more proof of the size of his crowd during his first full day as president is further evidence of the anxiety that he has demonstrated when people raise questions about the extent of his public support. As a candidate, he frequently commented on the size of his rallies, and when he became   he repeatedly spoke about the magnitude of his Election Day victories in states that few people thought he would win. Some political commentators had speculated that Mr. Trump’s focus on the magnitude of his support would fade once he took office, as the election became less important than the issues facing him. But his frustration about the size of the inaugural crowd is continuing. During an interview with David Muir of ABC News this week, he talked about it, saying: “We had a massive crowd of people. We had a crowd  —   I looked over that sea of people and I said to myself, ‘Wow.’ And I’ve seen crowds before. Big, big crowds. That was some crowd. ” He also walked Mr. Muir over to a panoramic picture of the crowd hanging in a hallway in the West Wing. Ms. Sanders said Mr. Trump’s decision to call Mr. Reynolds is a reflection of what his supporters find appealing: his willingness to do something himself when he thinks it needs to be done. “The reason that people like him is because he takes action himself,” she said. “If he sees something that’s an issue, he picks up the phone and directly engages to fix it. ”",0
9699,President Trump: Man-Made Global Warming is a Hoax,"Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/president-trump-man-made-global-warming.html Man-made global warming is a hoax perpetuated by the elite to make money and damage the U.S. economy, according to President-elect Donald Trump – and America isn’t going to stand for it anymore. “Obama thinks it’s the number one problem in the world today. I think it’s very low on the list,” Trump said on the Hugh Hewitt show, indicating a major shift in U.S. policy. Trump continued: “You know in the 1920s people talked about global cooling, they thought the earth was cooling. I believe there is weather and I believe there is change and I believe it goes up and it goes down and it goes up again and it changes depending on years and centuries.“ Pointing out that U.S. manufacturing and the economy as a whole has suffered since climate change rules were introduced by global organizations – making everybody poorer, except the elites who profit from the fearmongering – Trump has promised to make America competitive again.Trump is putting his money where his mouth is. According to a member of his transition team, the President-elect is looking at ways to withdraw as quickly as possible from a costly global climate agreement currently being ratified in Morocco. Since Trump’s victory in Tuesday’s election, governments ranging from China to small island states have reaffirmed their support for the agreement at climate talks running until November 18 in Marrakesh, Morocco. But Trump believes the global rules and regulations will continue to harm the American economy and the President-elect wants out. “It was reckless for the Paris Agreement to enter into force before the election,” the source, who works on Trump’s transition team, told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Top Scientist Resigns: ' Global Warming is a $Trillions Scam — It has Corrupted Many Scientists ' 30,000 scientists agree with Trump A staggering 30,000 scientists have come forward agreeing with Trump that man-made climate change is a scam perpetuated by the global elite in order to make money. One of the experts is weather channel founder, John Coleman, who warns that huge fortunes are being made by man-made climate change proponents such as Al Gore . The weather has been so cold for so long that the global warming HOAXSTERS were forced to change the name to climate change to keep $ flow! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2014 If you’re still inclined to believe what Al Gore has to say about global warming, please consider the fact that since he embarked on his climate change crusade, flying around the world on his private jet, his wealth has grown from $2 million in 2001 to $200 million in 2016 – largely due to investments in fake “green tech” companies and the effective embezzlement of numerous grants and loans. From the National Review : “A 2008 survey by two German scientists, Dennis Bray and Hans von Storch, found that a significant number of scientists were skeptical of the ability of existing global climate models to accurately predict global temperatures, precipitation, sea-level changes, or extreme weather events even over a decade; they were far more skeptical as the time horizon increased.” Other mainstream news sources besides the National Review have also been courageous enough to speak out against the global warming propaganda – even the Wall Street Journal published an op-ed piece in 2015 challenging the Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) pseudoscience being pushed by global warming proponents. And, of course, there are the more than 30,000 American scientists (to date) who agree with Trump and have signed a petition challenging the climate change narrative – and 9,029 of them hold PhDs in their respective fields. Breaking: Global Warming Data FAKED by Government Many of those scientists who signed the petition were likely encouraged to speak out in favor of the truth after retired senior NASA atmospheric scientist John L. Casey revealed that solar cycles are largely responsible for warming periods on Earth – not human activity . Many more still are likely to sign the petition and speak out against the mainstream propaganda now that Trump has indicated a major change in U.S. policy. By Baxter Dmitry  ",0
9700,Trump Was Asked What He Has In Common With His Daughter. His Answer Is CREEPY,"  
Republican nominee Donald J. Trump has been very vocal about his creepy sexual fetishization of his daughter Ivanka – and yet another deeply uncomfortable video has surfaced of him hitting on his daughter. 
During a 2013 tapping of the “ Wendy Williams Show ,” Donald Trump and daughter Ivanka appeared together as guests. 
Wendy asked each to name what they have in common, during a reoccurring segment called “Fave Five.” While Ivanka safely and logically responded, “real estate” and “golf.” Trump, however, gave the game an incestual twist, replying “Sex.” 
Considering Donald J. Trump’s record at subjecting Ivanka to his perversion, this shouldn’t even be surprising, but it is absolutely disgusting. It is shocking and just plain gross. In 2006, Trump allowed Howard Stern the go-ahead to call Ivanka a “ piece of ass ,” and agreed with this assessment (no pun intended) of his daughter. 
That same year he went on “ The View ,” telling the ladies that he wouldn’t disparage he posing for “Playboy” and that if she wasn’t his daughter he would be dating her. In 2003, he appeared with buddy Howard Stern, bragging about how his daughter’s has the “ best body ,” saying: “You know who’s one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. Ivanka. My daughter, Ivanka. She’s 6 feet tall, she’s got the best body. She made a lot money as a model—a tremendous amount.” 
Trump’s lack of discretion when referring to Ivanka is very, very weird and further proves that Trump is only capable of putting the women he interacts with into two camps: those he would have sex with and those he wouldn’t. That Ivanka is his daughter does not change this. She is a woman he would have sex with, and nothing more. He pitifully can’t even name anything they have in common. All that comes to mind is, as admitted by him, is sex. 
Maybe Republicans should spend their time investigating Trump possibly molesting members of his own family instead of trying to needlessly take down Clinton, before her term (inevitably) starts.

9701,Top Five Media-Generated Non-Stories from Trump’s Foreign Trip - Breitbart,"The media latched on to a few absurdly overblown stories to keep the bad vibes flowing during President Trump’s first overseas journey. Editorial judgment is apparently easy to suspend when the opportunity to hype an odd photo or curious video clip presents itself. [The Orb: By far the most entertaining   was the photo of President Trump, King Salman of Saudi Arabia, and President Sisi of Egypt posing with their hands atop a mysterious glowing white sphere.  Internet wags had a field day coming up with humorous theories about the Orb, including the lively wag subdivision of Breitbart News, whose contribution made the New York Times roundup of   merriment. A good time was had by all, but really, there’s nothing terribly mysterious about the Orb. It’s not a relic from some obscure desert nomad ritual given a   gloss by the Saudis, or an alien artifact, or a leftover prop from the Lord of the Rings films. It’s just a translucent globe of the Earth with a very bright light inside, which makes it look weird in photographs. It’s part of the decor at the   new Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology in Riyadh, and the three leaders were posing for a routine photo op. Evidently the management of the Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology has a keen sense of drama, as the New York Times describes the scene: “When the king and Mr. Trump touched it, background music of the kind that might accompany a reality show’s elimination sequence or introduce a cable news program soared and pulsed. The screens glowed with statistical displays and videos about fighting terrorism. ” That orb is destined to show up in a lot of selfies. The First Lady swats President Trump’s hand away: Shooting wars have gotten less coverage than a few seconds of video that appeared to show first lady Melania Trump evading President Trump’s attempt to hold her hand on the tarmac in Tel Aviv, while walking the red carpet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara. CNN analyzed what it called “the swat heard round the world” as if it were the Zapruder film, offering a variety of theories as to the meaning of Mrs. Trump’s 1. 5 seconds of body language. Verdicts ranging from “awkward” to “she hates his guts” were rendered. Mrs. Trump’s facial expressions and posture were scrutinized for signs of her dismay with the business of being first lady. Signals from distant stars that might host intelligent alien life are examined less carefully than the signals Melania Trump is supposedly sending. As for the    well, the “experts” see nothing but brutish misogyny in his body language. None of that has anything to do with what people who actually know the Trumps say about the state of their marriage, but why let common sense ruin a good news cycle?  If anyone needed further evidence that a great deal of modern reportage is driven by whatever “viral sensation” happens to float across the Twitter and Facebook pages of journalists, here it is. Hundreds of pages of news and commentary milked from one second of video is the best return on minimal effort since Jack planted a handful of magic beans and grew a beanstalk that punched through the stratosphere. Trump   the President of Montenegro: The media flipped out over video from President Trump’s visit to NATO headquarters in Brussels that showed Trump apparently shoving the hapless Prime Minister Dusko Markovic of Montenegro aside, so he could claim a choice position in a group photo shoot. “The Balkan state is in the process of formally joining NATO, but membership, it seems, does not earn it a spot at the front of the line,” sniffed the New York Times. Now that you mention it, no, tiny nations that aren’t even part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization yet would not normally stand in front of the    of the global hyperpower in a NATO group photo. Also, group photos are arranged by photographers and diplomatic staff, not shoving contests between world leaders. Of course, most of the media types trying to make hay out of the Trump Shove know this, since they work with photographers on a regular basis. Alas, even as new heights of media dudgeon were reached, Markovic ruined the fun by declaring he was not offended by Trump’s pat on the arm. “It didn’t really register. I just saw reactions about it on social networks. It is simply a harmless situation,” Markovic said. Then he blew up the rest of the narrative by noting, “It is natural that the president of the United States is in the front row. ” Trump attempts to dismember French president with brutal handshake: Not content with tossing the Prime Minister of Montenegro around like a sack of potatoes, Trump also came close to crushing the new French president’s hand at the NATO summit. According to the Washington Post, the only reason President Emmanuel Macron didn’t draw back a stump is that he was warned in advance about Trump’s gorilla grip. The ensuing encounter featured some of the most spectacular    combat since Agent Smith faced off against Neo at the subway station:  Macron strides along the blue carpet to the wall of world leaders walking toward him. As the president of the United States stretches out his arms in a “hey, buddy!” greeting of the newest member of the elite club, Macron veers to the right like a decoy Marine One from the South Lawn of the White House. Trump looks on as his French counterpart double kisses German Chancellor Angela Merkel and shakes hands with other leaders. When Macron does get around to greeting Trump, Trump goes for the   . But Macron immediately yanks back and employs his left hand to try to hold down The Donald’s rising right arm as the insecure alpha tries to assert his dominance as cameras clicked. President Macron is but a student of  . Melania is the master. Macron had to parkour his way across half of NATO headquarters to escape. Melania countered Trump’s iron fists with a mere twitch of her fingers. Veils at the Vatican: Melania Trump could not so easily evade the misogyny of the Catholic Church. The breathtaking hypocrisy of the Trump White House was laid bare when Mrs. Trump refused to don a headscarf in Saudi Arabia, but submitted to wearing a black veil at the Vatican along with Ivanka. How could the Trump women defy Islamic dress codes while obeying Catholic ones? This particular   had a short shelf life, because most media organizations already knew the answer. They still tried to milk it with headlines like “Melania Trump Wears Veil, But Not a Headscarf,” but the body text of the very same stories admitted the Vatican’s dress code is   and well known, while the Saudis did not even request she wear a headscarf. They don’t make such requests of visiting VIP women as a general rule. Furthermore, as Canada’s Globe and Mail noted, the Vatican is a holy site, and Mrs. Trump happens to be Catholic. She did not visit any holy sites in Saudi Arabia, where head coverings or the removal of shoes might have been required.  The Trumps also respected religious traditions during their visit to the Western Wall in Jerusalem, which has a published dress code for visitors. Mr. Trump wore a yarmulke head covering when he became the first sitting U. S. president to visit the Wall. There are three main reasons we saw a brief shower of “Veil But No Headscarf” headlines: reporters noticed people were popping off about it on Twitter, they were hoping for a cheap “Islamophobia” hit, and they remembered Donald Trump criticizing Michelle Obama for not wearing a headscarf in Saudi Arabia. Try Googling stories about Melania and the headscarf from May 20th, and you’ll see a string of stories from virtually every mainstream media organization recalling that Trump “attacked” or “slammed” Mrs. Obama for declining to wear one. They’re also still pretty sore about conservatives mocking President Obama for bowing to the Saudi king, so they scrambled to make a story about Trump bowing too. The Memory Hole is very real, but there are some things the media does not forget.",0

They will scoff, ridicule, mock My Presence, whether this be in My Church, in books; in the Word or when I Am Present in other souls. The Presence of God is Omnipotent and it is felt in the most painful way by those souls who are in darkness. This is why they react with such venom to any mention of Me. These people have a deep ingrained hatred of Me and they fail to see how they can hate someone Who, in their eyes, does not exist.I warn those who embrace false spirituality and who idolize or obsess about anything that does not come from Me. If you open your souls to any spiritual realm, not of My Making, you will open the door to demons, who will cunningly entice you into their dark world. Whatever peace you believe you receive from new age practices will be short-lived. And as you seek more, you will then enter into a state where your conscience will be taken over by those enemies of God, until you are unable to release yourself from their domain. You will never find peace when you idolize false gods.The world is infiltrated with false doctrines, gods and religions. There is only one True God and you can only come to Him by recognising the Great Sacrifice He made when He sent Me, His only Begotten Son, to bring you salvation from the snares of the evil one.To those who do know Me, but who dabble in other doctrines, know this.

So we are prepositioning enough equipment for a Marine Mechanized Task Force of 920 Marines 1000 Km from the Russian Boogie Man's border? Complete with 58 M1A1 MBTs? Talk about a total waste of Taxpayers money. In 2003 45,000 Marines barely made it to Baghdad, 545Kms against almost no opposition. The Marines fought mostly Fedayeen Saddam(determined fanatics yes, but with little or no military training) and prison inmates released once the invasion started (""fight the Americans or we shoot you now""). The Marines never encountered one opposing complete Iraqi Battalion, they did fight Company strength Iraqi Light Infantry 4 times and never came under coordinated Artillery fire. With timid leadership, a inept ability to maneuver off of the Hardball (Main Highway), complete abandonment of Doctrine nearly every ambush (the damn Task Force comes to a 2hr stop so 2 squads can engage 6 Hadjis for 20 minutes) and a real arrogance that precluded using Combat Multipliers (Intel, Artillery, Combat Aviation, SIGINT/ELINT, Civil Affairs or Linguists (3/4s Battalion CO dismounting & having Infantry assault dug-in Fedayeen Saddam in palm groves without preparatory fires while 5 M1s, 2 LAV25s and 8 AAV-7s are walking distance away with 120mm, 25mm, .50cal, and Mk-19s sitting at idle and the 81mm & 120mm mortars are less than 2Km away.

9705,Silver And Gresham’s Law,"Silver And Gresham’s Law Posted on Home » Silver » Silver News » Silver And Gresham’s Law 
Silver has been, is, and always will be “poor man’s gold.” Gold is unobtainable for most people in the world the way it’s priced right now. If a global crisis hits silver is going to be remonetized by the free market… 

From PM Fund Manager Dave Kranzler : 
If it’s not just an industrial metal, like it is today, if governments and central banks start holding it (silver), and this is a copy-cat effect, because obviously you know this, once one of the central banks does something the rest will do it because they don’t want to be different. – Lior Gantz, The Daily Coin, Silver Will Be Re-Monetized By The Market 
I n 1965 Lyndon Johnson signed the Coinage Act of 1965, which removed the silver content from dimes and quarters and took the silver content in half-dollars down to 40%. In 1970 silver was removed completely from the half-dollars. The excuse given was that the country was running out of silver. But the truth is that the U.S. Government in conjunction with England was dumping its Central Bank stock of silver (and gold) onto the market in order to prevent the price of these precious metals from rising against the U.S. dollar, which had been effectively the world’s reserve currency for 20 years. 
In fact, the silver-based U.S. coins were disappearing from the market because the value of the silver content in these coins had risen above the face value of the coins. It was real-time proof of Gresham’s Law. In effect, it was an effort by the U.S. Government to de-monetize silver, which has been civilized history’s oldest monetary metal. The U.S. could not yet de-monetize gold because, based on the Bretton Woods Agreement, the U.S. was required to back all Treasuries bonds issued to foreign buyers with gold. But a year after the last remnants of silver were removed from U.S.-minted coins, the Nixon Government disconnected gold from the reserve currency. 
Ultimately, silver will become re-monetized. Silver has been, is and always will be “poor man’s gold.” In today’s episode of The Daily Coin, we discuss the eventual re-monetization of silver. As a bonus, we describe the fraudulent nature of Tesla’s latest earnings report.",0
9706,Report: 540K Illegal Alien Court Cases Pending Nationwide,"There are more than 500, 000 pending immigration court cases for illegal aliens which will decide whether or not they are eligible to remain in the U. S. according to new data released. [In data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, released by Fox News, a tally of pending immigration cases show that there are approximately 542, 411 that have yet to be decided by an immigration judge.  That number means American taxpayers pay for illegal aliens to sometimes be held in detention centers for 673 days before their case even hits an immigration judge’s courtroom. In states with much larger migrant populations —  like Texas and California —  the wait period is even longer, running roughly three years. In sanctuary San Francisco, there are 38, 428 pending cases. U. S. Immigration Judge Dana Leigh Marks told Fox News that the massive backlog in immigration courts has been made worse, as administration after administration has done hardly nothing to remedy the problem. “We have been a neglected part of the immigration enforcement world for so long,” Marks said in the interview. “There are legitimate concerns about how long cases pend in the immigration court. ” The neglect could soon change with President Donald Trump’s administration, which is committing new plans and procedures to handle the immigration court backlog. In a letter from the Department of Justice (DOJ) the administration is expected to move 50 immigration judges to detention facilities in areas like Adelanto and San Diego, California, as well as Chicago, Illinois, as Breitbart Texas reported. Judges will hear cases from 6am to 6pm with two rotating shifts. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whose task it is to help remedy the problem, has long been a critic of the nation’s immigration system, arguing that lack of border security, a slow court process and influxes in   workers all put strain on social safety nets and American taxpayers.

9708,Comment on Bioethicists: Conscientious objectors to euthanasia and abortion should be banned from medical schools by stevor,"Posted on November 1, 2016 by Dr. Eowyn | 1 Comment 
Two bioethicists — UK professor Julian Savulescu and Canadian professor Udo Schuklenk — are urging that medical schools not admit prospective students who object to abortion and euthanasia. 
Julian Savulescu is director of the Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics at the University of Oxford, UK, and editor of the Journal of Medical Ethics ; Udo Schuklenk is the Ontario research chair in bioethics at Canada’s Queen’s University, and editor of the journal Bioethics . 
In a co-authored article titled, “ Doctors Have no Right to Refuse Medical Assistance in Dying, Abortion or Contraception ,” published by the journal Bioethics on Sept. 22, 2016, Savulescu and Schuklenk maintain that: Patients’ have an absolute right to abortion and to euthanasia or “assisted dying”. The problem is that there are doctors who conscientiously object. These doctors are respected for their “integrity” and given the prerogative not be involved in providing patients with abortion, artificial contraceptives, and euthanasia. Physicians who refuse to abort and euthanize should be punished or even fired. Conscientious objectors should be barred from admission into medical schools. 
Savulescu and Schuklenk write in the “Abstract” of their article: 
“[T]here should be better protections for patients from doctors’ personal values and there should be more severe restrictions on the right to conscientious objection, particularly in relation to assisted dying. We argue that eligible patients could be guaranteed access to medical services that are subject to conscientious objections by: (1) removing a right to conscientious objection; (2) selecting candidates into relevant medical specialities or general practice who do not have objections; (3) demonopolizing the provision of these services away from the medical profession. 
Some points made in their journal article by these two toxic men who actually pretend they are bioethicists: 
(1) Anti-Christian: 
Without naming it, Savulescu and Schuklenk blame Christianity — which they refer to only as “organized religion”— for the objection to abortion and euthanasia. As they put it: 
“The more religious a society is, the more religious values are imposed on people. Many of the conscientious objection protections we are grappling with today were written into constitutional arrangements in times gone by when the influence of churches was significantly more powerful than it is today. In strongly Christian societies, like Ireland, abortion remains illegal…. [Atheists] Richard Dawkins got it right, when he noted, ‘religion is not simply vicars giving tea parties. There are evil consequences.’” 
(2) Doctors should be denied the right to be a conscientious objector to abortion, euthanasia, and artificial contraception: 
“Enlightened, progressive secular countries like Sweden, have labour laws in line with our arguments. Sweden provides no legal right of employees to conscientious objection. Employees could be sacked for failing to provide legal services under labour law. The same holds true, for instance, for Finland…. These countries have resolutely prioritised patient access to care over the protection of doctors’ idiosyncratic moral convictions with regard to these services. Other countries ought to follow Sweden and Finland…. Conscientious refusal to provide contraception is common and mistakenly supported by medical boards and medical associations…. For religious GPs, obstetricians and pharmacists to refuse to provide the oral contraceptive pill is simply unprofessional. There is no requirement for a healthcare system to accommodate unprofessional behaviour…. If a professional norm [conscientious objection] is no longer fit for purpose, it should be changed.” 
(3) Doctors who are conscientious objectors should be punished or perhaps fired: 
“Doctors who did behave like this would be acting with a gross lack of professionalism and would therefore be subject to censure and appropriate remedies by their professional, statutory bodies…. [I]f society thinks contraception, abortion and assistance in dying are important, it should select people prepared to do them, not people whose values preclude them from participating. Equally, people not prepared to participate in such expected courses of action should not join professions tasked by society with the provision of such services.” 
(4) Medical schools should deny admission to conscientious objectors: 
“Therefore, even if we did not change the system for those already practising medicine, given that there is an oversupply of people capable and willing to become medical professionals, we should select those willing to provide the full scope of professional services, and those who are most capable. Medical schools and training programmes should carefully outline the nature of the job and screen for conscientious objection where it is relevant to job performance. Requirements of the job should be written into the contract. 
(5) Abolish medical doctors’ monopoly on medical care by licensing non-physicians to perform abortion and euthanasia: 
“Finally, if conscientious objection continues to be tolerated in medicine and results in treatment denial, alternative ways of guaranteeing reasonable and fair access to these goods ought to be provided. One way of doing this is to de-monopolize the provision of the relevant service. If the quality of such a service could match that provided by medical professionals, and sufficient supply could be ensured, then this would be a viable alternative. This would require new training, selection, regulatory and oversight procedures, which would be cumbersome and expensive. But there is no reason why only doctors could competently provide, for example, contraception, abortion or assisted dying services.” 
(6) Conscientious objector doctors are like the Nazis: 
“Part of the force behind respecting conscientious objection is a common commitment to ethical relativism: if that is what someone believes, then they are right to believe it, and that alone makes it a kind of truth…. But ethical relativism is practically ethical nihilism. If one accepted ethical relativism, the holocaust was, from the Nazi’s perspective, right.” 
Lastly, I find it curious that Savulescu and Schuklenk, with degrees in medicine, cannot distinguish between “reign” and “rein”. 
To “reign” is to be a sovereign or monarch; to “rein” is to curb. In their article, Savulescu and Schuklenk write that secular doctors who are conscientious objectors “ought to reign in their values too”. 
Tsk, tsk.

9709,UC Berkeley Administration Won’t Budge On Security Fees For MILO Event - Breitbart,"UC Berkeley’s administration has replied to the recent letter sent to them by Berkeley College Republicans regarding the security fee for Breitbart Senior editor MILO’s event at the university on February 1st. [Breitbart reported this week that Berkeley College Republicans drafted a letter to Berkeley College administration relating to the recent $6000 security fee imposed on MILO’s February 1st event at the college.  “Dear Chancellor Dirks, on behalf of the Berkeley College Republicans (“BCR”) we write in response to the University’s arbitrary and excessive, estimated $6, 370 security fee demand for the Milo Yiannopoulos event in Pauley Ballroom on February 1st. In effect, the University is restricting BCR’s constitutional rights to free expression on campus by charging fees for unsolicited security that amount to a tax on a “controversial” speaker. We are writing to request that this fee be waived in its entirety. The United States Supreme Court has held that “state colleges and universities are not enclaves immune from the sweep of the First Amendment. ” Healy v. James, 408 U. S. 169, 180 (1972). ” Further excerpts from the letter can be read here. Today Berkeley administration replied to the College Republicans. “Dear Berkeley College Republicans: “This responds to your letter to Chancellor Dirks which was sent by email to him and several other UC Berkeley administrators on January 11, 2017. ” begins the letter,  The First Amendment does not immunize event sponsors from the requirement to reimburse the University for the reasonable cost of providing basic event security, so long as security fees charged are not arbitrary or  . (See Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U. S. 569, 577 (1941).) It is the regular practice of the University to charge event sponsors such fees based on   factors such as the venue, the type of event, the number of anticipated guests, whether tickets are sold, and if the event is open to   guests.  The University has routinely and neutrally applied this policy to charge sponsors comparable fees for appearance of a wide range of speakers, including Anita Hill, Lewis Farrakhan, Will Farrell, Rand Paul, Justice Sonia Sotomayor and the Dalai Lama, and your claim that “Rio the best of BCR’s knowledge” security fees have not been charged for similar events is baseless. Similarly baseless is your contention that the University’s failure to give BCR special favorable treatment with regard to security fees is motivated by a desire to block your event.  This charge is especially galling in light of the fact that UCPD and LEAD Center staff have, as you are well aware, dedicated substantial resources and many hours —  including during the holidays and personal vacation time —  to working with BCR to allow your event to proceed smoothly, while at the same time BCR leadership has frequently abused these efforts by being late for pre arranged meetings and conference calls or entirely unresponsive.  You have also expressed concern about BCR’s ability to pay the basic security charge and asked that the normal security fee charged to all other event sponsors be waived for BCR. The University understands that BCR has sold 500 tickets for this event. The University is not in a position to treat BCR more favorably than other event sponsors nor to impose on the campus the out of pocket costs incurred by UCPD to provide basic support to student organizations’   events. The LEAD Center has provided BCR advice about additional revenue sources which may provide options for BCR to find funding. UCPD needs to receive a signed copy of the Police Services Request form promptly in order to approve the event from a security standpoint. If BCR decides that it cannot afford the event and must cancel, the University would appreciate receiving notice of that decision so that it can discontinue expending public resources on the planning process. Berkeley Assistant   Dan Mogulof also contacted Breitbart to “stress and reiterate that the security estimates for this event were compiled not by the campus administration, but by sworn officers —  law enforcement professionals —   —  in the University of California Police Department based on neutral, objective criteria. Just like every other   event. ” When asked for comment, Troy Worden of Berkeley College Republicans stated, “The University of California, Berkeley makes a mockery of the the ideals of the Free Speech Movement by responding to the Berkeley College Republicans in so   and   a letter. They belittle our efforts to work with them to provide the security they demand for our event, and then bewail the extra hours they have to put in to systematically snuff out our right to free speech. Let this much be clear: the university is imposing a comically large financial burden on our club for security that we did not request in the first place. ” Worden continued, “It should be the burden of the university to ensure the   political speech of all students  —   including conservatives such as the Berkeley College Republicans  —   is safeguarded from the mischief and violence of protesters. The lines are clearly drawn: the administration is bowing down to the demands of radical   and liberal university professors at UC Berkeley rather than treating all student groups equally. We will unceasingly pursue legal action to secure our rights in this matter. ” MILO’s event is still currently set to take place on February 1st at Berkeley University.

9710,NBC Takes Over Thursday Night Football Amid Promising Signs in TV Ratings - The New York Times,"NBC Sports will take over the “Thursday Night Football” franchise this week at a suddenly promising point in an N. F. L. season that has seen viewership plummet by   percentages in   games. The decline has concerned league and network officials and has prompted questioning over its causes. Had the contentious presidential election kept viewers away from football, especially when games competed with debates between Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton? Were there too many bad matchups and too few star turns? Were fans fed up with long commercial breaks? Were they ignoring games for online highlights? N. F. L. Commissioner Roger Goodell suggested last week that the league was considering ways to improve the pace of games, from running fewer advertisements to speeding up video reviews. So, Sunday was a litmus test. If the election had diminished football audiences, then the conclusion of the campaigns might lure fans back. The results suggested that a cloud had begun to lift, and that compelling games played by marquee teams would keep fans engaged. Seattle’s exciting   win over New England on Sunday night on NBC drew an average of 22. 5 million viewers, up 16 percent from the comparable game last season. Until then, NBC’s viewership had fallen by 18 percent this season, to 19. 3 million. Fox’s late afternoon broadcast of Dallas’s     victory over Pittsburgh generated a preliminary overnight rating of a 17. 8, the highest for any N. F. L. game this season (although it fell 3 percent from the comparable game on CBS last year). But CBS’s slate of games Sunday afternoon tumbled 28 percent from last year. NBC takes over the Thursday night games starting with New Orleans playing Carolina, teams with  . 500 records that might not give the network a lift to start its   schedule. But with the election over  —   as well as the baseball postseason that ended with 40 million people watching the Chicago Cubs clinch the World Series in Game 7  —   NBC is hoping to fare better than CBS and NFL Network did earlier this season. In five games through Oct. 20, CBS and NFL Network’s total viewership of 14. 7 million fell 16 percent from a year ago. CBS and NBC are paying the league a combined $450 million a year to carry five games apiece that they broadcast and NFL Network simulcasts. This is NBC’s first season on Thursday night games. CBS had carried eight games a season for two years. “I think we have very good games,” said Sam Flood, the executive producer of NBC Sports and NBCSN. “But we all know the back half of the season can be a bit of a crapshoot. You’re not sure who’s going to be great and who’s not going to be great. Who would have thought the Dallas Cowboys would be the best team in football right now, by their record? Minnesota started as the best team in the N. F. L. and has lost a few in a row. ” The Cowboys and the Vikings will play Dec. 1. NBC’s Thursday night schedule is a bit different from CBS’s, which took a break during Week 4. But NBC’s goes for six straight weeks because the Thanksgiving night game is part of its Sunday night package. “Our excitement is to have this run until the end of the season and into holiday shopping, which has a lot of advantages for our ad sales people,” Flood said Monday during a media gathering at a Manhattan restaurant. The N. F. L. has tried hard over the years to turn Thursday night games into an attraction that would bolster NFL Network and rival the older Sunday and Monday night franchises. The league has increased the number of Thursday night over the years, but it has found its biggest success in selling some of the games, first to CBS, and now to CBS and NBC, because broadcast networks reach larger audiences than a   channel like NFL Network. But Thursday night games have been less attractive to players, who dislike the short week of preparation time after Sunday, and to fans who see that the mostly divisional matchups don’t generally rival those of other   packages. The Thursday broadcasts have also become part of a discussion about whether the N. F. L. is overwhelming fans with too many games. Rodney Harrison, an analyst on NBC’s pregame show, said that he was looking less at the election as a factor in shrinking audiences than quality games. “The problem is you have to go back to earning the right to be on television rather than saying, ‘We have all these slots, on Sunday, Thursday, Sunday and Monday.’ ” The remark was targeted largely at the Thursday night package.   teams play at least one game on the Thursday night package that is being carried by CBS, NBC and NFL Network. The other three play on Thanksgiving.",0
9711,Does Killing Terrorist Leaders Make Any Difference? Scholars Are Doubtful - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   It seems obvious: Killing terrorist leaders should weaken their organizations, depriving those groups of strategic direction and ideological appeal. The death of someone like Abu Muhammad   a senior Islamic State figure reported killed on Tuesday in Syria, should seem like a significant setback for the group. But scholars have struggled to find evidence that killing leaders is an effective way to dismantle terrorist organizations, instead finding ample evidence that it makes little difference. That research seems to apply especially to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, whose attributes make it resilient to losing even a top figure like Mr. Adnani. Two features make a terrorist group able to withstand a senior officer’s death, according to research by Jenna Jordan, a Georgia Tech professor and a leading expert on the subject. The first is popular support. Groups need a steady stream of recruits and a pool of potential new leaders. Support among civilians in areas in which the groups primarily operate also makes them more stable, by broadening support networks and helping them to safely retrench when needed. Leaders are usually killed in or near communities that support them, resulting in those communities rallying behind the terrorist group and against whoever did the killing. While it might be difficult to imagine that a community would support the Islamic State, the group’s continued control over parts of Syria and Iraq and the recruits flooding in from abroad demonstrate its appeal. Religious groups are even better at absorbing attacks, Professor Jordan found, because their appeal is based on a shared identity that transcends any individual leader. The second feature is not something usually associated with groups like the Islamic State: bureaucracy. The more a terrorist group resembles a corporate organizational chart  —   often with administrative, payroll and logistical staff  —   the more stable it is, and the better able to handle a leader’s death. Just like any other bureaucracy, such groups have clearly delineated hierarchies, internal rules and divisions of responsibility. That clarity means it is easy to replace a leader with a deputy. It also makes the organization stable: If one cog falls out, the rest of the machine can still function. For a group as large and complex as the Islamic State, the infrastructure is simply too large for any one person, even a top leader, to make or break its future. This is why terrorism scholars have repeatedly concluded that killing or capturing terrorist leaders  —   a strategy known, colorfully, as “decapitation”  —   does not work. Robert A. Pape, a University of Chicago professor, wrote in a   2003 study that Israel and other governments had spent “over 20 years” focused on killing or capturing terrorist leaders and found “meager success. ” “Although decapitation of suicide terrorist organizations can disrupt their operations temporarily, it rarely yields   gains,” Professor Pape wrote. It can, in some cases, even backfire. Governments that engage in targeted killings risk resetting ongoing political negotiations. Daniel Byman, a Brookings Institution scholar who focuses on Israeli counterterrorism, has written that a policy of “decapitation” may have led Palestinian terrorist groups to decentralize, ultimately making them more of a threat. Still, the research is necessarily fuzzy. As one paper laments, definitive conclusions would require setting up an experimental terrorist group, which “is neither desirable nor feasible. ” That paper, by Patrick B. Johnston, a RAND Corporation researcher, is more supportive of “decapitation” strikes, however. Mr. Johnston found that repeated strikes against a terrorist group can, in some cases, increase the chances of a group’s defeat. But such strikes alone, he found, are not enough. What these studies share is an acknowledgment that terrorist groups are, in at least some important respects, a political phenomenon. They cannot be fully defeated without addressing their political roots, including whatever local support they enjoy. Abu Musab   the leader of Al Qaeda’s Iraq branch, was killed in 2006 as Iraqi Sunnis turned against the group in large numbers. His death was the result of his group’s decline, rather than a driver of it. Osama bin Laden’s death, in 2011, similarly came after a   ground war to uproot Al Qaeda from Afghanistan and accompanying efforts in Pakistan. If killing terrorist leaders does little on its own to defeat terrorist groups, then why do countries like the United States make such frequent use of this strategy? Consider where this strategy has been deployed: Syria, Somalia, Pakistan’s tribal regions and Yemen. These are places where the United States might believe it has few, if any, options. Targeting terrorist leaders might not make much difference, but it is cheap, it is low risk for the United States (though not always for civilians in the vicinity of strikes) and it allows American leaders to credibly say they are doing something. But there is little evidence that these deaths, whatever their political value in the United States, make much of a difference on the ground.",0
9712,"She Disappeared Without A Trace In 1850, Then They Found This Years Later","posted by Eddie Olive Oatman was born in Illinois in 1837. At the tender age of 14, Olive’s family were travelling alone to seek a better life in California. On the fourth day of their journey, family was attacked by a group of Native Americans. Only three of the Oatmans survived the attack. Olive’s parents and four of their children were killed, and Olive’s brother Lorenzo was clubbed and left for dead. Fortunately, he eventually reached a settlement and was able to carry on his journey, believing his entire family dead. Olive and her seven-year-old sister Mary Ann were captured by the Yavapai people, and were sent to their tribe to be used as slaves. For over 60 miles, the two girls were led through the Sonoran Desert to the tribe’s village. After a year, a group of Mohave Indians visited the village and traded two horses, vegetables, blankets, and other trinkets for the captive girls. Head over to the next page to find out the incredible story of what happened next. Both Oatman girls were tattooed on their chins and arms, in keeping with the tribal custom. During 1855, the tribe experienced a dire shortage of food supplies and ten-year-old Mary Ann died of starvation, along with many Mohaves. Because Olive did not know that her brother had survived the massacre, she believed she had no immediate family left, and the Mohave raised her as their own. She was given a clan name, Oach, and a nickname, Spantsa, a Mohave word having to do with unquenchable lust. Head over to the next page to discover how Olive finally managed to escape. After several years, rumours eventually began to surface of a white woman living with the Mohaves. Finally, after some intense negotiations with the Europeans, it was agreed she should be set free. When she arrived at what was to be her new home, Olive was dressed in traditional Mohave attire, which meant she wore nothing above the waist. Olive’s topless look is one echoed in the present day by women’s movement leader Inna Shevchenko. The following video, which was shot during a far right rally in Paris, four topless Ukrainian feminists occupied a rooftop holding a sign that read “Sextermination for Nazism”. The women were eventually brought down by firemen and shielded from the attacking demonstrators by police. Source:",0
9713,Mothers and Daughters Divided by Refugee Ban Encounter the Guilt of Good Fortune - The New York Times,"Sana Mustafa considers herself “the privileged one” in the family. A    Syrian refugee who made it to the United States, she has a college degree and an apartment in a quiet,   village in the Hudson Valley. She speaks out, freely and without fear, about the rights of refugees like herself. “But I feel so much guilt,” she said. “My life is moving forward. Their life has been put on hold. ” She means her mother and younger sister, Ghena. They live as refugees in a border town in Turkey, fearful of saying too much. Ms. Mustafa’s father was picked up by the Syrian authorities nearly four years ago and hasn’t been heard from since. Her older sister, Wafa, fled to Germany. President Trump’s executive order freezing refugee resettlement also froze her family’s hopes of living together in the United States. The ensuing legal challenges to the order bring little clarity. About 2, 000 refugees are expected to come into the country over a   period that was to start on Monday. But there are thousands more waiting in line overseas to join family members who are already here, like Ms. Mustafa. These families remain suspended in a state of uncertainty  —   and those who were able to get out say they feel a gnawing sense of guilt. In Knoxville, Tenn. an Iraqi woman who arrived five months ago has no explanation to offer her    twin daughters, who are stranded back home. They cry every time she calls. In Clarkston, Ga. a Somali mother fears for her daughter, 20, who was supposed to come on Feb. 6, but remains in a refugee camp in Kenya. The family had fled Somalia after gunmen stormed their home and raped and killed another daughter. That memory only makes things worse. “I am unable to sleep or eat,” the mother, Habibo Abdikadir Mohamed, 38, said through an interpreter this past week. “I’m not sure she will be safe. I’ve already lost one daughter. I’m worried I will lose another. ” Exactly how many families are divided like these is not known. A United States government lawyer said Friday that 100, 000 visas had been revoked, while the State Department said the number was closer to 60, 000. The rules are changing so fast, it’s impossible to predict the fate of relatives left behind. On Jan. 27, Mr. Trump signed the order suspending the resettlement of refugees from any country for four months, adding that Syrians seeking asylum would be barred indefinitely. Syrians and nationals from six other   countries, including Iraq and Somalia, would be unable to visit even if they had valid visas. Then, federal judges quashed the ban, at least temporarily. The State Department said it would allow refugees who had already been approved to fly to the United States, until Feb. 17. There were nearly 20, 000 people in that category  —   vetted and screened by multiple government agencies  —   according to the International Organization for Migration, a United Nations agency that arranged travel for the refugees. It was scrambling to get about 10 percent of them on planes to the United States in the next 10 days. That didn’t bring much comfort to Meathaq Alaunaibi of Iraq. Her husband worked for 10 years as a translator for the United States Agency for International Development in Baghdad. Their home was shelled in 2006, an attack that she believes was done by militants because of his work with American officials. Her husband’s hand was burned by a car bomb in 2014. Still, it took four years for their visa application to be approved, and last summer, the couple, their    daughter and their    son landed in Knoxville. But there was a new wrinkle. Because the process took so long, their twin daughters, Aisha and Fatima, had just turned 18. They were told that they would have to be screened anew. One is in medical school in Baghdad the other is in dentistry school in Kirkuk. Ms. Alaunaibi calls them every day, even if only to tell them to wait. “They just cry. ‘Why this happened to us? We love the U. S. A. We want to live in the U. S. A. ,’” Ms. Alaunaibi, 45, said of their response. “You know, they are young, they are ambitious, they are smart and responsible. So this is a shock to them. ” Ms. Mohamed, the Somali mother in Clarkston, was waiting anxiously to hear whether her eldest daughter would be among those who could come. Ms. Mohamed’s family arrived in Georgia on Jan. 18, after 10 years in a refugee camp in Kenya. She had fled Somalia after gunmen stormed her home and raped one of her daughters in front of her. Ms. Mohamed’s sister and    were killed, too, so she took in her sister’s two children, in addition to her own seven. The last of the family, Batulo Abdalla Ramadhan, 20, was scheduled to leave Kenya on Monday. But then came the ban last month. Her travel was canceled, she called to tell her parents. They could hear the grief in her voice. “She’s always asking us, ‘What do I do? ’” said Ms. Mohamed’s husband, Abdalla Ramadhan Munye. “She feels hurt that we left her behind. Only thing we can do is to listen to her and feel her pain. ” Mr. Munye said he wanted to deliver a message to the first lady, Melania Trump. “As a mother,” he said, “she knows how difficult it would be to be separated from a child. ” Sana Mustafa from Syria said her parents had encouraged her and her sister to get out of the country as soon as they could after the Syrian civil war began. Ms. Mustafa received a   fellowship funded by the State Department to visit Washington in the summer of 2013. “I applied, out of the blue, online, in the middle of the war,” she said. “My dad said, ‘Go. ’” That was one of her last conversations with him. A businessman known for his opposition to President Bashar  ’s government, her father was picked up in July 2013, while Ms. Mustafa was in Washington. Her plans changed immediately. There was no chance of going back to Syria. She slept on the sofas of strangers who took her in. She applied for political asylum in the United States, and quickly got it. To make ends meet, she worked as a hostess at a restaurant, then as a   babysitter. Through friends of friends, she landed a full scholarship at Bard College in upstate New York. She graduated last year. Her mother, Lamia Zreik, has not been as lucky. She fled with her other two daughters, Wafa and Ghena, after her husband was detained in 2013. They went to Gaziantep, Turkey  —   the border town now home to hundreds of thousands of Syrians  —   and in 2014, hoping to join Sana, applied for resettlement to the United States. They were interviewed four times  —   by United Nations officials, then by American officials. One year passed, then two. When Wafa, who had been supporting the family, got a chance to go to Germany, Ms. Zreik told her that she couldn’t possibly pass it up. “We had two options  —   either she stays or I work,” Ms. Zreik said by telephone from Gaziantep, where she works with Syrian children orphaned by the war. “And the first wasn’t really an option. ” In early January, the first bad news came: an email informing Ms. Zreik that she and her daughter would have to undergo more security screenings. Ms. Mustafa was visiting Gaziantep at the time. “Three years wasn’t enough for screening?” she said. “I was very devastated. I was actually very angry. ” For a while, neither of them told Ghena, 16, the bad news. Then came the executive order. Ms. Mustafa said Ghena had taken it the hardest. “She was very sad,” she said. “She said: ‘We’re not going anywhere. No one is taking us. ’” The family has applied for resettlement to France and Canada. Wafa, 26 and studying in Berlin, said she could not sponsor them to Germany until she could prove she could support them financially. Wafa’s own good fortune weighs on her. “I’m thinking about this every day,” she said. “I have to find a way to help my mom and my sister. ” For now, there’s no place they can be together. “I can’t express my deep anger,” Ms. Zreik said. “We are a small family. Without my husband, and each girl in a different country, we can’t see each other. ”",0
9714,"No Food, No Medicine, No Respite: A Starving Boy’s Death in Venezuela - The New York Times","MATURÍN, Venezuela  —   His name was Kevin Lara Lugo, and he died on his 16th birthday. He spent the day before foraging for food in an empty lot, because there was nothing to eat at home. Then in a hospital because what he found made him gravely ill. Hours later, he was dead on a gurney, which doctors rolled by his mother as she watched helplessly. She said the hospital had lacked the simplest supplies needed to save him on that day last July. “I have a tradition that in the morning of their birthdays, I wake up my children and sing to them,” his mother, Yamilet Lugo, said. “How could I do that when my son was dead?” Venezuela has suffered from so many ailments this year. Inflation has driven office workers to abandon the cities and head to illegal pit mines in the jungle, willing to subject themselves to armed gangs and multiple bouts of malaria for the chance to earn a living. Doctors have prepared to operate on bloody tables because they did not have enough water to clean them. Psychiatric patients have had to be tied to chairs in mental hospitals because there was no medication left to treat their delusions. Hunger has driven some people to  riot  —   and others into rickety fishing boats, fleeing Venezuela on reckless journeys by sea. But it was the story of a boy with no food, who had gone searching for wild roots to eat but ended up poisoning himself instead, that seemed to embody everything that had gone wrong in Venezuela. The country’s economic crisis had spent months encircling his family, only to snatch away its   son. His neighborhood, on the edge of what was once a prosperous oil boomtown, had long been running out of basics like corn flour and bread. The cutlery factory where Ms. Lugo had worked shut down in May because it could no longer obtain the materials to make plastic, joining many across the country that have gone idle. That left the family unable to buy what food was left. At the hospital, Ms. Lugo said, there was no respite. Like so many clinics throughout the country, the one in Maturín ran out of basic supplies like intravenous solutions, leaving the family to search the city and haggle with   sellers in the hours before Kevin died. “This boy dies this way for no reason at all,” said Lilibeth Díaz, his aunt, looking at Kevin’s grave, his name etched in wet concrete by a friend’s fingertip. Kevin is the baby in the overalls in the picture on his mother’s wall, the one who earned the perfect attendance awards. They still hang on the walls, too. The markers in the kitchen wall ticked off his growth. By 12, he was about 4 feet 11 inches by 14, he was four inches taller. His name is scribbled in child’s writing on a light switch in the bedroom he and his mother shared. “Active Kevin” says another doodle on a cabinet there. On her cellphone, Ms. Lugo stared at a picture of her embracing her son last year, on the front porch he had painted yellow. She has changed a lot since then. Her collarbone now protrudes from her neck. “I weigh 40 kilos now,” she said, 88 pounds. Kevin was losing weight, too. By spring, everyone in the family was. Then José Rafael Castro, Ms. Lugo’s boyfriend and the only other breadwinner in the household, came home with bad news: The construction supply factory where he worked making cinder blocks had let him go because the owners could no longer find cement. First, the family ate mangoes. By summer, it had turned to yuca, which grew in a plot owned by a relative a short bus ride away. “This was our food morning, noon and night,” Ms. Lugo said. By July, there was no money even for the bus fare to the field, the family said. It started looking elsewhere. Kevin’s birthday was coming up. The family knew this would be his first without a cake, but it had devised a solution: A neighbor down the street was celebrating a birthday and had offered to set aside a slice of cake for Kevin. Still, the family needed something to eat that night. It had gone three days without food, and everyone was growing weak. There were few options. This was not the capital, Caracas, where food was often scarce in the barrios, but at least there was always another shop or   seller to try. Nor was it the border, where foreign products could be bought. Instead, the family lived deep in Venezuela’s interior, where even cooking oil was scarce and products like bread and corn flour vanished almost as quickly as they arrived in stores. At times chicken was available, but the price was too high. Kevin and Mr. Castro had heard about an abandoned field a   walk from their home where other neighbors had been foraging for bitter yuca. As they emerged from the field, four men with pistols surrounded them and demanded their cellphones, Mr. Castro said. It was a narrow brush with disaster, and the two men breathed a sigh of relief that they still had the yuca. They did not know the worst was to come. The family knew the risks of bitter yuca and had tried to dry it to extract the toxins, a practice used to make a dried bread served locally. “We had nothing else to eat,” Mr. Castro said. But by 11:30 p. m. on July 25, the night before Kevin’s birthday, the family was getting sick. Mr. Castro said he was vomiting. Kevin was on the floor. Because they had no car, an hour passed before they found a neighbor’s car to take Kevin to the hospital. As he finally left, Kevin remembered the piece of cake. “I will be back tomorrow for it,” Ms. Lugo recalled him saying. Yuca intoxication is treated with gastric suction, also called stomach pumping, and intravenous solutions, among other measures. But Kevin’s family said he had waited untreated for hours in the crowded halls of the Manuel Núñez Tovar hospital, without being examined by a doctor. Dr. Luis Briceño, the hospital’s director, said it was a common situation at his hospital, which is stretched thin. Sometimes his emergency room, with a capacity for 200 people, is packed with 450 patients seeking help. “There is always someone who doesn’t receive treatment,” Dr. Briceño said. He said medical shortages were so common that patients often had to find and buy their own supplies, like intravenous solutions, though he thought the hospital probably had some the night Kevin arrived. But Ms. Lugo said a nurse had told the family to go out and buy the intravenous solution itself. Relatives found it from a   seller. The cost  —   about $4  —   was more than they could afford. Finally, another family with extra bottles of the solution gave two to Kevin, but there was little change in his condition. Around 4 a. m. on July 26, the morning of his birthday, Kevin could barely speak. “His stomach felt like stone,” his mother said. Ms. Lugo was alone with her son. She recalled a black liquid oozing from his mouth. Then, at 4:45 a. m. Kevin was dead. The next morning, Jesús Maestre, a    friend of Kevin’s, saw his friends gathered outside the hall in Kevin’s school. They were speaking in hushed tones. “They asked, ‘Did you hear what happened to Kevin? ’” he said. “Then it hit me  —   he was gone. ” Kevin’s coffin was trailed by a long parade of friends the day of his funeral, a path his mother retraces every Sunday when she visits the grave. On a recent day, she pointed out the Catholic church where he was baptized and the street he played on as a child. A cousin of his walked by. “Look at him,” she said. “They look exactly the same. ” And she said it again: “Since my mother raised me, and now with my children, we always had a tradition of singing ‘Happy Birthday’ in the morning. ” The day of the funeral, she sang the song before the coffin was lowered. “We did everything together,” Ms. Lugo said later, pointing to the headstone where her son’s name had been etched in wet concrete. Gesturing toward the empty plot beside it, she said, “They will bury me there one day. ” But back home, there were more mouths to feed. Ms. Lugo had given birth to another child two months before. Her    daughter, Kimberlit, had recently given birth, too. The two spent an afternoon nursing the babies together on the porch. That was the only food in the household. There was nothing in the kitchen.",0
9715,California Today: Latino Power Rising - The New York Times,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Sign up.) The election of Donald J. Trump has left many California Latinos feeling on edge. But one Election Day outcome has given Latino groups that opposed Mr. Trump a measure of encouragement  —   the largest ever Congressional Hispanic Caucus. “It’s historic what actually happened,” said Chuck Rocha, a political consultant. Latinos now make up nearly 40 percent of California’s population. Election analysts said strong Latino turnout played a crucial part in contests throughout the West, including the election of Catherine Cortez Masto, of Nevada, who will become the first Latina senator. As a result, the Hispanic caucus will grow from 26 to 31 members, with more than a third from California. Representative Linda Sánchez, the caucus chairwoman, said members had already asked for a meeting with Mr. Trump. “Obviously, we are going to be pushing back on some of the really divisive and flawed policies that Donald Trump has discussed with respect to the Latino community,” said Ms. Sánchez, whose district includes southeastern Los Angeles. How much clout the lawmakers can wield on issues like immigration policy, a major concern, is uncertain given the Republican control of the White House and chambers of Congress. Nanette D. Barragán, a Democrat who won an open seat representing a heavily Latino part of Los Angeles, said many of her constituents were fearful about Mr. Trump’s plans. “I just think having us at the table being a part of the conversation is so very important with a president like this,” she said. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump said he has nothing against immigrants but vowed to deport all of those who are in the country illegally, an estimated 11 million people. Speaking in an interview on “60 Minutes” that was broadcast on Sunday, the   appeared to soften that stance, saying he would seek to deport just those undocumented immigrants with criminal backgrounds, and only up to three million of them. Salud Carbajal, who was elected to Congress from the Central Coast, said immigrant leaders have always supported efforts to deport people who have committed serious crimes. The question is how broadly a Trump administration would define the group. “Am I glad that he has lowered the number? Yes,” Mr. Carbajal said. But, he added, “The devil’s in the details. ” • “That is not our job”: The Los Angeles police chief said he would not help deport immigrants under a Trump administration.

[The New York Times] People once thought Yosemite’s El Capitan was unclimbable. It was this month in 1958 that Warren Harding, a Californian, proved them wrong, ascending the   granite monolith for the first time. Mr. Harding, along with a series of partners, climbed the   Nose route in stages over the course of 18 months. They fixed ropes to the wall that hung to the ground and allowed the climbers to quickly return to where they had left off. Altogether, it took about 45 days of climbing to reach the top in freezing weather on Nov. 12. The feat redefined what was thought possible in the infant sport, and ushered in an era of big wall climbing. Mr. Harding continued rock climbing through the 1970s, making about 30 first ascents in Yosemite and becoming a legend of the sport’s golden age. He died in 2002 at his home near Anderson in Shasta County at age 77. Today, the latest generation of elite climbers is taking the sport to new levels. Last year, Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson scaled one of El Capitan’s most difficult routes, the Dawn Wall  —   without the benefit of ropes, other than to catch their falls. Some considered it the hardest climb in the world. California Today goes live at 6 a. m. Pacific time weekdays. Tell us what you want to see: CAtoday@nytimes. com.

9716,Review: ‘Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life’ Revives a Snow Globe Town - The New York Times,"Stars Hollow, Conn. would make a great “Twilight Zone” setting. There is something unearthly about the adorable little town. The people are eccentric and hale and smiley  —   maybe too smiley. It feels cut off from the world  —   you can barely even get a cellular signal  —   as if, in the words of Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) “The entire town was constructed in a giant snow globe. ” But “Gilmore Girls,” being revived with a     on Netflix on Friday, is the opposite of a horror story. It’s a comfort story. For seven seasons, then an afterlife in syndication and streaming, it poured its audience bottomless refills of   quirk and the highly caffeinated repartee of Lorelai and her daughter and best friend, Rory (Alexis Bledel). There’s always the danger, with cultural nostalgia, that sweetness can tip over into something uncanny and eerie. There’s a fine line between celebrating the past and exhuming it. “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” stays, mostly, on the good side of that line. So many things are much like we remember them: Miss Patty’s ballet studio, the Sam Phillips “la la la”s on the soundtrack, the troubadour in the town square. But it really works because, for all its winks and callbacks and   weaponized nostalgia, it also recognizes that things have changed. “A Year in the Life” was conceived as a kind of  . The creator, Amy   left the original series after six seasons (along with her husband and writing partner, Daniel Palladino) in a contract dispute. “Gilmore Girls” sputtered on for one   final season, but Ms.   wasn’t there to execute the ending that she had planned down to the series’ last four words. Though the   does end on those four words, “A Year in the Life” is not, and can’t be, the final season we never got. The biggest reminder is a change forced on the show: Edward Herrmann, who played the patriarch Richard Gilmore, died in 2014. His loss becomes the emotional engine of the   just as the original series was driven by the strain between Lorelai and her grande dame mother, Emily (Kelly Bishop) lingering from when Lorelai became pregnant with Rory at 16. “A Year in the Life” begins in early 2016, four months after Richard’s death, which has resurfaced bitter feelings between Lorelai and Emily. Rory, now a peripatetic journalist, comes home to figure herself out, see old friends and walk and talk with her mother through the town’s    snowscape. On the surface, little has changed. Luke Danes (Scott Patterson) Lorelai’s old squeeze, is still haranguing the customers at his diner, though now over   abuse rather than cellphone use. The   references still fly, updated to include “Game of Thrones,” “Outlander” and man buns. But Rory is 32 now, the same age as Lorelai when the series began in 2000. (On one level, the entire   is a “Wanna Feel Old?” listicle.) This is a   story, down to the structure  —   four   episodes, one for each season. Rory is feeling her age Lorelai is feeling her mortality Emily is feeling both heartbreak and the opportunity to change. The   is sentimental but not maudlin, and Ms. Graham and Ms. Bledel quickly fall back into their   comedic rhythm. “Wow. I’m winded,” Rory says after their first verbal tap dance. “Haven’t done that for a while,” Lorelai answers. There’s more of that   and a parade of “Well hello, you!” cameos. You will likely be indulged no matter whom you consider the best supporting character. (The correct answer, by the way, is Paris Geller, Rory’s former classmate played by Liza Weil, who gets an update that shows off her brittle imperiousness.) “A Year in the Life” plays like a   movie in four acts. The format establishes it, like Netflix’s “Arrested Development,” as something different from the series’   seasons. But there’s some bloat, including a “Waiting for Guffman”  community musical interlude, featuring Christian Borle and Sutton Foster, that runs 10 minutes and would have been better at 10 seconds. And elements of Rory’s plot feel like they were intended more for a character in her early 20s  —   as Ms.   originally planned  —   than one in her early 30s. Mostly, though, “A Year in the Life” succeeds at recreating the voice of “Gilmore Girls,” which is what creates the world of “Gilmore Girls. ” Like Lake Wobegon or Mayberry, Stars Hollow is a wish in the shape of a town, an idyll where everything is low stakes. Townspeople argue, but mostly over things like an international food fair or a proposed sewer system. They have decent, not overly demanding jobs, blue collar and white. Young adults who fail to launch can come home to their parents’ cozy houses (a running joke in one episode). Stars Hollow is not just a safety net, it’s a giant, fluffy featherbed. This is an eternal fantasy, but it’s well timed for the Thanksgiving weekend after an election that has made fractious Emilys and Lorelais of many relatives. (There are few political references beyond a quick allusion to “Brexit,” but it’s noteworthy that the story wraps in the fall, just as real America is about to head off to the polls.) In that sense, there is something sinister hiding, “Twilight Zone”  behind its facade of quirky comity: our world. Call “Gilmore Girls” a bubble or, if you’re a romantic, a snow globe. It’s not a horror story, though, except that in the end the characters get to stay, and the rest of us have to leave.",0
9717,‘Justice Nightmare’: 32 Years in Texas Prisons After Conviction Voided - The New York Times,"The legal record shows that Jerry Hartfield’s first murder conviction was thrown out on appeal, and for the next 32 years, he was not officially guilty of anything, not sentenced to anything. Yet he spent that time in Texas prisons, in what an appellate court now calls “a criminal justice nightmare. ” He was finally tried and convicted again in 2015, but on Thursday, Mr. Hartfield moved closer to freedom than he has been in decades. A state Court of Appeals ruled that he was not only denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial, but to a degree the court had neither seen nor imagined before it noted that the important precedents dealt with delays of three years, six years, eight years  —   not 32. The   panel dismissed the indictment against Mr. Hartfield, who is developmentally disabled, in effect erasing the recent conviction. But it is still not clear whether, or when, he will get out of prison. Prosecutors could appeal Thursday’s ruling to the Court of Criminal Appeals, Texas’ highest criminal tribunal. The state Attorney General’s Office, which has argued against Mr. Hartfield, referred questions to the Matagorda County District Attorney’s Office, which did not reply to requests for comment. “We are deeply mindful that our conclusion today means that a defendant who may be guilty of murder may go free,” Judge Gina M. Benavides wrote for the Court of Appeals. “However, based on the United States Constitution, it is the only possible remedy. ” All told, Mr. Hartfield, now 60, has spent more than 40 years behind bars for the murder of a bus station ticket clerk. His case can seem like something out of absurdist fiction: a court ruling ignored or forgotten, an appeal dismissed by a court that agreed with the substance but said it had been filed under the wrong statute, a retrial after most of the evidence had been lost and witnesses had died, and an argument by prosecutors that Mr. Hartfield, himself, was to blame for the delays, and caused them intentionally. “Once you call this Kafkaesque, you can’t really call anything else Kafkaesque, because there’s nothing else remotely like this,” said David R. Dow of the University of Houston Law Center, one of the lawyers who represented Mr. Hartfield on appeal. “This was the perfect storm of everything that could go wrong with the criminal justice system. ” On Sept. 17, 1976, Eunice Lowe, a    white woman, was killed where she worked, the Continental Trailways station in Bay City, southwest of Houston. The killer bashed in her head with a pickax, stole money from the station and took her car, and there was evidence of sexual assault after death. Mr. Hartfield, a black man, signed a confession that he later disavowed, and, crucially, investigators said he told them where to find Ms. Lowe’s car. Experts placed his I. Q. in the 50s or 60s, which his lawyers contend made him easily coerced by detectives, and unable to understand his rights or his confession. A jury convicted him and he was sentenced to death. But the Court of Criminal Appeals later overturned that verdict, ruling that a potential juror had been improperly dismissed for having doubts about the death penalty, and ordered a new trial. After years of legal wrangling, the high court ruling took effect in March 1983. Under Texas law at the time, prosecutors had a way to avoid a retrial and preserve the conviction  —   but only if they acted within a time frame set by the court. Because the trial error had to do with capital punishment, if the governor commuted the sentence to life in prison, then it would be as if the appellate court had never ruled, and the guilty verdict would remain in effect. That was apparently never communicated to the prison system. Mr. Dow said that Mr. Hartfield thought he was awaiting a new trial, but did not have the capacity to understand the delay or what to do about it. Whether the District Attorney’s Office understood what had happened at the time is unclear, but it never took steps to retry him, and the case lay dormant for the next 23 years. Prosecutors have argued that Mr. Hartfield had legal representation all along, because his original defense team remained his lawyers of record until a court formally dismissed them in 2013. But Mr. Hartfield’s new lawyers say he had no legal counsel from 1983, when the original team thought they were done with the case, until a federal court appointed a lawyer in 2008. Starting in 2006, a fellow inmate helped Mr. Hartfield file motions in various courts. Some were rejected outright, and at least one apparently went to the wrong office. One federal judge ruled in his favor, but another said he had to keep trying in state court. Finally, in 2013, Texas’ Court of Criminal Appeals ruled that Mr. Hartfield’s conviction and life sentence were void, but his motions were also void. The motions were filed under a law applying to people who have been convicted, the court said, and there was no valid conviction on record in his case. He refiled under a different provision, and prosecutors finally sought a new trial. Mr. Hartfield’s lawyers said the charges should be dismissed because he was denied a speedy trial. Prosecutors argued that while the government was negligent, the defendant was partly to blame for the delays. For more than two decades, they said, he acquiesced in his imprisonment without trial, as a ploy to avoid the death penalty and to make it harder to mount a case against him. (The Supreme Court ruled in 2002 that intellectually disabled people cannot be executed.) The District Attorney’s Office was able to locate just one of the 16 evidence exhibits used at the original trial, several witnesses had died, and at least one had dementia. The murder weapon was lost, along with blood and semen samples that could have yielded DNA. Ms. Lowe’s car no longer existed. But the trial court ruled that the case could proceed, and in 2015, 38 years after his first trial, Mr. Hartfield was convicted again and sentenced to life in prison. If that sentence were counted from the start of his time in prison, he would have been eligible for parole long ago. If he is released based on Thursday’s ruling, he would probably live with one of his two sisters, Mr. Dow said. “I’m not sure if he knows about this ruling yet,” Mr. Dow said. “I think it’s unlikely he really understands it very well. ”",0

Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20, giving their party full control of the government, Republicans plan quick action on several of their top priorities  —   most notably a measure to clear a path for the Affordable Care Act’s repeal. Perhaps the first thing that will happen in the new Congress is the push for deregulation. Also up early: filling a   Supreme Court seat, which is sure to set off a pitched showdown, and starting confirmation hearings for Mr. Trump’s cabinet nominees. “It’s a big job to actually have responsibility and produce results,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. “And we intend to do it. ” But as Republicans plan to reserve the first 100 days of Congress for their more partisan goals, Democrats are preparing roadblocks. The party’s brutal   wounds have been salted by evidence of Russian election interference, Mr. Trump’s   cabinet picks and his taunting Twitter posts. (On Saturday, he offered New Year’s wishes “to all,” including “those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don’t know what to do. ”) Obstacles will also come from Republicans, who are divided on how to proceed with the health care law and a pledge to rewrite the tax code. Some are also skittish about certain policy proposals, like vast changes to Medicare, that could prove unpopular among the broad electorate. And any burst of legislative action will come only if Congress can break free of its longstanding tendency toward gridlock. For Republicans, the path to this moment has been long and transparently paved  —   the House in particular has signaled the Republican policy vision through bills it has been passing for years. But many of those measures have gathered dust in the Senate or been doused in veto ink. The cleft between the two chambers recalls the situation faced by the insurgent House Republican majority in the  . Speaker Newt Gingrich took control with a determined agenda, only to be stymied by the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, who stacked conservative House bills like so many fire logs in the back of the Senate chamber. “They’ve been given a golden opportunity here,” said Trent Lott, the former Republican Senate majority leader. “But I have watched over the years when one party has had control of the White House and the Senate and the House, and the danger is overplaying your hand. “If you go too far, like what happened with Obamacare, and you get no support at all from the other side, you have a problem,” Mr. Lott continued. “You have to find a way to work with people across the aisle who will work with you. ” The tax overhaul and an infrastructure bill may be two opportunities for bipartisan cooperation the Senate Finance Committee is already moving in that direction. Still, both of those issues are expected to remain on the back burner, despite promises to the contrary from Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, Reince Priebus. The Senate may be narrowly divided, but among the 48 senators in the Democratic caucus are 10 who will stand for   in two years in states that voted for Mr. Trump. Republicans are counting on their support, at least some of the time. But on many issues, Senate Democrats  —   including their new leader, Chuck Schumer of New York  —   are expected to pivot from postelection carping to active thwarting, using complex Senate procedures and political messaging to slow or perhaps block elements of Mr. Trump’s agenda. “After campaigning on a promise to help the middle class,   Trump’s postelection actions suggest he intends to do the exact opposite after he’s sworn in,” said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. “Democrats will do everything we can to fight back if he continues to pursue an agenda prioritizing billionaires and big corporations while devastating   families and the economy. ” Republicans have chafed for years at a host of rules, many   that President Obama has issued through the regulatory process, and they have been advising the Trump team on which ones should be undone. “I hear probably more about the strangulation of regulations on business and their growth and their development than probably anything else,” the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, said at a recent forum. “I think if we can provide regulatory relief right away, that can breathe a sigh of relief into the economy. ” In late December, the Obama administration rolled out a major new environmental regulation intended to rein in   mining. That regulation, one of dozens that Mr. Trump is expected to reverse, is meant to go into effect one day before his inauguration. But Congress is likely to block it, using the obscure Congressional Review Act, which permits lawmakers to undo new regulations with only 51 Senate votes within the first 60 legislative days of the rules’ completion. Given time constraints on the Senate floor, members will have to pick some priorities. They are expected to train their sights on a rule that requires oil and gas producers to reduce methane gases, another that requires mining and fossil fuel companies to disclose payments they have made to foreign governments to extract natural resources, and still others that restrict pesticide use. Republicans will also move quickly to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They plan to pass a truncated budget resolution for the remainder of the fiscal year  —   already a quarter over  —   that includes special instructions ensuring that the final repeal legislation could circumvent any Democratic filibuster. But Republican leaders have not settled on a health care plan to replace Mr. Obama’s, and they may delay the repeal measure’s effective date for years. The Senate must also consider Mr. Trump’s cabinet picks, and Senate Democrats are already trying to slow the process. However, they cannot do much more than that, because when they were in charge, they changed the rules so that presidential nominees other than Supreme Court picks need only 51 votes to be confirmed. Previously, such nominations could face a filibuster, which required 60 votes to overcome. Democratic leaders have encouraged members to avoid meeting with Mr. Trump’s nominees until they have turned over their tax returns and made other disclosures. Republicans have been particularly upset that Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, whom Mr. Trump picked quickly to be attorney general, has either not gotten meetings with Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee or had meetings canceled. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California postponed her meeting with Mr. Sessions until January because, she said, her schedule got too busy. “The senator doesn’t want to rush,” said her spokesman, Tom Mentzer. One reason that Democrats are in no hurry is their bitterness over Mr. McConnell’s refusal last year to hold a hearing on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland. Lingering in the background is the specter of Russia. Democrats  —   and some Republicans, who are at odds with Mr. Trump on the issue and may at times be a brake on him  —   want a vigorous investigation of its efforts to disrupt the election. The Obama administration, which took sweeping steps last week to punish the Russians over election hacking, will release a report this month that is likely to serve as a turning point in those discussions. While Republicans may have a rare chance to open the flow of legislation, the party’s leaders are acutely aware of the punishment that Americans have historically delivered in midterm elections when things have not gone well. “This is no time for hubris,” Mr. McConnell said. “You have to perform. ”",0
9720,"After Earthquake in Italy, ‘Half the Town No Longer Exists’ - The New York Times","AMATRICE, Italy  —   The chaos came in the middle of the night. People were screaming and dying in the darkness across Amatrice, a summer getaway in central Italy famous as the birthplace of a pasta dish made with tomatoes and pork cheeks. It was 3:36 a. m. when the 6. 2 magnitude earthquake hit, followed by a succession of strong aftershocks  —   including one nearly as strong an hour later  —   that flattened houses and buried residents in the rubble. Amatrice was the worst hit by the quake, which also damaged surrounding towns. As of Thursday morning, the deaths totaled 241, officials said. “Half the town no longer exists,” Mayor Sergio Pirozzi of Amatrice told reporters on Wednesday morning. He might have been too optimistic. By midday Amatrice, a quiet mountain town about 100 miles northeast of Rome, felt more like a ghost town. Ambulances raced along windy roads clogged with traffic and rubble as rescue teams searched for survivors. Using picks, shovels and hands, they scrabbled through the dust and debris of crumbled homes. They brought in dogs to sniff for the dead and injured beneath collapsed concrete and stone. A soft white dust was still swirling about the rubble piled   in Amatrice. Stunned survivors  —   some with   cheeks, others still wearing pajamas  —   wandered through the streets, unsure what to do. A father, holding a small child, pushed a wobbly stroller piled with plastic bags of clothing over a rocky path. A young girl sobbed into her mobile phone. “It’s all gone, the bar, the house, everything,” she said. The initial quake was comparable in intensity to one in 2009 in the central Abruzzo region that killed more than 300 people. The quake and aftershocks were felt as far away as Bologna, Rome and Naples. Camps were set up to house hundreds of homeless, and the authorities were also trying to account for an unknown number of tourists. “The number of missing people is undefined at the moment,” Immacolata Postiglione, the head of the emergency unit at Italy’s Civil Protection Agency, said at a news conference in Rome. With a permanent population of about 2, 000, Amatrice is a place where people know one another. Many had ties to Rome in one way or another, working there in the winter, running restaurants, bars and hotels, as food has always been part of the town’s culture. “If you closed the restaurants in Rome run by Amatriciani, you’d close half the restaurants,” said Maria Prassede Perilli, a resident who had been visiting her sister in Rome when the quake struck. Ms. Perilli said she had rushed back after her husband, Giacomo, called in the middle of the night in a frightened voice, telling her, “There’s been a terrible earthquake, you can’t even imagine. ” Her husband survived, she said, but his sisters and niece did not. The couple’s house was crushed. “It’s flat, like a book,” she said. For many residents who worked in Rome, August was the traditional month of rest and relaxation, enjoying Amatrice’s mild climate and fresh air after months of Roman smog. “You had dinners in the piazza, long tables with lots of people, someone would bring out a guitar to sing,” Ms. Perilli said. “It’s the mountain, it’s a good place to be. ” It was especially wrenching for her to bump into shocked friends and acquaintances. “They can’t find Alessandra, they can’t find Alessandra,” one woman who approached said of her niece, buried under the rubble along with her mother. Ms. Perilli commiserated. “I don’t want to listen to anything any more. It’s all: ‘Did you hear that he died, did you know that that entire family was buried wife, husband, child.’ I just can’t take it,” she said, eyes tearing. “I feel as though I am in a dream, and I’m hoping that one moment I’ll wake up. ” Nearby, diggers were lifting rubble into trucks. “Will they ever be able to rebuild this?” Ms. Perilli said. “It seems like the end of an era. ” Rescue teams representing a spectrum of police and armed forces, local civil protection agencies from around the country, as well as medical staff members worked through the day searching for survivors, but more often finding the dead. “This is positive as soon as the earthquake struck, people came from all over to help,” said Riza Sinani, a nurse from the nearby town of Rieti. “That doesn’t happen in every country, this outpouring of humanity and good will. ” Several people in Amatrice said the town had been full of tourists who came for the coming weekend’s annual Sagra dell’Amatriciana festival, which celebrates Amatrice’s native pasta sauce, using cured pork cheek known as guanciale, and grated pecorino cheese. The festival has been canceled. As sympathy and offers of support poured in from around the world, Pope Francis led pilgrims at St. Peter’s Square in praying for the victims, clutching a rosary in his right hand, and Prime Minister Matteo Renzi went to Rieti. Mr. Renzi praised rescue workers and volunteers and vowed to rebuild  —   a promise particularly important for Italians still furious about the long delays in reconstruction after the 2009 quake. The area’s most significant monument, the Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi, was unharmed, as were monuments in the city of Perugia. “We were saved by a miracle,” said Stefania Proietti, the mayor of Assisi, where in 1997 a devastating earthquake caused casualties and extensive damage to the city, destroying frescoes by Giotto and Cimabue in the basilica. For those in Amatrice, the immediate focus was on essentials: who was alive, and who was dead, or missing. Among those awaiting information was Laura Besanzoni, who stood behind a ribbon that cordoned off the main street, the Corso Umberto. A few palazzos still stood along the street, but piles of rubble lined both sides, offering glimpses of bright blue sky. “It’s like being in one of those countries at war,” Ms. Besanzoni said, looking at the devastation. Her family’s palazzo was left standing, she said, but she had no news of an aunt and two cousins. “We don’t know if they are dead or alive,” she said. Makeshift human corridors were created to bring people out. Some were alive, others were not. As one body was passed, wrapped in a plastic cover, one woman wailed: “That looks like Manuela’s hand!” A   convent on the edge of town was virtually destroyed by the quake, the top two floors crushing the bottom. A young nun managed to escape, but said she feared that three nuns and four retirees had been buried. A high school teacher from Rome who vacations here every August said her home on the central Corso Umberto had been severely damaged but had not collapsed. The teacher, who identified herself only by her first name, Ilde, said the quake had struck with a loud bang. The buildings across the street from her and next door were destroyed. “Only the town tower was standing,” she said, describing scenes of panic, her neighbors screaming for help in the dark. “It was Dante’s ‘Inferno,’ it was apocalyptic, I don’t know,” she said. When rescuers came to escort her from her home, she said, she walked on rubble at least 10 to 13 feet high. In one square, families waited for news while diggers began tackling a pile of bricks and stones that had once been a home. One man had lost his father. Another, an uncle. “I can’t think of how many may still be in the rubble,” said one woman whose house withstood the quake while the neighboring ones did not. Amatrice is in an area prone to earthquakes, she said, “but we’ve never felt anything as violent as this. ” In the nearby Marche region, the village of Arquata del Tronto and the hamlet of Pescara del Tronto, also suffered major destruction. “When I arrived at the break of day, I saw a destroyed village, screams, death,” Bishop Giovanni D’Ercole of Ascoli Piceno, who visited Pescara del Tronto, told Vatican Radio. “I went to bless the bodies of two children buried under the rubble. ”",0
9721,Comment on Colin Kaepernick Just Started a Black Panther-Inspired Youth Camp to Teach Kids to Fight Oppression by European≠Nationality/Ethnicity,"Home / #Solutions / Colin Kaepernick Just Started a Black Panther-Inspired Youth Camp to Teach Kids to Fight Oppression Colin Kaepernick Just Started a Black Panther-Inspired Youth Camp to Teach Kids to Fight Oppression Claire Bernish November 2, 2016 3 Comments 
Oakland, CA — After earning both soaring praise and burning ire for sitting out the national anthem, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has turned his protest against police brutality into a positive force for change — by opening an education-based camp to empower kids. 
Kaepernick, in other words, wants to teach young people how to be the change — to educate themselves and stay healthy and safe. 
On Saturday, Kaepernick hosted a free youth camp called Know Your Rights — a “free campaign for youth to raise awareness on higher education, self empowerment, and instruction to properly interact with law enforcement in various scenarios,” the website explains. 
Hundreds of black and Latino children attended the camp, which took place in Oakland, according to the New York Daily News , and the quarterback now plans to expand the program beyond the Bay area. 
“We’re here today to fight back and give you all lessons to combat the oppressive issues that our people face on a daily basis. We’re here to give you tools to help you succeed,” Kaepernick told attendees, the Daily News reported. “We’re going to give you knowledge on policing history, what the systems of policing in America were based on, and we’re also going to teach you skills to make sure you always make it home safely.” 
With relations between police departments and civilians more tense than ever — and an epidemic of police brutality still growing — the camp aims to instill knowledge-based confidence in kids who might otherwise distrust uniformed officers, who often aren’t members of the communities they patrol. 
According to the Know Your Rights Camp site, the program’s goal is to “help build a stronger generation of people that will create the change that is much needed in this world.” 
Controversy raged over Kaepernick’s bold choice not to stand during the national anthem, as many misunderstood his quiet police brutality protest as a publicity stunt — but details about his plans for the camp evidence quite the contrary. 
“Please don’t say anything about it online,” Kaepernick told Daily News reporter Shaun King a few days before Know Your Rights opened. “I’m not doing this for the press and I don’t want it to become a media event so that the kids and the families can feel like this is just for them.” 
Modeled after the original Black Panthers’ 10-point plan, the camp taught kids they have the fundamental rights to be free, safe, educated, courageous, loved, and more. 
“It’s exciting for me because I see a lot of hope, I see a lot of what is to come,” Kaepernick told The Undefeated . “And if you look at a lot of movements in past history, it started at a youth level and has built. And that’s really where change is created, is when youth come up and they’re built in that culture of, ‘I know what this means, I know why this is happening and I also know how to help create change now.’” 
According to The Undefeated , kids from all over the San Francisco Bay area attended the camp — including a number of homeless children living in a halfway house — and heard speakers discuss organic nutrition, holistic healing, financial knowledge, higher education, the history of policing, and more. 
Not a single workshop discussed sports. 
Kaepernick also told the youth how he’d recently traced his roots to Ghana and Nigeria — provided kits to trace their ancestry, free of charge. 
Further, the athlete didn’t stop with organizing and funding the camp — and making a simple cameo appearance — he interacted with as many of the attendees as he could, visiting the smaller breakout focus sessions as the day progressed. 
“What we’ve done here today in Oakland, we want to do all over the country, in cities all over this country,” Kaepernick told the Daily News , “by bringing together local leaders, local activists and local youth, and not only giving them the skills and lessons they need, but we want to show them how much we love and value them.” 
And as Kaepernick told The Undefeated on goals for expanding the camp across the country, “This might not be something where I personally can create the change that this system needs. But together we can build this and help organize and create the change that we need.” Share",0
9722,Re: Vladimir Putin,"« Reply #328 on: August 24, 2015, 07:35:18 PM » Didn't really think Putin was falsely fagging.. Oh well. The Assassination of Russia - FSB false flag bombings of 1999 https://youtu.be/y9cRoXgawVA In the fall of 1999, a wave of bloody apartment bombings swept through Russian cities, killing 293 people and causing widespread panic. Although blamed on the Chechen terrorists that the Russians were fighting in the Second Chechen War, FSB agents were caught planting the exact same type of bombs as in the other blasts later that month. The government claimed that the bomb was part of a security exercise and Vladimir Putin came to power as the next Russian President on the back of the terror wave later that year. http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a092299ryazanbomb#a092299ryazanbomb On the evening of September 22, 1999, several residents of an apartment block in Ryazan, a city about a hundred miles south of Moscow, observe three strangers at the entrance of their building. The two young men and a woman are carrying large sacks into the basement. The residents notice that the cars plate has been partially covered with paper, although they can still see a Moscow license plate number underneath. They decide to call the local police. After several bombings of apartment buildings in Moscow earlier in the month (see September 9, 1999 and September 13, 1999), their vigilance is understandable. When the police arrive, around 9:00 p.m., they uncover what appears to be huge bomb: three sacks of sugar filled with a granular powder, connected to a detonator and a timing device set for 5:30 a.m. The bomb squad uses a gas testing device to confirm that it is explosive material: it appears to be hexagen, the military explosive that is believed to have been used to blow up two Moscow blocks. The residents are evacuated. Then the bomb carted away and turned over to the FSB. (In an apparent oversight, the FSB fails to collect the detonator, which is photographed by the local police.) The following morning, September 23, the government announces that a terrorist attack has been averted. They praise the vigilance of the local people and the Ryazan police. Police comb the city and find the suspects car. A telephone operator for long-distance calls reports that she overheard a suspicious conversation: the caller said there were too many police to leave town undetected and was told, Split up and each of you make your own way out. To the polices astonishment, the number called belongs to the FSB. Later this day, the massive manhunt succeeds: the suspects are arrested. But the police are again stunned when the suspects present FSB credentials. On Moscows orders, they are quietly released. On September 24, the government reverses itself and now says the bomb was a dummy and the whole operation an exercise to test local vigilance. The official announcement is met with disbelief and anger. Ryazan residents, thousands of whom have had to spend the previous night outdoors, are outraged; local authorities protest that they were not informed. However, the suspicion of a government provocation is not widely expressed and press coverage fades after a few days. It is only several months later that an investigation by the independent weekly Novaya Gazeta re-ignites the controversy (see February 20, 2000 and Fall 1999). The governments explanations will fail to convince skeptics (see March 23, 2000). The Ryazan incident later becomes the main reason for suspecting the government of having orchestrated previous bombings. The controversy is then widely reported in the international press.

After the chief bomb suspects were discovered to be FSB agents, the government claimed the bomb was a dummy and the incident was a training exercise (see September 22-24, 1999). But the bomb-squad officer, Yuri Tkachenko, is adamant that it was a professionally-prepared, military-style bomb. He defends the accuracy of his sophisticated gas-testing device which identified the explosives as hexogen. The article provokes much comment in Russia but is ignored by the government.

[Source: Terror99.ru]A team of FSB officials, led by Alexander Zdanovich, agrees to a televised meeting with angry and suspicious residents of Ryazan, hoping to put down rumors of a government provocation and shore up the credibility of the official account. In September 1999 a bomb was found in the basement of a building in Ryazan and the people arrested for planting the bomb were discovered to be FSB agents. The government then claimed the incident was merely a training exercise, but residents suspect the FSB wanted to bomb the building to create a fake terrorist incident (see September 22-24, 1999). Zdavonich apologizes for the inconvenience suffered by Ryazan inhabitants but then suggests the renewed interest in the event is a campaign ploy: For months, there was no interest and there were no publications. The theme was activated on the eve of the presidential election with the most fantastic details in order to accuse the FSB of planning a real explosion with the death of people. This is actively used in the political struggle. (The presidential election is only one week away.) A soldier named Alexei Pinyaev has claimed that he worked at a nearby base where hexogen was reportedly kept in sacks marked sugar (see Fall 1999). The commander of the base denies that there was any soldier named Pinyaev, but the Novaya Gazeta reporter who had found Pinyaev then shows pictures of him and plays a recording of his interview. The FSB will not let its three agents appear in public or allow journalists to interview them. The broadcast does not allow any discussion of a possible connection between the Ryazan incident and the apartment bombings in Moscow earlier that month (see September 9, 1999 and September 13, 1999). The FSB officials did not have good explanations for the fact that local authorities, including its own FSB office in Ryazan, were not informed of the supposed exercise, or for the lack of medical resources for the thousands of people forced to spend the night outdoors. According to David Satter, a long-time correspondent in Moscow for the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times who believes the Ryazan incident was a failed provocation, the broadcast only serves to increase the publics misgivings.

9723,Time For the Real Left To Double Down on Single Payer Medicare For All,"Tweet Widget A Black Agenda Radio Commentary by Bruce A. Dixon 
Under President Obama, Democrats threw away their mandate to fight for health care for. Instead they let insurance companies concoct Obamacare, sketchy policies, skimpy coverage, high deductibles and co-pays for half the uninsured and empty promises for the other half. A Gallup Poll confirms that 58% of Americans want to see Obamacare replaced with a single payer system to guarantee health care, not health insurance for everybody. Time For the Real Left To Double Down on Single Payer Medicare For All A Black Agenda Radio Commentary by Bruce A. Dixon 
The Affordable Care Act, which President elect Trump promises to repeal and replace with nobody knows what, was never all it was cracked up to be. 
The promise to deliver affordable health care was a key campaign issue in 2007 and 2008. But while most Americans demanded a single payer system to replace the private insurance companies, and guarantee health care for everyone, the 44 th president his corporate funded Democrats instead delivered Obamacare –- billions in tax dollars to insurance companies for policies with skimpy coverage and such high co-pays and deductibles that many families cannot afford to use their new health insurance. Worse still, Obamacare only provided these sketchy policies to about half the uninsured leaving the rest to the tender mercies of state governments which control Medicaid. 
Ever since 2009 corporate Democrats have justified their treachery with claims that single payer Medicare For All was impossible to get through even the majority Democratic Congress of 2009 and 2010. Hillary Clinton also declared single payer dead on arrival should she be elected. But Hillary was not elected, and even though this is the fourth consecutive Republican dominated Congress, and Republican politicians hate Medicare For All just as much as their Democratic rivals, the popular mandate for single payer health care is very much alive. 
A May 2016 Gallup Poll confirms that “...58% of U.S. adults favor the idea of replacing the law (Obamacare) with a federally funded healthcare system that provides insurance for all Americans.” The question for the left, however you read that term is what do we do about this? The answer has to be that we fight for what we know people want and need with all the means at our disposal. In the present era, the willingness to organize, to agitate, to educate, to demonstrate and to demand health care –- not health insurance, but health care for everybody as a human right is one of the markers by which we can tell actual flesh and blood leftists and their organizations from those who merely fake the funk until the next Democrat takes office. It’s worth noting that the Green Party’ candidates Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka were the only ones in this election calling for single payer health care. 
A 2009 study by the National Nurses Union reveals that adoption of Medicare For All would create 2.6 million new jobs, from doctors and nurses to a host of health care professionals and technicians. That’s as many jobs as were lost in the 2007-2009 recession. It would inject #75 billion per year into the US economy, including $100 billion in wages alone. President Trump won in part because he told people he’d “bring back the jobs.” But steel mill jobs are imaginary, fictitious. Health care jobs are real. 
The tens or hundreds of thousands in streets each night justifiably protesting the ascension of a crotch grabbing racist con man to the White House would be well advised to not repeat the mistake of Occupy a few years ago. They and others who want to be relevant in this new era urgently need to put forth some concrete demands which if struggled for will make them opinion leaders, and if won will improve the lives of millions. Quality single payer health care NOW is one of those demands. 
Trump’s threat to dismantle Obamacare is an invitation for us to reopen the struggle for health care as a human right. And this time we know we’re struggling against Republicans AND Democrats.

9724,Madrid Buses Ban Men ’Manspreading’ - Breitbart,"MADRID (AP)  —   If you’re taking a bus in the Spanish capital, be sure to keep your legs to yourself. [Madrid authorities on Monday started putting up signs banning the practice of ‘manspreading’  —   opening one’s legs so wide you invade other’s seating space  —  on city buses as part of their new etiquette guidelines.  EMT municipal transportation company says the sign is designed to discourage physical postures that bother people. The sign features an illustration of a man with splayed legs with a red ‘X’ above. The text beneath urges passengers to “respect the space of others. ” There are no sanctions or fines for those indulging in the practice. The bus company incorporated the ban following an internet signature campaign by a woman’s group, Mujeres en Lucha (Fighting Women). In their campaign petition, the women said it was a “very common practice. ” La @EMTmadrid añade una nueva señal a bordo del bus para evitar el #manspreading: ”Respeta el espacio de los demás”. https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Ayuntamiento Madrid (@MADRID) June 6, 2017,  “It’s not difficult to see women with their legs closed and very uncomfortable because there’s a man beside them who’s invading their space with their legs,” it added. The group said women were taught to sit with their legs together whereas men are ingrained with “the idea of territorial hierarchy, as if the space belongs to them. ” EMT said it felt its initiative, which also includes asking passengers not to eat or drink on buses, to keep their backpacks on or put their feet up on seats, was being well received. Again, there are no sanctions for any of these other requests. “When a person opens their legs so wide it disturbs others, this is rude,” said Alvaro Gomez Jordana Moya, 60, as he waited for a bus in Madrid. “It’s also uncomfortable having to ask someone, ‘Please, can you close your legs’. ” “It’s a problem because people don’t respect seating,” said another bus passenger Maria Carmen Ventosa, 46. “It should change things, if only out of respect for others. ” Madrid’s underground train company said it had no plans to follow suit.",0
9725,Syria and Russia Appear Ready to Scorch Aleppo - The New York Times,"BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   Make life intolerable and death likely. Open an escape route, or offer a deal to those who leave or surrender. Let people trickle out. Kill whoever stays. Repeat until a deserted cityscape is yours. It is a strategy that both the Syrian government and its Russian allies have long embraced to subdue Syrian rebels, largely by crushing the civilian populations that support them. But in the past few days, as hopes for a revived   have disintegrated at the United Nations, the Syrians and Russians seem to be mobilizing to apply this     strategy to the most ambitious target yet: the   sections of the divided metropolis of Aleppo. The killing and destruction in Syria, of course, has stupefied much of the world over the past five years. But it could pale in comparison with a military assault to retake all of Aleppo, once Syria’s largest city and still home to about two million people, roughly 250, 000 of them in   territory. A takeover battle could mean “a slow, grinding,    fight, over the course of months, if not years,” the United Nations special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, warned on Sunday, speaking at an emergency Security Council session on Syria, in which outright confrontation replaced any effort to find diplomatic common ground. East Aleppo would be by far the biggest and most fortified area that government forces had sought to retake with   tactics of siege and bombardment  —   called “ ” after slogans scrawled outside besieged areas by   militiamen. The tactics have succeeded in much smaller areas: in encircled suburbs of the capital, Damascus, and in rebel enclaves in the central city of Homs  —   first in the historic Old City and, most recently, last week, in the outlying neighborhood of Waer. In the past few days,   forces have signaled that they are escalating efforts to press the tactics to their conclusion in Aleppo, step by step. On Sunday, Syria’s United Nations ambassador punctuated the message, declaring that the government would reclaim all of the city. First came new waves of airstrikes, Aleppo’s worst bombardment of the war. The bombings were so ferocious that the United States and Britain accused Russia of “barbarism” and “war crimes” for backing the Syrian air campaign. More than 90 people died on Friday, and more than 100 on Saturday. At one hospital, nearly half of the 67 people treated for injuries were children. On Sunday, scores in the   districts were dead by evening. But it was not just the volume of bombs that made the airstrikes devastating. They also hit, one by one, the systems that have kept life inching along. Rescue workers in Aleppo reported that their cars and headquarters were among the first targets hit on Friday. The effect was instant: Now, when people are buried in rubble, no one comes. Or it takes longer for them to arrive. Relatives are again exhuming relatives with their hands. Next, a much deadlier weapon than had been seen before was introduced: a     bomb, known as a  . Turning whole buildings into craters yards deep, these bombs also threaten basement shelters and water pipes  —   not to mention the schools, clinics and even playgrounds built underground over the years to help minimize the damage of airstrikes. As medical workers, rescuers and residents navigate the chaos, every now and then, on their phones, a text message pings, offering help. The texts, from the government, say that Russia is providing aid to people in the   side of the city, and is available to any who return to the bosom of the state. The Syrian state news media broadcasts images of the night life on the other side of Aleppo, its lit skyline viewable from the darker rebel side. Those images play down the struggles of people on the government side, who have faced their own suffering with rebel shelling, water shortages and economic collapse. Russia says it has opened safe corridors, and Syrian state television has reported that people have fled through them. Other residents say they have tried to approach the corridors, only to be shot at each side blames the other for trapping people there. Yet if other places are any indication, some people in East Aleppo may eventually take a deal at any cost. In Homs, in the Damascus suburb of Daraya and elsewhere, fighters and civilians have concluded that they are stuck in a war of attrition. They have agreed either to take their chances in government territory  —   seeking “regularization” of their status and the clearing of any criminal records, but risking rearrest  —   or to be bused to   territory, where they risk further bombing. The groundwork for that kind of choice has been laid in eastern Aleppo. Supplies of food and medicine are thin and intermittent. But in case anyone expected that the agreement between Russia and the United States on delivering aid would bring relief, a week ago a sustained, hourslong aerial attack was carried out on one of the first convoys of United Nations aid trucks permitted to travel under that agreement. The United States has blamed Russia and the Syrian government, which have denied involvement. At the emergency meeting of the Security Council on Sunday, Mr. de Mistura pleaded for diplomats to halt what he called “new heights of horror,” and asked for   pauses in the fighting for evacuations and humanitarian relief. But what followed was vitriol. Russia remained unbowed and its Western rivals challenged it more aggressively, erasing most of whatever hope remained for diplomatic progress. The Russian side blamed the United States and its allies for unleashing terrorist groups across the Middle East, and even extolled the Syrian government’s behavior. Vitaly I. Churkin, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations, complimented the government of President Bashar   of Syria, asserting that it had shown “enviable restraint. ” The Council meeting came after months of diplomacy by the United States and Russia collapsed on the sidelines of the General Assembly conclave last week after the convoy assault. Efforts to revive a temporary cessation of hostilities failed, and frustration intensified among American allies that the   negotiations between Washington and Moscow had yielded no relief. Mr. Churkin accused the Americans of having no influence over the rebel groups they backed, and repeated his government’s contention that no   was possible until all opposition groups distanced themselves from the Nusra Front, the extremist group that now calls itself the Levant Conquest Front and that both Russia and the United States consider a terrorist organization. The American ambassador, Samantha Power, took sharp digs at Mr. Churkin even before he began speaking, saying Russia had tried to blame everyone else and refused to account for its actions. She said “it was not unreasonable to think” that the Russian and Syrian militaries had loaded incendiary bombs aboard warplanes bound for Aleppo even as Russian diplomats at the United Nations talked last week of making peace. “Instead of pursuing peace, Russia and Assad make war,” she said. “Instead of helping get lifesaving aid to civilians, Russia and Assad are bombing the humanitarian convoys, hospitals, and first responders who are trying desperately to keep people alive. ” “What Russia is sponsoring and doing is not counterterrorism,” she said. “It is barbarism. ” When Bashar   the Syrian ambassador, began speaking, Ms. Power left the chamber, along with her counterparts from Britain and France, according to diplomats. The British envoy, Matthew Rycroft, accused Russia of “partnering with the Syrian regime to carry out war crimes. ” Mr. de Mistura said the government was carrying out countless airstrikes on residential buildings and other civilian infrastructure in   parts of Aleppo  —   a potential war crime. He refused to quit, saying it “would be a signal that the international community is abandoning the Syrians. ”",0

[  of ESPN’s “Russillo and Kanell Show,” Ryen Russillo admits that since politics became so pervasive in sports talk, he no longer knows what his job is anymore. He came to his current profession because he loves to talk about sports, but that appears to be an outdated business model.  “Now I feel like if I’m not doing a social awareness show three out of five days a week, I feel like I’m doing it wrong,” Russillo lamented during his show. “I can’t possibly think that’s the play,   for what I’m supposed to do as a sports talk show host for the next 10 years. ” The    from Laramie Wyoming, who has   the show since 2009, added, “I don’t know what it is. If I were doing the   show three days a week, would I have 90% support from  ? Because that’s what it feels like right now. ” Russillo found it funny that another ESPN host Dan Le Batard criticized an ESPN memo instructing hosts not to talk about Trump’s current immigration ban. Russillo said, “Like, I think the majority of everybody I work with does all the time  …     I saw a show the other day tease that one of the hosts was upset about the travel ban. That was the tease for a show. Can you imagine if I teased this show and said, ‘Coming up, why all of you are wrong about Trump, and why he’s awesome. ’” Russillo knows all too well that ESPN and other sports networks wouldn’t be keen on that idea, saying, “It’s really weird that the job now feels like you have to have a take, and it better be along the lines of so many other people in the media or you’re just gonna be uncool, you’re gonna be ostracized. ”",0

Ivo van Hove, the acclaimed international theater director, will stage the play, about executives at a struggling TV network and their Machiavellian maneuvers for higher ratings  —   including the manipulation of Mr. Cranston’s character, the “mad as hell” television host that Peter Finch played in the film. Lee Hall, the screenwriter of “Billy Elliot,” is adapting the   screenplay by Paddy Chayefsky. Mr. van Hove, who won a Tony last year for directing a revival of “A View from the Bridge” on Broadway, is set to open the show in November on the National’s Lyttelton stage. The theater also announced that its hit production of “People, Places and Things” would travel to St. Ann’s Warehouse in New York in October. The actress Denise Gough earned   reviews when she played the lead role, Emma, at the National in 2015, and later in London’s West End. She will travel to New York with the show. The theater announced the plays as part of a broader lineup for 2017 and 2018. Other productions include the world premiere of “Saint George and the Dragon” by Rory Mullarkey, which will be directed by Lyndsey Turner, who staged a   production of “Hamlet” in 2015 starring Benedict Cumberbatch and a production of “Macbeth” starring Rory Kinnear. “Saint George” will open in October, and “Macbeth” in the spring of 2018.",0

A Government of Scoundrels, Spies, Thieves, Ruffians, Rapists and Killers “There is nothing more dangerous than a government of the many controlled by the few.”— Lawrence Le... Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/a-government-of-scoundrels-spies.html “There is nothing more dangerous than a government of the many controlled by the few.”— Lawrence Lessig, Harvard law professor The U.S. government remains the greatest threat to our freedoms. The systemic violence being perpetrated by agents of the government has done more collective harm to the American people and our liberties than any single act of terror. More than terrorism, more than domestic extremism, more than gun violence and organized crime, the U.S. government has become a greater menace to the life, liberty and property of its citizens than any of the so-called dangers from which the government claims to protect us. Image: They Live film This is how tyranny rises and freedom falls. As I explain in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People , when the government views itself as superior to the citizenry, when it no longer operates for the benefit of the people, when the people are no longer able to peacefully reform their government, when government officials cease to act like public servants, when elected officials no longer represent the will of the people, when the government routinely violates the rights of the people and perpetrates more violence against the citizenry than the criminal class, when government spending is unaccountable and unaccounted for, when the judiciary act as courts of order rather than justice, and when the government is no longer bound by the laws of the Constitution, then you no longer have a government “of the people, by the people and for the people.” What we have is a government of wolves . Worse than that, we are now being ruled by a government of scoundrels, spies, thugs, thieves, gangsters, ruffians, rapists, extortionists, bounty hunters, battle-ready warriors and cold-blooded killers who communicate using a language of force and oppression. Does the government pose a danger to you and your loved ones? The facts speak for themselves. We’re being held at gunpoint by a government of soldiers — a standing army. While Americans are being made to jump through an increasing number of hoops in order to exercise their Second Amendment right to own a gun, the government is arming its own civilian employees to the hilt with guns, ammunition and military-style equipment, authorizing them to make arrests, and training them in military tactics. Among the agencies being supplied with night-vision equipment, body armor, hollow-point bullets, shotguns, drones, assault rifles and LP gas cannons are the Smithsonian, U.S. Mint, Health and Human Services, IRS , FDA, Small Business Administration, Social Security Administration, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Education Department, Energy Department, Bureau of Engraving and Printing and an assortment of public universities. There are now reportedly more bureaucratic (non-military) government civilians armed with high-tech, deadly weapons than U.S. Marines. That doesn’t even begin to touch on the government’s arsenal, the transformation of local police into extensions of the military, and the speed with which the nation could be locked down under martial law depending on the circumstances. Clearly, the government is preparing for war — and a civil war, at that — but who is the enemy? We’re being robbed blind by a government of thieves . Americans no longer have any real protection against government agents empowered to seize private property at will. For instance, police agencies under the guise of asset forfeiture laws are taking property based on little more than a suspicion of criminal activity. In one case, police seized $53,000 from the manager of a Christian rock band that was touring and raising money for an orphanage in Thailand. Despite finding no evidence of wrongdoing, police kept the money. Homeowners are losing their homes over nonpayment of taxes ( for as little as $400 owed ) and municipal bills such as water or sewer fees that amount to a fraction of what they have invested in their homes. And then there’s the Drug Enforcement Agency, which has been searching train and airline passengers and pocketing their cash , without ever charging them with a crime. We’re being taken advantage of by a government of scoundrels, idiots and cowards. American satirist H.L. Mencken calculated that “Congress consists of one-third, more or less, scoundrels; two-thirds, more or less, idiots; and three-thirds, more or less, poltroons.” By and large, Americans seem to agree . When you’ve got government representatives who spend a large chunk of their work hours fundraising , being feted by lobbyists, shuffling through a lucrative revolving door between public service and lobbying, and making themselves available to anyone with enough money to secure access to a congressional office , you’re in the clutches of a corrupt oligarchy . Mind you, these same elected officials rarely read the legislation they’re enacting, nor do they seem capable of enacting much legislation that actually helps rather than hinders the plight of the American citizen. We’re being locked up by a government of greedy jailers . We have become a carceral state , spending three times more on our prisons than on our schools and imprisoning close to a quarter of the world’s prisoners , despite the fact that crime is at an all-time low and the U.S. makes up only 5% of the world’s population. The Prison Industry in the United States: Big Business or a New Form of Slavery? Which is in contrast with... Netherlands is Closing 19 Prisons Because of Criminal Shortage . The rise of overcriminalization and profit-driven private prisons provides even greater incentives for locking up American citizens for such non-violent “crimes” as having an overgrown lawn . As the Boston Review points out, “America’s contemporary system of policing, courts, imprisonment, and parole … makes money through asset forfeiture, lucrative public contracts from private service providers, and by directly extracting revenue and unpaid labor from populations of color and the poor. In states and municipalities throughout the country, the criminal justice system defrays costs by forcing prisoners and their families to pay for punishment. It also allows private service providers to charge outrageous fees for everyday needs such as telephone calls. As a result people facing even minor criminal charges can easily find themselves trapped in a self-perpetuating cycle of debt, criminalization, and incarceration.” We’re being spied on by a government of Peeping Toms . The government is watching everything you do, reading everything you write, listening to everything you say, and monitoring everything you spend. This is George Orwell's 1984 on steroids. Omnipresent surveillance is paving the way for government programs that profile citizens, document their behavior and attempt to predict what they might do in the future, whether it’s what they might buy, what politician they might support, or what kinds of crimes they might commit . The impact of this far-reaching surveillance, according to Psychology Today, is “ reduced trust, increased conformity, and even diminished civic participation .” As technology analyst Jillian C. York concludes, “Mass surveillance without due process — whether undertaken by the government of Bahrain, Russia, the US, or anywhere in between — threatens to stifle and smother that dissent, leaving in its wake a populace cowed by fear .” We’re being ravaged by a government of ruffians, rapists and killers . It’s not just the police shootings of unarmed citizens that are worrisome. It’s the SWAT team raids gone wrong that are leaving innocent citizens wounded, children terrorized and family pets killed. For trying to run from the principal’s office . For, at the age of 12, getting into a fight with another girl . We’re being forced to surrender our freedoms — and those of our children — to a government of extortionists, money launderers and professional pirates . The American people have been repeatedly sold a bill of goods about how the government needs more money, more expansive powers, and more secrecy (secret courts, secret budgets , secret military campaigns, secret surveillance) in order to keep us safe. Under the guise of fighting its wars on terror, drugs and now domestic extremism, the government has spent billions in taxpayer dollars on endless wars that have not ended terrorism but merely sown the seeds of blowback, surveillance programs that have caught few terrorists while subjecting all Americans to a surveillance society, and militarized police that have done little to decrease crime while turning communities into warzones. Not surprisingly, the primary ones to benefit from these government exercises in legal money laundering have been the corporations, lobbyists and politicians who inflict them on a trusting public. Whatever else it may be — a danger, a menace, a threat — the U.S. government is certainly no friend to freedom. To our detriment, the criminal class that Mark Twain mockingly referred to as Congress has since expanded to include every government agency that feeds off the carcass of our once-constitutional republic. In fact, there’s a very good reason you don’t hear much in the way of specifics about the government’s tyranny from politicians: it’s because they can’t afford to upset the apple cart (i.e., jeopardize their posh lifestyles). So no matter which party wins the White House, controls Congress or appoints future Supreme Court justices, rest assured that the menace of the shadow government — the permanent, unelected bureaucracy that operates beyond the reach of the Constitution, the courts and the citizenry — will continue uninterrupted. Our backs are against the proverbial wall. The government and its cohorts have conspired to ensure that the only real recourse the American people have to express their displeasure with the government is through voting, which is no real recourse at all. The penalties for civil disobedience, whistleblowing and rebellion are severe. If you refuse to pay taxes for government programs you believe to be immoral or illegal, you will go to jail. If you attempt to overthrow the government — or any agency thereof — because you believe it has overstepped its reach, you will go to jail. If you attempt to blow the whistle on government misconduct, there’s a pretty good chance you will go to jail. For too long, the American people have been made to act like puppets dancing to a tyrant’s tune. We have obeyed the government’s dictates, no matter now extreme. We have paid its taxes, penalties and fines, no matter how outrageous. We have tolerated its indignities, insults and abuses, no matter how egregious. We have turned a blind eye to its indiscretions and incompetence, no matter how imprudent. We have held our silence in the face of its lawlessness, licentiousness and corruption, no matter how illicit. We have suffered. How long we will continue to suffer depends on how much we’re willing to give up for the sake of freedom. America’s founders provided us with a very specific explanation about the purpose of government and a roadmap for what to do when the government abuses its authority, ignores our objections, and establishes itself as a tyrant. We must choose between peaceful slavery (in other words, maintaining the status quo in servitude to the police state) and dangerous freedom . That will mean carving out a path in which we begin to take ownership of our government, starting at the local level, challenging the status quo, and raising hell whenever a government official steps out of line.

9737,So That’s Who You Call: The Politics of the New ‘Ghostbusters’ - The New York Times,"The rebooted “Ghostbusters,” starring Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon as an   squad of ectoplasm fighters, sold $46 million worth of tickets in North America over the weekend, making it the   earning film behind “The Secret Life of Pets. ” But even before any tickets had been sold, “Ghostbusters” was already surely the most   movie of the year, attacked by angry male fans on the internet and hailed as a new milestone in Hollywood diversity. Wesley Morris, critic at large for The New York Times, joins its chief film critics Manohla Dargis and A. O. Scott to survey the state of the debate now that people have actually seen the movie. The discussion may include spoilers. A. O. SCOTT The   backlash was another of those reactionary     that have become a fixture of our culture and our politics lately. The wounded   will keep on whining about their ruined childhoods, but meanwhile the debate has moved in other directions. The movie’s feminist bona fides have been questioned, notably by Alyssa Rosenberg in The Washington Post, who wrote that she was “more dismayed by the idea that the uproar around ‘Ghostbusters’ has pushed feminists into championing Paul Feig’s remake” than by the misogynist outrage over the   cast. And why is Leslie Jones’s character, the only nonwhite Ghostbuster, also the only nonscientist? I have to say it makes me very happy when big commercial movies provoke serious political arguments, but before we dive into that particular fray I want to make a few statements I trust will not be terribly controversial. 1) Kate McKinnon should be in every movie from now on. 2) The new “Ghostbusters” is like the old “Ghostbusters” in that it gives comic performers who gained popularity on television and in more provocative projects a chance to widen their appeal and increase their earning potential with a mainstream  . 3) The old “Ghostbusters” isn’t that great to begin with. WESLEY MORRIS You’re right on all counts. Kate McKinnon joins my personal Taraji P.   Stone “more, please forever” club. But the politics around  this movie have nothing to do with the politics in this movie, of which, to Mr. Feig’s credit, there isn’t very much. His “Ghostbusters” isn’t defensive so much as pro forma and strangely sedate compared with the original movie and to what else these women can do (and have done). My favorite moments involved the characters being let off their leashes, like when Kristen Wiig is running around New York trying to tell the mayor and whoever else won’t listen that terror is afoot. That’s a great mode for her. As for Ms. Jones’s given occupation as a transit worker, it leaves me, once again, annoyed by the optics. If the other Ghostbusters were, say, Ms. Henson, Jada Pinkett Smith and Gabourey Sidibe as the scientists, and Ms. Jones’s Patty was still the subway worker, who’d care? But under the circumstances, it just seems like the same questionable,     choice that movies have always made for black performers  —   and an excuse for the plot to ride the subway. But, look: She’s an equal member of the team and black people work in public transit. Politics! What do we make of the movie’s fetishization of Chris Hemsworth? He’s very funny as himbo  . But somebody involved with this movie clearly thinks he’s utterly captivating  —   or politically necessary, too. A lot of the plot hinges on him being   funny. And I actually found the comedic material to be there for him in a way it wasn’t for almost everyone else, especially Melissa McCarthy, who, maybe, shouldn’t be a straight man after all. I wanted gonzo from this movie and got dutiful. What’s wrong with me? MANOHLA DARGIS Gonzo is tough to find in the current   landscape, which is radically different from what it was when the first movie opened in 1984. Given this, I think the new “Ghostbusters” succeeds on its own fairly narrow commercial mainstream terms, but with some dividends, including a pretty, ditsy secretary (Mr. Hemsworth) and the new Bill Murray (our collective crush, Ms. McKinnon). The only thing I would add is that Ms. McCarthy was already a significant   draw in 2014 when Mr. Feig tweeted that he was making an   “Ghostbusters. ” Oh, and one more thought: The most interesting thing about the reboot isn’t the movie itself but the misogynistic discourse that has swirled around it since this project was announced. I did my best to ignore the   chatter before I saw “Ghostbusters” just because I avoid reading anyone else’s opinion about a movie before seeing it. I knew that there was a contingent of angry male fans of course there were. There are always men enraged by women’s autonomy, whether women are starring in a comedy reboot or “Thelma  Louise” playing rock or video games demanding their reproductive rights running for president or, you know, doing anything that some men don’t want them to do. The depths of this rage betray a deep fear about a loss of male power that’s been central to the cultural, social and political landscape for decades. “Ghostbusters” turns on the threat of one apocalypse the irrational hatred toward it turns on another end time. SCOTT I think what pleased me most about this “Ghostbusters” was how     —   how chill  —   the movie was, notwithstanding the bombast of the climactic battle. I think we all agree that it has a generic,     quality. That’s something it shares with the original, by the way, which far from being a transcendent masterpiece of cinematic imagination was a nice paycheck for the artists involved and an easy, inoffensive night out for the audience. Sorry if I ruined anyone’s childhood. Mr. Feig, like Ivan Reitman before him, has assembled a workmanlike   about people at work. Professionalism may be the opposite of gonzo, but I think there’s something (dare I say it) radical about how   this story is. Here’s a movie about female friendship and collegiality  —   which, of course, also entails rivalry, miscommunication and shifting allegiances  —   that feels no need to entangle any of its heroines in a heterosexual romance plot. Ms. Wiig’s character is distracted by the hotness of her secretary (I was reminded of Zero Mostel in the original “Producers”) but the real emotional stakes are between her and Ms. McCarthy. We don’t know if any of the Ghostbusters are gay, bi, straight, married, single, celibate, polyamorous or whatever. It’s not relevant. Any more than it would be in a western or a platoon picture or a Mafia epic or a movie about a bunch of tech bros building a  . (    assignment: “Ghostbusters” is actually a remake of “The Social Network. ”) “Bridesmaids,” “The Heat” and “Spy” may have had naughtier (and funnier) jokes, but they were also careful to include   flourishes and semiplausible love interests. “Ghostbusters” doesn’t do that. Nor does it pander to the male gaze. And it’s not really out to prove that women can be strong or funny or handle powerful weapons. In most movies, such offers of proof are accompanied by reassurances that the women in question are still sexy or maternal or eager to settle down with the right guy  —   that they fulfill some kind of conventional idea of femininity. “Ghostbusters” doesn’t bother with any of that, and in the process seems to be on the verge of inventing a new set of archetypes. MORRIS Well, the movie does pander to this male’s gaze, at least in its appreciation of Mr. Hemsworth’s presumed hotness. There’s a randomness to this movie, much of which is devoted to him. (Why does he decide he wants to bust ghosts, too? What’s with all those cheesecake, shirtless head shots that keep showing up?) Still, the more I think about it the more I feel like every word of opprobrium or defense  —   every profane or besotted emoji  —   has been in some ways unfair to a movie that just wants to be. But Tony, your ascribing meaning and value to the workplace dynamics really struck me. These women are   owners who love their jobs. (To paraphrase the eternal Ray Parker Jr.: Bustin’ makes ’em feel good.) That’s a strong contrast to something like “9 to 5” (1980) whose women hated work because their boss was a pig. Now there’s no boss, just an endless supply of ghosts. Progress! My objection to this movie is purely an exasperation with remakes of stuff that no one needs. (People of the world, for the love of Netflix, your childhoods are still available on demand!) Nonetheless, Manohla, your enthusiasm  —   and my friend Katie’s  —   won me over, at least in this case. This is an elastic concept that can withstand all kinds of reconfigurations. It’s not sacred. And to the girls in the audience, who know nothing about the battles roiling their parents’ Reddit feeds, the comedic quartet of McCarthy, Jones, Wiig and McKinnon is just business as usual. But that’s a difference that feels entirely generational, no? DARGIS Maybe it’s generational but it’s also a matter of awareness. Because while a   blockbuster may seem like business as usual to some, reams of data prove that movies like this remain an exception in the   industry. To cite (again) just one bummer study: From 2007 to 2014, women made up 30. 2 percent of all speaking or named characters in the 100   fictional films released in the United States. And while there’s certainly awareness about this sexism, at least in some quarters, that hasn’t translated into real industry progress. For a big studio like Sony, and in an industrial climate in which male superheroes keep studios going, “Ghostbusters” is a gamble. The studio tried to revive “Ghostbusters” for years. In 2009, when Dan Aykroyd talked to The Los Angeles Times about what was then “Ghostbusters 3” (meaning another sequel, not a reboot) female Ghostbusters were part of the story. This iteration would star the original cast and involve the older Ghostbusters passing the proton torch to a new group that included some women. Mr. Aykroyd specifically mentioned Alyssa Milano and Eliza Dushku, casting that was eagerly greeted on some entertainment sites. “Why don’t they have BOTH of them in the movie? That way they can towel the slime off each other,” wrote one commentator on Screenrant. “Slime her!” a writer for Cinemablend enthused about Ms. Milano. Entertainment Weekly even ran a story  —   “Pick the New ‘Ghostbusters’ Girl!”  —   with a photo of Megan Fox, who it suggested could be “The Sexpot” alongside Zoe Saldana (“The Geek Queen”) Emma Watson (“The Touch of Class”) and Charlyne Yi (“The Wild Card”) who has “just the right   charm for the Ghostbusters crew. ” The stars of the new “Ghostbusters” are adult women  —   three over 40  —   they’re not girls or especially charming. And while some moviegoers may not need this particular remake, I think there are plenty of girl and women moviegoers who would say, yes, we do.",0

Some Evidence is coming out regarding the handling of the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s private server. A frequent donor of the Clinton’s has donated a substantial amount of money to the wife of the FBI agent responsible for Hillary’s case. The FBI’s investigation found that Hillary was innocent of any crimes. Wonder why. 
Let me just start by saying that this is the single worst crime a person running for President in the US has EVER been convicted of. Hillary Clinton was just proven beyond any doubt to have been directly involved with the bribing and promoting of a top FBI agent during her own email trial. 
Let me break this down for you: 
Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, one of Bill and Hillary Clinton’s most consistent backers, donated nearly $500,000 to the Virginia state Senate campaign of a candidate (Dr. Jill McCabe) who is married to the FBI’s deputy director. – Daily Mail 
McCabe’s husband, Andrew McCabe, was the associate deputy of the FBI’s Washington field office, which was tasked with investigating Hillary’s emails. 
This is where it gets really interesting. Sometime between the donation being made and the beginning of Clinton’s email investigation, McCabe was promoted to the Deputy Director of that office, giving him full control of the Clinton investigation.

NoisyRoom.net 
In North Carolina , a major donor to US Senate candidate Deborah Ross, was caught on video by Project Veritas saying some very disturbing things. He compared black Republicans to Jews helping Nazis during the Holocaust. Benjamin Barber also said that blacks are “seriously f***ed in the head.” 
James O’Keefe and Project Veritas have been relentless in exposing Democrats and the left this election cycle. They’ve done terrific work, much to the chagrin of Barber. Benjamin and Leah Barber were caught on undercover video at a fundraiser for Ross. They are also major donors to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Figures. 
First up in the video is Ross comparing voter ID laws to racist Jim Crow laws in the South. Then the conversation with the Barbers began. And it was a doozy. 
“It doesn’t make sense,” Leah Barber said about African Americans who support Republicans. “You’re voting against your self-interest. In the name of change, what is the change that they want to see?” 
From PJ Media : 
In a new video released today by Project Veritas Action, a top Democratic donor is caught on camera horribly maligning Republican blacks at a fundraiser for North Carolina U.S. Senate candidate Deborah Ross. In the video, Benjamin Barber, a prominent Ross and Clinton donor, compares blacks who vote Republican to Nazis at the fundraiser for Ross on the Upper West Side of New York City on September 19, 2016. 
“Have you heard of the Sonderkommandos? Jewish guards who helped murder Jews in the camps. So there were even Jews that were helping the Nazis murder Jews! So blacks who are helping the other side are seriously fucked in the head,” Barber said. “They’re only helping the enemy who will destroy them. Maybe they think ‘if I help them we’ll get along okay; somehow I’ll save my race by working with the murderers.’” 
The irony here is rich considering the sordid history of George Soros , another prominent big Democrat donor who literally was a Jewish Nazi collaborator as a teenager during World War II in his native Budapest, Hungary. 
An analogy of the Sonderkommandos… work units in Nazi death camps? This guy just trashed African Americans and Jews. What an asshat. The death camps were usually composed of Jewish males, forced to dispose of bodies from the gas chambers. They did not assist with the killings themselves. Assertions otherwise are obscene. 
Project Veritas showed the video to some religious leaders and others in the black community who were shocked by the contents of the video. 
“I think that Deborah Ross has shown her true colors. If this is not a, if that… what you just showed me is not racism and condescending and basically calling blacks stupid and ignorant and saying that we are voting against our own self-interest if we support any Republican. I am appalled. I am incensed. Deborah Ross should be called to task for something like that,” said Bishop Wooden, a black voter in North Carolina. 
No one should be shocked by this… the undercurrent of racism and Antisemitism has always been out there for the Democrats. You just got to see some honesty for a change instead of the usual pandering. Disgusting and revealing. 0",0
9741,LOL! BRITISH WIFE Of LIB ACTOR Who Said: “There Will Never Be A President Donald Trump”…Warns Americans About President-Elect Trump [VIDEO],"Go to Article 
Political activist and Hillary supporter Amal Clooney traveled to Texas to warn Americans about our elected President Donald J. Trump and his tough immigration policies. Maybe she didn’t get the memo…Trump’s tough immigration stance is what catapulted him to the top of the heap in the crowded pack of GOP primary contenders. It wasn’t too long ago that her arrogant liberal husband announced with great confidence, “There will never be a President Trump”. 
Perhaps Amal should’ve traveled to some of the border towns if she wanted to get a clear picture of how illegal immigration is affecting our nation. Aliens crossing our borders illegally have destroyed the property of American ranchers, and threatened the safety and security of American citizens living in homes in or near the US -Mexican border towns… 
Amal Clooney has warned that many of president-elect Trump’s proposals would be ‘violations of international law.’ 
Speaking at the Texas Conference For Women at the Austin Convention Center on Tuesday, the international human rights lawyer, and wife of George Clooney, said she had concerns about America’s reputation under the real estate mogul’s plans. 
She noted that Trump’s comments during his campaign, ‘that there should be a religious test imposed on entering the U.S. or the fact that there should be state-sponsored torture or that families of suspected terrorists should all be killed — all of those things are violations of international human rights law and the values that underlie that.’ 
The 38-year-old wife said America’s reputation as a country with a strong human rights record and high moral standing was at risk. 
‘I think there’s some concern from abroad as to, “Are these things actually going to happen?”, or is the U.S. going to lose some of the moral standing that it has internationally,’ according to the Hollywood Reporter. 
Perhaps its time to put our nation’s security and sovereignty before we worry about what people in other countries around the world think of us… 
Both Amal and her Hollywood actor husband George, a staunch Hillary Clinton supporter, have spoken out against Trump in the past. 
Earlier this year, Amal Clooney called for Trump to be challenged on his extreme views. 
Watch George Clooney here whine about press giving Trump too much favorable press: 
‘When you listen to what the leading candidate on the Republican side has been saying about building walls, about excluding Mexicans and a complete shutdown of all Muslims entering in, and if you actually look at what he specifically said in that now infamous speech about Muslims, he kept saying, ‘They only want jihad. They don’t believe in our way of life. They don’t respect our system,” Clooney said. Via: Daily Mail  ",0
9742,Roger Ailes Hints at Suit Against New York Magazine - The New York Times,"A lawyer for Roger Ailes, the former chairman of Fox News, has sent a letter to New York magazine suggesting he might take legal action over its reporting about Mr. Ailes. Lauren Starke, a spokeswoman for the magazine, said that Charles J. Harder, who was Hulk Hogan’s lawyer in his successful lawsuit against Gawker Media, had contacted the magazine by email and asked it to preserve documents related to Mr. Ailes in preparation for a possible defamation claim. Mr. Harder sent the email on behalf of Mr. Ailes and his wife, Elizabeth, Ms. Starke said. The move was first reported by The Financial Times. Mr. Harder did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Gabriel Sherman, a reporter for the magazine, has written extensively about Mr. Ailes and the sexual harassment allegations by female employees that resulted in his ouster in July as chairman of Fox News. On Friday, New York published a lengthy article by Mr. Sherman about Mr. Ailes and his downfall, and in July Mr. Sherman was the first to report that Rupert Murdoch and his sons, Lachlan and James, had decided to remove Mr. Ailes from his position. Mr. Sherman declined to comment on Mr. Harder’s request. The magazine said Mr. Sherman’s work “is and has been carefully reported. ” Mr. Harder, a Hollywood lawyer, has become a big name in media circles recently for taking on publications on behalf of   clients. In March he won a $140 million judgment in favor of Hulk Hogan, the former professional wrestler whose real name is Terry G. Bollea, in an    lawsuit against Gawker Media. That case was a professional breakout for Mr. Harder, who had previously been known for handling  —   and usually, settling  —   more routine rights’ enforcement cases for celebrities. After the trial, Peter Thiel, the billionaire Silicon Valley entrepreneur, revealed that he had secretly financed Mr. Bollea’s lawsuit and other legal cases against Gawker. Mr. Harder is also representing Melania Trump, the wife of the Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump, in a libel lawsuit filed last week against the publisher of The Daily Mail. The lawsuit was filed shortly after Mr. Harder sent letters to several publications, including The Daily Mail, Politico and Liberal America, threatening legal action if they did not retract articles that Ms. Trump said contained defamatory statements, including that she was once an escort. The Daily Mail retracted the article and issued an apology after the lawsuit was filed.",0

[A   Facebook post claimed that the restaurant’s “manager sang along as well,” The News  Observer reports.  The viral social media message prompted David Harris, the owner of Smithfield’s Chicken ’N    restaurant, to issue a stern apology and promise to “terminate anyone employed that doesn’t share our RESPECT of ALL law enforcement. ” On Saturday, a Facebook post on the Raleigh Police Department’s page said that the department “appreciates the long term and strong relationship it continues to have with Smithfield’s. ” Raleigh Police Protective Association union President Matthew Cooper also posted a Facebook message. “We really appreciate the support we have received from the incident involving Smithfield’s Chicken and BBQ,” Cooper’s message read. “We are confident that a positive resolution will occur as a result from our effort”: As recently as last July, rapper Ice Cube vowed to continue to perform the vulgar 1980s song. In the wake of fatal police shootings in Dallas, Texas, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the NWA rapper and actor told TMZ, “I ain’t gonna change nothing I do because I ain’t do nothing wrong. ” The profane “f*ck the police” refrain is often heard at Black Lives Matter rallies and is shouted during protests. Ice Cube performed “F*ck the Police” last July at the 2016 Le Festival d’été de Québec (Quebec City Summer Festival) just two days after Houston New Black Panther Party member Micah X Johnson shot and killed five officers in Dallas.

9744,"Girl Posting to Twitter From Aleppo Gains Sympathy, but Doubts Follow - The New York Times","She is a    with dimples, pink hair ribbons, a missing front tooth and halting English who first captured global attention three months ago with Twitter messages about bombs, death and despair in eastern Aleppo, the   section of the Syrian city. The girl, Bana   has since attracted more than 220, 000 followers on  Twitter, where her account says it is managed by her mother, Fatemah, who also posts messages there. Bana’s Twitter followers include the   author J. K. Rowling, who was so taken with her story of survival that she sent her Harry Potter  . Western news organizations have produced articles and television segments extolling Bana’s pluckiness in the face of fear, and she was the subject of a New York Times column in October. So when Bana’s Twitter account, @AlabedBana, was deactivated last weekend as Syrian military forces advanced into eastern Aleppo, many worried that she had been killed  —   only to learn on Tuesday that the account had reappeared. And in a new posting on Wednesday, Bana’s account suggested Syrian ground troops had seized her neighborhood: Images of suffering children in Syria have occasionally punctured the world’s conscience even as it has grown accustomed to the violence of the country’s nearly    conflict. Like Alan Kurdi, a    Syrian whose drowned body was discovered on a beach in Turkey, and Omran Daqneesh, dazed and bloodied after his home in Aleppo was bombed, Bana has touched a nerve. But in an era of internet hoaxes, fabrications and the increased use of fake news around the world to further political agendas, Bana’s Twitter account has also raised some questions of veracity and authenticity. Her messages are sophisticated for a    for example, particularly for one whose native language is not English. Others have disarming grammatical errors that invite sympathy: Some people have questioned whether the videos in which Bana speaks were rehearsed or altered. The inaccessibility of much of the Syria conflict to journalists, who often have no way of confirming the provenance of information directly, has amplified those concerns. According to Bana’s mother, who describes herself as a    teacher of English and who has spoken with The New York Times via Skype and WhatsApp, the Twitter postings originated in eastern Aleppo, where Fatemah said she lived with Bana and her two younger children, Mohamed, 5, and Noor, 3. All appear in photographs and videos posted by the @AlabedBana account. But Bana is the only one who spends significant time on camera or who speaks to the audience in English. She appears in many of the clips to be reading from a card or to have memorized lines. Fatemah, who says she taught Bana to speak English, appears to be digitally astute in photographing and recording her daughter. However, a handful of videos on Bana’s account seem to have been filmed by local citizen journalists with   cameras. Bana and family members also were shown in a documentary broadcast in France last month about Aleppo, produced by Sept à Huit, a leading French magazine. Antigovernment activists and doctors working in eastern Aleppo have corroborated, through Skype and WhatsApp, that Bana and her mother are who they say they are. But Bana’s Twitter account has also drawn an inordinate number of trolls and voices sympathetic to the Syrian government and its Russian backers, who assail Bana as a fraud. Some have called Bana’s father a violent jihadist affiliated with   fighters ensconced in eastern Aleppo. Others have called Bana and her mother fictions created by the United States as a propaganda tool to malign the Syrian and Russian governments. There is some precedent for such cynicism, and a notable example also had a Syrian connection. In 2011, a woman who described herself as a lesbian blogger using the pseudonym Amina Arraf wrote about political persecution in Damascus, the capital, and suddenly disappeared. The “gay girl in Damascus,” as the blogger came to be known, turned out to be a    American man from Georgia. Twitter has designated Bana’s account as “verified”  —   meaning that the company has established the authenticity of the account holder. Besides talking with Bana’s mother, The New York Times has been able to verify, through comparisons with satellite maps, that at least some videos posted from Bana’s Twitter account were filmed in Al Shaar, a neighborhood in eastern Aleppo. But it is unclear whether all of her Twitter posts  —   which could be put online from anywhere, by anyone with Bana’s password  —   originated in eastern Aleppo. Nor is it clear how many posts Bana has composed herself. Bana’s mother did not immediately respond to requests via WhatsApp for clarification on these questions. International aid advocates have expressed mixed feelings about Bana’s fame  —   satisfaction that she has increased global sympathy for child victims in Syria, but concern that her story, as presented on Twitter, may not be entirely accurate. “Whether it’s Bana, or Alan Kurdi, or Omran Daqneesh, they bring attention to an issue in a way that helps people visualize a little more clearly the situation of children,” said Sonia Khush, the Syria director of Save the Children. “In the case of this girl, I don’t know whether it’s true or fake in this age of social media,” she said. “But her living as a child in Aleppo is consistent with what we hear. The fear, the sounds of different airplanes and drones. They’re terrified and have trouble sleeping at night. ” Juliette S. Touma, a Unicef spokeswoman for the Middle East and North Africa, acknowledged that there was, in Bana’s case, “no way to verify where the tweets are coming from, or whether they’re coming from the girl or somewhere else. ” At the same time, Ms. Touma said, “there is something symbolic about the tweets that are coming out from Bana, or that account, in the sense that it highlights the story of children who are caught up in the crossfire  —   it’s not just one girl, it’s many boys and girls. ” Despite the questions surrounding Bana’s account, news organizations have embraced it as a window into the Syria conflict. When the account went dark over the weekend, some outlets reported its absence with breathless urgency. “Her Twitter account was deleted and nobody knows why,” CNN said. “Bana   the    girl whose tweets from   eastern Aleppo in Syria captivated people around the world, appears to be in mortal danger,” CBS News said. Such reports underscore the phenomenon that Bana’s social media presence has become. Abdulkhafi Alhamdo, a prominent eastern Aleppo activist who knows the family, said via WhatsApp on Wednesday that Bana and her mother had temporarily halted their Twitter posts over the weekend for security reasons. “Her father said they are scared of regime revenge,” he said. “Regime has got agents here and spies. ” Some experts on news media ethics said that, despite the appeal of such a heartbreaking narrative  —   and with a young girl at its center, no less  —   news outlets had to approach the account with skepticism, and that some had fallen short. “It’s always a question of whether a    is being used as a propaganda tool, and if so, by whom,” said Jane E. Kirtley, a professor of media ethics and law at the University of Minnesota. “Sometimes we fall in love with a concept and basically ignore things that would undermine that concept, and ignore things that should be red flags. ” She added, “For me, my antenna always goes up when the story is this compelling. ” Kathleen Bartzen Culver, the director for the Center for Journalism Ethics at the University of   said some news outlets, including morning network news shows in the United States, seemed to have “suspended skepticism. ” “There are times when I will read or watch something when I will think, ‘I just don’t think we have our critical thinking hats on at the moment,’” she said. But she said that those questioning or denigrating Bana’s account on Twitter should be challenged, as well. “We can’t just question this source,” she said. “We also have to question the person accusing the source of being part of the propaganda scheme. ”",0
9745,The Mucus-Shooting Worm-Snail That Turned Up in the Florida Keys - The New York Times,"It’s bright orange and yellow and about as long as your finger. It lives underwater in a limestone tube with an opening at the tip about as wide as a pencil eraser. It glues its home to hard surfaces and stays for the rest of its life. It’s a species of   that may never have been seen before, and somehow it turned up in an artificial reef in the Florida Keys. On land, its table manners would not seem so polite. It shoots strings of mucus from its mantle  —   a footlike appendage hanging out of the tube’s opening  —   in slow motion, like some warped, weirdo, saltwater version of  . It releases the strings into the current, forming a snotty web that it holds on to with its equivalent of a toothy tongue, trapping plankton and other ocean debris. Then it reels in whatever it has trapped, along with the snot. In a study published Wednesday in PeerJ, scientists have identified this new species of  . They’ve named it Thylacodes vandyensis after the  General Hoyt S. Vandenburg, a sunken, retired naval ship where tens of thousands of the snails live. If they spread elsewhere, the   could damage the region’s living coral. The Vandy, as divers have nicknamed it, is among a number of large, retired ships sunk in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary to provide new homes for ocean creatures and alternative diving spots. Researchers like Rüdiger Bieler, a curator at the Field Museum in Chicago and the lead author of the paper, monitor these artificial reefs to see what’s settling in. In 2014, during two   dives, he and his colleagues found three of these  . Now there are thousands. Dr. Bieler thinks the   could indicate what kind of marine life is settling into the reefs. To make a terrestrial comparison: “Are we getting the native butterflies back, or are we just seeing feral cats?” he wonders. “It’s a new species, but we’re still not 100 percent sure where it’s coming from. ” The closest relatives of the previously undescribed   are native to the Pacific Ocean. He speculates that these mollusks stowed away on a ship before taking advantage of the uninhabited artificial reefs: “There’s this   real estate where there are nonlocal species, few predators and very little competition. ” Monitoring these creatures on the Vandy could help prevent their spread to natural reefs, where they could do great damage. Similar   found in the Pacific and the Red Sea have been found to slow coral reef recovery by killing coral tissue and chasing off fish with a bioactive compound in their mucus. “When you have them in the living reef,” Dr. Bieler said, “there’s always this kind of death zone around them. ”",0

After Sweeping Election, First Thing Trump Invites Netanyahu to U.S. for Meeting By VNN on November 9, 2016 To Hell With Detroit or New Orleans, Trump Calls ISRAEL to Pay Hommage to Masters! 
After sweeping the election on Tuesday, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump invited Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the U.S. for a meeting. 
The two spoke on the phone on Wednesday hours after Netanyahu congratulated Trump on his surprising win, saying Trump was a “true friend of Israel.” According to a statement by Netanyahu, during their phone call, the two agreed to meet at the “first opportunity.” 
Following the election results, Netanyahu published a statement congratulating Trump, saying: “President-elect Trump is a true friend of the State of Israel. We will work together to advance the security, stability and peace in our region. The strong connection between the United States and Israel is based on shared values, shared interests and a shared destiny. 
“I’m certain that President-elect Trump and I will continue to strengthen the unique alliance between Israel and the United States, and bring it to new heights,” he added. 
This after it was disclosed earlier this month that Donald Trump was paid $ 25 million by Israeli Firster Zionist Billionaire Sheldon Adelson who fronts for AIPAC and the Zionist State. 
President Reuven Rivlin also congratulated Trump. 
“I want to congratulate President elect Donald Trump, his family, and all the American people who have once again shown the world it is the greatest democracy.” 
“I hope together Israelis and Americans can grow our innovation and cooperation, which are the fruits of liberty, and equality. God bless you, Mr. President,” Rivlin added. 
Opposition leader Isaac Herzog (Zionist Union) congratulated Trump on Facebook: “Warm wishes to the president of the strongest and biggest global power: Donald J. Trump!” 
Habayit Hayehudi Chairman Naftali Bennett, meanwhile, hoped Trump’s election would bring an end to the two-state solution. 
“Trump’s victory is a tremendous opportunity for Israel to immediately announce its intention to renege on the idea of establishing Palestine in the heart of the country – a direct blow to our security and the justice of our cause. 
“This is the president-elect’s outlook as it appears in his platform, and that definitely should be our way. Salient, simple and clear. The era of the Palestinian state is over.”",0

It turns out that Secretary of State is not really all about being the nation's chief diplomat and top foreign policy aide to the president, but is rather a cozy career path for Democratic politicians who want to pad their resumes. Who knew? 
As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was an indisputable disaster. Leaving aside the clear violations with her private email server, which transmitted classified information , was potentially hacked , and put the nation's security at risk for Clinton's “ convenience ” here are a few more of her lowlights: 
Completely misjudging the Arab Spring “democratic” movement 
Gravely miscalculating with her “reset” policy and encouraging Russian aggression 
Assessing Bashar al-Assad as a “ reformer ,” overseeing a disastrous Syrian policy 
Failing to support the Iranian people during their freedom demonstration 
Pushing to remove Gaddafi by force in Libya, only to leave it a failed state 
Overseeing a Middle Eastern policy that culminated in the rise of ISIS 
Failing to secure the Benghazi, Libya annex that was overrun by terrorists, leading to the death of four American servicement, then lying by blaming a Youtube video Image Credit: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images 
It goes on and on. But it gets worse. The reigns at the State Department were turned over to Senator John Kerry, whose testimony on the Vietnam war is notorious on the right. Kerry's tenure has been nothing short of feckless and laughable. No, seriously. 
Vladimir Putin, for example, is actually laughing at Kerry's useless protestations against Russia's backing of Assad. Kerry was also a vocal supporter of the Iranian nuclear deal, and he is satisfied that the deal will keep the mullahs on good behavior, despite their venomous hatred of the United States and lengthy track record of lying. 
The icing on the cake for this stretch of Democratic career politicians taking over the helm at State will culminate with Hillary Clinton's whispered preference for the job with current Vice President Joe Biden. Image Credit: Mark Wilson/Getty Images 
As reported by The Washington Examiner: 
Vice President Joe Biden is at the top of the list for secretary of state if Hillary Clinton pulls out a win on Nov. 8. 
A source close to Clinton's transition team told Politico on Thursday evening that the Democratic nominee is already making serious considerations when it comes to who would be part of a Clinton 2.0 Cabinet. 
The hilarious part? Biden himself seems to be oblivious to the potential nod. 
Biden himself is apparently unfamiliar with the news. Neither Clinton, a former secretary of state herself, nor her aides, have informed the former Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman that he's most likely to oversee international affairs if she wins. 
“He'd be great, and they are spending a lot of time figuring out the best way to try to persuade him to do it if she wins,” said the source familiar with the transition planning. 
Though many are in disbelief about the report, there is one very plausible reason to believe that Biden very well could spend his sunset years at the State Department: And that's the reward for not running. https://t.co/10DepJ4x9B — Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) October 28, 2016

9749,Donald Trump Nominates Christopher Wray to Lead FBI,"President Donald Trump has nominated Christopher Wray as the new FBI director. [“I will be nominating Christopher A. Wray, a man of impeccable credentials, to be the new Director of the FBI,” the president announced on Twitter on Wednesday morning. “Details to follow. ”  Wray served as the Associate Deputy Attorney General in former President George W. Bush’s administration and was promoted to the assistant attorney general for the criminal division, before he left to work in the private sector as a partner at the Washington law firm King  Spalding. During his time in government, he oversaw the highly publicized Enron case and oversaw the legal aspects of the war on terror after   according to King  Spalding’s website. He also served as Governor Chris Christie’s personal attorney during the bridgegate scandal. Last week, Christie praised Wray as an “outstanding lawyer,” after it was revealed that he was under consideration. “He has absolute integrity and honesty, and I think that the president certainly would not be making a mistake if he asked Chris Wray to be FBI director,” Christie said. Trump’s choice earned praise from Norm Eisen, a Brookings Institute fellow and former ethics czar for former president Obama. “Good choice. Oversaw Enron case, which I also spent years of my life on,” Eisen wrote on Twitter. “He was very fair. I endorse. ”  ",0
9750,Border Patrol Agents Recover 44 Migrants from Stash House,"Border Patrol agents from the Laredo and Rio Grande Valley Sectors joined up to raid a stash house where 44 illegal immigrants were being warehoused. [The agents raided a stash house near Donna, Texas, located south of McAllen along the Rio Grande Border with Mexico. Agents also captured and arrested the smuggler who managed the human warehouse.  The agents joined forces with Hidalgo County Precinct 1 Constable’s Office deputies, information provided to Breitbart Texas by U. S. Border Patrol officials. The law enforcement officials received a tip about suspicious activity at the house. After obtaining permission to search the home, the agents and deputies found that 44 people from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras were being held in the home. Human smugglers frequently store their human cargo in what Border Patrol officials have described in the past as “deplorable” conditions. The women are often sexually assaulted or threatened while men are frequently beaten. They are oftentimes held for ransom as   smugglers contact family members requesting additional funds to move their loved one forward along the smuggling trail, Breitbart Texas has reported in the past. “The outstanding work done by all involved is a great example of how our enforcement strategy, utilizing collaboration across the South Texas Corridor, is working,” Rio Grande Valley Sector Acting Chief Patrol Agent Raul Ortiz said in a written statement. “In this case, 44 illegal immigrants were spared from being held in a crammed stash house and a smuggler was apprehended. ” The 44 migrants were removed from the house and taken to the Weslaco Station for processing. The human smuggler, a Mexican national, was arrested and turned over for prosecution. “The callous disregard for human life in which these persons were subjected to and the inhumane conditions that they were placed in demonstrates how heartless these smugglers can be,” said Laredo Sector Chief Patrol Agent Mario Martinez. The joint operation, carried out by agents from the Laredo and Rio Grande Valley Sectors, is part of an   Border Safety Initiative. The program is described as a humanitarian,   strategy aimed at reducing migrant deaths. It also serves to educate the public in addition to informing potential illegal immigrants about the dangers of turning their lives or the lives of their children over to the ruthless cartel smugglers.

9751,‘The Greatest Loss and Despair’: Thais Mourn Their King - The New York Times,"BANGKOK  —   The death on Thursday of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, whose leadership helped bring stability to Thailand over the past seven decades, introduced a new era of uncertainty in a sharply divided nation. He was the only monarch most Thais had ever known, and his death set off widespread grief throughout the country. “His Majesty was a beloved and revered king,” said Prime Minister Prayuth   head of the military junta that seized power in 2014. “He unified the hearts of all Thais. It is the greatest loss and despair in the lives of all Thais nationwide. ” King Bhumibol, 88, who ascended to the throne in 1946 and became the world’s   monarch, helped balance rival political factions, at times giving his blessing to juntas that seized power from democratically elected governments, including the current leadership. His son, Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, who for years has spent most of his time in Germany and who has a reputation as a   playboy, is expected to take the throne. It was unclear whether he would have the same moral authority to insert himself into the nation’s contentious politics. On Thursday evening, the crown prince unexpectedly said he was not ready to become king and requested more time to grieve the loss of his father, General Prayuth told reporters. The    prince, who has been the royal heir since 1972, wants to wait until an appropriate time to take on the mantle of monarch, the prime minister said. Thailand’s National Assembly, which had been expected to crown a new king, convened in the evening. Members stood in silence for nine minutes  —   the king was the ninth in his dynasty  —   but adjourned abruptly soon afterward without taking further action. Thai news media reported that Col. Sansern Kaewkamnerd, the government’s chief spokesman, asked all TV channels to show only the government channel’s programming during a   mourning period. Throngs of people had gathered at Siriraj Hospital on Thursday afternoon as rumors of the king’s death spread. Many wore pink, the color thought to bolster his health, and knelt on the ground to pray for his recovery. At one point, the crowd chanted, “Long live the king. ” By then, it was too late. President Obama said in a statement that King Bhumibol, who was born in Massachusetts, was a “close friend” of the United States. “His Majesty was a tireless champion of his country’s development and demonstrated unflagging devotion to improving the standard of living of the Thai people,” Mr. Obama said. “With a creative spirit and a drive for innovation, he pioneered new technologies that have rightfully received worldwide acclaim. ” General Prayuth said flags would fly at   for 30 days and asked the public to refrain from holding celebrations during that period. Government officials will be in a state of mourning for one year, he said. “Even though we are in sorrow and tears are in our faces, our beloved Thailand and the monarchy must continue,” the prime minister said during an appearance broadcast on all television channels. “Do not let the death derail his majesty’s determination to see his kingdom prosper, the people live in blessedness and be kind to each other. ” Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a   professor at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, said King Bhumibol’s accomplishments included helping to develop the nation’s economy and preventing the communist movement from making inroads in Thailand as it swept through neighboring countries. While the last 10 years in Thailand have been volatile, he said, the king’s leadership was especially critical during the height of the Cold War, from the 1950s through the 1970s. “He has left behind a great nation, a grieving and grateful nation,” Professor Thitinan said. “There are detractors and critics who might argue that the monarchy has impeded democratic development over the past decade, but in the broader, overarching perspective, Thailand would not be where it is today without this monarchy and this monarch. ” Thailand has been divided for years between poor farmers mainly in the rural north and more prosperous urban residents centered in Bangkok. At the same time, Muslims have been fighting a   insurgency in the far south for more than a decade, seeking independence from the central government. The military has staged two coups over the past 10 years to oust populist governments that favored the rural poor, first the government led by a billionaire businessman, Thaksin Shinawatra, and later the government of his sister, Yingluck. Part of the rationale for the current government’s remaining in power was to ensure a smooth transition after the expected death of King Bhumibol. The announcement of the king’s passing came about three hours after the official time of death, 3:52 p. m. He died at Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok, where he had been confined for most of the past few years. He had a number of health problems, including kidney failure, and in his final days was on a ventilator. On Wednesday rumors of his death sent the Thai stock market plunging nearly 7 percent before it recovered somewhat later that day to a loss of 2. 5 percent. “Even though the team of doctors tried their best, his illness hasn’t improved and he declined accordingly until 13 Oct. 2016,” the palace said Thursday in its announcement. Although the king’s death had long been anticipated, the reality still came as a shock to many Thais. “I really, really love the king,” said Thanthai Kaenwong, 35, a bartender. “He is the father of all Thais,” he added. “We closed our club today to mourn him. But no one is in the mood, anyway. ” Wimonsiri Kaewsadet, 39, a Bangkok food vendor, grew teary as she spoke of the king. She said her chest felt tight, her face was numb, and she could not eat. She said her sense of loss was even greater than when her own father died. “My heart is broken in pieces,” she said. “No one wished him to go so soon like this. But he was very, very sick. He could not go on. He had endured so much pain. ” She said the king’s absence made her feel uncertain about the country’s future. “It’s the news that no one wants to hear,” she said.",0
9752,The Powerful Effect of Heart-Centered Healing on The Human Body,"Leave a reply 
Michael Forrester – Every cause of disease first begins with an imbalance in the body’s energy systems, specifically, the interaction between how the heart communicates with the brain and the body. Fix that and there is no disease, ever. The heart can produce an electrical field 100 times greater than the brain and a magnetic field 5000 times greater. Which one are you using to heal? 
Emotions are vibrations which influence consistently our reality. We not only think and work our way through a day, meeting, assignment, but also feel and believe our way through it. The outcome depends on both. 
Simply put, the number one cause of health is your energetic and emotional state. How you connect emotionally to your overall wellness and wellbeing is more important than any supplement , food, exercise or health treatment. There is only one cause of disease and that has to do with the energy and frequency imbalances that exist within your body. Rectify that, and disease cannot exist… it would be impossible. 
All the emotions are varieties of two: fear and love: Fear/stress is contagious and causes contraction: inhibits creativity, brain activity, inhibits the immune system, selective perception and over extensive periods of time leads to breakdown. Love (positive beliefs and emotions) has high impact and causes expansion : creativity, physical and mental endurance, more productivity in shorter time because we take decisions quicker because we are receptive and highly perceptive. This a question of Math, HeartMath, as per the contribution in this field of the HeartMath Institute: when one has accurate information, takes better decisions. 
The quality of the field one creates with his heart influences his experience and reality. 
The research behind the evolution of HeartMath came from the idea that the body’s emotional response to events do not always occur from “top-down” processing (i.e., the brain sends signals to the heart and other organs, and the body responds accordingly). Rather, it has now proven that often times our emotional state triggers our heart to send out its own signals to the brain and other organs, and the body then responds accordingly. 
For instance, while two-way communication between the cognitive and emotional systems is hard-wired into the brain, the actual number of neural connections going from the emotional centers to the cognitive centers is greater than the number going the other way. Have you ever: Made a “rash” decision? Done something dangerous on impulse? Taken a risk because you believed in it? This research helps explain the influence emotions have on our ability to think and act. 
In fact, researchers at HeartMath have determined that the physiology and nerve centers of the heart are so complex and active, that they constitute a “brain” all on their own, termed a “mini-brain.” We now know that the heart contains cells that produce and release norepinephrine and dopamine, neurotransmitters once thought to be produced only by the brain and ganglia outside the heart. Even more remarkable is the discovery that the heart produces oxytocin – the “love hormone” – in concentrations that are as high as those in the brain. 7 Simple actions to create positive feelings: 
1. Think about the colleagues who helped you today. Thank them in your heart. Think about your current assignments. Know that they will work out well and work from this space 
2. What is it that you would like to have professionally? A new project? With whom? Think about it in detail, be specific and imagine you are already working on it 
3. Entertain the feeling of celebration that arises in your heart. From this space take the appropriate actions to make it happen 
4. Find ways to help your colleagues, or make them feel that you care. Do one (in)visible act of kindness per day or more if you want to 
5. Before starting your work day give thanks and envision it the way you want it to be 
6. When finishing your work day give thanks and clear it of negative emotions (which come out of fear that we know now is illusion). Do not take them at home or preserve for the next day 
7. Smile 
The time of crisis is literally here: there is the fast pace of our world, the assault of too much to do with too little time and resources. Being in the present moment is just a concept for most of us and has little translation to daily life practice. Fear is wide spread and is polluting us on a very cellular level: hypertension, autoimmune diseases, cancer, infertility, chronic back problems, anxiety, and depression; the list could continue forever. The difference is how we interpret crisis because we can be at complete peace in the midst of chaos. 
Can we live the life we want? Can we be authentic in our speech? Can we identify and release our underlying limiting beliefs so that we begin a new commitment towards genuine compassion, abundance, love and connection. Your commitment will show in your body and intentions. SF Source Wake Up World  ",0

9755,Politics Should Not Ruin Thanksgiving Dinner,"The 2016 presidential election has left the country more divided than ever. As many continue to celebrate Donald Trump’s victory, others are fighting their way through the five stages of grief surrounding Hillary Clinton’s defeat and President Obama’s departure. As much as some would wish otherwise, many of the wars that have stormed social media have extended through families and friendships. With Thanksgiving just a couple of days away, people are concerned that opposing voters may find it difficult to enjoy a long meal together. However, politics should not ruin thanksgiving.
There is always at least one person who arrives at the family gathering ready to talk politics and express why their view is the right one. These are the worst kind of guests. Politics should be the uninvited guest to Thanksgiving festivities as people from around the country celebrate the many reasons to be thankful this year. Anyone that brings up politics over Thanksgiving dinner, with an aim of convincing another or adding insult to injury should be dismissed and possibly not invited back.
President-elect Trump has done many distasteful things throughout the recent campaign, but ruining Thanksgiving should not be one of them. Families work hard to set up the perfect holiday gathering so they can rehash old stories, bond with the newest additions, watch their favorite football team win or lose, and celebrate life over a table filled with favorite foods. Politics should not ruin thanksgiving; instead of a deadly spiral, redirect the conversation back to what really matters.
Truth is, without the likes of a tumultuous election season, holidays have the potential to produce large amounts of anxiety. Relatives and friends, near and far, all gathered into one location hashing out competitive family updates can be stressful enough. Add some spiked cider to that mix and it becomes a recipe for a potential holiday meltdown, so there is no need for politics to ruin Thanksgiving dinner.
Families should remain a family long after Trump takes the Oval Office, so politics should not accompany the turkey at the dinner table. Somewhere down the track, attendees will be split along bipartisan lines. Instead of joining in, why not bow out before blowing up. More than politics, preserving important relationships should be the focal point.
Post-election emotions have already complicated life, as many Americans have known it. Navigating Thanksgiving dinner should not be an added stress. As such, many who are already bruised by the election are now dreading what should be an entertaining and eventful family gathering of food and fellowship. This is a time for expressing thanks while making new memories, not overshadowed by the results of a turbulent electoral season.
Politics should not ruin what has been noted as one of America’s favorite holidays. With multiple personalities and beliefs at the dinner table, the only safe way to handle politics at Thanksgiving dinner is by avoiding it. Not only is it neither the time nor the place, but avoidance protects everyone’s health and sanity. The holiday’s intent is to bring people together peacefully and to celebrate this great country’s resiliency and diversity.

9756,"Peng Chang-kuei, Chef Behind General Tso’s Chicken, Dies at 98 - The New York Times","Peng   the Taiwanese chef who invented General Tso’s chicken, a dish nearly universal in Chinese restaurants in the United States, died on Wednesday in Taipei. He was 98. The death was reported by The Associated Press. The British food scholar Fuchsia Dunlop has called General Tso’s chicken  —   lightly battered pieces of dark chicken fried in a      sauce  —   “the most famous Hunanese dish in the world. ” But like many Chinese dishes that have found favor with Americans, General Tso’s chicken was unknown in China until recently. Nor was it, in the version known to most Americans, Hunanese, a cuisine defined by salty, hot and sour flavors. Mr. Peng, an official chef for the Nationalist government, which fled to Taiwan after the 1949 revolution in China, said he created the dish during a   visit by Adm. Arthur W. Radford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, during the Taiwan Strait crisis of 1955. On the spur of the moment, he assigned it the name of a Hunanese general, Zuo Zongtang, who had helped put down a series of rebellions in the 19th century. “Originally the flavors of the dish were typically Hunanese  —   heavy, sour, hot and salty,” Mr. Peng told Ms. Dunlop, the author of “Revolutionary Chinese Cookbook” (2007) which is devoted to the cuisine of Hunan. “The original General Tso’s chicken was Hunanese in taste and made without sugar. ” The dish made its way to New York in the early 1970s after Chinese chefs in New York, preparing to open the city’s first Hunanese restaurants  —   Uncle Tai’s Hunan Yuan and Hunam  —   visited a restaurant that Mr. Peng had opened in Taipei. They adapted the recipe to suit American tastes. “We didn’t want to copy chef Peng exactly,” Ed Schoenfeld, an assistant to the restaurant’s owner, David Keh, told the website Salon in 2010. “We added our own spin to dishes. And so our General Tso’s chicken was cut differently, into small dice, and we served it with water chestnuts, black mushrooms, hoisin sauce and vinegar. ” The chef was Wen Dah Tai. At Hunam, the chef Tsung Ting Wang  —   who was also a partner with Michael Tong in another prominent Chinese restaurant in Manhattan, Shun Lee Palace  —   put a Sichuan spin on the dish. He crisped up the batter and sweetened the sauce, producing a taste combination that millions of Americans came to love. He called it General Ching’s chicken. But as the dish traveled, the General Tso name adhered. Both restaurants were awarded four stars, the highest rating, by Raymond Sokolov, the restaurant critic of The New York Times. In 1973, with Hunan fever raging, Mr. Peng came to New York and, with Mr. Keh, opened Uncle Peng’s Hunan Yuan on East 44th Street, near the United Nations. Mr. Peng discovered, to his consternation, that his creation had preceded him, and that the child was almost unrecognizable. “New Yorkers didn’t realize he was the real thing, and some treated him like he was copying,” Mr. Schoenfeld said. The tangled history of the dish was explored in 2014 in a documentary, “The Search for General Tso,” directed by Ian Cheney. Peng   was born in Changsha, the capital of Hunan Province, in 1918. His family was poor. At 13, after running away from home, he began serving an apprenticeship under the celebrated Hunanese chef Cao  . Formerly a family chef to Tan   prime minister of the Nationalist government in the late 1920s, Mr. Cao had opened the restaurant Jianleyuan in Changsha. In the 1930s, after the Japanese invasion, Mr. Peng moved to Chungking, the temporary Nationalist capital, where he began to gain renown. After World War II, he was installed as the government’s head banquet chef. He emigrated to Taiwan in 1949, leaving his wife and two sons behind, and continued to cater official functions. He is survived by a son, Peng  . Complete information on other survivors was not available. New York proved to be a fraught experiment, as Mr. Peng’s restaurant soon closed. “Doom trailed Uncle Peng,” the food critic Gael Greene wrote in New York magazine in 1973. “The pressures of Manhattan restaurant reality were too much for the brilliant teacher. ” Undaunted, Mr. Peng borrowed money from friends and opened Yunnan Yuan on East 52nd Street, near Lexington Avenue, where Henry A. Kissinger, then the secretary of state, became a faithful customer. “Kissinger visited us every time he was in New York, and we became great friends,” Mr. Peng told Ms. Dunlop. “It was he who brought Hunanese food to public notice. ” General Tso’s chicken began to assume celebrity status when Bob Lape, a restaurant critic, showed Mr. Peng making the dish in a segment for ABC News. The station received some 1, 500 requests for the recipe. Encouraged, Mr. Peng reopened his old restaurant as Peng’s, bringing his signature dish with him. Reviewing the restaurant in the The Times in 1977, Mimi Sheraton wrote, “General Tso’s chicken was a   masterpiece, sizzling hot both in flavor and temperature. ” He left the restaurant in 1981 and opened Peng’s Garden in Yonkers, then returned to Taiwan in the late ’80s and opened the first in a chain of Peng Yuan restaurants there. The menu featured General Tso’s chicken. It was listed on the menu in Mandarin as Zuo Zongtang’s farmyard chicken, and in English as chicken à la viceroy. In 1990 he opened a branch of his restaurant in the Great Wall Hotel in Changsha, but it was not a success. As Hunanese chefs adopted General Tso’s chicken, the dish entered a strange second career. In a sweeping act of historical revisionism, it came to be seen as a traditional Hunan dish. Several Hunanese chefs have described it in their cookbooks as a favorite of the   general’s.",0
9758,"Fidel Castro, Cuban Revolutionary Who Defied U.S., Dies at 90 - The New York Times","Fidel Castro, the fiery apostle of revolution who brought the Cold War to the Western Hemisphere in 1959 and then defied the United States for nearly half a century as Cuba’s maximum leader, bedeviling 11 American presidents and briefly pushing the world to the brink of nuclear war, died on Friday. He was 90. Cuban state television announced the death but gave no other details. In declining health for several years, Mr. Castro had orchestrated what he hoped would be the continuation of his Communist revolution, stepping aside in 2006 when a serious illness felled him. He provisionally ceded much of his power to his younger brother Raúl, now 85, and two years later formally resigned as president. Raúl Castro, who had fought alongside Fidel Castro from the earliest days of the insurrection and remained minister of defense and his brother’s closest confidant, has ruled Cuba since then, although he has told the Cuban people he intends to resign in 2018. Fidel Castro had held on to power longer than any other living national leader except Queen Elizabeth II. He became a towering international figure whose importance in the 20th century far exceeded what might have been expected from the head of state of a Caribbean island nation of 11 million people. He dominated his country with strength and symbolism from the day he triumphantly entered Havana on Jan. 8, 1959, and completed his overthrow of Fulgencio Batista by delivering his first major speech in the capital before tens of thousands of admirers at the vanquished dictator’s military headquarters. A spotlight shone on him as he swaggered and spoke with passion until dawn. Finally, white doves were released to signal Cuba’s new peace. When one landed on Mr. Castro, perching on a shoulder, the crowd erupted, chanting: “Fidel! Fidel!” To the   Cubans gathered there and those watching on television, it was an electrifying sign that their young, bearded guerrilla leader was destined to be their savior. Most people in the crowd had no idea what Mr. Castro planned for Cuba. A master of image and myth, Mr. Castro believed himself to be the messiah of his fatherland, an indispensable force with authority from on high to control Cuba and its people. He wielded power like a tyrant, controlling every aspect of the island’s existence. He was Cuba’s “Máximo Lider. ” From atop a Cuban Army tank, he directed his country’s defense at the Bay of Pigs. Countless details fell to him, from selecting the color of uniforms that Cuban soldiers wore in Angola to overseeing a program to produce a superbreed of milk cows. He personally set the goals for sugar harvests. He personally sent countless men to prison. But it was more than repression and fear that kept him and his totalitarian government in power for so long. He had both admirers and detractors in Cuba and around the world. Some saw him as a ruthless despot who trampled rights and freedoms many others hailed him as the crowds did that first night, as a revolutionary hero for the ages. Even when he fell ill and was hospitalized with diverticulitis in the summer of 2006, giving up most of his powers for the first time, Mr. Castro tried to dictate the details of his own medical care and orchestrate the continuation of his Communist revolution, engaging a plan as old as the revolution itself. By handing power to his brother, Mr. Castro once more raised the ire of his enemies in Washington. United States officials condemned the transition, saying it prolonged a dictatorship and again denied the   Cuban people a chance to control their own lives. But in December 2014, President Obama used his executive powers to dial down the decades of antagonism between Washington and Havana by moving to exchange prisoners and normalize diplomatic relations between the two countries, a deal worked out with the help of Pope Francis and after 18 months of secret talks between representatives of both governments. Though increasingly frail and rarely seen in public, Mr. Castro even then made clear his enduring mistrust of the United States. A few days after Mr. Obama’s highly publicized visit to Cuba in 2016  —   the first by a sitting American president in 88 years  —   Mr. Castro penned a cranky response denigrating Mr. Obama’s overtures of peace and insisting that Cuba did not need anything the United States was offering. To many, Fidel Castro was a   zealot whose belief in his own destiny was unshakable, a chameleon whose economic and political colors were determined more by pragmatism than by doctrine. But in his chest beat the heart of a true rebel. “Fidel Castro,” said Henry M. Wriston, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations in the 1950s and early ’60s, “was everything a revolutionary should be. ” Mr. Castro was perhaps the most important leader to emerge from Latin America since the wars of independence in the early 19th century. He was decidedly the most influential shaper of Cuban history since his own hero, José Martí, struggled for Cuban independence in the late 19th century. Mr. Castro’s revolution transformed Cuban society and had a   impact throughout the region than that of any other   Latin American insurrection, with the possible exception of the 1910 Mexican Revolution. His legacy in Cuba and elsewhere has been a mixed record of social progress and abject poverty, of racial equality and political persecution, of medical advances and a degree of misery comparable to the conditions that existed in Cuba when he entered Havana as a victorious guerrilla commander in 1959. That image made him a symbol of revolution throughout the world and an inspiration to many imitators. Hugo Chávez of Venezuela considered Mr. Castro his ideological godfather. Subcommander Marcos began a revolt in the mountains of southern Mexico in 1994, using many of the same tactics. Even Mr. Castro’s spotty performance as an aging autocrat in charge of a foundering economy could not undermine his image. But beyond anything else, it was Mr. Castro’s obsession with the United States, and America’s obsession with him, that shaped his rule. After he embraced Communism, Washington portrayed him as a devil and a tyrant and repeatedly tried to remove him from power through an   invasion at the Bay of Pigs in 1961, an economic embargo that has lasted decades, assassination plots and even bizarre plans to undercut his prestige by making his beard fall out. Mr. Castro’s defiance of American power made him a beacon of resistance in Latin America and elsewhere, and his bushy beard, long Cuban cigar and green fatigues became universal symbols of rebellion. Mr. Castro’s understanding of the power of images, especially on television, helped him retain the loyalty of many Cubans even during the harshest periods of deprivation and isolation when he routinely blamed America and its embargo for many of Cuba’s ills. And his mastery of words in thousands of speeches, often lasting hours, imbued many Cubans with his own hatred of the United States by keeping them on constant watch for an invasion  —   military, economic or ideological  —   from the north. Over many years Mr. Castro gave hundreds of interviews and retained the ability to twist the most compromising question to his favor. In a 1985 interview in Playboy magazine, he was asked how he would respond to President Ronald Reagan’s description of him as a ruthless military dictator. “Let’s think about your question,” Mr. Castro said, toying with his interviewer. “If being a dictator means governing by decree, then you might use that argument to accuse the pope of being a dictator. ” He turned the question back on Reagan: “If his power includes something as monstrously undemocratic as the ability to order a thermonuclear war, I ask you, who then is more of a dictator, the president of the United States or I?” After leading his guerrillas against a repressive Cuban dictator, Mr. Castro, in his early 30s, aligned Cuba with the Soviet Union and used Cuban troops to support revolution in Africa and throughout Latin America. His willingness to allow the Soviets to build   sites in Cuba led to a harrowing diplomatic standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union in the fall of 1962, one that could have escalated into a nuclear exchange. The world remained tense until the confrontation was defused 13 days after it began, and the launching pads were dismantled. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Mr. Castro faced one of his biggest challenges: surviving without huge Communist subsidies. He defied predictions of his political demise. When threatened, he fanned antagonism toward the United States. And when the Cuban economy neared collapse, he legalized the United States dollar, which he had railed against since the 1950s, only to ban dollars again a few years later when the economy stabilized. Mr. Castro continued to taunt American presidents for a   frustrating all of Washington’s attempts to contain him. After nearly five decades as a pariah of the West, even when his once booming voice had withered to an old man’s whisper and his beard had turned gray, he remained defiant. He often told interviewers that he identified with Don Quixote, and like Quixote he struggled against threats both real and imagined, preparing for decades, for example, for another invasion that never came. As the leaders of every other nation of the hemisphere gathered in Quebec City in April 2001 for the third Summit of the Americas, an uninvited Mr. Castro, then 74, fumed in Havana, presiding over ceremonies commemorating the embarrassing defeat of C. I. A.  exiles at the Bay of Pigs in 1961. True to character, he portrayed his exclusion as a sign of strength, declaring that Cuba “is the only country in the world that does not need to trade with the United States. ” Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz was born on Aug. 13, 1926  —   1927 in some reports  —   in what was then the eastern Cuban province of Oriente, the son of a plantation owner, Ángel Castro, and one of his maids, Lina Ruz González, who became his second wife and had seven children. The father was a Spaniard who had arrived in Cuba under mysterious circumstances. One account, supported by Mr. Castro himself, was that his father had agreed to take the place of a Spanish aristocrat who had been drafted into the Spanish Army in the late 19th century to fight against Cuban independence and American hegemony. Other versions suggest that Ángel Castro went penniless to Cuba but eventually established a plantation and did business with the despised,   United Fruit Company. By the time Fidel was a youngster, his father was a major landholder. Fidel was a boisterous young student who was sent away to study with the Jesuits at the Colegio de Dolores in Santiago de Cuba and later to the Colegio de Belén, an exclusive Jesuit high school in Havana. Cuban lore has it that he was headstrong and fanatical even as a boy. In one account, Fidel was said to have bicycled   into a wall to make a point to his friends about the strength of his will. In another   tale, young Fidel and his class were led on a mountain hike by a priest. The priest slipped in a   stream and was in danger of drowning until Fidel pulled him to shore, then both knelt in prayers of thanks for their good fortune. A sense of destiny accompanied Mr. Castro as he entered the University of Havana’s law school in 1945 and almost immediately immersed himself in radical politics. He took part in an invasion of the Dominican Republic that unsuccessfully tried to oust the dictator Rafael Trujillo. He became increasingly obsessed with Cuban politics and led student protests and demonstrations even when he was not enrolled in the university. Mr. Castro’s university days earned him the image of   and seemed to support the view that he had had Communist leanings all along. But in an interview in 1981, quoted in Tad Szulc’s 1986 biography, “Fidel,” Mr. Castro said that he had flirted with Communist ideas but did not join the party. “I had entered into contact with Marxist literature,” Mr. Castro said. “At that time, there were some Communist students at the University of Havana, and I had friendly relations with them, but I was not in the Socialist Youth, I was not a militant in the Communist Party. ” He acknowledged that radical philosophy had influenced his character: “I was then acquiring a revolutionary conscience I was active I struggled, but let us say I was an independent fighter. ” After receiving his law degree, Mr. Castro briefly represented the poor, often bartering his services for food. In 1952, he ran for Congress as a candidate for the opposition Orthodox Party. But the election was scuttled because of a coup staged by Mr. Batista. Mr. Castro’s initial response to the Batista government was to challenge it with a legal appeal, claiming that Mr. Batista’s actions had violated the Constitution. Even as a symbolic act, the attempt was futile. His core group of radical students gained followers, and on July 26, 1953, Mr. Castro led them in an attack on the Moncada barracks in Santiago de Cuba. Many of the rebels were killed. The others were captured, as were Mr. Castro and his brother Raúl. At his trial, Mr. Castro defended the attack. Mr. Batista had issued an order not to discuss the proceedings, but six Cuban journalists who had been allowed in the courtroom recorded Mr. Castro’s defense. “As for me, I know that jail will be as hard as it has ever been for anyone, filled with threats, with vileness and cowardly brutality,” Mr. Castro declared. “I do not fear this, as I do not fear the fury of the miserable tyrant who snuffed out the life of 70 brothers of mine. Condemn me, it does not matter. History will absolve me. ” Mr. Castro was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Mr. Batista then made what turned out to be a huge strategic error. Believing that the rebels’ energy had been spent, and under pressure from civic leaders to show that he was not a dictator, he released Mr. Castro and his followers in an amnesty after the 1954 presidential election. Mr. Castro went into exile in Mexico, where he plotted his return to Cuba. He tried to buy a used American PT boat to carry his band to Cuba, but the deal fell through. Then he caught sight of a     wooden yacht named Granma, once owned by an American who lived in Mexico City. The Granma remains on display in Havana, encased in glass. During Mr. Castro’s long rule, his character and image underwent several transformations, beginning with his days as a revolutionary in the Sierra Maestra of eastern Cuba. After arriving on the coast in the overloaded yacht with Che Guevara and 80 of their comrades in December 1956, Mr. Castro took on the role of freedom fighter. He engaged in a campaign of harassment and guerrilla warfare that infuriated Mr. Batista, who had seized power in a 1952 garrison revolt, ending a brief period of democracy. Although his soldiers and weapons vastly outnumbered Mr. Castro’s, Mr. Batista grew fearful of the young guerrilla’s mesmerizing oratory. He ordered government troops not to rest until they had killed Mr. Castro, and the army frequently reported that it had done so. Newspapers around the world reported his death in the December 1956 landing. But three months later, Mr. Castro was interviewed for a series of articles that would revive his movement and thus change history. The escapade began when Castro loyalists contacted a correspondent and editorial writer for The New York Times, Herbert L. Matthews, and arranged for him to interview Mr. Castro. A few Castro supporters took Mr. Matthews into the mountains disguised as a wealthy American planter. Drawing on his reporting, Mr. Matthews wrote sympathetically of both the man and his movement, describing Mr. Castro, then 30, parting the jungle leaves and striding into a clearing for the interview. “This was quite a man  —   a powerful       with a straggly beard,” Mr. Matthews wrote. The three articles, which began in The Times on Sunday, Feb. 24, 1957, presented a Castro that Americans could root for. “The personality of the man is overpowering,” Mr. Matthews wrote. “Here was an educated, dedicated fanatic, a man of ideals, of courage and of remarkable qualities of leadership. ” The articles repeated Mr. Castro’s assertions that Cuba’s future was anything but a Communist state. “He has strong ideas of liberty, democracy, social justice, the need to restore the Constitution, to hold elections,” Mr. Matthews wrote. When asked about the United States, Mr. Castro replied, “You can be sure we have no animosity toward the United States and the American people. ” The Cuban government denounced Mr. Matthews and called the articles fabrications. But the news that he had survived the landing breathed life into Mr. Castro’s movement. His small band of irregulars skirmished with government troops, and each encounter increased their support in Cuba and around the world, even though other insurgent forces in the cities were also fighting to overthrow the Batista government. It was the symbolic strength of his movement, not the armaments under Mr. Castro’s control, that overwhelmed the government. By the time Mr. Batista fled from a darkened Havana airport just after midnight on New Year’s Day 1959, Mr. Castro was already a legend. Competing opposition groups were unable to seize power. Events over the next few months became the catalyst for another transformation in Mr. Castro’s public image. More than 500   officials were brought before   and special tribunals, summarily convicted and shot to death. The grainy    images of the executions broadcast on American television horrified viewers. Mr. Castro defended the executions as necessary to solidify the revolution. He complained that the United States had raised not a whimper when Mr. Batista had tortured and executed thousands of opponents. But to wary observers in the United States, the executions were a signal that Mr. Castro was not the democratic savior he had seemed. In May 1959, he began confiscating privately owned agricultural land, including land owned by Americans, openly provoking the United States government. In the spring of 1960, Mr. Castro ordered American and British refineries in Cuba to accept oil from the Soviet Union. Under pressure from Congress, President Dwight D. Eisenhower cut the American sugar quota from Cuba, forcing Mr. Castro to look for new markets. He turned to the Soviet Union for economic aid and political support. Thus began a   of American antagonism toward Cuba. Finally, in 1961, he gave the United States 48 hours to reduce the staff of its embassy in Havana to 18 from 60. A frustrated Eisenhower broke off diplomatic relations with Cuba and closed the embassy on the Havana seacoast. The diplomatic stalemate lasted until 2015, when embassies were finally reopened in both Havana and Washington. During his two years in the mountains, Mr. Castro had sketched a social revolution whose aim, at least on the surface, seemed to be to restore the democracy that Mr. Batista’s coup had stifled. Mr. Castro promised free elections and vowed to end American domination of the economy and the   oppression that he said it had caused. Despite having a law degree, Mr. Castro had no real experience in economics or government. Beyond improving education and reducing Cuba’s dependence on sugar and the United States, his revolution began without a clear sense of the new society he planned, except that it would be different from what had existed under Mr. Batista. At the time, Cuba was a playground for rich American tourists and gangsters where glaring disparities of wealth persisted, although the country was one of the most economically advanced in the Caribbean. After taking power in 1959, Mr. Castro put together a cabinet of moderates, but it did not last long. He named Felipe Pazos, an economist, president of the Banco Nacional de Cuba, Cuba’s central bank. But when Mr. Pazos openly criticized Mr. Castro’s growing tolerance of Communists and his failure to restore democracy, he was dismissed. In place of Mr. Pazos, Mr. Castro named Che Guevara, an Argentine doctor who knew nothing about monetary policy but whose revolutionary credentials were unquestioned. Opposition to the Castro government began to grow in Cuba, leading peasants and   insurgents to take up arms against it. The Escambray Revolt, as it was called, lasted from 1959 to 1965, when it was crushed by Mr. Castro’s army. As the first waves of Cuban exiles arrived in Miami and northern New Jersey after the revolution, many were intent on overthrowing the man they had once supported. Their number would eventually total a million, many from what had been, proportionately, the largest middle class in Latin America. The Central Intelligence Agency helped train an exile army to retake Cuba by force. The army was to make a beachhead at the Bay of Pigs, a remote spot on Cuba’s southern coast, and instigate a popular insurrection. Mr. Szulc, then a correspondent for The Times, had picked up information about the invasion, and had written an article about it. But The Times, at the request of the Kennedy administration, withheld some of what Mr. Szulc had found, including information that an attack was imminent. Specific references to the C. I. A. were also omitted. Ten days later, on April 17, 1961, 1, 500 Cuban fighters landed at the Bay of Pigs. Mr. Castro was waiting for them. The invasion was badly planned and by all accounts doomed. Most of the invaders were either captured or killed. Promised American air support never arrived. The historian Theodore Draper called the botched operation “a perfect failure,” and the invasion aroused a distrust of the United States that Mr. Castro exploited for political gain for the rest of his life. The C. I. A. fighting the Cold War, had acted out of worries about Mr. Castro’s increasingly open Communist connections. As he consolidated power, even some of his most faithful supporters grew concerned. One break had taken place as early as 1959. Huber Matos, who had fought alongside Mr. Castro in the Sierra Maestra, resigned as military governor of Camagüey Province to protest the Communists’ growing influence as well as the appointment of Raúl Castro, whose Communist sympathies were well known, as commander of Cuba’s armed forces. Suspecting an antirevolutionary plot, Fidel Castro had Mr. Matos arrested and charged with treason. Within two months, Mr. Matos was tried, convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison. When he was released in 1979, Mr. Matos, nearly blind, went into exile in the United States, where he lived until his death in 2014. Shortly after arriving in Miami and joining the legions of Castro opponents there, Mr. Matos told Worldview magazine: “I differed from Fidel Castro because the original objective of our revolution was ‘Freedom or Death.’ Once Castro had power, he began to kill freedom. ” It was not until just before the Bay of Pigs invasion that Mr. Castro declared publicly that his revolution was socialist. A few months later, on Dec. 2, 1961, he removed any lingering doubt about his loyalties when he affirmed in a long speech, “I am a  . ” Many Cubans who had willingly accepted great sacrifice for what they believed would be a democratic revolution were dismayed. They broke ranks with Mr. Castro, putting themselves and their families at risk. Others, from the safety of the United States, publicly accused Mr. Castro of betraying the revolution and called him a tyrant. Even his family began to raise doubts about his intentions. “As I listened, I thought that surely he must be a superb actor,” Mr. Castro’s sister Juanita wrote in an account in Life magazine in 1964, referring to the December 1961 speech. “He had fooled not only so many of his friends, but his family as well. ” She recalled his upbringing as the son of a    landowner in eastern Cuba who had sent him to exclusive Jesuit schools. In 1948, after Mr. Castro married Mirta   whose family had ties to the Batista government, his father gave them a   honeymoon in the United States. “How could Fidel, who had been given the best of everything, be a Communist?” Juanita Castro wrote. “This was the riddle which paralyzed me and so many other Cubans who refused to believe that he was leading our country into the Communist camp. ” Although the young Fidel was deeply involved in a radical student movement at the University of Havana, his early allegiance to Communist doctrine was uncertain at best. Some analysts believed that the obstructionist attitudes of American officials had pushed Mr. Castro toward the Soviet Union. Indeed, although Mr. Castro pursued ideologically communist policies, he never established a purely Communist state in Cuba, nor did he adopt orthodox Communist Party ideology. Rather, what developed in Cuba was less doctrinaire, a tropical form of communism that suited his needs. He centralized the economy and flattened out much of the traditional hierarchy of Cuban society, improving education and health care for many Cubans, while depriving them of free speech and economic opportunity. But unlike other Communist countries, Cuba was never governed by a functioning politburo Mr. Castro himself, and later his brother Rául, filled all the important positions in the party, the government and the army, ruling Cuba as its maximum leader. “The Cuban regime turns out to be simply the case of a   dictator seizing a useful ideology in order to employ its wealth against his enemies,” wrote the columnist Georgie Anne Geyer, whose critical biography of Mr. Castro was published in 1991. In this view of Mr. Castro, he was above all an   Spanish caudillo, one of a long line of Latin American strongmen who endeared themselves to people searching for leaders. The analyst Alvaro Vargas Llosa of the Independent Institute in Washington called him “the ultimate   caudillo. ” In Cuba, through good times and bad, Mr. Castro’s supporters referred to themselves not as Communists but as Fidelistas. He remained personally popular among segments of Cuban society even after his economic policies created severe hardship. As Mr. Castro consolidated power, eliminated his enemies and grew increasingly autocratic, the Cuban people referred to him simply as Fidel. To say “Castro” was considered disloyal, although in later decades Cubans would commonly say just that and mean it. Or they would invoke his overwhelming presence by simply bringing a hand to their chins, as if to stroke a beard. Mr. Castro’s alignment with the Soviet Union meant that the Cold War between the world’s superpowers, and the ideological battle between democracy and communism, had erupted in the United States’ sphere of influence. A clash was all but inevitable, and it came in October 1962. American spy planes took reconnaissance photos suggesting that the Soviets had exploited their new alliance to build bases in Cuba for   nuclear missiles capable of reaching North America. Mr. Castro allowed the bases to be constructed, but once they were discovered, he became a bit player in the ensuing drama, overshadowed by President John F. Kennedy and the Soviet leader, Nikita S. Khrushchev. Kennedy put United States military forces on alert and ordered a naval blockade of Cuba. The two sides were at a stalemate for 13 tense days, and the world held its breath. Finally, after receiving assurances that the United States would remove American missiles from Turkey and not invade Cuba, the Soviets withdrew the missiles and dismantled the bases. But the Soviet presence in Cuba continued to grow. Soviet troops, technicians and engineers streamed in, eventually producing a generation of blond Cubans with names like Yuri, Alexi and Vladimiro. The Soviets were willing to buy all the sugar Cuba could produce. Even as other Caribbean nations diversified, Cuba decided to stick with one major crop, sugar, and one major buyer. But after forcing the entire nation into a failed effort to reach a record    sugar harvest in 1970, Mr. Castro recognized the need to break the cycle of dependence on the Soviets and sugar. Once more, he relied on his belief in himself and his revolution for solutions. One unlikely consequence was his effort to develop a Cuban supercow. Although he had no training in animal husbandry, Mr. Castro decided to crossbreed humpbacked Asian Zebus with standard Holsteins to create a new breed that could produce milk at prodigious rates. Decades later, the Zebus could still be found grazing in pastures across the island, symbols of Mr. Castro’s micromanagement. A few of the hybrids did give more milk, and one that set a milk production record was stuffed and placed in a museum. But most were no better producers than their parents. As the Soviets settled in Cuba in the 1960s, hundreds of Cuban students were sent to Moscow, Prague and other cities of the Soviet bloc to study science and medicine. Admirers from around the world, including some Americans, were impressed with the way that health care and literacy in Cuba had improved. A reshaping of Cuban society was underway. Cuba’s tradition of racial segregation was turned upside down as peasants from the countryside, many of them   descendants of Africans enslaved by the Spaniards centuries before, were invited into Havana and other cities that had been overwhelmingly white. They were given the keys to the elegant homes and spacious apartments of the   Cubans who had fled to the United States. Rents came to be little more than symbolic, and basic foods like milk and eggs were sold in government stores at below production cost. Mr. Castro’s early overhauls also changed Cuba in ways that were less than utopian.   priests were exiled, and local clergy were harassed so much that many closed their churches. The Roman Catholic Church excommunicated Mr. Castro for violating a 1949 papal decree against supporting Communism. He established a sinister system of local Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, which set neighbors to informing on neighbors. Thousands of dissidents and homosexuals were rounded up and sentenced to either prison or forced labor. And although blacks were welcomed into the cities, Mr. Castro’s government remained overwhelmingly white. Mr. Castro regularly fanned the flames of revolution with his oratory. In marathon speeches, he incited the Cuban people by laying out what he considered the evils of capitalism in general and of the United States in particular. For decades, the regime controlled all publications and broadcasting outlets and restricted access to goods and information in ways that would not have been possible if Cuba were not an island. His revolution established at home, Mr. Castro looked to export it. Thousands of Cuban soldiers were sent to Africa to fight in Angola, Mozambique and Ethiopia in support of Communist insurgents. The strain on Cuba’s treasury and its society was immense, but Mr. Castro insisted on being a global player in the Communist struggle. As potential threats to his rule were eliminated, Mr. Castro tightened his grip. Camilo Cienfuegos, who had led a division in the insurrection and was immensely popular in Cuba, was killed in a plane crash days after going to arrest Huber Matos in Camagüey on Mr. Castro’s orders. His body was never found. Che Guevara, who had become hostile toward the Soviet Union, broke with Mr. Castro before going off to Bolivia, where he was captured and killed in 1967 for trying to incite a revolution there. Despite the fiery rhetoric from Mr. Castro in the early years of the revolution, Washington did attempt a reconciliation. By some accounts, in the weeks before he was assassinated in 1963, Kennedy had aides look at mending fences, providing Mr. Castro was willing to break with the Soviets. But with Kennedy’s assassination, and suspicions that Mr. Castro and the Cubans were somehow involved, the 90 miles separating Cuba from the United States became a gulf of antagonism and mistrust. The C. I. A. tried several times to eliminate Mr. Castro or undermine his authority. One plot involved exposing him to a chemical that would cause his beard to fall out, and another using a poison pen to kill him. Mr. Castro often boasted of how many times he had escaped C. I. A. plots to kill him, and he ordered information about the foiled attempts to be put on display at a Havana museum. Relations between the United States and Cuba briefly thawed in the 1970s during the administration of President Jimmy Carter. For the first time,   were allowed to visit family in Havana under strict guidelines. But that fleeting détente ended in 1980 when Mr. Castro tried to defuse growing domestic discontent by allowing about 125, 000 Cubans to flee in boats, makeshift rafts and inner tubes, departing from the beach at Mariel. He used the opportunity to empty Cuban prisons of criminals and people with mental illnesses and force them to join the Mariel boatlift. Mr. Carter’s successor, Reagan, slammed shut the door that Mr. Carter had opened. In 1989, when frustrated veterans from Cuba’s African ventures began rallying around Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa, who led Cuban forces on the continent, Mr. Castro effectively got rid of a potential rival by bringing the general and some of his supporters to trial on drug charges. General Ochoa and several other   officers were executed on the orders of Raúl Castro, who was then the minister of defense. The United States economic embargo, imposed by Eisenhower and widened by Kennedy, has continued for more than five decades. But its effectiveness was undermined by the Soviet Union, which gave Cuba $5 billion a year in subsidies, and later by Venezuela, which sent Cuba badly needed oil and   economic support. Most other countries, including close United States allies like Canada, maintained relations with Cuba throughout the decades and continued trading with the island. In recent years, successive American presidents have punched big holes in the embargo, allowing a broad range of economic activity, though maintaining the ban on tourism. “I faced my greatest challenge after I turned 60,” Mr. Castro said in an interview with Vanity Fair magazine in 1994. He was referring to the collapse of the Soviet empire, which brought an end to the subsidies that had kept his government afloat for so long. He had also lost a steady source of oil and a reliable buyer for Cuban sugar. Abandoned, isolated, facing increasing dissent at home, Mr. Castro seemed to have come to the end of his line. Cuba’s collapse appeared imminent, and Mr. Castro’s final hours in power were widely anticipated. Miami exiles began making elaborate preparations for a triumphant return. But Mr. Castro, defying predictions, fought on. He chose an unlikely weapon: the hated American dollar, which he had long condemned as the corrupt symbol of capitalism. In the summer of 1993, he made it legal for Cubans to hold American dollars spent by tourists or sent by exiled family members. That policy eventually led to a dual currency system that has fostered resentment and hampered economic development in Cuba. Mr. Castro, the     was also willing to experiment with capitalism and free enterprise, at least for a time. Encouraged by his brother Raúl, he allowed farmers to sell excess produce at market rates, and he ordered officials to turn a blind eye to small,   kitchens and restaurants, called paladares, that charged market prices. Under Rául Castro, those reforms were broadened considerably, though they were sometimes met with public grumbling from his older brother. But despite his apparent distaste for capitalism, and lingering memories of the 1950s Cuba that preceded his rule, Fidel Castro continued to foster Cuba’s tourism industry. He allowed Spanish, Italian and Canadian companies to develop resort hotels and vacation properties, usually in association with an arm of the Cuban military. For many years, the resorts were off limits to most Cubans. They generated hard cash, but a new generation of struggling young Cuban women were lured into prostitution by the tourists’ money. For a time, Mexican and Canadian investors poured money into the decrepit telephone company (owned by ITT until it was nationalized by Mr. Castro in 1960) mining operations and other enterprises, which helped keep Cuba’s economy from collapsing. He declared an emergency during which he expected the Cuban people to tighten their belts. He called the United States embargo genocide. All his efforts were not enough to keep dissent from sprouting in Havana, Santiago de Cuba and other urban areas during this period of hardship. Despite worldwide condemnation of his actions, Mr. Castro clamped down on a fledgling democracy movement, jailing anyone who dared to call for free elections. He also cracked down on the nucleus of an independent press, imprisoning or harassing Cuban reporters and editors. In 1994, for the first time, demonstrators took to the streets of Havana to express their anger over the failed promises of the revolution. Mr. Castro had to personally appeal for calm. Then, in early 1996, he seized an opportunity to rebuild his support by again demonizing the United States. A South Florida group, Brothers to the Rescue, had been flying three civilian planes toward the Cuban coast when two were shot down by Cuban military jets. Four men on board were killed. Mr. Castro raged against Washington, maintaining that the planes had violated Cuban airspace. American officials condemned the attack. Until then, President Bill Clinton had been moving discreetly but steadily toward easing the United States embargo and   some relations with Cuba. But in the wake of the attack, and the virulent reaction from   in Florida  —   a state Mr. Clinton considered important to his   bid  —   he reluctantly signed the   law, which allowed the United States to punish foreign companies that were using confiscated American property in Cuba. The State Department’s first warnings under the new law went to a Canadian mining company that had taken over a huge nickel mine, and a Mexican investment group that had purchased the Cuban telephone company. Despite protests from American allies, the United States maintained the   law as a weapon against Mr. Castro, although all its provisions have never been carried out. But in Cuba, the American actions reinforced Mr. Castro’s complaints about American arrogance and helped channel domestic dissent toward Washington. One of his strengths as a communicator  —   he considered Reagan his only worthy competitor in that regard  —   had always been to transform his anger toward the United States into a rallying cry for the Cuban people. “We are left with the honor of being one of the few adversaries of the United States,” Mr. Castro told Maria Shriver of NBC in a 1998 interview. When Ms. Shriver asked him if that truly was an honor, he answered, “Of course. ” “For such a small country as Cuba to have such a gigantic country as the United States live so obsessed with this island,” he said, “it is an honor for us. ” As he grew older and grayer, Mr. Castro could no longer be easily linked to the intense guerrilla fighter who had come out of the Sierra Maestra. He rambled incoherently in his long speeches. He was rumored to be suffering from various diseases. After 40 years, the revolution he started no longer held promise, and Cubans by the thousands, including many who had never known any other life but under Mr. Castro, risked their lives trying to reach the United States on rafts, inner tubes and even old trucks outfitted with floats. Although the revolution lost its luster, what never diminished was Mr. Castro’s ability to confound American officials and to create situations to seize the advantage of a particular moment. That was evident early in 1998 when Pope John Paul II visited Havana and met with Mr. Castro. The meeting was widely expected to be seen as a rebuke and an embarrassment to Mr. Castro. The aging   pontiff stood beside the aging Communist leader, who had abandoned his military uniform for the occasion in favor of a dark suit. The pope talked about human rights and the lack of basic freedoms in Cuba. But he also called Washington’s embargo “unjust and ethically unacceptable,” allowing Mr. Castro to claim a political if not a moral victory. The next year, Mr. Castro converted another conflict into an opportunity to bolster his standing among his own people while infuriating the United States. A young woman and her    son were among more than a dozen Cubans who had set out for Florida in a   aluminum boat. The boat capsized and the woman drowned, but the boy, Elián González, survived two days in an inner tube before being picked up by the United States Coast Guard and taken to Miami, where he was united with relatives. Later, however, the relatives refused to release the boy when his father, in Cuba, demanded his return. The standoff between the family and United States officials created the kind of emotional and political drama that Mr. Castro had become a master at manipulating for his own purposes. Mr. Castro made the boy another symbol of American oppression, which diverted attention from the deteriorating conditions in Cuba. After several months, American agents seized the boy from his Miami relatives and returned him to his father in Cuba, where he was greeted by Mr. Castro. That episode carried great significance for Mr. Castro in the way it echoed one in his personal life. Mr. Castro and his wife, Mirta   divorced in 1955, six years after the birth of their son, Fidelito. In 1956, when Mr. Castro and Ms.   were both in Mexico, Mr. Castro arranged to have the boy visit him before embarking on what he said would be a dangerous voyage, which turned out to be his invasion of Cuba. He promised to bring the boy back in two weeks, but it was a trick. At the end of that period, Mr. Castro placed Fidelito in the custody of a friend in Mexico City. He then sailed for Cuba with his fellow rebels on the yacht Granma. The boy’s mother, with the help of her family and the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City, found a team of professional kidnappers, who ambushed the boy and his guardians in a park and carried him off. Ms.   took Fidelito to New York and enrolled him in a local school for a year. But after Mr. Castro entered Havana and grabbed control of the government, he persuaded his former wife to send the boy back. The younger Mr. Castro lived in Cuba until, years later, he was sent to the Soviet Union to study. He became a physicist, married a Russian woman and eventually returned to Cuba, where he was named head of Cuba’s nuclear power program. Details of Mr. Castro’s personal life were always murky. He had no formal home but lived in many different houses and estates in and around Havana. He had relationships with several women, and only in his later years was he willing to acknowledge that he had a relationship of more than 40 years with Dalia Soto del Valle, who had rarely been seen in public. (Whether they were legally married was not clear.) The two had five sons  —   Alexis, Alexander, Alejandro, Antonio and Ángel  —   all of whom live in Cuba. Mr. Castro also has a daughter, Alina, a radio host in Miami, who bitterly attacked her father on the air for years. Mr. Castro had stormy relations with many of his relatives both in Cuba and the United States. He remained close to Celia Sánchez, a woman who was with him in the Sierra Maestra and who looked after his schedule and his archives devotedly, until she died in 1980. A sister, Ángela Castro, died at 88 in Havana in February 2012, according to The Associated Press, quoting her sister Juanita. And his elder brother Ramón died in February 2016 at 91. Outlasting all his enemies, Mr. Castro lived to rule a country where the overwhelming majority of people had never known any other leader. Hardly anyone talked openly of a time without him until the day, in 2001, when he appeared to faint while giving a speech. Then, in 2004, he stumbled while leaving a platform, breaking a kneecap and reminding Cubans again of his mortality and forcing them to confront their future. As Mr. Castro and his revolution aged, Cuban dissidents grew bolder. Oswaldo Payá, using a clause in the Cuban Constitution, collected thousands of signatures in a petition demanding a referendum on free speech and other political freedoms. (Mr. Payá died in a car crash in 2012.) Bloggers wrote disparagingly of Mr. Castro and the regime, although most of their missives could not be read in Cuba, where internet access was strictly limited. A group of Cuban women who called themselves the Ladies in White rallied on Sundays to protest the imprisonment of their fathers, husbands and sons, whose pictures they carried on posters inscribed with the number of years to which they were sentenced as political prisoners. After being made his brother’s successor, Raúl Castro tried to control the fragments of the revolution that remained after Fidel Castro fell ill, including a close association with President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, who modeled himself after Fidel. (Mr. Chávez died in 2013.) Never as popular as his brother, Raúl Castro was considered a better manager, and in some ways was seen as more conscious of the everyday needs of the Cuban people, despite his reputation as the revolution’s executioner. One of his first moves as leader was to replace the grossly overcrowded city buses, known as “camels,” with new ones, many imported from China. He opened up the economy somewhat, allowing entrepreneurs to start businesses, and he eased restrictions on traveling, access to cellphones, computers and other personal items, and the buying and selling of property. Still, Raúl Castro came under mounting pressure from Cubans demanding even more economic and political opportunity. He took more steps to open the economy and, in so doing, dismantled parts of the socialist state that his brother had defended for so long. Lurking in the background as Raúl Castro embarked on that new course was the brooding visage of Fidel, whose revolution has been seen as a rebellion of one man. When President Obama and Raúl Castro simultaneously went on TV in their countries in 2014 to announce a prisoner exchange and the first steps toward normalizing relations, Cubans and Americans alike expected to hear Fidel either accepting or condemning the moves. Six weeks after the deal was announced, Mr. Castro, or someone writing in his name, finally reacted in a way that combined his own bluster and his brother’s new approach. “I do not trust the politics of the United States, nor have I exchanged a word with them, but this is not, in any way, a rejection of a peaceful solution to conflicts,” Mr. Castro wrote near the end of a rambling letter to students on the commemoration of the 70th anniversary of his own time at the University of Havana. Sounding more like his brother than his old self, he backed any peaceful attempts to resolve the problems between the two countries. He then took one final swipe at his old nemesis. “The grave dangers that threaten humanity today have to give way to norms that are compatible with human dignity,” the letter said. “No country is excluded from such rights. With this spirit I have fought, and will continue fighting, until my last breath. ” In April 2016, a frail Mr. Castro made what many thought would be his last public appearance, at the Seventh Congress of the Cuban Communist Party. Dressed in an incongruous blue tracksuit jacket, his hands at times quivering and his once powerful voice reduced to a tinny squawk, he expressed surprise at having survived to almost 90, and he bade farewell to the party, the political system and the revolutionary Cuba he had created. “Soon I will be like everybody else,” Mr. Castro said. “Our turn comes to us all, but the ideas of Cuban communism will endure. ” No one is sure if the force of the revolution will dissipate without Mr. Castro and, eventually, his brother. But Fidel Castro’s impact on Latin America and the Western Hemisphere has the earmarks of lasting indefinitely. The power of his personality remains inescapable, for better or worse, not only in Cuba but also throughout Latin America. “We are going to live with Fidel Castro and all he stands for while he is alive,” wrote Mr. Matthews of The Times, whose own fortunes were dimmed considerably by his connection to Mr. Castro, “and with his ghost when he is dead. ”",0
9759,Republican Party Targets Four California Democrats in 2018 - Breitbart,"The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) has named four Democratic California congressmen it plans to target and defeat in next year’s midterm elections. [According to the Los Angeles Times, the NRCC’s “top offensive targets” are Reps. Ami Bera (  Grove, 7th district) Salud Carbajal (  Barbara, 24th district) Scott Peters (  Diego, 52nd district) and Raul Ruiz (  Springs, 36th district).  Bera was barely able to secure his seat in the district’s expensive race against Republican candidate Sheriff Scott Jones last year. He beat Jones by just over 6, 000 votes, or approximately three percentage points. The Times notes that Carbajal, 52, a freshman congressman, won his seat by six points against Republican challenger Justin Fareed, 28. He reportedly started off the 2018 cycle with just over $52, 000 in his war chest. Democrats held an   advantage over Republicans in Carbajal’s district before the election. The Times also reported last month that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had released a list of seven California Republicans they are planning to target  including Reps. Jeff Denham (  10th district) David Valadao (  21st district) Steve Knight (  25th district) House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (  39th district) Mimi Walters (  45th district) Dana Rohrabacher (  Mesa, 48th district) and Darrell Issa (  49th district). Clinton also carried the districts listed above during the general election. Among the Republicans targeted by the Democrats, Reps. Issa, and Denham won   against their challengers by the smallest margins. Issa was able to secure his seat by just 1, 621 votes against Democrat Douglas Applegate. Denham beat Democrat Michael Eggman by 8, 201 votes. Applegate has announced he plans to run against Issa again in 2018. According to the Times, Denham, Issa and Valadao were also among the top spenders in California on a   basis in the November election, spending well above $30 per each vote they received.

They’re nervous. They’re frightened about what they see happening to the American government. And this Trump regime —  I don’t call it an administration, I call it a regime. That’s how they act. They have appointed several former generals, that’s very   to the rest of the world.

9761,Fox News Gets Destroyed While Trying To Blame Hillary Clinton For GOP Email Scandal,"By Jason Easley on Sun, Oct 30th, 2016 at 2:37 pm Fox News Sunday's Chris Wallace tried to blame Hillary Clinton for the email scandal that Republicans created and got destroyed by Clinton campaign manager Robbie Mook. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
Fox News Sunday’s Chris Wallace tried to blame Hillary Clinton for the email scandal that Republicans created and got destroyed by Clinton campaign manager Robbie Mook. 
This exchange between Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace and Clinton campaign manager Robbie Mook highlighted why the email scandal isn’t working for the GOP. 
Video: 
Transcript via Fox News Sunday: WALLACE: The last question I want to ask you is that you’re acting as if it was the director who brought this into the election when the fact is that it was Hillary Clinton who brought this into the election. 
I want to go back to the e-mail exchange on March 2nd, 2015, when The New York Times broke the story about Hillary Clinton using private e-mails. We’re going to put it up on the screen. 
Clinton adviser Neera Tanden, “Why didn’t they get the stuff out like 18 months ago? So crazy.” 
Campaign chairman John Podesta, “Unbelievable.” Tanden, “I guess I know the answer, they wanted to get away with it.” 
Robby, it was Clinton who delayed and it was Clinton who brought this into the presidential campaign. 
MOOK: And it is Secretary Clinton who has said this was a mistake. It is Secretary Clinton who cooperated fully with the investigation. And it was Secretary Clinton who accepted the outcome of that investigation. And what secretary Clinton is doing now is saying, if there’s new information, get it out on the table. Let’s get it out. These could be duplicates. 
Again, it’s been reported these e-mails may not have been sent or received by Secretary Clinton. We don’t know anything. And this close to an election, this unprecedented announcement of new information, when – when, again, it’s been reported by Yahoo! News that – that the FBI may have not even seen it. That – that – that Director Comey sent this unprecedented letter shortly before the election when he doesn’t even know what the information is. That’s disturbing. And we’re just asking him, get everything out there that he knows. 
Fox News has no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Clinton, so they have been reduced to whining about why she didn’t release the emails sooner. What Wallace left out was that the release of Clinton’s emails represented an unprecedented level of disclosure. 
Hillary Clinton didn’t cause this email scandal. House Republicans misused their Benghazi Select Committee to go on a fishing expedition for Hillary Clinton’s emails. 
Robbie Mook destroyed Fox News with facts, because unlike Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton hasn’t worked to keep information hidden from the public. Trump has not released his tax returns, medical records, or an accounting of his business dealings with Russia. Trump has been the least transparent nominee in more than 40 years. 
Republicans and conservative media are blaming Clinton for the scandal that they created as justification for continuing the investigations of her after the election. 
Clinton’s campaign manager was able to wipe the floor with the Republican talking points because at the end of the day the email scandal remains a conspiracy about nothing.",0
9762,They Get Paid to Have a Catalog-Perfect Summer - The New York Times,"One morning last month, the ferry from Hyannis, Mass. to Nantucket Island carried   tourists, seasonal laborers and two young blond British women who were three weeks into what was quite possibly the best summer of their lives. Fee Meynell and Ella Crockett plopped their bags down for the      ride. Ms. Meynell, 23, was lively and talkative. Ms. Crockett, 21, was conserving her energy, having recently spent four days sick in bed. “I’m very fragile,” she said, slumping over a table. Ms. Meynell and Ms. Crockett are “Seasonnaires,” the term the British clothing company Jack Wills uses for its summertime brand ambassadors. They had been chosen from 3, 000 applicants and sent to live for two months in a location with a Jack Wills shop for Ms. Crockett, it was Nantucket, for Ms. Meynell, Martha’s Vineyard. “When I applied, it was a pipe dream,” Ms. Meynell said. “You never expect to get it, do you?” She recalled that as a teenager she had a poster in her bedroom of Jack Wills Seasonnaires jumping up and down in front of a lighthouse. Her relationship with “Jack,” as she called the brand, had been “very  . ” “I probably took it quite far,” she said. “I’d go out in Jack Wills pajamas. ” Jack Wills is still   in America, one of those preppyish brands like Vineyard Vines or Kiel James Patrick that’s a shared secret among the   crowd from Annapolis, Md. to Kennebunkport, Me. But in Britain, it has been popular for years. At the suburban London high school that Ms. Meynell attended, the cool kids wore Jack Wills hoodies, crews and chinos. “If you didn’t have Jack, you were no one,” she said. Ms. Crockett, who also grew up in suburban London and has modeled for Jack Wills, nodded in agreement, saying: “At my school, you put your lunch in a    Jack Wills bag. You wanted the bedding. You wanted the knickers. You were obsessed. ” Both remembered fawning over the brand’s catalogs, which, similar to those of Abercrombie  Fitch, feature attractive young men and women cavorting at sporting events or falling into bed in their underwear,   fight. (The sexualized imagery in the spring 2016 catalog  —   and its winking promotional copy about “midnight mischief”  —   led it to be banned by the Advertising Standards Authority, a British media watchdog.) On the ferry ride, both women wore the brand they have been relentlessly promoting. Ms. Meynell had on the red Bagley shorts and a white Eccleston   while Ms. Crockett was dressed in black Fernham   jeans and the Hoyle tank. Her overnight things were stuffed into an      duffel bag. They were returning after a night in Chatham, a town on Cape Cod that also has a Jack Wills store. Three weeks into their branded summer, the women were still adjusting to New England, which neither had ever visited before, and to their    social schedule, in keeping with the corporate hashtag mantra to #livelifelouder. “Mealtime is not a thing when you’re a Seasonnaire,” Ms. Meynell said. “I eat at 2 a. m. when I get home. ” And the partying and brand promotion doesn’t end at the bar. “We have so much alcohol in the house,” Ms. Crockett said. When Ms. Meynell and Ms. Crockett were selected for the Seasonnaire program, they were sent for training at Jack Wills’s London headquarters, where they met with the   and chief executive, Pete Williams. Now 42, Mr. Williams, who is British, started the brand at 24, an age when he had already realized, he said, that his best years were behind him. Jack Wills was about capturing (or recapturing) the rush of college and   youth. “You have all the amazing independence of being an adult, but haven’t lost the naïveté,” Mr. Williams said from Britain by phone. “You don’t have a boss, a wife or husband, kids or a mortgage and the responsibilities that grind us all down. That spirit is intoxicating, and you don’t realize it until later. ” Founded in 1999, the brand’s visual and spiritual DNA comes from Salcombe, a preppy nautical resort town in southwest England similar to Nantucket that Mr. Williams once visited with a college girlfriend. As for the term Seasonnaire, it’s based on a tradition in Europe in which students would take a gap year between high school and college and go work at, say, a ski resort in the French Alps. “It was an amazing time in your life, lots of fun working and partying,” Mr. Williams said. The job of a Jack Wills Seasonnaire, as Ms. Crockett and Ms. Meynell learned, involves going out to bars, beaches and restaurants, meeting lots of people and spreading the word about Jack in the friendliest, most organic way possible. So far, in an expansion push into America begun in 2010, the brand has opened stores in wealthy enclaves and university towns on the East Coast like Westport, Conn. and Boston. Seasonnaires also work in the stores and organize promotional parties like the Croquet and Cocktails event that was held at the Chatham Bars Inn. Being a Seasonnaire is a pretty good gig. The company pays their room and board, allowed them to go on a shopping spree at its Boston location and puts them up at houses set aside for Jack Wills employees. They get around in vintage Land Rovers, or “Landies,” as the women called them, painted in the company colors, blue and pink. They also have expense accounts to go with salaries they would not disclose. Both Ms. Meynell and Ms. Crockett were paired for the summer with male American counterparts who share the rental houses and job responsibilities. Splashing in the waves, sipping champagne on yachts, having sunset dinner parties right on the beach: A Seasonnaire’s life is like a catalog shoot come to life. Mr. Williams encourages the young people he ships off to what he called “emotionally rich locations” in America to say yes to everything. During their orientation in London, Ms. Meynell and Ms. Crockett heard the legend of Red Rainey, a   Seasonnaire of a few summers back who had made a name for himself in company lore as a nonstop party animal, always up for anything. “I remember Pete said, ‘Be like Red,’” Ms. Crockett recalled. Mr. Williams sounded as if he wouldn’t mind trading places with the Seasonnaires in his employ. “They make me jealous, actually,” he said. “I try to live my life vicariously through them. ” By early August, Ms. Meynell and Ms. Crockett had each compiled a personal highlight reel of good times: a blur of boat trips, barhopping,   conversations with strangers and fast friends and sunbaked days patrolling the islands in the Landies. Ms. Meynell and her American counterpart, Sean Fegan, started a biweekly Jack Wills party at the Loft, a club on Martha’s Vineyard. One night she danced until 1:30 a. m. then invited everyone back to the rental house for pizza. “It got to 5 a. m. and we said, ‘Should we get a cab to the beach and watch the sunrise? ’” Ms. Meynell said. “We climbed one of those lifeguard stands and watched the sun come up. ” “We went to bed feeling very knackered,” she said, using a British term for exhausted. In Nantucket, Jack Wills sponsors a dance party on Mondays at the Chicken Box, where on a recent night Ms. Crockett stood on stage laughing as she tossed preppy merchandise into the crowd as if tossing chum to sharks. “It’s literally like I’ve got a million dollars in my hand,” she said. “It’s ridiculous. ” The Seasonnaires are either embraced or derided on Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard, depending on one’s age and tolerance for red Solo cups. It’s not uncommon for Ms. Meynell to meet people, she said, who have been partying in the house where she is staying, or even in her bedroom, during previous summers. Ms. Crockett, meanwhile, was convinced that the Nantucket police see the    Landy coming a mile away and get their summons books ready. She was making quite an impression herself Ms. Meynell said “the sushi guy” at a Nantucket restaurant they frequented had a crush on Ms. Crockett. Despite ample suitors, both women said they had not entered into a summer romance. The main man in their lives, it seems, was Jack. For part of her time on Nantucket, Ms. Crockett had worked without her Seasonnaire partner, Jon Wormser, who had to go home for family reasons. Ms. Meynell regularly took the ferry over from the Vineyard to help out for instance, during the Monday parties at the Chicken Box. Mr. Fegan, a muscled surfer with long hair and a friendly Labradorish manner, has been Ms. Meynell’s steady partner on the Vineyard, helping plan a dinner party one Saturday and translating American slang for her. Mr. Fegan, a Maryland native with only passing knowledge of Jack Wills before this summer, theorized that he was picked partly because he attends college in North Carolina. Like a seed pod, he would spread the brand to the South. Mr. Fegan was heading into his senior year in the fall, vaguely dreading it. “I’m 22,” he said. “Sadly, I don’t want to graduate. ” The culmination of the summer for the Seasonnaires, as well as for many other people on the islands, is the   festivities held in   on Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket. On a recent afternoon, Ms. Meynell and Ms. Crockett were busy planning the Jack Wills  . At the end of the month, Ms. Crockett planned to visit New York before returning to Britain and her senior year of college. Ms. Meynell’s Seasonnaire experience was more bittersweet: It marked a goodbye to carefree summers. Having already graduated from college in June, she will return to London to a new apartment and her first adult job. “When I’m older and have children I can say, ‘O. K. this summer, my last summer, I did this,’” Ms. Meynell said. “‘I have said yes to everything, lived up to that, pushed my boundaries. ’” She’ll also be flying home with bags of Jack Wills clothes bought with her earnings.",0
9763,"Reince Priebus, Normalizer in Chief - The New York Times","Ten days removed from the   shock of Donald Trump’s election, around lunchtime on a Friday, I navigated the jagged lines of steel barriers, police officers and Secret Service battalions with big dogs and big guns surrounding Trump Tower. The    shopping mall, tourist trap and TV set had been transformed into the unlikely plotting ground for the nation’s immediate future. It was anybody’s guess what was taking shape inside the gilded bunkers. Clots of media people,   and protesters crowded the lobby and nearby streets for the occasional clue, or at least glimpses of Marla Maples and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. Kellyanne Conway posed for a selfie with a few lucky cops. The locus of the scene was a bank of elevators ferrying staff, cabinet candidates and the competing maestros of the Trump transition to and from various nerve centers over several floors. Every time a bell sounded, announcing the opening of an elevator door, lobby heads would bob expectantly. “Is that what Jeff Sessions looks like?” I heard a photographer ask (no, it is not, and it was not). No doubt a host of key Trump orchestrators and luminary actors were making ample use of auxiliary entrances and exits, sneaking in and out. New rumors, predictions and potential firestorms seemed to materialize every hour. The Kremlinology of the incoming White House is shaping up as knotty, to say the least. Not one of Trump’s initial   hires has any experience working in a White House. How will they work with the volatile   and   maven in the Oval Office? With his proclivity to make decisions based on the last person he speaks to? With his children playing an uncertain role, his    a possibly   whisperer? How will it all work with Trump’s senior adviser Steve Bannon, former head of Breitbart News, who has a long rap sheet of racial, ethnic and sexist affronts and a   war on Washington Republicans? I had gone to Trump Tower to see Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, whom Trump named as his chief of staff five days after his election, in the same release in which Bannon was named chief strategist and senior counselor. Bannon was mentioned first, for Kremlinologists scoring at home, and his appointment has consumed the bulk of the attention, given his hyperprovocative ways. But Priebus, in a sense, filled a more exotic role. He would be the chief establishment ambassador for a president whose brief and meteoric political career has been predicated on blowing that establishment up. A generous reading is that Trump is trying to foster a   tension between his top deputies, who will represent his own diametrically opposed impulses (Bannon the   devil on one shoulder, Priebus the peacemaking angel on the other). The simpler reading is that Trump hasn’t thought that much about this and is simply trying to reward and surround himself with people he feels served him well in the campaign. “It’s almost like a puzzle mystery,” Priebus told me last summer. I don’t recall what we were talking about, but Priebus had a knack for homespun Wisconsin logic and, particularly, throwaway lines that would stick with me. I kept thinking of the puzzle mysteries that were playing out up and down Trump Tower, even though I showed up Friday without an appointment with Priebus and was confined to the lobby watching tourists ride up and down its   escalators. Priebus and I started talking last spring, as I was undertaking an article for this magazine about the seemingly fracturing state of the Republican Party. We kept in touch during the campaign, drank the occasional Miller High Life in his office and exchanged the sporadic email. Priebus was constantly going on TV saying he was certain Trump would win, even though he could read polls and precedents like everyone else. Still, he carried on as the chief carrier of Trump’s choppy water because that’s what a party chairman does: He smiles and spins and swallows his   plans and audibles in the name of getting his nominee to the finish line. In a sense, Priebus, who squired his future wife to a local G. O. P. banquet on their first date, was the purest form of “political hack” that Trump would rail against as he bulldozed the G. O. P. For his efforts during the campaign, Priebus gained the respect and gratitude of Trump loyalists  —   especially the fiercest loyalist, Donald J. Trump himself. He also won derision and ridicule. He was the subject of multiple stories in The Onion (“Reince Priebus Smiles, Shakes Head While Flipping Through Old Briefing on G. O. P. ’s Plans for 2016”). His spirited TV defenses of Trump’s indefensible behavior drew him comparisons to “Baghdad Bob” (Muhammad Said  ) Saddam Hussein’s chief propagandist during the early months of the Iraq war, whose dubious predictions of imminent victory despite growing devastation all around made him an international laughingstock. Long before Trump’s victory, back when it seemed like a long shot, I asked Priebus whether he would consider taking a job in a Trump administration  —   maybe a plum ambassadorship to somewhere. “Yes,” he said. “Wisconsin. ” It was a throwaway answer to a throwaway question, which was laughably hypothetical anyway. But I never had a sense he had thought that much about a Trump administration job, besides possibly staying on as R. N. C. chairman whether or not the Donald prevailed. For all his   sheepishness, Priebus’s “just a kid from Kenosha, Wisc. ” shtick belies a penchant for main stages,   rooms and   company. No shortage of Reince Priebus photos hang on the walls of the R. N. C. ’s headquarters on Capitol Hill. He can be a little  . He travels far and often to appear with candidates and party dignitaries at events where his presence is not necessarily required. Priebus was giddy when I spoke to him last spring as he prepared to attend a party for Time’s “100 most influential people” at Lincoln Center. We were on the phone, him walking through the lobby of the J. W. Marriott after a packed day of  . He sounded almost out of breath, less from exhaustion than what seemed like pure excitement. He told me how stoked he was to meet the golfer Jordan Spieth and the     the Rock. “Those are my top two,” Priebus said, especially the Rock. “I was a big   fan back in the day,” he added, noting his childhood admiration for Hulk Hogan and Mad Dog Vachon. “Growing up in Kenosha, Wisc. being named to the Top 100 list is a pretty cool thing,” Priebus told me. At this point, I reminded him that no national party chairman would ever be named to the Top 100 except in extraordinary circumstances like these  —   and these were not particularly enviable ones. The White House chief of staff’s post is arguably the most grueling job in Washington. It would be a burnout caldron under even the most predictable and disciplined of presidents. The average tenure of a White House chief of staff is about two years.    jobs are so synonymous with thanklessness that a whole White House mythology surrounds them. “A good chief of staff is seldom popular,” Richard Nixon wrote in his 1990 memoir. “He must see that his chief gets the credit for the administration’s successes and must take the heat for its failures, even when they are not his fault. . .. He sometimes finds he doesn’t have many friends or supporters. Some may well call him just a prat boy. ” Some may call Priebus worse than that, and maybe already have. “Eat rocks” is an expression I’ve heard Priebus use a few times. It refers to being game to do what is needed: swallowing pride and taking one (or one thousand) for the team. If serving as R. N. C. chairman in 2016 has been the definition of eating rocks, Priebus’s next gig could go down even harder. “It’s   and never stops,” says Andy Card of the job he held in George W. Bush’s White House for more than five years, making him the    chief of staff in history. “My only area of angst on Priebus is that he has young children,” Card added, referring to Priebus’s son and daughter. Card has a few other concerns, one of which he says presented itself as soon as Trump “jumped all over” Megyn Kelly in the first Republican primary debate last year. “I’m thinking he would be a very hard president to work for if he doesn’t accept people speaking candidly to him. ” Card, who remains close to the Bush family and supported Jeb Bush for president, said the most important part of being a chief of staff is remembering that the “staff” part is far more important than the “chief” part. The president is by far his most important client. “I know of one chief of staff who failed because he was used to being a principal,” says Beth Myers, who served as Mitt Romney’s chief of staff during his four years as governor of Massachusetts. Priebus may not have that problem he has been described with that most anodyne term for a Washington manager, the “ . ” But the White House chief of staff job is not so much about building consensus, Card told me. It’s all about serving the only principal who matters. “Chief of staff is the only job in Washington that really is defined by what the president’s idiosyncrasies are,” Card says. “Are they a morning person or an evening person? Disciplined or not? Do they suffer fools kindly or not?” Priebus and the future   had their dicey stretches, but their relationship grew as the campaign wore on. “Trump told me over and over again, ‘I trust Reince, I trust him,’’u2009” Priebus felt a need to tell me one day in his office last spring. They have both proved a lot of people wrong and were both aggressively underestimated along the way, if not outright dismissed. “I don’t buy this theory that unpredictable is necessarily bad,” Priebus said back when Trump was just his ruffian nominee and not yet his future boss. You can’t appreciate the magnitude of Priebus’s changing loyalties until you consider just how much time, energy and dignity he expended before Nov. 8 trying to protect “the party” from being defiled by Trump. “Donald Trump is Donald Trump, and the party is the party,” Priebus used to tell me during the campaign. His ultimate allegiance was never in question. It was only six years ago that Priebus was happily ensconced in Kenosha as chairman of the Republican Party of Wisconsin. Now he is being described as the consummate “Washington insider” in the Trump White House. He certainly has a line to Republican officials, namely his close friend and fellow Wisconsinite Paul Ryan. But in the end, for Priebus, it’s now all about serving Trump, whose partisan impulses have proved flexible through the years  —   let alone his allegiance to the G. O. P. He ran, foremost, as a candidate of disruption. He fashioned himself a dealmaker. No doubt this could immediately run afoul of the conservative orthodoxy that has driven the Republican agenda on Capitol Hill. Trump also vowed to “drain the swamp” of the “bloodsucker” lobbyists and “blood money”   “political hacks” and various other parasites and   that have fattened themselves so spectacularly in   City. In many ways, these are Priebus’s people. He has cavorted,   and campaigned with them for years, attended their    donors’ breakfasts and mediated their disputes for the good of the party. He will most likely be looked upon as a chief emissary to the Capitol Hill, K Street and donor constituencies that Trump explicitly campaigned against  —   the chief of swamp. For his part, Bannon has undertaken an incendiary mission over the years to upend the G. O. P. “establishment,” no one more so than Ryan (“a total and complete sellout of the American people,” Breitbart once declared, referring to Ryan’s stewardship of House appropriations). Bannon could occupy something of a mysterious Svengali role in the tradition of presumed   presidential whisperers like Karl Rove (for George W. Bush) and Valerie Jarrett (for Barack Obama). Both Rove and Jarrett represented wild cards in their respective White Houses and regular thorns in the sides of the various chiefs of staffs with whom they served. But one notable difference is that neither Rove nor Jarrett made it his or her goal to obliterate the establishments that their presidents were trying to fold themselves into nor did either have close ties to fringe elements of their parties, as Bannon has to the     and its main platform. Breitbart has been described as a “white   propaganda mill” by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The site has posted articles linking undocumented immigrants to disease, declared in a headline that “Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy,” promoted the Confederate flag (“Hoist It High and Proud: The Confederate Flag Proclaims a Glorious Heritage”) and referred to Gabby Giffords as “the   Movement’s Human Shield. ” Bannon, who has tried to play down the most extreme elements of the   in recent days, nonetheless viewed Trump as a kindred provocateur  —   a feeling that appears mutual. In one form or another, Priebus will try to integrate his establishment orientations with these disruptive forces operating all around him. Back during the campaign, Priebus used to refer admiringly to Trump as “an earthquake in a box. ” In a separate conversation (and metaphor) he described his challenge to me as keeping Trump inside “the funnel. ” Presumably this meant keeping him directed and contained, easier said than done, but still fascinating  —   and somewhat entertaining  —   to watch unfold in the campaign. But with the presence of Bannon and the weight of Trump leading a nervous and divided nation, the challenge in the White House is considerably less entertaining to contemplate. Washington  —   like the presidency, certainly  —   creates its own distinct funnel that will shape Trump and everyone around him in inexplicable and perhaps dark ways. As it turned out, Priebus never showed his face in the lobby of Trump’s building, at least when I was there. Like many key players inside Trump’s ragtag circle of collaborators, Priebus has gone largely dark since Election Day, holing up in Transition Tower with occasional hops down to Washington. He was not responding to my emails and was described by gatekeepers as “drinking from multiple fire hoses. ” So for now, my most recent and enduring image of Priebus is watching him beaming and   and a bit stunned on TV in the early hours of Nov. 9. A triumphant Trump had just called him to the podium, declared him a “superstar” and compared him to Secretariat. “But I’ll tell you, Reince is really a star,” Trump exulted. “Reince, come up here. Where is Reince? Get over here, Reince. ” Trump offered him the mike and insisted he say something. There could be no more of a pinnacle moment for an avowed Republican Party animal who used to listen to Newt Gingrich speeches in the car as a teenager. He would soon go from being one of the most   figures in American politics to one of the most    insiders in a White House of insurgents. “Ladies and gentleman, the next president of the United States, Donald Trump,” was all Priebus could muster. There were worse images to dwell on before the drama intensified and puzzle mysteries inevitably presented themselves. Who knew what the night’s result would lead to or what “normal” would become for any of the Trumpians soon, or any of us?",0
9764,Pennsylvania Governor Ignores Fracking Health Risks to Children,"Get short URL 0 8 0 0 Governor Tom Wolf of the US state of Pennsylvania has overlooked more than 600 studies that reveal fracking as a public hazard that endangers the health of children attending school near drilling wells, advocacy group Pennsylvanians Against Fracking (PAF) told Sputnik. 
WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — Researchers at the Yale School of Public Health conducted a study that established a connection between fracking and cancer-causing chemicals, which includes some that are known to cause childhood leukemia and lymphoma. Top US Scientist Says Humanity is Too Late to Stop Global Warming ""[Wolf] has not made one statement on any of the studies that I’m aware of,"" PAF founding member Karen Feridun told Sputnik on Wednesday. ""The governor has blinders on."" 
The advocacy group noted in a release that 685 studies conducted in Pennsylvania have linked asthma attacks, migraines, fatigue and chronic nasal and sinus problems to fracking. © RIA Novosti. Aleksey Nikolskyi Hillary Tells Big Oil That Environmentalism is a Russian Hoax to Wreck Economy ""Governor Wolf has ignored them all. But the clear next steps laid out in the Yale study demand his attention,"" the release stated. 
More than 8,500 Pennsylvania children go to school within half a mile of drilling activities, according to the release. Moreover, about 58,000 children attend school a mile away from drilling activities and nearly 132,000 children attend school two miles away from drilling activities, the release added. 
The PAF is consequently calling for Wolf to halt fracking in Pennsylvania amid the hundreds of research studies that link health concerns to fracking, and especially as they relate to children. 
Pennsylvania ranks second in gas production in the United States and about 9,700 unconventional wells have been built in the state since 2004. ...",0
9765,Economists Still Opposed to Trump’s Economic Nationalist Program - Breitbart,"Professional economists continue to march in   against the trade and immigration policies of the Trump administration’s economic nationalism. [Nearly half of American business economists say that the U. S. should ease immigration restrictions. An additional 27 percent say that President Donald Trump should leave immigration policy as it is. Just 19% think policies should be aimed at reducing the flow of immigrants into the country.  Close to 60 percent think the U. S. should expand the number of   visas issued to   workers. Fifteen percent even say that their first priority when it comes to immigration is expanding the number of visas for   workers. Just 9 percent support increased spending on border enforcement. A tiny 5% support increased spending for deportations. Business economists are even more opposed to proposals to impose restrictions on trade.   percent say there should “never” be limits placed on imports into the U. S. while around 70 percent say the U. S. should set up import barriers only “when vital industries are threatened by unfair trade practices. ” The numbers come from a survey of 285 economists released Monday by the National Association for Business Economics. It’s hardly surprising that this group, which represents economists at big businesses like ATT and WalMart, should find its views so out of sync with those of the Trump administration —  and the American people. Prior to the election, 55 percent of economists surveyed by the NABE said Hillary Clinton would do a better job managing the economy. Fifteen percent chose Gary Johnson. Just 14 percent chose Donald Trump.",0
9766,"The N.B.A. Fashion Runway: The Stars, the Styles ... the Trash? - The New York Times","OAKLAND, Calif.  —   The beautiful millionaires arrive in couture. Cameras are there to greet them as their fans stand by on social media, craving glimpses of their   ensembles. Suddenly, however briefly, the bowels of basketball arenas are turned into the shabbiest fashion runways in the world. For all their dazzling feats on the court, N. B. A. stars have somehow made an event out of simply showing up at games. The sports world and the fashion world cannot look away, even if the setting is an underground tunnel in, say, Oracle Arena  —   approximately nine million miles from Milan. “Oh, it’s beautiful,” Sarah Oliphant, an artist who designs backdrops for fashion shows out of her studio in New York, said. She would not stage these N. B. A. arrivals any other way. “These are   people with megamoney behind them in every possible way,” Oliphant said. “But the runway is a linoleum floor and a   tunnel,” and you can see Teamsters setting up in the background. She added: “I couldn’t have even thought that up. It’s brilliant. Whoever came up with this is brilliant. ” The N. B. A. finals between the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers are shaping up as one of the season’s biggest stages  —   for fashion, of course. The basketball has been decent, too, although not overly competitive. The Warriors will look to build on their     lead when the series resumes in Cleveland on Wednesday night. “You stress over outfits for days,” the Warriors’ Stephen Curry said in an interview, “and you wind up wearing it for 30 seconds when you walk from the parking lot to the locker room. ” But those 30 seconds are important. Important to broadcast partners like ESPN and Turner Sports, who have filmed these entrances throughout the postseason to help fill pregame airtime. Important to viewers at home, who want to see their favorite players behind the scenes. Important to fashion designers, who benefit from mainstream exposure. And important to the players, who have come to delight in the strange pageantry of it all. “I’ve got to make sure everything looks good coming out of the car,” Curry, the league’s most valuable player, said. “You don’t want to have a missed button or a wrinkled shirt. ” It is an oddly   environment for high fashion. Nobody made a bigger splash in recent weeks than Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder, whose team fell to the Warriors in the Western Conference finals. Westbrook’s bursts of sartorial pyrotechnics  —   denim overalls one game,   blazer the next  —   were offset by an obstacle course of trash cans, ladders and heating ducts. “It’s become an event unto itself, which is kind of amazing,” Brett J. Banakis, a stage and film production designer, said. “So you’ll have Russell Westbrook wearing a lime green jumpsuit and walking past the most banal objects possible. ” Banakis has been a fan of Westbrook’s since they were students together at U. C. L. A. where Westbrook played basketball and Banakis played trombone in the marching band. (They were once on the same charter flight to the Final Four, Banakis said.) Banakis said it made sense for   players to embrace their opportunities to flash some individual style, even if their milieu is a loading dock. “Most of the time, you see them wearing uniforms,” he said. “So this is really their only moment to say, ‘This is me. ’” Oliphant, the backdrop designer, is not a huge basketball fan  —   “I usually choose the team that has the nicest colors and costumes,” she said  —   but she has been transfixed by the clips of players arriving for games. Oliphant cited the authenticity of the whole setup. Consider the Cavaliers’ LeBron James, who, seconds after arriving at Oracle for Game 1 on Thursday night, deposited some personal items in a small plastic tub before he went through a metal detector. He even had to wait in line behind a couple of team officials. (LeBron: Just like us!) “It wouldn’t have the same effect if you took all these guys and you put them up at Lincoln Center in one of the big   venues,” Oliphant said. “I could even paint them a giant backdrop, but it wouldn’t be the same. It would no longer be accessible to my nephew who would never watch something on fashion. ” Curry said he did not realize that he needed to care about his   pregame walk to the locker room until he made his first playoffs appearance with the Warriors in 2013. All of a sudden, camera crews were waiting for him. He knew then that he had to put more effort into his attire. It has become an important part of his game day ritual. “I would wear most of this stuff anyway, especially for the playoffs,” he said. “You want to feel good for each game. ” While television has used player arrivals as pregame fodder for years, social media has given these small moments greater currency. They have also become much more involved productions. Nian Fish, a creative director and producer of fashion shows and events, said she was struck by the work of the film crews. “You can see a guy holding up a big floodlight because they’re obviously going through this dark tunnel,” Fish said. “So I’m like, wow, that’s really amazing that they’re doing a lighting production to create a video of this, their own version of the red carpet. They’re really producing this shot. ” All for a few seconds of video. There are other logistical hurdles, said Tim Corrigan, a senior coordinating producer for ESPN. Because home and visiting teams often arrive at different entrances, Corrigan assigns crews to camp out at each location. Players also show up at various times. When the Warriors are on the road, for example, they have three buses that leave for the arena in   increments. By now, ESPN’s crew knows that Curry tends to take the last bus, which usually pulls in about two hours before the game. Once he arrives, Curry takes measured steps past the assembled masses, his strides slow but purposeful. “It’s a normal walk,” the assistant coach Bruce Fraser said, “for someone who knows someone else is staring at him. ” Other players are more elusive. Corrigan recalled how Ray Allen, the former N. B. A. player, liked to show up so early for games that he often took a taxi from the team hotel. Marreese Speights, a reserve forward with the Warriors, tries to avoid the cameras altogether. His strategy? Take the last bus to road games and be the last player to disembark, his hope being that everyone will have vacated the premises then. Besides, Speights has no illusions that the cameras are there for him. “People want to see their favorite players all dressed up,” he said. The spotlight that follows Curry does not affect everyone. Steve Kerr, the Warriors’ coach, often shows up for home games in a   and sweatpants. (He carries his suit in a garment bag.) Others take greater pains to be more fashion forward. James Michael McAdoo, a   forward, has friends who send him news clippings and video snippets of Curry that just happen to feature McAdoo standing in the background. McAdoo does not want to look like a slob. “My wife makes sure I dress up for the finals,” he said. “I let her iron my shirts. I pick out my outfit a little bit earlier. It’s not like I just wake up from my nap and throw on whatever. Let’s make sure I have something that’s a little choreographed for each game. ” Curry has become an active participant in the whole process. He goes so far as to watch clips of other players making their arena entrances. “All the time,” Curry, whose competitive drive extends beyond the court, said. “You want to see what the other guys are doing. ”",0

9768,"In New York, Homeless and Making Plans to Vote - The New York Times","At 7 a. m. on Monday, the line for the soup kitchen snaked through a hallway of St. Bartholomew’s Church in Midtown Manhattan as men and a few women, bundled in layers of worn jackets and sweatshirts, waited for a breakfast of mixed greens and egg noodles with beef donated by the nearby Waldorf Astoria. On Tuesday, a handful of soup kitchen regulars will stand in lines at polling places around New York City to cast their votes in a presidential contest where the struggles of poverty rarely made their way into the national debate. But with the help of the League of Women Voters, volunteers with Crossroads Community Services, a nonprofit founded by the church, held voter registration drives in August and September. Homeless people are guaranteed the right to register to vote in New York despite not having fixed addresses as a result of a lawsuit argued by the Coalition for the Homeless in 1984. Wendy Range, 51, signed up, registering for the first time since the 1990s. “It was too important to not have a voice,” she said. Ms. Range said she left an abusive home in Dansville, N. Y. where she was discriminated against as a teenager for being gay. Now, she chuckles at the memory of her first vote at 18 when she supported Ronald Reagan. But she grew serious when discussing how her failure to vote over two decades began with apathy and was reinforced by poverty. Ms. Range, who had attended college and had worked on lighting crews for Off Broadway shows, said her finances grew tenuous in 2008 and she lost her job to budget cuts in 2010. She said she could no longer afford her $   studio in Chelsea and became homeless. She also had no time to think about elections. “Think about being on the street,” she said during an interview at St. Bartholomew’s, where she is a volunteer and a client. “It’s difficult to find somewhere to use the bathroom. It’s difficult to find something to eat. Imagine that, and how do I get to the polls?” But Ms. Range, who recently found a little work, said she had noticed changes in the soup line and was moved to register to vote. “A lot of people out here are working,” she said. “Security guards. Men in suits. What the hell are they doing here? They’re working, but they are not making enough. ” As of Wednesday, there were 36, 520 adults in city shelters overseen by the Department of Homeless Services. As a voting bloc, homeless adults could be powerful, but many are uninterested and overwhelmed. “They are living in crisis and dealing with a lot of immediate needs, and that may prohibit them from voting,” Giselle Routhier, policy director at the Coalition for the Homeless, said. The organization distributed around 1, 500 fliers in shelters for single adults last week, Ms. Routhier said. The flier says voting could influence local and federal housing policies. “At all levels of government, these people have the power to impact your lives,” she said. Vance R. Hinton, who registered two years ago, agreed that voting is an important civic duty, but at the same time he questioned what impact homeless people could have. Born and raised in Harlem within earshot of “the organ and cheers” of Yankee Stadium, Mr. Hinton, 62, went to college with the help of basketball scholarships but fell on hard times after a longtime relationship ended in 2003. He said he once called a sleeping bag in Central Park home but lived these days on the E train. After his meal, Mr. Hinton sipped coffee and opined. He wondered which of the candidates really cared about the issues that affect him. “We have folks living in boxes and living on trains,” said Mr. Hinton, a registered Democrat who was once a member of the Green Party. “None of the folks dealt with that issue. ”",0
9769,New Leak Exposes Hillary’s Real Plan For Clinton Foundation Foreign Donors,"Share This 
The Clinton Foundation and its foreign donors have been an area of concern should Hillary Clinton become president due to accusations of pay-to-play scandals. Knowing this, Hillary gave her word that the Clinton Foundation would stop accepting foreign donations should she be elected president. However, a new leak just exposed her real plan for foreign donors, and it’s not looking good. Hillary Clinton 
Once again, Hillary has landed herself in the middle of more scandalous activity. With the FBI reopening her email and private server investigation and WikiLeaks continuously exposing her corruption, she can’t seem to catch a break — and she shouldn’t. Her long list of scandals continues to grow, as should her nose, after being busted lying to the American people yet again to manipulate her way into our White House. 
According to a leaked memo, Hillary’s words mean nothing. Although she promised that the Clinton Foundation would cease accepting foreign donations if she were to be elected president, a leaked memo has exposed her real plans and proven that she didn’t mean what she said. Two-faced Hillary told the public one thing, while her secret plan was for something much different. 
Thanks to WikiLeaks, the truth is again being revealed after the organization published an email that was sent to John Podesta, the Clinton Campaign chair. The email contained the leaked memo, which appears to have been crafted by Cheryl Mills, a Clinton aide, who wrote, “I connected with HRC this am regarding the steps she will take with regard to the Foundation should she announce a decision to explore a run for the Presidency,” just days before Hillary announced her run for president. 
Although she’s said otherwise throughout her campaign, Hillary’s personal preference, as indicated by the leaked memo dated April 7, 2015, is for the foundation to continue accepting money from foreign governments, The Daily Caller reports, and this could mean bad news for Hillary as five FBI field offices are currently investigating her “nonprofit” foundation due to pay-to-play allegations, although the Department of Justice did their best to suppress investigations into the corrupt Clinton Foundation. 
The leaked memo clearly shows that Hillary indicated to staffers that her personal preference is for the foundation to continue to accept money from foreign governments, even if she is elected president . What’s worse, the corrupt Clintons were hesitant to limit the foundation’s financial operations in any way, as the memo says, Hillary “does not want to limit the Foundation’s ability to operate programs now or in the future,” adding, “ we don’t want to close the door to unexpected opportunities. ” 
The memo goes on to mention a “compromise” option, where it says they could “say that the Foundation will not accept contributions from foreign governments unless that funding is part of an ongoing program or a disbursement for a completed negotiation.” However, under that option, the foundation would continue to accept money from Qatar despite Hillary’s own admission that the country is financially supporting ISIS . 
The “final option” mentioned “would mirror the 2008 [Memorandum of Understanding] agreement whereby the Foundation submits new foreign government contributions and those of a substantial size increase to an independent body (e.g. White House, State Department) for review. The obvious challenge with this is that there is no independent body to make that review.” However, as The Daily Caller notes, Hillary “did not uphold her end of the 2008 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU),” and even liberal-leaning PolitiFact ruled the claim that Hillary acted in accordance with the 2008 MOU “mostly false.” 
When is enough, enough? The Clinton crime family will never change their ways and their fake foundation is only a front for their shady deals. The Clintons’ greed for money and power is endless and nothing — not even our laws — will stand in the way of Hillary and Bill as they grab as much of both as they can. There’s only one place Hillary belongs while on this earth, and that’s not the Oval Office, it’s a cinderblock cell. After her time there is done, she has a one-way ticket to hell, where she probably hopes to overthrow the devil. That is how evil, corrupt, and power hungry she is. Her deceit and depravity know no bounds, and she would even give the devil a run for his money. Do you really want that kind of person to be our next president?",0
9770,Apple Removes New York Times Apps From Its Store in China - The New York Times,"Apple, complying with what it said was a request from Chinese authorities, removed news apps created by The New York Times from its app store in China late last month. The move limits access to one of the few remaining channels for readers in mainland China to read The Times without resorting to special software. The government began blocking The Times’s websites in 2012, after a series of articles on the wealth amassed by the family of Wen Jiabao, who was then prime minister, but it had struggled in recent months to prevent readers from using the   app. Apple removed both the   and   apps from the app store in China on Dec. 23. Apps from other international publications, including The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal, were still available in the app store. “For some time now the New York Times app has not been permitted to display content to most users in China and we have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations,” Fred Sainz, an Apple spokesman, said of the Times apps. “As a result, the app must be taken down off the China App Store. When this situation changes, the App Store will once again offer the New York Times app for download in China. ” Mr. Sainz declined to comment on what local regulations the Times apps were said to have violated, who had contacted Apple and when, and whether a court order or other legal document had been presented. China’s main internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, did not respond to faxed questions. The Times bureau in Beijing said it had not been contacted by the Chinese government about the matter. A Times spokeswoman in New York, Eileen Murphy, said the company had asked Apple to reconsider its decision. “The request by the Chinese authorities to remove our apps is part of their wider attempt to prevent readers in China from accessing independent news coverage by The New York Times of that country, coverage which is no different from the journalism we do about every other country in the world,” Ms. Murphy said in a statement. The request appears to have been made under regulations released in June 2016 called Provisions on the Administration of Mobile Internet Application Information Services. The regulations say apps cannot “engage in activities prohibited by laws and regulations such as endangering national security, disrupting social order and violating the legitimate rights and interests of others. ” The cyberspace administration says on its website that apps also cannot publish “prohibited” information. The ruling Communist Party tightly controls media inside China and employs one of the world’s most sophisticated systems of internet censorship. Chinese law prohibits the publication of “harmful information” online, and officials often take action without legal procedures or court orders against material they deem objectionable. Apple has previously removed other, less prominent media apps from its China store. It is unclear how the company evaluates requests from Beijing to take down apps and whether it ever resists them. Apple’s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has said that the company complies with all local laws. While in early 2016 Apple resisted a court request in the United States for it to help federal officials unlock an iPhone for a criminal investigation, Mr. Cook said he would obey whatever order the court ultimately handed down. In the end, the government was able to unlock the device without Apple’’s help and the case was dropped. Farzana Aslam, associate director of the Center for Comparative and Public Law at the University of Hong Kong, noted that in matters involving customer privacy, Apple requires governments to submit subpoenas, search warrants or other legal documents. “Maybe in the end they have to do it, but I think there’s something to be said about standing up for what you believe in and purporting to put principle before profit in a country like China, to show that actually there is this tension there,” Ms. Aslam said. “It’s not as simple as, ‘Because we operate in your jurisdiction, we’ll do anything you ask of us. ’” She added that it was “very worrying” that Apple had not disclosed what laws the authorities said were violated, making it difficult for The Times and other publishers to file an appeal or challenge the government’s requests. In the weeks leading up to the withdrawal of the Times apps, The Times was working on various articles related to the Chinese government. One of them, posted online on Dec. 29, revealed the billions of dollars in hidden perks and subsidies that the Chinese government provides to the world’s biggest iPhone factory. China is also one of Apple’s largest iPhone markets, though sales in that region have slowed. On Dec. 23, David Barboza, a Times reporter, spoke with members of Apple’s media team about the article. Mr. Barboza had previously been in touch with the iPhone factory owner, Foxconn. He had also contacted the Chinese government as part of his reporting. Later that day, a separate team from Apple informed The Times that the apps would be removed, Ms. Murphy said. In another article, published on Dec. 22 as a post on its Sinosphere blog, The Times described an   internet video that had been widely promoted by Chinese public security offices. The Times news apps remain available in Apple’s app stores for other countries, as well as the Hong Kong and Taiwan stores, but people must have a credit card with a billing address outside mainland China to download them. The Times crossword puzzle and virtual reality apps remain available throughout China. When the Chinese government began blocking the Times websites in 2012, it also prevented users with Times apps from downloading new content. But readers in China can still gain access to The Times using software that circumvents the government’s firewall. And in July 2015, The Times released a new version of its   app that adopted a different method for retrieving articles, one that the government appeared unable to stop. Apple’s decision to remove the app from its China store should not affect those who have already installed it. But users in China will not be able to download new releases unless they use another region’s app store. The Times discovered after being blocked in 2012 that hackers with possible ties to the Chinese military had targeted the newspaper’s computer systems and that the attacks coincided with the reporting for that Times investigation. Foreign tech companies face increasing pressure from government authorities in China. In April, Apple’s iBooks Store and iTunes Movies were shut down in the country, just six months after they were introduced there. Mark Natkin, the   managing director of Marbridge Consulting, who advises American technology firms in China, said he did not think any such company entering the Chinese market could “ever fully comprehend how challenging it’s going to be. ” Mr. Natkin said that Apple had a certain amount of leverage against the Chinese government in terms of the total amount of jobs created but that “the technology gap has started to close. ”",0
9771,"Pythagoras, The Golden Ratio & The Tuning Of The Human Frequency","posted by Eddie Pythagoras was a Greek philosopher, mathematician and founder of Pythagoreanism. He was also a high ranking member in many mystery schools and secret societies, including the Egyptian Priesthood and The Order Of The Magi. Pythagoreanism is a religious movement in which he attempted to merge education, science and religion in perfect unity. The Pythagorean School consisted of nine temples for the different subjects which included- geometry, music, astronomy, philosophy, medicine, politics and especially mathematics. His esoteric teachings were guarded closely and more secretive, candidates were given a probationary period to pass through. This was used to test their mental capabilities and their ability to maintain secrecy. Those who passed through this process were initiated into a select brotherhood in which they pursued religious and ascetic practices he had developed. This group were called Esoterici – The Esoteric. Pythagoras, Phidias and Fibonacci are all names that come up in association to the golden ratio, Phi or the Fibonacci sequence. But Pythagoras was the first to use it on a musical scale. According to legend, Pythagoras discovered musical tones when he walked passed a blacksmiths and was captured by the sounds emanating inside. He thought the harmonies could be translated into a mathematical equations. He later went into the blacksmiths and learnt how the sounds were made by observing their tools. He realised that the hammers had simple ratios to each other, one hammer was half the size of the first, another was 2/3 the size, and so on. This story cannot be validated, however it is fascinating to think that one of the most (if not the most) significant audio scales were discovered in this way. The fibonacci sequence is the number sequence 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13 and so on to infinity. This mathematical formula is found by adding up the two numbers before it in the sequence 0+1=1 1+1=2 1+2=3 2+3=5 and so on. The space between these numbers gives us the golden ratio of 1.618. This sequence unifies the properties of space, time, light, gravity and our genetic makeup within our DNA code. Our faces have this ratio and so do our bodies, you can find this ratio in our upper arm to lower arm and upper leg to lower leg. Even our brains are constructed with this ratio, with our pineal gland (which is thought to be the seat of the souls in many teachings) spiraling with this magical formula. Our pineal gland also produces melatonin and DMT which is thought to cause dreams and spiritual states. This ratio exists within flower petals, trees, seeds, natural foods, shells, the galaxies in the universe, it is truly the mathematical language of the universe. Given the significance of this, you may be able to see why listening to music tuned at this frequency could be a good thing. You can view more information about Pythagorean tuning and in specific the frequency of 432Hz in the video below.

[10/31/16] While Hillary Clinton’s team is working to dig the Democratic presidential candidate out from under a barrage of leaked emails exposing corruption and collusion, staffers at the Democratic headquarters in Warren, County Ohio were stuck in a similar situation over the weekend. 
The Warren County Democratic Party headquarters on Route 42 was the target of an unexpected dump of its own late Friday night, but instead of embarrassing emails the office received several tons of manure, dumped at the front door, WCPO reports. 
A volunteer found the pile of poo the next morning. 
Bethe Goldenfield, county party chairman, downplayed the dump as a “minor blip on the radar,” and contends it’s only inspired local volunteers to get people to the polls. 
“People are very motivated,” she said. 
Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper sent out a picture of the pile to his Twitter followers around 9 a.m. Saturday. 
“When they dump manure, we go high! One of our best performing offices, generating strong D early vote,” he wrote. “Lesson: keep organizing while they bs.” 
WPCO reports the incident was a repeat from the 2012 election, when the local campaign office received the exact same donation. The party has since installed video cameras, however, and are hoping the investment pays off. 
“We have cameras, so the perps will hopefully be responsible for their actions,” the party posted to its Facebook page, WHIO reports. Post navigation",0

9774,Israeli Parliament Moves To Ban BDS Supporters From Entering Israel,"| November 9, 2016 Be Sociable, Share! 
BETHLEHEM (Ma’an) — A bill preventing supporters of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement from entering Israel was authorized on Monday for its first reading in the Israeli parliament, according to Israeli media. 
According to the Jerusalem Post , the interior committee of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, approved the bill, which was initiated by Knesset Member Yinon Magal from the ultranationalist Home Party, paving the way for the bill to enter its first reading in the Israeli Knesset. 
The bill would allow individuals supporting a boycott against Israel to be banned from entering the country. 
The BDS movement was founded in July 2005 by a swath of Palestinian civil society as a peaceful movement to restore Palestinian rights in accordance with international law through strategies of boycotting Israeli products and cultural institutions, divesting from companies complicit in violations against Palestinians, and implementing state sanctions against the Israeli government.The move came after several months of Israeli efforts to crack down on the BDS Movement. Israeli Minister of the Interior Aryeh Deri and Minister of Public Security Gilad Erdan announced in August that they were forming a joint task force to “expel and ban the entry of BDS activists” into Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory. 
“We must not allow BDS activists to enter the state of Israel. This is a necessary step, given the malicious intentions of these activists to delegitimize and spread lies and distortions about the reality in our region,” Erdan was quoted as saying in a statement released at the time, adding that the boycott movement against Israel “must have a price.” 
“Fighting against Israeli boycotts starts by fighting those who undermine the state of Israel,” Deri also said at the time. 
“We have a responsibility to do everything possible to crush any boycott and to state clearly that we will not allow the State of Israel to be harmed. Forming the task force is an important step in that direction.” 
Without citing any names, the statement estimated that “hundreds” of pro-Palestinian activists and dozens of organizations were currently in Israel “to gather information and use it to boycott Israel, and harm its citizens,” and that the task force would also try to prevent the entrance of activists in the future. 
The statement also alleged that BDS activists traveled to the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem to “incite” Palestinians. 
The announcement led to outcry from groups like the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), which believed they were the targets of the newly-formed task force.“Isolation of Palestinians by denying access and/or deporting human rights activists aims to make Palestinian communities already vulnerable and suffering from abuse…even more vulnerable,” ISM said in a statement in response to the plans of forming the task force .“We condemn Israeli suppression of Palestinian nonviolent resistance. This recent attempt to further isolate Palestinians indicates the occupation authorities’ unwillingness to do the only thing that will actually bring an end to Israel’s isolation — to adhere to international law, end the occupation and grant Palestinians their rights.”ISM argued that its foreign activists play a crucial role in trying to prevent Israeli army violence against Palestinians.“As a civilian population living under military occupation Palestinians in the occupied territories are promised protection under International law,” the group said in its statement. “(Foreign) civilians have been attempting to fill in the gap created by the failure of governments and official international bodies to provide protection and fulfill their obligations.“We find that our presence sometimes results in reducing the level of lethal force used by the Israeli military against unarmed Palestinians.”The boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel has gained momentum over the past year, with activists targeting companies that act in compliance with Israel’s illegal occupation of East Jerusalem and the West Bank. 
In late July, the Black Lives Matter movement — which denounces police violence against African-Americans in the United States — came out in support of BDS , stating that it was committed to “global struggle, solidarity, and support of the Boycott, Divest and Sanction (BDS) movement to fight for freedom, justice and equality for Palestinian people and to end international support of the occupation.”The Israeli government, meanwhile, has grown increasingly concerned about the growth of the BDS movement, as the movement’s support base has expanded to include companies, universities and religious institutions around the world divesting from organizations complicit in Israel’s violation of Palestinian rights. 
In January, the Israeli Knesset held a conference to discuss ways to combat BDS , and dedicated 100 million shekels ($26 million) of the government’s 2016 budget to the issue.In May, Israel issued a travel ban on BDS cofounder Omar Barghouti , a permanent resident in Israel, as Mahmoud Nawajaa, the general coordinator of the Palestinian BDS National Committee, stated at the time that the decision reflected “the lengths [Israel] will go to in order to stop the spread of the non-violent BDS movement for Palestinian freedom, justice and equality.” 
More recently, Israel’s Parliament, the Knesset, passed a controversial NGO “transparency bill” into law on July 12 , compelling organizations to reveal their sources of funding if more than half came from public foreign entities — a law which human rights groups and opposition Knesset members condemned for seeking to “silence criticism” of Israel and delegitimize left-wing groups .Opposition leader in the Knesset Isaac Herzog of the Zionist Camp party then slammed the law for “symbolizing the budding fascism that is rising and flourishing in Israeli society” and making a “mockery” of the “right to organize, which is a sacred founding principle of a democratic society.”",0
9775,Senior MP Reveals Saudi Arabia's Role in Several Failed Assassination Attempts in Iran,"Deputy Chairman of the Iranian parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Commission Abolfazl Hassan Beiki accused Saudi Arabia of orchestrating several assassination attempts in the Southern provinces of Iran and plotting to blow up three tons of explosives in Tehran. 8 Shares

""We have witnessed the Saudis' footprints in several failed assassination attempts in the two (Southwestern and Southeastern) provinces of Khouzestan and Sistan and Balouchestan,"" Hassan Beiki, also a former advisor to Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, said on Saturday.
He also said that a terrorist team which was disbanded in Garmsar recently and intended to blow up three tons of explosives in Tehran was affiliated to Riyadh, adding that the arrested terrorists in Garmsar and Tehran had received financial support from Saudi Arabia and had been trained in Iraq's Mosul and Syria's Raqqa.
""We should clearly announce that today, the Saudis are adopting measures against our national security through other countries' embassies, and unfortunately, we see today that certain Arab, African and European embassies are accompanying and uttering similar words like the Saudis (against Iran),"" Hassan Beiki said.
Earlier this week, Head of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps Public Relations Department General Ramezan Sharif announced that the IRGC forces have dismantled two terrorist groups who sought to carry out sabotage acts inside Iran, adding that they were mercenaries of Saudi Arabia.
""By hollow promises, Saudi Arabia attempted to make the terrorist groups, including Komala and the former Democrat group (Democratic Party of Iran's Kurdistan (Hadka) affiliated to Komala party), to confront the Islamic Republic,"" General Sharif said on Tuesday.

His remarks came two month after the IRGC dismantled a team of 9 terrorists ""sent by Saudi Arabia to foment insecurity inside the country"".
The IRGC killed four of the terrorists, including their commander, and injured two others in the city of Saravan in Sistan and Balouchestan province in Southeastern Iran.
Official statements said the terrorist team which intended to carryout ""sabotage acts inside Iran was disbanded by the IRGC in the Kouhak border region of Saravan city"".
The IRGC also destroyed the weapons, ammunition, wireless equipment, night-vision goggles and three Toyota vehicles of the terrorists calling themselves Jeish al-Adl group.
Also in September, the Iranian intelligence and security forces dismantled a team of 12 terrorists sent by Saudi Arabia and certain trans-regional states to foment insecurity inside the country.
The terrorist team which was equipped with light and semi-heavy weapons and intended to carryout sabotage acts inside Iran was disbanded in the Western bordering areas of Sardasht city through cooperation with the IRGC forces.
Ten terrorists of the outlawed Democrat Party were also killed last month in armed clashes with the Iranian border guards in the Western province of Kurdistan.
The terrorists who were trying to sneak into the country through the Western Iranian borders in the village of Baneh and Khalfi in Sardasht region, sought to foment insecurity in Iran's Kurdistan province.
Based on the latest information, 10 terrorists of the outlawed group were killed during the clashes.",0
9776,Make America Vote Again,"0 Add Comment 
A GRASSROOTS movement which has distilled people’s myriad frustrations and anger into one simple, catch all phrase continues to gather pace on the ground in America this morning. 
Providing a slogan to a loose affiliation of people’s desires, which often directly contradict or compromise the various factions involved, the populist movement is expanding at a worrying rate. 
‘Make American Vote Again’, the name given to vast swathes of people who feel America really needs to vote again a second time to get it right, has seen large crowds gather at numerous rallies across the United States. 
“Wrong” was the repeated phrase voiced by speakers at the rallies, as they cited the fact that America was headed in the wrong direction as evidence it needed a revolution in order to place it back on the right path. 
Many media personnel in attendance sought to press rally goers on the finer points of their plan to make America vote again, but could only shout ‘make America vote again’ repeatedly. Followers of the movement also displayed an almost violent patriotic loyalty to the 1st Amendment of the Constitution, which they claim Donald Trump would dismantle once in power. 
“It’s heartwarming to see such large crowds. But, where were you assholes yesterday,” shared one of the movement’s leaders Hillary Clinton. 
Clinton, criticised for her populism which has seen her join the calls for another vote, is looking to tap into the sort of post-Brexit come down, which saw half of Britain ‘shit their pants’ and wish they could vote all over again. 
The movement has drawn the attention of mainstream media which remains suspicious of Make America Vote Again, due to the face it is occurring online through social media channel outside the confines of the news media. 
“It goes against our values, principles and ideals, it’s not something anyone likes to see,” confirmed Republican strategist Noren Hassleback. 
“Having said that, despite the move being unconstitutional, many of the utterances bordering on being treasonous and discriminatory… they might be onto something”.",0

9778,Brazil’s Leaders Tout Austerity (Just Not for Them) - The New York Times,"SÃO PAULO, Brazil  —   Brazil’s sickly economy is hemorrhaging thousands of jobs a day, states are scrambling to pay police officers and teachers, and money for subsidized meals is in such short supply that one legislator suggested that the poor could “eat every other day. ” Still, not everyone is suffering. Civil servants in the judicial branch are enjoying a 41 percent raise. Legislators here in São Paulo, Brazil’s largest city, voted to increase their own salaries by more than 26 percent. And Congress, which is preparing to cut pension benefits around the country, is now allowing its members to retire with lifelong pensions after just two years in office. Brazil is struggling to pull out of its worst economic crisis in decades, and President Michel Temer says the country needs to curb public spending to do so. Yet it did not help his dismal approval ratings when he hosted a lavish   banquet to persuade members of Congress to support his budget cuts, with 300 guests eating shrimp and filet mignon. Outside such rarefied circles, Mr. Temer’s austerity measures are igniting a fierce debate over how the richest and most powerful Brazilians are protecting their wealth and privileges at a time when much of the country is enduring a harrowing economic decline. “This government talks about austerity for everyone, but of course forces the costs on society’s most vulnerable people,” said Giovana Santos Pereira, 25, a schoolteacher. “It’s ridiculous to the point of being tragic. ” Much of the ire revolves around the centerpiece of Mr. Temer’s austerity drive: his success in persuading the   Congress to impose a cap on federal spending for the next 20 years. Mr. Temer, who rose to power last year after supporting the impeachment of his predecessor, Dilma Rousseff, says the cap, which would limit the growth in spending to the rate of inflation, is needed to scale back ballooning budget deficits. Investors have applauded the measure as a turning point for Latin America’s largest economy. But critics are lashing out at the spending cap, saying it could harm the poor for decades to come, especially in areas like education. Philip Alston, the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, said the spending cap placed Brazil “in a socially retrogressive category all of its own. ” The debate is all the more caustic because Mr. Temer’s government is resisting calls to raise taxes on wealthy Brazilians, who still enjoy what some economists describe as one of the most generous tax systems for the rich among major economies. For instance, Brazilians remain exempt from paying any taxes at all on dividends from stock holdings, and they can easily use loopholes to significantly lower taxes on other sources of income. Economists at the government’s Institute of Applied Economic Research said in a 2016 study that a 15 percent tax on dividends could generate nearly $17 billion in revenue a year, but such proposals have failed to gain traction in a government that has shifted to the right. “The system is engineered to perpetuate inequality, and Temer is doubling down on bets that Brazil needs   austerity,” said Pedro Paulo Zahluth Bastos, an economist at the University of Campinas, drawing parallels between Brazil’s multiyear slowdown and Greece’s seemingly interminable economic crisis. Mr. Temer has not been a popular president, and his approval ratings stand at just 10 percent. But his supporters point out that his leftist predecessor, Ms. Rousseff, sought her own austerity measures before her ouster last year, and that his government has promised to maintain some widely popular antipoverty programs expanded by her party years ago. Mr. Temer’s government says it is reversing the   ways of previous governments. Brazil’s economy shrank about 4 percent in 2016, when its political class was consumed by infighting over the impeachment. But last month, the finance minister, Henrique Meirelles, claimed that “the recession has ended. ” Some promising signs of a recovery may be emerging. Foreign investment has increased and, after performing poorly, Brazil’s stock market was one of the best performing in the world in 2016, creating a windfall for the relatively prosperous Brazilians who put money into equities. Mr. Temer is especially bullish, predicting that the economy will grow 3 percent next year. But the conditions on the streets of cities around Brazil tell a different story, reflecting devilishly complex structural challenges as millions of Brazilians fall into poverty. States are facing crippling strikes by public employees over unpaid or inadequate salaries. In the state of Espírito Santo, in southeast Brazil, a police strike last month produced an anarchic week marked by looting and a surge in homicides. Rio de Janeiro, which hosted the Olympics in August, showcases the complex issues Brazil’s states face. In desperate efforts to slash deficits, the authorities in Rio are shutting down restaurants that provide subsidized meals to the poor, raising taxes on residential electricity service and eliminating welfare programs for the state’s poorest residents. Yet Rio’s governor, like his counterparts in other Brazilian states, enjoys the use of a private jet for jaunts around the country. And Rio’s judges, already well paid, were pressing ahead with plans to spend millions of dollars hiring new servants for their chambers  —   until the public got wind of the plan. The ensuing outrage forced the judges to shelve the idea. At the same time, the state is having trouble finding money to pay for food for the poor. The cost  —   about 65 cents a meal  —   was straining the state enough that one state legislator, Pedro Fernandes, suggested taking meals “every other day. ” “I don’t know if what I’m saying is absurd, but it’s something to ponder,” he said. The ability of elected officials and elite public employees to secure what Brazilians call “super salaries” and outsize benefits for themselves has long been a contentious feature of the country’s political system. But while Brazilians fume over the issue at a time of national   some officials say they are entitled to special treatment. Brazilian judges, who can easily make about $200, 000 a year, have been especially outspoken in demanding raises in a country where roughly half the population scrapes by on a minimum wage of about $4, 000. “There’s no shame whatsoever in this,” Ricardo Lewandowski, a Supreme Court justice, recently told a conference of judges to a round of applause. “Building maintenance fees go up, real estate taxes go up, gasoline goes up, food goes up, and the judge’s salary can’t go up?” As many poor and   Brazilians absorb the brunt of austerity policies, the protracted economic slowdown and a dizzying array of graft scandals involving the nation’s political leaders are fueling   sentiment ahead of presidential elections in 2018, paving the way for figures outside the mainstream to gain momentum. Alarming some politicians, Jair Bolsonaro, an ultranationalist congressman who excoriates immigrants and defends the torture of drug traffickers, is polling well ahead of traditional contenders like Aécio Neves, a senator from the Brazilian Social Democracy Party. According to a  survey last month by MDA, a Brazilian polling company, just 1 percent of respondents said they would vote for Mr. Temer, reflecting his dismal nationwide standing. It may not even matter, since Mr. Temer’s conviction for violating campaign finance limits could make him ineligible to run. His popularity sustained another blow in recent days after his government spent thousands of dollars to upgrade the president’s luxurious residence, only for Mr. Temer to move his family back to another   palace in the capital, Brasília. The poll was conducted from Feb. 8 to 11 through interviews with 2, 002 people, with a margin of sampling error or plus or minus 2. 2 percentage points. It also showed a former president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, as a potential  . But Mr. da Silva, a leftist who has been condemning Mr. Temer’s austerity measures, could also find himself ineligible to run if he is convicted of graft charges in connection with his ties to construction companies that profited from public contracts. Given the volatile political landscape and the weak economy, a sense of hopelessness afflicts many Brazilians. Ana Cristina Silva, 49, lost her job in December at a company in the southern city of Porto Alegre that assembles furniture. “They just think about themselves,” she said about Mr. Temer’s government, expressing indignation about the pay increases granted to some public employees while much of the country is still reeling. “It’s absurd. Those who don’t need it get a raise. ”",0
9779,11 Ideas for Midweek Cooking - The New York Times,"Kim Severson is filling in for Sam Sifton, who emails readers of Cooking five days a week to talk about food and suggest recipes. That email also appears here. To receive it in your inbox, register here. Hello, besties. I think this newsletter thing is going really well so far, don’t you? Since there is no one left in New York in August, except the people who stay because they can get a parking space, none of my bosses seem to care that I am just doing whatever I want in this space. Of course, you care. And I love you for it. This is the day we like to cook without a recipe. A day sans receta, as El Bloombito would say if he were a cook. A recent meal built from fresh field peas, marinated cucumbers and tomatoes, plus an impromptu snack of radishes that spent a couple of hours in red wine vinegar, cayenne and salt, got me thinking about why vinegar is really an unsung savior as summer produce plays out. You can combine it with olive oil and garlic to marinate a pork tenderloin or chicken breasts, which gets you into Sam Sifton’s spiedie territory. It can dress any number of leftover steamed vegetables (or try   a technique J. Kenji   discussed on “The Splendid Table”). Or you could do what Nina Bernstein, a New York Times investigative reporter, does when she is not unearthing the sad things that happen to cadavers in New York. She learned the technique from her mother, and she uses it almost daily for her salad. Mash garlic and kosher salt together in a wooden bowl, add a dollop of Dijon mustard and a splash or two of vinegar (she uses balsamic). Stirring steadily and rapidly, slowly pour in a thin stream of   olive oil. Adjust the salt and acid. Pile some dry, sturdy lettuce into the bowl. You can keep it in the refrigerator until you are ready to serve. Then toss it all together. “Tossing well is crucial,” she said. “When you think it’s well tossed, toss some more. ” That salad would be great with a bowl of steamed mussels from David Tanis, or steamed clams à la Sifton, or a   piece of   fish from the steady hand of Martha Rose Shulman. Sometimes you just need a bowl of pasta. Mark Bittman has a good puttanesca, which you can probably make from the pantry. Or you could go deep in the vault and make Pierre Franey’s skirt steak with lentils. Throw in some roasted carrots with parsley and thyme, which went nuts on our Facebook page over the weekend, and you’re golden. Now, for something sweet. I was on a work road trip that took me deep into Alabama’s peach country last week, and I had some great homemade peach ice cream at Durbin Farms Market in Chilton County. It was the kind where the chunks of peach are frozen inside some deeply creamy vanilla ice cream. Don’t be jelly! (As   women should never say.) Here’s a   peach ice cream recipe from my Southern sister Julia Reed. And if you want to approximate the experience with   ice cream, here’s a recipe for butterscotch peaches.

9781,The Breakaway Civilisation,"by Mohsin Siddiqui for the Oceania Saker Blog 
The US elections much like the rest of our usual daily consumption of Mass Media are more about stage managed theatre with bucket loads of Americanism, a seasoning of hyperbole and most certainly reality-free. The constant barrage of infotainment from the indispensable nation, the exceptional nation and the benign super power tells us of a distinct desire to consume information reality-free. 
This informational GMO has permeated every facet of our existence and has infected the minds of billions around the world. It can be ridiculed, seen as inferior or even unsustainable. But do understand that it is the food for the liberal soul and it is a formidable force to be reckoned with. 
Human beings drive the vast bulk of their understanding of the world through information either delivered directly via consumable media or indirectly via peer impressions, religion, anecdotes, fables and cultural norms. All of it ultimately centres on the flow of information which is a commodity that has been designed, refined, repackaged and is continually ‘improved’. Most of us underestimate the true awesome power of mass media, we read the statistics, the concentration of power and observe the echo chamber yet we still need to let it all sink in to truly grasp what it means. 
Mass media is the encapsulation of the spectrum of information; From magazine to sports to history to business to politics, it is driven by a seamless thread of a philosophy guiding the ego & soul towards an atomised individualistic view of the world. It is an echo chamber that has not seen its parallel before on this planet, an organ to shape reality for the billions. A human being is a hodge-podge of history, culture, religion, philosophy, geography, epigenetics and a host of many more layers of information. Mass Media is the flute that organises this cacophony into a melody, and just like that a marionette of the modern man is born. 
Resistance to the pied piper is possible but requires one to leave that womb of comfort that the information matrix provides with its legions of followers; That feeling of belonging, of being understood, of being ‘right’ and of being good. The strength can only come from reality but in our upside down world many are malnourished on the diet of GM information and it is not a problem for only Americans – who are severely affected – but instead it is a global phenomenon. 
Successful entrepreneurs, businessmen, academics, financial experts, journalists, neighbours, friends, brothers, sisters and parents can all be entangled in the web of the information matrix. Many of us have been at pains to explain the conflicts in Syria, Libya, Iraq, Ukraine and Yemen to our colleagues and friends but it is as if the words fall on deaf ears. The cognitive dissonance is heavy and the Teflon like value-matrix – a product of pre-packaged popularly accepted globalised values- lets all facts, figures and evidence that we present slip off. It is about the first woman president elect and not her war crimes, it is about the opposing camp saying that a racist, misogynist bigot is worse than a psychopathic mass murderer. It is inverted reality. It is full on dystopia. 
Where do you begin to explain that elections are for the most part mere stage managed theatre? That the USA is an Empire of 1,000 military bases and not a country? That Obama the peace maker has incinerated civilians in 7 countries with impunity? That Hillary’s black lives did not matter for whole black Libyan towns that were extinguished? That President Asad’s Syria is LGBTQ friendly and the “Syrian revolution” that never was is the opposite? Or that it simply is not about personality politics, gay rights and black lives but is about a class struggle? 
Moreover, how do you abstract further and talk about Imperialism with a populace that thinks that protesting with Soros funds -to the benefit of the imperial war machine- is inline with being a Communist/Marxist movement? How do you explain Imperialism when King Leopold II has his bust on display with a higher tally than that of Hitler? 
A chasm in time it is and it is widening. 
I have been speaking to friends of the past 20 years trying to give my view of what I feel is missing in the discourse; Class struggle, how mass media works, what colour revolutions are, what imperialism is and how we ought to abandon personality politics. Our biggest obstacle is personality politics, and we are seen through that lens as arrogant bastards trying to educate Ivy League graduates, hedge fund managers, educated graduates and Silicon Valley success stories. How can we, the deplorable, know anything anyway? 
After a recent exchange, a Rhodes Scholar quipped: “To put it succinctly, you are saying Trump is good for Russia. I think we kind of get that”. I did not know what to say, the Teflon value matrix had won again. Plato’s democratic man guards the citadel of his soul with vengeance. 
Another highly educated and decorated researcher at a prestigious Ivy League university said “… under Obama our economy bounced back, unemployment went down, we didn’t start any major new wars” and ended his raving review by stating “Obama did a great job.” The painful part is coming to terms with a colonized mind; These educated men and women are the crème de la crème of their imperialism ravaged countries, the ones who proverbially “made it”. 
Their world makes sense to them, the Mass Media might have shamed itself in our eyes and the veil might have been lifted for us. But for them their convictions have only strengthened and they have been wronged by the basket of deplorables.

9782,Clarion: Syrian Christian Militia Condemns Turkey for Bombing Kurds - Breitbart,"This story originally appeared at the Clarion Project:  By Ryan Mauro, The Syriac Military Council, a Christian militia in Syria opposed to the Assad regime, condemned Turkey for bombing its U. S.  Kurdish allies who are fighting ISIS. The Christians accused Turkey of continuing the genocidal and   campaigns of the Ottoman Empire. The statement reads in part: “This attack came at the 102nd commemoration of the Syriac Assyrian, Armenian and Greek genocide ‘Sayfo,’ while Turkey is continuing the same policies against the people living in the Middle East, trying to overthrow the democratic project that our people are working together to reach a political and administrational system based on pluralism, justice, equality and democracy. ” Turkey’s airstrikes killed 40 Kurdish fighters in Iraq and 30 in Syria. The Kurds in Syria belonged to the People Defense Units (YPG). The Syriac Military Council (MFS) and its female wing, the Beth Nahrin Women Protection Forces, are allied with the YPG Kurds in a U. S.  alliance named the Syrian Democratic Forces. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is a   coalition and it is leading the fight against ISIS as it prepares to attack Raqqa. Despite historical ethnic tensions, the   SDF was able to recruit so many Sunni Arabs that a top U. S. commander estimates that 60% of the fighters are Arab and 40% are Kurds.

9784,Scrutiny of Hillary Clinton’s Health Puts New Focus on Tim Kaine - The New York Times,"DAYTON, Ohio  —   When Hillary Clinton was searching for a running mate, she made clear her top criterion: Her selection needed to be ready to become president “if something were to happen,” as she put it. When she announced Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia as her choice, Mrs. Clinton affirmed that he had passed that test. Now, after Mrs. Clinton had to be helped into a van while departing a Sept. 11 anniversary ceremony on Sunday and the later disclosure that she had been given a pneumonia diagnosis on Friday, Mr. Kaine is coming under a more intense spotlight. When he took questions from reporters on Monday, cable news channels carried the exchange live, a rare level of attention for his candidacy. While everyone  —   politicians included  —   gets sick from time to time, the intense focus on Mrs. Clinton’s health brings with it a constitutional reminder: Mr. Kaine is not only a   booster, but also a possible president himself. The scrutiny of Mrs. Clinton’s health “means that Tim Kaine has to step up his game,” said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. “He’s such an unknown quantity to the American people that he now has to kind of assume the mantle of what it would be like to have him as commander in chief, not just vice president,” Mr. Brinkley said. Nine vice presidents have assumed the presidency during a president’s term, eight because of a death and one because of a resignation. In four of those eight instances, the president was assassinated. In four other cases, the president died of natural causes, most recently in 1945, when Franklin D. Roosevelt died of a cerebral hemorrhage and Harry S. Truman became president. A lawyer by training, Mr. Kaine, who served as mayor of Richmond, Va. and as Virginia’s lieutenant governor and governor before winning election to the Senate in 2012, was seen as an appealing pick for Mrs. Clinton in large part because of his résumé and his policy chops. But he is not a   figure nationally, even after more than seven weeks as Mrs. Clinton’s running mate. In a   poll conducted this month, 19 percent of voters said they had never heard of Mr. Kaine, and an additional 21 percent said they had no opinion of him. “So far this has been a presidential race that has been heavily focused on the presidential candidates, to an unusual extent,” said Joel K. Goldstein, a law professor at St. Louis University who is an expert on the vice presidency. Recalling his own bout with pneumonia, Mr. Goldstein cautioned that “the fact that somebody has pneumonia doesn’t mean there’s about to be a succession. ” But he said the episode on Sunday would bring more attention to Mr. Kaine’s suitability to the presidency. “It should remind people of the importance of the two   candidates, and whether they are appropriate presidential successors based on their experience, skill, character and substantive views,” he said. As he hopscotches from state to state, Mr. Kaine comes across more as a genial traveling salesman for the   ticket than as a president in waiting. In his speeches, he tends to focus on making a case against Donald J. Trump while talking up Mrs. Clinton. At times, he still expresses shock that he is even on the Democratic ticket, as if he had been plucked from anonymity to embark upon a great adventure. “I felt like I was Pinocchio turning into a real boy,” he told a crowd in Virginia on Friday, recalling when Mrs. Clinton asked him to be her running mate. “I mean, like, ‘Wow, what? You want me? Are you kidding? ’” The biggest test of Mr. Kaine’s readiness will come on Oct. 4, when he faces Mr. Trump’s running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, in the   debate. “You don’t want a Sarah Palin situation where voters really have doubts about the second person on the ticket,” said Julian E. Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton. “It’s especially true if there are any kinds of concerns about age or health. ” Mr. Kaine, 58, differs from the man he is hoping to succeed, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in that he is a relatively new member of the Senate, not an elder statesman. But Mr. Kaine has made a point of focusing on foreign policy during his time in the Senate, where he serves on the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees. Speaking to reporters after an event here on Monday, Mr. Kaine said he did not think the new episode involving Mrs. Clinton’s health put any more pressure on him to convince voters he is ready to be president. Even before the latest incident, Mr. Kaine had tried to defend Mrs. Clinton against questions about her health, while also calling on Mr. Trump, who had accused Mrs. Clinton of lacking stamina, to be more forthcoming about his own health. Two weeks ago, Mr. Kaine mocked the letter from a doctor for Mr. Trump that asserted the candidate would be “the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency,” while he also declared Mrs. Clinton to be “one tough and one healthy person. ” And as he campaigned here on Monday, he offered fresh testimony about Mrs. Clinton’s physical  . “I’ve just been on the campaign since July 22,” Mr. Kaine told the crowd. “Hillary Clinton has been on the campaign trail for 18 months. Her energy staggers me. I have a hard time keeping up with her. ”",0

Chaffetz said, “The reality is, sadly, I don’t see much difference between the Trump administration and the Obama administration. I thought there would be this, these floodgates would open up with all the documents we wanted from the Department of State, the Department of Justice, the Pentagon. In many ways, it’s almost worse, because we’re getting nothing, and that’s terribly frustrating and with all due respect, the Attorney General has not changed at all.

9786,Obama Describes Facebook Torture Video as ’Despicable’ Hate Crime - Breitbart,"President Barack Obama reflected on the attack on a white disabled man aired on Facebook by four   teenagers, describing the incident as a “terrible” and “despicable” hate crime. [Obama made his remarks in the context of a discussion of race relations and whether or not they had gotten better or worse during his presidency.  “I don’t think it’s accurate to say that race relations have gotten worse,” he said, blaming social media, smart phones, and the internet for “surfacing” more incidents of racial violence. “What we have seen as surfacing, I think, are a lot of problems that have been there a long time,” he said in an interview with local Chicago station CBS 2. “Whether it’s tensions between police and communities, hate crimes of the despicable sort that has just now recently surfaced on Facebook. ” The suspects, Jordan Hill, 18 Tesfaye Cooper, 18 Brittany Covington, 18 and Tanishia Covington, 24 were charged with criminal hate crimes and aggravated kidnapping as well as other felony charges, according to NBC News.  Obama also discussed the horrifying incident in an interview with Chicago’s ABC7. “It’s terrible,” he said. “And so part of technology allows us to see now is the terrible toll that racism and discrimination and hate takes on families and communities. But that’s part of how we learn and how we get better. ” Obama argued that it was alarming to see the new images on social media, but that it would help society root out the scourge of racism. “We don’t benefit from pretending that racism doesn’t exist and hate doesn’t exist, we don’t benefit from not talking about it,” he said. “The fact that these things are being surfaced means we can solve them. ” Obama remained convinced that race relations were getting better, citing the Council Wars in Chicago when he first arrived in 1985. “I promise you, for the most part, race relations have gotten better,” he said.",0
9787,More fake 'pro-Trump' attacks: Ohio student charged for falsifying report of attack by Trump fans - Russia News Now,"This post was originally published on this site 
sott.net/news 
A black, female Bowling Green State University student allegedly fabricated a hate crime story about white, male President-Elect Donald Trump supporters attacking her on campus and is now being charged for faking a police report. 
The day after Trump’s presidential victory, Eleesha Long told Bowling Green police that she had been attacked by three men wearing Trump gear who “began to throw rocks” at her , according to ABC13. 
Long took to her Facebook page to share the story, describing in detail what each Trump supporter was wearing and giving a description of as to where the alleged hate crime had occurred, but never actually called the police. 
Long’s Facebook post went viral and her father notified law enforcement after he said he was not able to get in touch with her . Local detectives took Long into police headquarters and asked her to share details of the described hate crime. 
Long reportedly began telling police multiple stories about the incident, to include changing the location of the alleged incident. 
“Several times the complainant changed her story about what happened, where it happened, and when it happened,” Lt. Dan Mancuso told ABC13. 
Afterward, the police got a warrant for Long’s Facebook and Verizon cell phone history, proving that she was not where she claimed she was at the time of the alleged attack . 
“Based on that information, it proved that she was not in the location that of when she said it occurred,” Lt. Mancuso said. 
Police investigators said Long’s cell phone history included discriminatory remarks towards Trump supporters that she had sent to her boyfriend and mother. 
In one text message, Long said about Trump supporters “should take an IQ test to vote,” while a couple other messages said “I hope they all get AIDS” and “I haven’t met a decent Trump supporter yet.” 
Long is now being charged for falsifying a police report and obstructing official business, which she will have to appear in court for. Related ",0
9788,Trump’s Wiretapping Claims Puncture Veneer of Presidential Civility - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   When last they saw each other six weeks ago after the ceremonial passing of power, President Trump and former President Barack Obama parted with smiles and handshakes. But it did not take long for the surface bonhomie to degenerate into a fierce and public clash unlike any other in modern times. While Mr. Obama has remained quiet for the most part, some of his closest loyalists moved into opposition mode, leading what some only   call “the resistance. ” Mr. Trump, convinced that Obama holdovers still in government are trying to sabotage his presidency, took the conflict nuclear over the weekend by accusing his predecessor of bugging his telephones last year. Mr. Trump provided no proof, and the charge was quickly dismissed by intelligence veterans and, indirectly, the F. B. I. but that did not make it any less sensational or any less historic. Never in recent generations has the natural friction between current and past presidents spilled over into such a public spectacle. If sustained, it could fray the institution of the presidency, further erode the public’s already low confidence in the nation’s leadership and leave both allies and enemies with the impression of an America at war with itself. Perhaps it should be no surprise that it came to this between the 44th and 45th presidents. During last year’s campaign, Mr. Obama called Mr. Trump a “con artist and a  ” who could not be trusted with the nuclear codes. Mr. Trump called Mr. Obama “the worst president in the history of the United States” after spending years questioning whether he had been born in the United States. They put that rancor aside for a cordial meeting after the election, but that barely veiled the chasm between them in terms of personality, politics and policy. “We’re in a unique period,” said Newt Gingrich, the Republican former House speaker who has been an outside adviser to the new president. “Trump is a genuinely disruptive figure who threatens everything Obama stands for. ” Mr. Obama’s camp insisted they are simply defending their legacy. “It takes two people to duel, and only one seems to be aiming his weapon,” said Jennifer Psaki, White House communications director under Mr. Obama. “The uniqueness of the time is the fact that you have one unhinged and misinformed sitting president pointing his gun at a former. That is unprecedented. ” Denis R. McDonough, Mr. Obama’s last White House chief of staff, said the former president’s team could not remain silent in the face of false assertions. “What I have witnessed in recent days is former colleagues speaking out against untruths when needed,” he said. “That is best characterized as not backing down from attacks it is not seeking out conflict. ” But inside the Trump White House, it has become an article of faith that people seeded throughout the government by Mr. Obama have been leaking everything they could get their hands on to damage the new president. “I think that President Obama is behind it, because his people are certainly behind it,” Mr. Trump said in a recent interview with “Fox  Friends. ” “And some of the leaks possibly come from that group, you know, some of the leaks, which are really very serious leaks, because they’re very bad in terms of national security. ” Other presidents have endured fractious relations. After leaving office, Herbert Hoover regularly castigated Franklin D. Roosevelt, who ostracized his predecessor. Harry S. Truman was so estranged from Dwight D. Eisenhower that they did not speak during a frosty ride to the 1953 inauguration. Ronald Reagan publicly blamed his woes on the mess he said Jimmy Carter had left him, just as Mr. Obama from time to time pointed the finger at George W. Bush. But none of those moments compared to what America has seen in recent days. “Trump is on new ground in going after Obama,” said the historian Robert Dallek, who has written acclaimed books on John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon. Most presidents have publicly ignored their predecessors “until we get to Trump,” he added. “He is either ignorant of recent presidential history or simply doesn’t care. ” The closest analogue in modern times may have been Johnson and Nixon, both presidents who favored secret wiretapping. In his last days in office, Johnson was furious at Nixon after wiretaps revealed that a Republican intermediary seemed to be trying to undercut possible peace talks before the 1968 election. For his part, Nixon was convinced that Johnson had bugged him. Yet neither Johnson nor Nixon publicly aired those grievances at the time. “The Nixon tapes show that Nixon always thought that Johnson taped his 1968 campaign, and possibly Nixon himself,” said Luke A. Nichter, a leading scholar of Nixon’s secret Oval Office tapes at Texas AM University. “Nixon said that it was J. Edgar Hoover who told him this. However, based on the available records, the closest to wiretapping Nixon that L. B. J. ever came was monitoring the phone calls out of Spiro Agnew’s campaign plane. ” Before last year’s campaign, Mr. Obama told advisers that he was inclined to keep quiet after leaving office to give his successor a chance to govern, much as Mr. Bush did for him. But he expected that successor to be Hillary Clinton or even Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio. Mr. Trump was a different story, and Mr. Obama concluded he would speak out if he felt the nation’s ideals were under threat. Ten days into the new administration, when Mr. Trump issued his first temporary travel ban on visitors from seven largely Muslim countries and cited Mr. Obama’s own actions as precedent, the former president did just that in a statement saying he “fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion. ” His team did not wait even that long. The day after the inauguration, former Obama administration officials, including John Kerry, whose tenure as secretary of state had just ended, joined a women’s march in Washington protesting Mr. Trump. Other officials appeared on television talk shows and newspaper   pages to speak out against the new president’s policies. Mr. Trump’s team has been angered by the criticism but even more by what they see as the enemy within. With so few of his own political appointees in place, much of the government is still operating with acting officials, some held over from the Obama administration. Moreover, the federal Civil Service, while officially neutral politically, is not dominated by Trump supporters, judging by vote results in Washington and its suburbs. So when Mark Levin, the conservative radio host, contended that Mr. Obama had targeted Mr. Trump for surveillance in what he called a “silent coup,” an assertion picked up by Breitbart News, the former website of the White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, it struck a chord. Along with reports that in Mr. Obama’s last days in office his administration changed the rules on distributing intelligence and made a point of spreading information about Mr. Trump’s team and Russia to different parts of the government to “preserve” it, the wiretapping allegation pushed Mr. Trump over the top. “It’s a sign of how deeply frustrated he is,” Mr. Gingrich said. “They have a much bigger assault against them than people have had in the past. ” And so, Mr. Gingrich added, Mr. Trump needs to figure out how to get control of his own bureaucracy. “He’s not going to survive,” he said, “unless he profoundly rethinks what they’re doing and how they’re doing it. ”",0
9789,Olympic Cover-Up: Why You Won’t See Some Shoe Logos - The New York Times,"RIO DE JANEIRO  —   The track and field events at the Rio Olympics this month will showcase elite athletic talent and, if you look closely, creative subterfuge. Tape, markers, elastic sleeves and maybe even paint will disguise some shoe brand logos in an Olympic sleight of foot. In track and field, the centerpiece sport of the Summer Games, shoes are the most vital piece of equipment and serve purposes beyond performance: supplying advertising billboards for apparel companies and providing financial footing for athletes. But some athletes do not want the world to see the logos on their shoes, or they are prohibited from doing so by their sponsors if they wear competing brands. Although United States track and field athletes at the Rio Games must wear uniforms bearing the familiar swoosh of Nike, an official team sponsor, they are free to wear their own brand of shoes, disguised or not. Take, for example, Jeremy Taiwo, a decathlete from Seattle who will wear eight pairs of shoes in his 10 events, each with a function as specific as a golf club’s. His shoe sponsor is Brooks, but the company does not make shoes designed for throwing and jumping events. So Taiwo also plans to wear shoes made by Nike, Adidas and Asics. He must cover the logos of those competing brands, which he plans to do with tape, elastic sleeves and cleverly shaded fabric. “In terms of athletic performance, you have to have the right shoes to be able to meet your goals,” Taiwo, 26, said in a telephone interview before traveling to Rio de Janeiro. “And ultimately, you have to do well so you can get paid. If you make it, your shoes are largely responsible for that. ” The camouflaging demonstrates the power of the $75 billion global athletic footwear industry, which closely monitors what athletes wear  —   and, with lawyers at its beck and call, what they do not. Although it is unclear how many athletes will be disguising their footwear at the Games, the practice is not uncommon at track meets, with the reasons for the   almost as varied as the shoes available. Athletes who have no shoe sponsor may not want to give free advertising to any company, preferring to signal that they are free agents. Taiwo called this an act of “no representation without compensation. ” Other athletes disguise shoes because they are transitioning from one company to another and are continuing to wear their old shoes while new ones are being perfected. Some, like Taiwo, participate in events for which their sponsor does not make shoes. Some athletes are simply dissatisfied with the gear made by their sponsor. Sometimes, shoe companies give permission for athletes to wear another, disguised brand. Other times, they take umbrage, and the controversy becomes public. In a widely reported incident in 2013, Nike withdrew a contract offer to the American   in the pole vault, Brad Walker, after Walker taped over a strap on his shoes and covered the swoosh logo. Walker wrote on Facebook at the time that he was not trying to undermine Nike but was using tape to “hold together a shoe that shouldn’t break down within 6 months. ” Nike did not say why the contract offer was rescinded, only that Walker “did not take up this option in a timely manner. ” Walker put his gear up for sale on eBay. Mike Hazle, the 2011 American champion in the javelin, said his   shoes were too narrow, causing his toenails to fall off and his feet to become numb. So for years, he said, he borrowed gear made by Asics and   a Chinese company, from a fellow javelin thrower. He covered those logos with tape or with slices from wristbands that bore the Nike swoosh. It was never a problem in the   event, Hazle said, until he won the United States title and a photograph of him appeared in Track  Field News. His left foot was raised after a throw, revealing the   logo of   on the bottom of his shoe. Nike was not pleased and exercised an option on his contract in 2012 to keep him from signing with another company, Hazle said, but offered only $10, 000 with no chance of bonuses. It is unfortunate “if someone is paying your bills and you’re supposed to wear what they give you and it doesn’t work,” Hazle said from Afghanistan, where he is serving in the Air National Guard. “But at the end of the day, it’s going to compromise your performance, so you’ve got to take care of yourself. ” Nike said it did not comment on contracts but expected that its sponsored athletes “will always wear Nike products unless there is some specific, mutually agreed exception. ” One   exception took place last year. Christian Taylor of the United States, who won the triple jump at the 2012 Olympics and signed with Nike in 2015, was permitted to wear Adidas shoes at the world track and field championships in Beijing while Nike customized shoes for him. Taylor, the triple jump favorite at this year’s Olympics, now wears Nikes. Two medal favorites in the high jump, Mutaz Essa Barshim of Qatar and Derek Drouin of Canada, have also been permitted by Nike to wear shoes from other brands that are covered by elastic sleeves resembling spats that bear the Nike swoosh. “As with any athlete, we are working closely with them to get the shoe that best suits their specific needs,” Charlie Brooks, a Nike spokesman, said in an email. “There’s no issue with our shoes it’s just a matter of personal customization for these athletes. We anticipate they’ll be jumping in Nike shoes soon. ” Camouflaging reflects the particular nature of track and field, which finds itself in the limelight every four years during the Summer Games. Sprinters,   and steeplechasers generally do not receive annual salaries from teams the way professional football and basketball players do. Instead, they mostly rely on prize money and contracts with shoe companies, along with other endorsements. The apparel companies, Nike in particular, wield strong influence. They equip athletes and keep the struggling sport afloat. But they can also reduce payments when certain performance goals are not met. And at certain meets like the Olympics, athletes are restricted from wearing competing sponsor logos on their uniforms and as temporary tattoos. The number of track meets is dwindling, as are the available prize money and appearance fees, athletes and agents say. Rampant doping has threatened the legitimacy of the sport. Income disparity is wide. The sprinting champion Usain Bolt of Jamaica, track’s one global superstar, who is sponsored by Puma, makes $32. 5 million a year, including $30 million in endorsements, according to an estimate by Forbes. Far less visible but successful athletes say they might make as little as $10, 000 to $25, 000 annually. Carl Lewis, a   Olympic gold medalist who has had a long affiliation with Nike, said the camouflaging of shoes was “a microcosm of what the real issue is: Are we really creating a professional sport?” “Why are we so dependent on just shoe companies?” said Lewis, an assistant coach at the University of Houston. Some athletes said they considered it disrespectful and unprofessional to cover up the logo of a sponsor. “If they’re paying money, the least we can do is respect their dollar,” said Wallace Spearmon of the United States, a   sprinter and a former Nike athlete. Other athletes owe no allegiance because they have no shoe sponsor. Johnny Dutch of the United States has run the fastest time in the world this year in the   hurdles. But he said he had been without a shoe sponsor for three years, since his Nike contract ended. At the Olympic track and field trials in July in Eugene, Ore. Dutch wore shoes that were   neon orange to cover the logos of Nike and two other brands. This was done, in part, to express his artistic side, said Dutch, 27, an aspiring filmmaker. But it was also his way of saying that, for him to display any shoe company logo, “they’ve got to support me,” he said. “They’ve got to give me something where I can live and pay my medical bills. ” Money had become so tight, Dutch said, that he had moved from Miami to live with his parents in Raleigh, N. C. His chance to gain visibility and financial buoyancy as an Olympian disappeared when Dutch clipped the final hurdle in the   hurdles at the trials and faded from first place to fifth. Only the top three advanced to Rio. Disconsolate, Dutch said he intended to retire. “I feel like I can’t do this no more,” he told reporters. “I’ve been struggling financially. I don’t have a contract. I have no job. ”",0
9790,The U.S. National Bird Is Now a Drone,"Posted on October 26, 2016 by DavidSwanson 
Officially, of course, the national bird of the United States is that half-a-peace-sign that Philadelphia sports fans like to hold up at opposing teams. But unofficially, the film National Bird has it right: the national bird is a killer drone. 
Finally, finally, finally, somebody allowed me to see this movie. And finally somebody made this movie. There have been several drone movies worth seeing , most of them fictional drama , and one very much worth avoiding ( Eye in the Sky ). But National Bird is raw truth, not entirely unlike what you might fantasize media news reports would be in a magical world in which media outlets gave a damn about human life. 
The first half of National Bird is the stories of three participants in the U.S. military’s drone murder program, as told by them. And then, just as you’re starting to think you’ll have to write that old familiar review that praises how well the stories of the victims among the aggressors were told but asks in exasperation whether any of the victims of the actual missiles have any stories, National Bird expands to include just what is so often missing, and even to combine the two narratives in a powerful way. 
Heather Linebaugh wanted to protect people, benefit the world, travel, see the world, and use super cool technology. Apparently our society did not explain to her in time what it means to join the military. Now she suffers guilt, anxiety, moral injury, PTSD, sleep disorder, despair, and a sense of responsibility to speak out on behalf of friends, other veterans, who have killed themselves or become too alcoholic to speak for themselves. Linebaugh helped murder people with missiles from drones, and watched them die, and identified body parts or watched loved ones gather up body parts. 
Even while still in the Air Force, Linebaugh was on a suicide watch list and had a psychologist recommend moving her to a different sort of job, but the Air Force refused. She has episodes. She sees things. She hears things. But she’s forbidden to discuss her work with friends or even with a therapist who doesn’t have the proper “security clearance.” 
We let Daniel down even more than Heather. He says he actually opposed militarism but was homeless and desperate, so he joined the military. We could have given him a house for much less than we paid him to help murder people at Fort Meade. 
Lisa Ling worked on a database filled by drone surveillance that compiled information on 121,000 “targets” in two years. Multiply that by a dozen years. With 90% of victims not among the targets, add up how many people would die in the targeting of the whole list. That’d be over 7 million. But it’s not numbers that have poisoned the souls of these three veterans; it’s children and mothers and brothers and uncles lying in pieces on the ground. 
Ling travels to Afghanistan to see the place at ground level and to meet with drone victims. She meets a little boy who lost his leg and his 4-year-old brother and his sister and his father. On February 2, 2010, drone “pilots” at Creech Air Base murdered 23 innocent members of one family. 
The filmmakers have voices read the written transcript of what the drone operators said to each other before, during, and after sending in the missiles that did the damage. This is worse than Collateral Murder . The people whose job it is to identify children and others who should not be murdered have identified children among the group of people being targeted. The “pilots” at Creech are eager to reject this information and to get onto killing as many people as they can. Their lust for blood drives the decision process. Only after they’ve killed 23 people do they recognize children among the survivors, and the lack of guns. 
We see the bodies brought home to bury. Those injured describe their suffering, physical as well as mental. We see people being fitted with artificial legs. We hear Afghans describe their perception of drones. They imagine, just as many Americans may imagine, and just as viewers of Eye in the Sky would imagine, that drone operators have a clear, high resolution view of everything. In fact, they have a view of fuzzy little blobs on a computer screen that looks like it was created in the 1980s. 
Linebaugh says there is no way to distinguish the little “civilian” blobs from little “militant” blobs. When Daniel hears President Obama claim that there is always near certainty that no civilians will be killed, Daniel explains that such knowledge is simply not possible. Linebaugh says she was often on the side of the conversation telling the “pilots” at Creech not to murder innocents, but that they always pushed for permission to kill. 
Jesselyn Radack, attorney for whistleblowers, says in the film that the FBI told two whistleblowers that a terrorist group had put them on a kill list. She said that the FBI has also contacted Linebaugh’s family and warned her that “terrorists” have been searching for her name online, suggesting that she fix this problem by shutting up. (She had written an op-ed in the Guardian ). 
The FBI also raids Daniel’s house, arriving with 30 to 50 agents, badges, guns, cameras, and search warrants. They take away his papers, electronics, and phone. They tell him he is under investigation for a possible indictment under the Espionage Act. This is the World War I-era law for targeting foreign enemies that President Obama has made a routine of using to target domestic whistleblowers. While Obama has prosecuted more people under this law than did all previous presidents combined, we probably have no way of knowing how many people have been explicitly threatened with the possibility. 
While we should be apologizing to, comforting, and aiding these young people rather than denying them the right to speak to anybody and threatening them with decades in prison, Lisa Ling did manage to find some kindness.

If aggression is perhaps the most ignoble act, self defense may be one of the most noble.

9791,Swedish MP quits in disgust at Jewish ownership of media — Includes short video by Red Ice Radio,"Other Writers 
Swedish Democrat party member of Parliament Anna Hagwall has announced her resignation from all party posts and will not stand for reelection in 2018 after a furor following her exposure of the fact that a single family of Jews control the Swedish media. One Jewish family helps to brainwash the entire population of Sweden. This Swedish MP has had ENOUGH! 
The uproar followed her letter to the Aftonbladet newspaper in which she said that “ethnicity should be a factor” in determining media ownership of more than 5 percent—an obvious reference to the Jewish Bonnier family media group. 
The Bonnier Group owns 96 book publishers, 42 business and trade press newspapers, 105 digital news platforms, 9 film production companies, 176 magazines, 23 major newspapers, 33 TV stations, and 33 “other” media outlets—and quite literally dominates the controlled media in Sweden. 
Hagwall had earlier submitted a motion to the Swedish parliament which proposed cuts to the state subsidies paid to media in Sweden. 
Although she never mentioned Jews by name, Hagwall said in an explanatory letter to the Aftonbladet that it would be a good idea to “let Bonnier’s newspapers go under” so that “no family, ethnic group, or company” could control more than 5 percent of the media. 
“An entire 80 percent of the media is owned and controlled by the same owners,” Hagwell wrote. “This is not acceptable. Therefore, media ownership should be spread over many independent companies and people. In order to change this, I suggest press subsidies [only] for the independent media.” 
When asked by Aftonbladet how the abolition of press subsidies to the country’s local newspapers reduce Bonnier’s power over the media in Sweden, Hagwall answered by email that “most small newspapers are directly or indirectly controlled by Bonnier, and why they have to be subsidized by the Swedish taxpayer is a mystery. 
“Let the little Bonnier newspapers in the provinces go under, because then a void will be created which can be filled by newspapers that care about people and business owners.” 
She also said that the Swedish public service broadcaster, Sveriges Television (SVT), should be switched to pay channels to “reduce SVT’s propagation of the politically correct agenda.” 
The comments provoked a stream of attacks upon Hagwall, and the Swedish Democrat leadership also distanced itself from her, saying in a statement that the matter will “affect her future in the party.” 
This week, Hagwall resigned her position as member of the Parliamentary Committee on Taxation and internal group leader of the Sweden Democrats’ tax policy group. She also will not seek reelection to Parliament in 2018 at the request of the party leadership, and it is currently unclear if she will continue to sit in parliament for the remainder of the current term.",0
9792,The Lost Footage of Marilyn Monroe - The New York Times,"It happened one night in the late summer of 1954. Jules Schulback, a New York furrier and taker of home movies, heard that Marilyn Monroe would be on the Upper East Side of Manhattan filming scenes again for her new picture, “The Seven Year Itch. ” Two days earlier, Mr. Schulback had taken footage of her with his   Bolex movie camera around the corner from his townhouse apartment. So he grabbed the camera  —   the one usually used for family picnics and parades and the stuff of everyday life  —   and headed over to the subway grate in front of Wright’s Food shop, just down the street from the   movie theater on Lexington Avenue and 52nd Street. Though it was around 1 a. m. a large crowd had already gathered, mostly newspaper photographers and curious men waiting to see Marilyn. The movie studio and the director, Billy Wilder, had counted on this, inviting the press and the public to drum up buzz for the new movie, which starred Ms. Monroe as “the Girl Upstairs,” who entices a   executive, played by Tom Ewell, while his wife is away with the kids for the summer. In the famous street scene, the two are leaving the movies as Ms. Monroe pauses over a grate to enjoy the breeze from the subway as it blows up her dress on a hot summer night. “Isn’t it delicious?” she purrs. The breeze came from a large fan under the grate operated by the film’s special effects chief. The night  —   Sept. 15  —   was actually quite chilly. But the stunt worked. It became known as “the shot seen around the world. ” But there was a dark subtext to the comedy. Gathered at that late hour were hundreds of gawkers, almost all men, who catcalled and yelled things like, “Higher! Higher!” as Ms. Monroe’s dress blew up over her head. For two hours, the men watched from surrounding buildings and from the street. “Unfortunately, one of them was her husband, Joe DiMaggio,” Mr. Wilder is quoted as saying in his biography, “Nobody’s Perfect. ” “And he didn’t like what he saw, or what everyone else was seeing. ” Mr. DiMaggio hadn’t planned on visiting the set that night, and was waiting for his wife at the St. Regis Hotel, where the couple were staying. But the columnist Walter Winchell had persuaded him to come along. Ms. Monroe was not happy her husband had shown up. But he was even more unhappy and angrily stormed off. Later that night the couple had a screaming fight in their room. The next morning, her hairdresser covered up Ms. Monroe’s bruises with makeup. Three weeks later, Ms. Monroe filed for divorce. Mr. Wilder never used the Lexington Avenue footage and reshot the scene on a closed lot in Hollywood, though photographs of that night appeared everywhere. Except for some brief, grainy shots from a newsreel covering the divorce, footage from that night was never screened. “The footage immediately disappeared,” Mr. Wilder said in the biography. “But one day I’m sure some film scholar will dig it up. ” The story of the night Marilyn Monroe’s white   dress blew up was well known among Jules Schulback’s children, and even among his grandchildren. His granddaughter Bonnie Siegler said he bragged from time to time about his personal film shoot with Marilyn. “He was a real raconteur,” said Ms. Siegler, a graphic designer who runs her own company, Eight and a Half. “I didn’t know if the story was real. ” But even though she had never seen it, she often told people that her grandfather had footage of Marilyn Monroe on the subway grate. Ms. Siegler’s older sister, Rayna Dineen, said her grandfather, whom they called Opi (a German term of endearment) was rarely without his camera. “He would be filming everywhere, all the time. ” There were reels of vacations, family picnics, birthday parties and bar mitzvahs. He had even filmed a   day in the life of his daughters, depicting them waking up, brushing their teeth and going to school. “But the Marilyn story was one of his favorite stories to tell,” Ms. Dineen said. It was just one of dozens of amazing tales. Mr. Schulback had a long, technicolorful life, one so filled with drama that his Monroe story sometimes seemed like a footnote. In 1938, Mr. Schulback had argued with his family in Germany that Adolf Hitler was much more dangerous than anyone thought. According to Ms. Siegler, his family believed that Hitler’s hate speech was simply rhetoric, and that he wouldn’t act on anything he was saying. Mr. Schulback, 25 at the time, urged them to pack their bags and leave Berlin with him. But they resisted, opting to wait and see how things developed, never imagining the horror that awaited them and millions of other European Jews. Mr. Schulback was not taking any chances. In 1938, Jews immigrating to the United States needed a sponsor, someone to take financial responsibility for them. Mr. Schulback sold everything he had, bought an expensive suit, booked passage on the Queen Mary, reserved a room at the Plaza and headed to America to find a sponsor for him and his wife, Edith, and their daughter Helen, who was then a toddler. “He was like: ‘I’m your lost, rich relative. I won’t be a burden.’ But he had no money. He played it,” Ms. Siegler said. He secured a signature, then returned to collect his family, but was stopped trying to enter Nazi Germany by a suspicious border guard. Knowing the Germans were big fans of the 1934 Clark Gable hit, “It Happened One Night,” Mr. Schulback told the guard he was the distributor for Mr. Gable’s new movie. He claimed that if he couldn’t enter the country, neither would the film. “The guy was like, ‘Oh, we love Clark Gable,’ and waved him through,” Ms. Siegler said. Mr. Schulback grabbed Edith and Helen, again imploring his other relatives to leave, and escaped back to the United States with a few suitcases, claiming to the Nazi immigration officers that his family was going on vacation. The date was Nov. 8, the day before Kristallnacht. In Berlin, he had been a furrier, and his shop was destroyed that night. His remaining family  —   four sisters, parents and    —   would all perish in the Holocaust. The United States was good to Mr. Schulback. He and his family lived a happy, successful life in New York, much of it preserved in his home movies. As a child, Ms. Siegler loved going to her grandfather’s Upper East Side apartment not just because of his great stories and sense of humor, but also because he lived opposite the New York Doll Hospital. From his apartment window, she could see the buckets of doll eyes and doll arms. “It was really intense,” she said. When Edith had a stroke in the 1970s, she was given only a few weeks to live. But Mr. Schulback, always a man of action, refused to let his wife die in the hospital and took her home. The couple moved into the   apartment of a building around the corner, and Mr. Schulback became her nurse. “Half her body was paralyzed, she couldn’t speak,” Ms. Siegler said. “But he loved her and took care of her for 26 years until she finally died. ” After 35 years in that same apartment, Mr. Schulback  —   who had been president of the 61st Street Block Association  —   was forced to leave. The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation had bought the townhouse where he lived and the one behind it and wanted to reconfigure the property. So Ms. Siegler and her husband, Jeff Scher, helped move her    grandfather to a new place on the other side of Central Park. In 2004, in the arduous packing up of Mr. Schulback’s home, the couple came across a big stash of film. It was stored in a back room that the family called “Opi’s fur room,” where Mr. Schulback had once assembled garments from animal pelts for his business. “No one ever wanted to go back there,” Ms. Siegler said. “But when we went in, we found this plastic bag filled with just tons of film, home movies, bought movies and everything mixed together. ” Ms. Siegler’s husband, an experimental filmmaker, couldn’t wait to screen the films. He was particularly interested in seeing whether Marilyn and the subway grate footage actually existed. “It was like this family myth,” Mr. Scher said. “So long rumored and never confirmed. ” The same was true for its source material. For decades, innuendo swirled around the Lexington Avenue shoot for “The Seven Year Itch. ” Ms. Monroe and Mr. DiMaggio had married that January and had already had a bumpy ride, the Yankee Clipper enraged by her exhibitionism and by rumors of infidelity, according to Lois W. Banner, the author of the 2012 biography “Marilyn: The Passion and the Paradox. ” “She was having an affair with her musical director at the time, and everyone knew about it in the business,” said Dr. Banner, a professor emeritus of history and gender studies at the University of Southern California. So before he even arrived on set, there was tension. “DiMaggio,” Dr. Banner said, “was not happy with Marilyn. ” There are several theories as to why the footage from that night was never used. Some believe the Manhattan shoot was done purely as a publicity stunt, which was made even more sensational when Mr. DiMaggio showed up. Some biographers say the enthusiastic crowd was just too noisy, making the film unusable. A third theory was that the footage was too risqué and Ms. Monroe wanted to shoot a more demure version, so as not to further infuriate her husband. There was even talk at the time that she wasn’t wearing any underwear. Mr. Wilder tried to put those rumors to rest in his biography. She had put on not just one, but two sets of underwear, he said. Dr. Banner said all three reasons quite likely played into the final decision to reshoot. “But the photographs of that night had gone viral by the time the film was being put together,” she said, “and played a great role in her fame. ” The   scene used in the finished film is incredibly brief and tame. The image many people have of that moment comes from the press shots and publicity stills in New York, and not from the finished movie. Back in the pelt room of Mr. Schulback’s apartment, Mr. Scher excitedly gathered up the old metal film canisters. None were labeled, Mr. Scher recalled. Some of the film was off the reel and sitting there like big balls of spaghetti, as if there had been a projector mishap years ago. Later that night in his studio in the couple’s apartment on West 16th Street, Mr. Scher slowly and carefully wound the film, since some of it was very brittle and in danger of breaking. He did a few repairs and then began looking at it using a light box, spooling it from reel to reel by hand. There were about 50 rolls of   film and around 75 rolls of 8 millimeter. There were the family outings and parades. The birthdays and bar mitzvahs. And there, amid the mundane scenes of precious everyday life, was Marilyn Monroe, in crisp, colorful Kodachrome. “This stuff just popped out,” Mr. Scher said. “It was real! Preserved like the home movies are, too. Just these moments in time. ” Mr. Scher could clearly see the actress’s dress billowing up. “Like a parachute with a pair of legs attached,” he said. “It was startling. Like seeing a myth materialize. ” It was a shadow version of lost footage amid home movies of a family that almost certainly wouldn’t have existed had the Schulbacks stayed in Germany. Mr. Scher called out to his wife: “It’s really here!” They watched all 3 minutes 17 seconds in amazement. “There was something so magical about it,” Ms. Siegler said. “For years I didn’t know if it was real. I certainly didn’t believe it wholeheartedly. And there it was. It was like the end of the story. ” The film starts with a   intertitle that reads “World Premiere,” Mr. Schulback’s little inside joke. And then there is Marilyn Monroe, in a white terry robe, coming down the stoop of a   building at 164 East 61st Street, between Lexington and Third Avenues. It was the earlier scene  —   before the subway grate footage  —   that Mr. Schulback had shot. Cameramen and press photographers are gathered outside as the actress smiles and waves. Cut to Ms. Monroe in a   window wearing a slip and   her hair. Mr. Ewell walks down the street and into the building. The film cuts inexplicably to 30 seconds of what must be a Shriners parade in Manhattan, then jumps to another intertitle, which reads “Our Baby. ” And suddenly, there is Ms. Monroe again, this time on the subway grate in that famously fluttering white dress, holding a matching white clutch in her right hand and a     scarf in her left. Mr. Schulback was incredibly close, filming right behind Mr. Wilder’s shoulder, stopping to wind his   camera every 25 seconds. Now and then, a silhouette of the director’s arm intrudes into Mr. Schulback’s   shot. At one point Mr. Wilder, in a fedora, passes across the frame. Ms. Monroe gets into position and yawns, while the cinematographer sets up the camera. Through a gap in the film crew, Mr. Schulback captures just her face, looking off to the left, serious and unsmiling. Then Mr. Ewell is there, chatting with Ms. Monroe, who pushes him into position. The dress flutters again, Ms. Monroe holds it down, bending slightly, smiling and talking to Mr. Ewell, but it flutters up some more and she laughs, her head thrown back. It blows up again, but she doesn’t push it down this time, and it flies up over her head, clearly revealing two pairs of underwear that, because of the bright lights, do not protect Ms. Monroe’s modesty quite as much as she might have liked. Then, as suddenly as she appeared, Marilyn is gone, and the film reverts to   mode: Edith Schulback walking on the grass at a family outing in the country. It’s like being shaken from some crazy dream, back to reality. Interest in that moment in film history from more than 50 years ago endures. The new movie musical starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, “La La Land,” makes brief filmic reference to it in the opening number, with a young dancer’s yellow dress blowing up. And a Snickers commercial from the Super Bowl last year stars Willem Dafoe, Eugene Levy and a   Monroe on the famous set. “It’s that iconic image,” said Dr. Banner, the Monroe biographer. “People are still fascinated by the context in which it all happened. ” After screening the film with her husband, Ms. Siegler immediately told her grandfather that she had found the footage. “I was so excited about it  —   more for the reason that his story was true. ” She shrugged. “But he never had any doubts. ” Mr. Schulback moved in 2005 and died six months later. Ms. Siegler and Mr. Scher made a print and screened it for about 100 people in 2004 at the upstate home of their friends Kurt Andersen and his wife, Anne Kreamer. The two couples had started a small film festival for neighbors and friends, hanging a sheet on the side of a barn and serving popcorn, ice pops and beer. The people in the audience that summer night had no idea what they were in for. “That scene is one of the most iconic scenes in American cinema,” said Mr. Andersen, an author, radio host and a founder of Spy magazine. “So to have film of it actually being shot, it’s like watching the Zapruder film. It’s just extraordinary. ” The crowd that evening sat in silence as Marilyn Monroe’s dress blew up on the side of the barn. “People were ” Mr. Andersen said. “They were like, ‘What did I just see? ’” That was the only time anyone outside the family had seen the film. Until now.",0
9793,2016 Election Night Live Blog/Open Thread,"Here’s the timing: 
Most of the US will have to wait for polling stations to close – typically between 19:00 EST (00:00 GMT) and 20:00 EST (01:00 GMT) – for state projections. 
As for the final result? Stay glued to your phone or TV or set your alarm for 23:00 EST (04:00 GMT). That’s when West Coast polls close and history suggests a winner’s declared. It was bang on the hour in 2008, and 15 minutes later in 2012. 
Of course, if you go further back in history, 2004 was a nailbiter. I remember very well going to bed after the Kerry campaign said they’d challenge the result based on Ohio, and getting up in the morning to find out they’d caved. And of course election 2000 was what it was. 
There will be many sites tracking the results as they come in; here’s Politico’s for the presidency (they also have the House and the Senate). It’s impossible to know which one is the best until data actually appears; I prefer maps with results as they come in by county. And speaking of counties… 
The final RCP averages put Clinton ahead in the national popular vote by 3.3%. However, with Trump ahead in Florida (0.02%), North Carolina (1%), and Clinton only ahead by 0.5% in New Hampshire, it still looks like a horse race, to me. (Of course, I may have become counter-suggestible to the idea that Clinton has it in the bag because almost the entire political class is yammering that she does.) 
Anyhow, if indeed this is a horse race — and if our famously free press doesn’t simply decide to call it — we’ll be up late waiting for county data in the states that are close (presumably swing states like Florida, North Carolina, and New Hampshire). So here is a table of the counties that various sources regard as key:",0
9794,Germany’s Islamist Scene Growing: Security Chief,"BERLIN (AFP)  —   Germany’s domestic security chief warned Sunday that the country’s radical Islamist scene is not only growing, but becoming more decentralised, posing greater challenges to surveillance operations. [In an interview with national news agency DPA,   Maassen also defended security officials under fire after it emerged that Berlin truck attack suspect Anis Amri had slipped through their net, saying they had done everything they could.  Overall, the number of Salafists  —   or fundamentalist Sunni Muslims  —   in Germany has risen to more than 9, 700, sharply up from 3, 800 people in 2011, said Maassen. “It’s of great concern to us that this scene is not only growing, but it is also very diversified. There is not just one, two, three or four people who have a say,” he warned. “Rather, there are many people who dominate this Salafist scene. And all these people have to be watched. ” While in the past, there were a few people who wielded influence, today, there are many small clusters formed by individuals. “So you can no longer talk about a Salafist scene as a whole, but you have to deal with many hotspots. That makes things more difficult for us, because we can no longer just watch a few people. We have to monitor many groups,” he said. In a defence of security officials under pressure for failing to stop Amri, Maassen said that although officers had watched the Tunisian over a long period of time, they found no evidence to arrest him. “I believe that the security forces, in particular the police, have done everything in their power to assess the danger posed by Amri. But it is also clear that we live under the rule of law, and the legal framework must be respected,” he said. Amri, 24, who was shot dead by Italian police days after ramming a truck into a crowded Christmas market, had been under surveillance since March. But German police dropped their watch in September thinking he was a   drug dealer. Public anger also mounted as the rejected asylum seeker and known radical Islamist should have been deported long ago. In the wake of the attack, Chancellor Angela Merkel admitted that “the Amri case raises questions” and ordered a sweeping review of Germany’s security apparatus.",0

9796,Hillary Clinton and the President’s 'Longer Game.',"Hillary Clinton and the President’s ' Longer Game .' At home and abroad, a nation less affluent, less free, and far less secure. October 31, 2016 Lloyd Billingsley 
The President of the United States, the most powerful man in the world, used a pseudonym to communicate with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on her private, unsecured email server. As Andrew McCarthy contended , that was the reason the FBI declined to prosecute Clinton, because the president would have been part of the same action, and that wouldn’t be politically correct. 
The current president of the United States is also on record that, contrary to custom, he will linger in Washington DC for a few years. Wherever he chooses to live, the email intrigue suggests continuing back-channel communications with Hillary Clinton, should she become president. That invites a look at what the man the New York Times dubbed “Obama’s narrator,” the White House adviser who sat closest to the president and signed off on his every word, had to say about the president’s vision of the future. 
“Few of the decisions he had made would satisfy the politics of the moment,” David Axelrod explained in his massive 2015 Believer . “But at home and abroad, Obama was playing a longer game.” As he explained in Columbia, Missouri, on October 30, 2008, “We are five days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America.” 
If this man was a liberal, as Barry Rubin wondered in Silent Revolution: How the Left Rose to Political Power and Cultural Dominance , why did he see a need fundamentally to transform a nation shaped by liberals such as Franklin Roosevelt with his New Deal and Lyndon Johnson with his Great Society? He saw the need because he was not a liberal but a lifelong leftist radical. 
As David Horowitz explained in Volume 7 of the Black Book of the American Left , the president was “born, bred and trained in the progressive movement.” His mentors were “Communists and their progressive successors,” so no wonder he presided over “the institutionalizing of the policies of the left in government” for eight years. What that means in practical terms is becoming painfully evident. 
The economy remains sluggish and under Obamacare, the president’s signature plan, premiums are skyrocketing . This suggests that, as many believe, Obamacare was simply a demolition plan. In the “longer game,” designated successor Hillary Clinton will impose government monopoly healthcare, what some candidates erroneously call “socialized medicine.” 
As Rubin noted, the goal of the left is “to convince Americans the exact opposite of what their experience proved: that the country had fundamentally failed and the old leftist solutions were the answer.” The result “may be a very long-term and even permanent change of the United States into something else, a nation far less affluent and far less free.” And far less secure, as David Axelrod also indicates. 
Vladimir Putin makes an appearance in Believer but Obama’s narrator does not outline Putin’s background in the KGB. The believer includes nothing about Putin’s role in East Germany, a Stalinist police state that walled in its subjects and shot those attempting to escape. The narrator avoids Putin’s belief that the breakup of the Soviet Union was “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century.” 
In Believer , Putin tells the president, “You are a highly educated man. I come from the security sector.” The believer then asks the president for his assessment of Putin. 
“He’s smart, tough, clear about his interests and without a trace of sentimentality,” the president says. That is not very strong language for a KGB veteran and expansionist autocrat. 
In his narrator’s account, the president uses the word “motherf",0
9797,Why Did They Vote For Trump?,"By Andre Vltchek WHY DID THEY VOTE FOR THIS MAN? 
“If we don’t understand why that choice was made, we will all get fucked, soon, and not only in North America, but also all over the world!” — Andre Vltchek 
Since the results of the latest Presidential elections were announced, I am longing for silence, while the overwhelming cacophony of deafening noises is assaulting my ears, and in fact all my senses. 
Suddenly everyone around me wants to speak, to shout, and to declare. Lately, people who are surrounding me, as well as those who are far away from me are frantically watching the news, reading newspapers and browsing through countless political websites. 
My friends and comrades all over the world are poking jokes at the US political establishment, or trembling in anticipation of something terrible, even apocalyptic. 
Many are just having fun. Even some thoughtful and educated individuals are behaving like obsessive football fans: analyzing, passing judgments, and spending countless hours on the couch, in front of their television screens. 
Of course there are also many gigantic protests in countless American cities against the President-elect, Donald Trump, the 45th leader of the mightiest nation on Earth. There are some massive protests, desperate protests, and hopeless protests. There are also personal protests, resigned shrugs of shoulders and downcast glances. 
Overall there is a lot of noise. Everyone is speaking from the top of his or her lungs. Actually, people are shouting over each other. They want to be heard, desperately. While very few are listening. Very few also appear to be reflecting on what is being said by the others, on what is truly happening, on what has happened. 
Despite millions of words and images assaulting our brains from all directions, I know that something is definitely missing, something important, and even something essential. It is not just my analytical mind that comprehends this; it is also my intuition. 
As a result, I want to smash those television sets in my vicinity, I want to throw newspapers into the garbage bin, and I want to go away, far away, from all my politicizing friends and comrades. 
But what is it that is being omitted in the official and even in the alternative narrative? What is it that I want to hear, longing to hear so much … longing with such force, even with such desperation? 
Am I desperate for some precise analyses, for exact numbers, for revealing facts? Am I yearning for one brilliant study, for a report? Do I want to hear from someone why on earth did the American people elect someone like him, like Donald Trump? Or is it all actually much more simple and selfish: do I expect those wise words to come from my own brain, typed into my computer with my own fingers? 
How did it all really come to this? And why? What will happen now? What will happen to them (to the voters), what will happen to America, the country, which despite everything used to be my home for many years? What will happen to America which took so much, but which also gave me plenty? I kept asking, above all, what will happen to the world, to the entire world, which is now my true home, and which is also their true home (home of the American voters), although perhaps they do not fully comprehend it yet. 
No, I did not want to hear the facts! I couldn’t care less about the numbers. I was not longing for analyses, and I felt absolutely no desire to speak! 
Suddenly, there was only one longing left in me: to listen, to hear, to absorb the millions of voices of those who just recently went to the polls and stuck those pieces of paper into boxes, most likely changing the destiny of the world. And since I knew I wouldn’t be able to absorb millions of testimonies, I wanted to listen to at least a few hundred or even thousands of them if possible. 
I wanted to hear the stories of those men and women from the Rustbelt states, from the Deep South, from isolated farms and exhausted mining towns. I wanted to put my glass of beer next to theirs, in some god-forsaken bar, and just nod and whisper what so many storytellers before me, have done for millennia, and what they will be saying for many centuries to come: “Please tell me your story…” 
I want to hear their stories so I can collect them, arrange them, and pass them onto the world. 
I want the people who voted for Donald Trump to speak to me, to explain, to let me into their thoughts and emotions. I want to understand what occurred through their stories. 
I don’t want to judge. I am usually very judgmental, very political, and very ideological. This time I have no desire to be … This is too serious; too damn serious! 
I owe America that much. That is the least I can do. To return there, to fly there all the way from Asia, to rent a car, and drive from coast to coast, for long weeks, and to finally listen to people, trying to understand who they are, what they did, and why? 
“I am what I am because I am a passionate listener,” I was once told by one of the greatest Latin American writers, Eduardo Galeano. “People always know what goes on. All we have to do is to listen to them. And we have to lead them only when they ask us, when they order us to do so.” 
There is no doubt in my mind that now is the time to attentively listen to the American people; to fill newspapers and websites with their words. But almost no one seems to be doing that. 
All we hear is ‘why they voted as they did’. How they voted: women, minorities, particular classes or states … We read about numbers. But we don’t hear people speaking! We don’t hear them formulating the words. 
And that is what I am longing for: to shut up, to be silent, and to listen. And I want other intellectuals to shut up and to humbly listen too, finally! 
Not because I agree with what they, the voters, have done. Not because I want Donald Trump to lead the country and the Empire. Not because I suddenly ‘fell in love with the small people’. 
It is simply because the people of the most powerful country on Earth have spoken, because they made their choice. And because, if we don’t understand why that choice was made, we will all get fucked, soon, and not only in North America, but also all over the world! 
I want to listen and to understand so the course of action can be determined, so that we know where all this will lead … because this is not the end, just the beginning… of something… Because not only people in the United States, but also in Europe want something, and listening to the analysts from both parts of the world, and by just ‘reading facts and numbers’, I have absolutely no clue what it is! 
Do voters want some new form of participatory democracy? Do they want neo-fascism? Are they thoroughly selfish or is there at least some internationalist essence in their souls? 
We can only find out if we let them speak. And that is why I am longing for silence, and then for their voices to resonate, so we know, we know now, before the thunder and flames swallow our Planet, and before it is too late.",0
9798,Anderson Cooper On Melania’s Cyber-Bullying Speech: Isn’t The Problem With HER Family? (VIDEO),"Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr 
Melania Trump gave her first campaign speech on Thursday and in it, she said that if she became first lady, she would work to improve social media which she says has become “too tough and too mean.” 
Naturally, the internet had a field day with this news, considering her husband is best known for his hate speech and 3 am Twitter-tantrums, where he regularly demeans and insults the president and first lady, the Clintons, and countless others. 
In an interview with Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, Thursday night, Anderson Cooper questioned her about Melania’s speech: 
“Does this start at home? Isn’t the problem at her own dinner table?” 
Kellyanne did what Kellyanne always does and brushed it off, saying that “No, it’s not at the dinner table. The fact that her husband is running for president and defends himself sometimes or tweets things out…” 
But Anderson didn’t let her finish that statement and gave her a dose of truth that she won’t soon forget.

9799,Arrest in Stockholm Truck Attack: ‘We Think He Is the Driver’ - The New York Times,"STOCKHOLM  —   The Swedish police said on Saturday that they had arrested a      man they believed had hijacked a beer truck and carried out a terrorist attack by driving the truck into a crowd of people in Stockholm the day before, killing four and injuring at least 15 others. Prosecutors and police officials did not identify the suspect, but Anders Thornberg, the head of the Swedish Security Service, said at a news conference that the man had been on the authorities’ radar some time ago. Mr. Thornberg said that the agency had looked into information it received on the suspect last year, but that it had not led to anything. He said the suspect was not on any current list of people being monitored. “The suspect didn’t appear in our recent files, but he earlier has been in our files,” Mr. Thornberg said. The Swedish national broadcaster SVT reported that a bag with explosives had been found in the truck used in the attack. On Saturday, the police chief, Dan Eliasson, said: “We have found something in the truck in the driver’s compartment, a technical device that should not be there. I cannot say whether this is a bomb or some sort of flammable material. ” Prosecutors said the suspect had not spoken, and there was no immediate word of any criminal charges. But Chief Eliasson said there was “nothing to indicate we have the wrong person. ” He added, “We cannot exclude the possibility that others are involved. ” Lars Bystrom, a spokesman for the regional police, said earlier on Saturday, “We have one person in custody, and we think he is the driver of the truck. ” Chief Eliasson would not say how long the suspect had been living in Sweden. “We are focusing on how he entered the country, where has he been,” he said. “We need to establish what kind of contacts he had. ” He said there were clear similarities with the deadly attack in London last month. On Saturday, people placed flowers outside the department store in Stockholm where the attack occurred as a memorial to the victims. Karolinska Hospital said that six of the injured had been released. The police said eight people remained hospitalized. The beer truck, stolen earlier on Friday, mowed down pedestrians along Drottninggatan, a busy pedestrian shopping street. It came to a stop after slamming into the Ahlens department store. After the rampage, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said: “Sweden has been attacked. This indicates that it is an act of terror. ” The manhunt brought transit systems to a halt and put Parliament under lockdown. The suspect was detained in a northern Stockholm suburb on Friday and later arrested on suspicion of having committed a terrorism crime, the police said. Elias Broth, 19, a high school senior, was on a bus at the intersection of Drottninggatan and Kungsgatan when he heard a loud noise. “I look up and I see the truck passing by, driving really fast,” he said by phone on Saturday. “Then I heard a big boom when it crashed into people. ” He said he had stayed in the bus a bit longer, before taking shelter in a clothing store on Kungsgatan. “The first thing I saw when I stepped off the bus was a woman. Her body was in pieces,” he said.   Juncker, the European Commission president, said in a statement on Friday: “One of Europe’s most vibrant and colorful cities appears to have been struck by those wishing it  —   and our very way of life  —   harm. An attack on any of our member states is an attack on us all. ” Peng Wu, 35, a postgraduate student from New York who moved to Stockholm in late 2013, was leaving a coffee shop near the shopping center when he saw people rushing toward him, many of them crying and in shock. Initially, he said, he did not know what had happened, but as he made his way to his wife’s office, he saw people lying motionless and police officers with body armor rushing to the site. He said he expected locals to bounce back quickly, though. “Swedes are pretty resilient people,” he said. While the city was under lockdown, the hashtag #openstockholm sprang up on Twitter. Jenny Nguyen, 22, a law student in Stockholm, said she had come up with the hashtag to encourage people to open their homes to commuters, tourists and others who were stranded after the transit system was shut down. “This idea is actually not a new one,” she said in a phone interview. “I was following the attack in Paris when that occurred. I saw that someone started a hashtag to tell people where to go and where they could find company. ” “Suddenly, I felt the world was not as dark as people who commit these types of actions want it to be,” she said.",0

9802,Palestinian Authority Daily: Water The Soil With Martyr’s Blood,"JERUSALEM  —   “Water the soil with your blood,” was the message conveyed by a cartoon published last week in the official Palestinian Authority daily. The cartoon depicted a Palestinian prisoner watering a blooming plant with blood directly from his vein. [The cartoon, which was published in     and cited by Israeli NGO Palestinian Media Watch, is in keeping with the ideology of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’ Fatah party, which regularly promotes the idea that the land and the cause of “Palestine” needs Palestinian blood in order to survive.  Children from a young age are indoctrinated with this blood cult ideology of martyrdom as a poem posted on Fatah’s Facebook page testifies: Teach your children  …     There is a seed in the soil, If you water it with blood, It will sprout a revolution, When the most recent wave of terror was launched in October 2015, the PA fueled the fire by glorifying suicide and martyrdom. Following one of the first terror attacks, the PA daily     summarized the attack thus: [Palestinians] insisted on perfuming themselves with the Martyr’s blood.   …     The residents of Jerusalem looked at the blood spots which were still on the ground and on the water which turned slightly red from it, formed a circle and recited the [Quranic Sura]   for the martyr’s [soul]. Earlier the same month, PA official Governor of Ramallah and   Laila Ghannam, posted a message on her Facebook page describing the morning as one “fragranced by the blood of the martyrs:” Palestine’s morning, A morning fragranced by the blood of the martyrs, The morning of wounded Jerusalem, Have a morning of pride and honor, In January, Fatah posted a separate call to water the soil with blood of martyrs: Fatah means full readiness to sacrifice and faith in Allah, and afterwards in the inevitable victory, in the justice of the cause, and in the national unity. We were born as rebels on the land of [Prophet] Muhammad’s Night Journey and Ascent to Heaven we carried out intifada as free men and we embraced the land in purity and washed in blood with which we watered our land for freedom and independence.

9806,"Unpaid Chernobyl veterans, underpaid teachers storm the Rada","November 3, 2016  - Fort Russ News -

- Liliya Filatova , in Politobzor, Nov 1, 2016, translated by Tom Winter -


Right now, an angry crowd of veterans from the Chernobyl clean-up have gathered in front of the Kiev Verkhovna Rada: They are not receiving their benefits. The crowd tried to storm the parliament, so their deputies would hear then out and start to act rather than just shrug all over again.

Now the event is gaining an even larger scale as two thousand teachers have joined the Chernobyl cleanup veterans. A column of teachers partially blocked traffic for vehicles on Grushevskogo street.

The demands of the teachers are simple and reasonable: raise our wages, and not just yours, and cancel the increase in tariffs, which was physically impossible to pay since they are higher than the salaries.

The fatcat deputies of the Verkhovna Rada and the Prime Minister, who backdated salary increases for themselves and the president, have brought the citizens of Ukraine to the limit, as people take to the streets and storm City Councils. Recently in Vinnitsa protesters tried to storm the city council and the break in to the session hall.

9807,"Cultural Revolution Shaped Xi Jinping, From Schoolboy to Survivor - The New York Times","Editors’ note: We are resurfacing this 2015 article on Xi Jinping ahead of the Chinese president’s visit to the United States on Thursday to meet with President Trump. BEIJING  —   When the pandemonium of the Cultural Revolution erupted, he was a slight, softly spoken    who loved classical Chinese poetry. Two years later, adrift in a city torn apart by warring Red Guards, Xi Jinping had hardened into a combative street survivor. His father, a senior Communist Party official who had been purged a few years earlier, was seized and repeatedly beaten. Student militants ransacked his family’s home, forcing the family to flee, and one of his sisters died in the mayhem. Paraded before a crowd as an enemy of the revolution and denounced by his own mother, the future president of China was on the edge of being thrown into a prison for delinquent children of the party elite. Visiting the United States this week, Mr. Xi, 62, has presented himself as a polished statesman, at ease hobnobbing with American capitalists in Seattle and attending a state dinner at the White House in his honor, set for Friday. Yet his first immersion in politics came on the streets of the Chinese capital during the most tumultuous era of Communist rule, when Mao Zedong exhorted students “to bombard the headquarters” of order. “I always had a stubborn streak and wouldn’t put up with being bullied,” Mr. Xi recalled in an interview in 2000, one of the few times he has spoken about his experience as a teenager in Beijing. “I riled the radicals, and they blamed me for everything that went wrong. ” Mr. Xi has often discussed the seven years he spent exiled to a rural village during the latter part of the Cultural Revolution, including in a speech in Seattle on Tuesday, casting that chapter of his life as an uplifting story of a city boy who discovers the suffering of ordinary Chinese in the countryside and resolves to make a difference. But Mr. Xi has rarely spoken in public about his experiences from 1966 to 1968 at the tumultuous start of the Cultural Revolution, and his close contemporaries refuse to talk to foreign journalists about those years. An examination of memoirs written by them and by members of Mr. Xi’s family, though, offers an unusually vivid look at how a shy, bookish youth, raised in the bosom of party privilege, was tested and changed by the chaos that unfolded after Mao’s decision to turn the masses against the party establishment. Mr. Xi started his transformation in the equivalent of the seventh grade in the August 1 School, a cloistered boarding school largely reserved for children with parents in the senior ranks of the party and the military. When Cultural Revolution militants shut it down, he ended up at the No. 25 School, which was a hotbed of discontent with the party elite, said Qian Peizhen, chairwoman of the school’s alumni association. But as order broke down, Mr. Xi, like many youths, spent little time in class. Mr. Xi and a friend “would hang out all day,” Ms. Qian said. After fleeing their home, he, his mother and his siblings took refuge at the Central Party School, an academy for officials. “We grew up in a highly abnormal environment,” Li Xiaobing, a classmate at the August 1 School, recalled on a school alumni website. The purges, zealotry and mass strife that Mao unleashed during the Cultural Revolution left a lasting mark on every Chinese leader who has succeeded him. But Mr. Xi stands out because he is the first party chief from the generation of the Red Guards  —   the youths who served as Mao’s shock troops  —   and because he fell so far before beginning his trek to power, from a family in the party elite to an unmoored life as a teenage political pariah. Some of Mr. Xi’s critics argue that his experiences during the Cultural Revolution inform his authoritarian ways. But the imprint of that time was more complex than that, said Patricia M. Thornton, a professor at Oxford who is researching the Cultural Revolution and its legacy. Mr. Xi’s generation venerated Mao, she said, but his family suffered in the violence that Mao unleashed, and Mr. Xi’s outlook is rooted in an elitist rejection of that turmoil. “Xi got to see both sides of that time, which is one reason I think he’s such an interesting character,” she said, “but that’s also why he’s so difficult to read. ” Unlike some youths from elite backgrounds, Mr. Xi did not turn against the party or Mao, but learned to revere strict order and abhor challenges to hierarchy, said Yongyi Song, a historian and librarian in Los Angeles who has long studied the Cultural Revolution. “He suffered much under Mao,” Mr. Song said, “but I think that actually increased his belief that those who are ‘born red,’ those children of the party elite, earned the right to inherit Mao’s place at the center. ” At the August 1 School, Mr. Xi and other students were expected to be exemplary servants of the socialist revolution. “We took the children to clean out latrines, and they did a really fine job,” a former teacher, Tang Yuhua, said in an interview for the school alumni association. “The children of officials did what they were told. ” One of Mr. Xi’s teachers, Chen Qiuying, recalled him as a studious, elaborately polite boy who was fond of Du Fu, an ancient Chinese poet. He had a “very steady, kind personality,” she said in an interview published in Hong Kong. But Mr. Xi and his brothers and sisters were vulnerable when the Cultural Revolution began because Mao had turned on their father, Xi Zhongxun, a revolutionary veteran and vice premier, four years earlier. He lost his post and was sent to work in a factory in central China, while his wife, Qi Xin, kept her job as a party cadre in Beijing. Many of the first Red Guards who embraced Mao’s call in August 1966 to purge society of ideological enemies and traitors were the children of party officials. But Mr. Xi could not join them because he was too young and had been tainted by his father’s fall. Instead, he became a target of abuse, Ms. Chen said. “He told me of one incident, in which a primary school sports teacher with a very poor attitude bullied him when the wave of physical assaults in the Cultural Revolution was spreading,” she said. The sports teacher, she recalled, mocked him as “child of a black gang,” a term for toppled officials. Radicals accused students at the school of betraying Mao by defending their parents and privileges. A journal published by Red Guards described the school as “a cradle for pampering the sons of senior cadres” that had “bred a successor class of the bourgeoisie. ” Violence was encouraged and widespread. In August and September of 1966, nearly 1, 800 people died in attacks across Beijing, according to party estimates issued in 1980. Mr. Xi lost an elder sister, Xi Heping, his father’s first daughter through an earlier marriage. Official accounts say she was “persecuted to death,” leaving out details, but a historian familiar with the party elite who spoke on condition of anonymity said she probably had taken her own life under duress, as many targeted by the Red Guards did in those years. Mr. Xi’s father, exiled in central China, was seized by Red Guards, who took him to Xi’an, a city in northwest China. There they paraded him around on a truck, beat and interrogated him, and made outlandish accusations that he had used a secret radio set in his home for clandestine foreign contacts. As the Cultural Revolution spiraled into mayhem, Mr. Xi learned to fend for himself. “We were the ‘blackest’ in the class, and the others all despised us,” recalled Nie Weiping, a classmate at the No. 25 School whose father had also been purged. “They wouldn’t come near us, and we also despised them. ” One day, he, Mr. Xi and another teenage friend with a purged father, Liu Weiping, were among a large group ambushed by radical Red Guards outside a school hall. “Hundreds of them came rushing out, waving clubs and yelling, and they beat whomever they saw,” Mr. Nie said in a memoir. “Xi Jinping and I moved fast and escaped,” he said, “but Liu Weiping ran a step slower, and almost suffered a concussion from a beating. ” In the interview published in 2000, when he was still a provincial official, Mr. Xi recalled being singled out and detained by the radicals because of his refusal to yield. “They all believed I was a leader,” he said. “They asked me how bad I thought my crimes were,” he said. “I said that they should make a guess, was it enough to deserve being shot? They said it would be enough to be shot 100 times over. I thought, what was the difference between being shot once and 100 times?” “Afterwards,” he added, “I recited the thoughts of Chairman Mao every day late into the night. ” At one point, militants paraded Mr. Xi and five adults on a stage before a rally, according to an associate of Mr. Xi’s father, Yang Ping, citing conversations with the father and family. Mr. Xi had to use both hands to hold up the   metal hat he was made to wear. “The mother had no choice but to go to the struggle session and sat below the stage,” Mr. Yang wrote. “When they yelled, ‘Down with Xi Jinping!’ on the stage, his mother was forced to raise her arm and shout the slogan along with everyone. ” By late 1968, Mr. Xi’s record of defiance was enough that he was ordered to a juvenile detention center for the children of purged officials. But he was spared imprisonment after Mao issued a call for urban youths to go to the countryside. He did not see his father again until 1972, when Premier Zhou Enlai arranged a family reunion. The father, battered and disoriented after years of isolation and interrogation, “looked at his two grown boys, and totally failed to recognize them,” according to his father’s biography, citing an interview with Mr. Xi. The older man wept, and Mr. Xi offered him a cigarette. “He asked me, ‘How come you also smoke? ’” Mr. Xi said. “I said: ‘I’m depressed. We’ve also made it through tough times over these years.’ “He went quiet for a moment and said, ‘I grant you approval to smoke. ’”",0

9812,Democrats Are Going Back Into Florida With Millions Of Dollars To Retire Marco Rubio,"By Jason Easley   5:35 pm A Democratic super PAC is injecting millions of dollars into the Florida Senate race in a bid to retire Sen. Marco Rubio.   
A Democratic super PAC is injecting millions of dollars into the Florida Senate race in a bid to retire Sen. Marco Rubio. 
CNN reported that Harry Reid’s super PAC, the Senate Majority PAC, is injecting millions of dollars into the Florida Senate race to help Rep. Patrick Murphy in his bid to defeat Marco Rubio: “This race is closing,” spokesman Shripal Shah told CNN. “Voters know that Marco Rubio is only looking out for himself and they’re going to hold him accountable for pushing a self-serving agenda at their expense.” 
“This afternoon Senate Majority PAC made a seven-figure transfer to Floridians for a Strong Middle Class, a Florida based Super PAC supporting Patrick Murphy’s campaign. The move comes hours after Senate Majority PAC announced a record fundraising haul — $19.3 million — covering the pre-general reporting period (October 1st thru 19th) that will be filed with the FEC today.” 
Democrats have been divided over the strategy for handling the Florida race. Sen. Chuck Schumer canceled future spending in Florida to direct resources into Senate races in North Carolina, Indiana, and Missouri. Reid sees an opportunity to knock out Rubio and eliminate him from presidential contention in 2020. 
The retiring Senate Democratic leader has been loudly urging Democrats to spend big in Florida to end Rubio’s national political career. 
According to Harry Enten at FiveThirtyEight , the polling suggests that pulling out of Florida is probably the right move for Democrats, but with cash to burn and a shot to beat Rubio, there is a case to be made for more spending. 
Democrats on the ground wanted in Florida wanted more spending on the Senate race, and they’ve gotten their wish thanks to Sen. Harry Reid.",0
9813,Why You Should Pay Attention to the Anti-Trump Riots and How to Prepare,"
Outbreak of Violent Riots A number of riots have broken out in Los Angeles, Oakland, Portland, Austin and Manhattan following the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency. One anti-Trump protester in Los Angeles is quoted in a CNN interview saying, “ People have to die ” and graffiti on a monument in New Orleans reads “ DIE WHITES DIE ” in response to Trump’s election. Rioters are breaking windows of businesses, looting stores, lighting trash cans on fire, shooting flares and brutalizing people who might support Trump or disagree with their violent leftist ideology.
Shortly after midnight on Wednesday morning, a female driver in Oakland was hit by another car on the highway, and when she pulled over to the right shoulder, a group of anti-Trump rioters surrounded her car, broke the back window and she sustained multiple serious injuries. A shocking video which surfaced Thursday shows a man in Chicago being ripped from his car and brutally attacked by multiple anti-Trump agitators who are seen punching and kicking him in the head as one steals his car, dragging the man as he hangs onto the back left window. Many believe this is the handywork of financier George Soros who has funded multiple uprisings in recent years. What we can all agree on is this is worse than a zombie apocalypse; this epidemic of hate and criminal behavior will only lead to more unrest if allowed to grow.
At times like these, it is more important than ever to ensure that you have the knowledge and ability to defend yourself and your loved ones from threats that may come at the most unexpected times, possibly when you are stuck in traffic and physically unable to get away from violent degenerates who may be at your window seeking to cause you harm.
Situational Awareness Let’s start with your general state of awareness in your day-to-day life. It is an unfortunate truth that many place themselves in needlessly volatile situations by not paying close attention to risks that they could face in their immediate surroundings, be it during simple daily tasks, like operating a vehicle or working around heavy machinery, or the more imminent threat of violent agitators that are now filling the streets in major cities, many of whom seek to cause damage to your property and/or harm to you and your loved ones. Utilizing techniques of avoidance, risk reduction, de-escalation and general situational awareness is essential to your survival.
How to Use Cooper’s Color Codes A scale of situational awareness called Cooper’s Color Codes, named after Colonel Jeff Cooper’s combat preparedness methods, is often used in firearms training for situational awareness. The four colors are used as a measure of the degree of situational awareness which an individual may reach at any given point in the day.
White — In condition white, your state of awareness is one that is relaxed and largely unaware of your surroundings. Generally, the only time a person should be in condition White is if he or she is asleep or somehow incapacitated.
Yellow — In condition yellow, you may be relaxed, but you have a heightened sense of awareness for who is around you and what noises and movements occur in your vicinity. You are not captivated by a cell phone screen; you are keeping track of who is behind or near you, especially when near a crowd. This awareness is in no way a paranoia; it is a general sense of awareness for threats to the safety of you and your loved ones.
Orange — In condition orange, you have identified something that is likely to cause harm, and you are focused in on a particular person or situation that poses a threat. This means that should an attack of any kind occur, you would be expecting this and ready for it at this stage.
Red — In condition red, you know that there is an immediate threat in your presence. However, this is not necessarily the point at which one who is armed would fire upon a target. Instead, this is the point where one who is armed may draw their firearm and make commands for an attacker to stop what they are doing. It is important to take steps to de-escalate at all cost, there is no reason to use deadly force if a situation can be solved without it.
Those who carry firearms, especially those who open-carry where concealed carry is criminalized, are obligated to have a heightened situational awareness at all times because any person who gets within arms reach could possibly attempt to take the firearm from them. On a number of occasions, concealed carry holders have stopped attempted robberies by merely maintaining a condition Yellow situational awareness and being prepared to draw their firearm in the moments they had as the gunman turned away from them. Many who seek to cause you harm are not expecting you to be prepared to fight back, and they will run when they see that you are prepared to defend yourself.
Weapons of Opportunity While firearms are effective tools of self-defense, they are not always available, and sometimes they are not practical; for this reason, it is important to consider keeping weapons of opportunity on your person, in your vehicle and even in your workplace. A weapon of opportunity is an everyday object that could be used as a defensive weapon if needed. Having situational awareness only becomes truly effective when you have the tools of defense at your disposal. Various weapons of opportunity are likely sitting all around your home and workplace; these are the heavy or sharp objects that can be grabbed at a moments notice, like a pen, key, belt or even a coffee mug. Various weapons of opportunity for your vehicle could be a crescent wrench, tire iron, lug wrench or crow bar. Make sure to check your local laws as there have been individuals who have been prosecuted for carrying opportune weapons like a baseball bat, but they had no substantiating evidence, like a baseball glove or ball, to show that they meant to use the item for its intended use.
Why Gun Control Kills In some states, like California and New York, there have been such extreme gun control measures that non-violent people have been prohibited from carrying firearms for self-defense. This means that non-criminals are treated the same as convicted felons in these states; this only endangers lives and forces well-to-do people into vulnerable positions in which they become defenseless targets of murderers and thieves, and as we see today, individuals are being taken out of their cars and brutalized by anti-Trump rioters, like in Chicago, on of the most anti-gun cities in the country. Laws have not stopped the illegal acquisition of firearms, but they have caused many peaceful people to be victimized by criminals, and it’s time that this bureaucratic overreach is reversed.
Reestablishing the foundations of self-defense and self-sufficiency in our society will require that we maintain awareness of threats to life and liberty and that we keep the tools of defense close by our side, ready to be used when the worst happens.

9815,U.S. Warns North Carolina That Transgender Bill Violates Civil Rights Laws - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The Justice Department warned the State of North Carolina on Wednesday that its new law limiting bathroom access violated the civil rights of transgender people, a finding that could mean millions of dollars in lost federal funds. In a letter to Gov. Pat McCrory, Vanita Gupta, the top civil rights lawyer for the Justice Department, said that “both you and the State of North Carolina” were in violation of civil rights law, and gave him until Monday to decide “whether you will remedy these violations. ” A Justice Department official said that federal officials hoped that the state would agree to comply voluntarily with federal civil rights law by abandoning the measure. But the department has a number of tools it can use to try to force compliance, including denying federal funds or asking a court to do so, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The ultimatum escalated a contentious national debate over North Carolina’s new legal stance on transgender and gay people, and set up what could be a lengthy showdown between the state and the Obama administration. In a statement, Mr. McCrory, a Republican, said: “The right and expectation of privacy in one of the most private areas of our personal lives is now in jeopardy. We will be reviewing to determine the next steps. ” Phil Berger, the president pro tempore of the State Senate, accused the Justice Department of “a gross overreach” that he said “deserves to be struck down in federal court. ” Tim Moore, the speaker of the House, called the letter an attempt to “circumvent the will of the electorate and instead unilaterally exert its extreme agenda. ” The state measure, House Bill 2, known as HB2, was signed into law in March and says the bathroom a person uses is determined by his or her biological gender at birth. That requirement “is facially discriminatory against transgender employees” because it treats them differently from other employees, Ms. Gupta wrote. As a result, “we have concluded that in violation of Title VII, the state is engaged in a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of Title VII right by employees of public agencies,” she said. The letter was first reported by The Charlotte Observer. The law has become an issue in the presidential campaign and has prompted boycotts of North Carolina from celebrities like Bruce Springsteen, as well as calls for repeal by a number of businesses, some of which have canceled plans to create new jobs in the state. Opponents cheered the Justice Department’s move. “I think it makes clear what we’ve known all along, which is that HB2 is deeply discriminatory and violates civil rights law in all kinds of manners,” said State Representative Chris Sgro of Greensboro. Matt McTighe, executive director of Freedom for All Americans, an L. G. B. T. rights group, said in a statement Wednesday that “actions have consequences, and Governor McCrory and his legislative allies are now paying the price for this   law that they so hurriedly enacted. “HB2 is a solution in a search of a problem that simply doesn’t exist, and lawmakers must take immediate action to fully repeal it,” he said. “The state’s economy and reputation have suffered enough, and now students all across the state stand to lose out on nearly $1 billion in critical funding because of HB2. The livelihoods of North Carolina’s families are at stake, and there is no excuse for inaction. ” In December 2014, the attorney general at the time, Eric H. Holder Jr. directed the Justice Department to begin including gender identity  —   including transgender status  —   as a basis for discrimination claims under federal civil rights law. That decision reversed a policy at the Justice Department that specifically excluded transgender people from federal protection. Mr. Holder called the decision “an important shift,” meant to affirm the Justice Department’s commitment “to protecting the civil rights of all Americans. ” In addition, the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission held last year that “equal access to restrooms is a significant, basic condition of employment” and that denying access to transgender individuals was discriminatory, Ms. Gupta noted, in her letter to Mr. McCrory. The Justice Department’s threat was not the only front opened Wednesday in the battle over transgender bathroom rights. In Illinois, a group calling itself Students and Parents for Privacy filed a lawsuit against the Department of Education, the Justice Department, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch and the school directors of Township High School District 211 in Cook County, Ill. seeking to stop the district from “forcing   to    girls to use locker rooms and restrooms with biological males. ” In November, federal education authorities ruled that the school district, near Chicago, violated Title IX, the federal law that forbids discrimination on the basis of sex in public education, when it did not allow a transgender student who said she identifies as a girl to change and shower in the girls’ locker room without restrictions. The fact that the student, who is biologically male, now uses the bathroom and locker rooms at William Fremd High School, the lawsuit states, creates an “intimidating and hostile environment” for girls, according to the lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday in the United States District Court in the Northern District of Illinois. The suit also asks the court to set aside a Department of Education rule in which transgender students are covered under Title IX. Meanwhile, in Oxford, Ala. the City Council on Wednesday rescinded an ordinance it had passed the week before that forbade people to use a public restroom that did not match their gender at birth, according to the Alabama news website al. com. The news service reported that at least one of the three members who voted to rescind the ordinance in the   vote was influenced by a city attorney’s opinion that the ordinance might be illegal under Title IX.",0
9816,WH Press Secretary Sean Spicer Blasts Media’s ’Deliberately False Reporting’ - Breitbart,"White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer held an emergency press briefing on Saturday where he lit into the media for their “egregious” and “deliberately false reporting” of Friday’s inauguration of President Donald Trump and his first day in office.[  “Some members of the media were engaged in deliberately false reporting,” Spicer said. He explained that one reporter “falsely tweeted out that the bust of Martin Luther King, Jr. had been removed form the Oval Office  …     This was just plain wrong. ”  The false report, which Spicer described as “irresponsible and reckless,” came from TIME magazine pool reporter Zeke Miller: Tweeting again: wh aide confirms the MLK bust is still there.

He added, it was the first time in the nation’s history that white floor coverings had been used to protect the grass and that they amplified empty spaces, whereas the grass had minimized the appearance of spaces in the past.  “Inaccurate numbers regarding crowd size were also tweeted,” Spicer said. “No one had numbers, because the National Park Service, which controls the National Mall does not put any out. ” He said this also applies to any attempts to count the numbers of protesters during the “Women’s March” on Saturday.   “There’s been a lot of talk in the media about holding President Trump accountable. Well, I’m here to tell you that it goes two ways. We’re going to hold the press accountable as well. The American people deserve better,” Spicer said. “And as long as he serves as the messenger of this incredible movement, he will take this message directly to the American people where his focus will always be. ”  Spicer’s criticism of the media’s fake news reporting resulted in a media meltdown on social media.

9817,JPMorgan Pays $264 Million Fine For Bribing Chinese Officials,"JPMorgan is, once again, paying money out to federal regulators for its chronic criminal activity. The latest payment of $264 million comes after it was discovered that the Too Big To Fail/Jail bank hired the relatives of Chinese government officials to win business in China—a clear violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). 
According to the Department of Justice, JPMorgan will pay a $72 million criminal penalty to the Department of Justice, a civil penalty of $61.9 million assessed by the Federal Reserve, and a $130.5 million disgorgement to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for a total of $264.4 million in fines. 
In its statement, the SEC claimed “investment bankers at JPMorgan’s subsidiary in Asia created a client referral hiring program that bypassed the firm’s normal hiring process and rewarded job candidates referred by client executives and influential government officials with well-paying, career-building JPMorgan employment. During a seven-year period, JPMorgan hired approximately 100 interns and full-time employees at the request of foreign government officials, enabling the firm to win or retain business resulting in more than $100 million in revenues to JPMorgan.”
Amazingly, the corrupt practices were so common at JPMorgan that company executives used “Referral Hires vs Revenue” spreadsheets to show how the bribes were paying off. Not a single referral was denied, even though many of the children, relatives, and friends of the Chinese elite were not qualified for the jobs they received.
In fact, some of the hires were so incompetent they were referred to within JPMorgan as “photocopiers.” So much for meritocracy.
JPMorgan executives certainly knew they were violating FCPA, but the money was just too good. And, given the Justice Department’s track record of not prosecuting individual law breakers on Wall Street, what did they have to lose? JPMorgan’s criminality is pretty rational when analyzed fully.
While US regulators are happy to celebrate the fines, the Chinese government appears less-than-enthusiastic about diving into the scandal. The Financial Times speculates this may be because the Chinese anti-corruption authority, known as the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), has no idea where an investigation into the hiring program will take them. 
Given the large amount of Chinese government business steered JPMorgan’s way (over $100 million) it seems likely the Chinese officials involved are people of considerable influence. CCDI typically targets lower-level officials and, when it goes high, it has the support of the Communist Party, which is, after all, the ruling authority in China.
Like most countries, China does not have the ridiculous light touch for corruption that the US has. If cited for corruption in China, a government official or businessperson is likely to go to jail. JPMorgan has broken the law perpetually and has yet to face serious consequences, despite a new 2015 directive at the Justice Department to hold individual corporate executives accountable for wrongdoing.

9819,This Comment About Trump’s Win Will Make You THINK HARD About The Full Horror Of What Just Happened,"By Joe Clark Election 2016 , Politics , Racism November 9, 2016 This Comment About Trump’s Win Will Make You THINK HARD About The Full Horror Of What Just Happened   
On November 8, 2016, an almost evenly divided America made a consequential choice. 
And in the end, they chose to elect the least most qualified candidate in U.S. history to become the 45th President of the United States of America. 
However, one Twitter user said something so profound, that it should send a chill up the spine of any decent and rational American. The tweet said: 
“Our first black president will have to have over the White House to someone endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan. Just let that sink in.” Our first black president will have to hand over the White House to someone endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan. Just let that sink in. 
— Salon (@Salon) November 9, 2016 
Yes, we should all allow that sink in for a few moments. 
After the election, neo-Nazis, Alt-Righters, White Supremacists, and the Ku Klux Klan are all celebrating Trump’s election. 
Meanwhile, few, if any, minorities are doing the same, because they understand what his presidency will mean for their lives and the lives of their children. 
And while we can keep telling ourselves that “this is not who we are,” it’s important to recognize that it was that same denial that brought us to this point in our history. 
It’s time we took a hard look in the mirror and at the country we’ve created.

9820,L.A. #Resist Rally Will Replace Gay Pride Rally - Breitbart,"On Sunday, June 11, a “Resist March” against President Donald Trump will replace the Los Angeles Gay Pride Parade. [“When they come for one of us, they come for all of us. Join the Resistance at ResistMarch. org,” a banner on the march’s website reads.  According to a video on the website, posted by Canadian Indie pop twin Teagan and Sara, the march will start at “8 a. m. sharp” at the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue. “It’s time that we all stand together, as one, and resist. ” Southern California Public Radio (SCPR) reported that the march will end with the L. A. Pride festival in West Hollywood. Breitbart News previously reported that the annual Gay Pride parade had been canceled in favor of the Resist March. The festival will cause the shutdown of several major roads in West Hollywood, some of which have already been shut. SCPR noted that San Vicente Boulevard was closed between Santa Monica Boulevard and Melrose Avenue starting at 7 p. m. on Thursday, June 8, and that it will remain closed through 10 a. m. on Monday, June 12. Hollywood Boulevard will reportedly be closed off between La Brea and Highland Avenue as early as 6 a. m. through noon on Sunday. SCPR also noted that the following streets will be closed as early as 8 a. m. and will reopen as the “Resist” march passes through: In Charlotte, North Carolina, gay Trump supporters were denied in their effort to join the Gay Pride parade on a   float, according to the Associated Press.

9821,"As Iraqi Troops Near Mosul, Civilian Casualties Begin to Rise","Locals Caught in Crossfire Between Troops, ISIS   
While early fighting in Mosul was presented as comparatively easy by Iraqi officials, as the troops near the city, the fighting is starting to get more fierce, and the civilian population trapped in the area is increasingly caught in the crossfire . 
Increased fighting, and higher population density are a dangerous combination, and locals by and large are being prevented from fleeing the area. Unsurprisingly, this is leading to reports of a growing number of civilians killed and wounded in the area. 
This has the PR people going into high gear, trying to manage the narrative around the deaths, with Western and Iraq officials accusing ISIS of forcing civilians into the city to use as human shields, and preventing them from relocating outside the city. 
While some reports suggest this may be accurate, the US has also talked openly of conducting airstrikes against all “fighters” fleeing the city, which has led the Iraqi government to openly warn the civilian population of Mosul against fleeing , lest they get targeted as welll. 
Civilians getting mistaken for fleeing ISIS fighters has been an ongoing problem for the US, who killed hundreds of civilians around the Syrian city of Manbij in such mistakes. Manbij was a much smaller city than Mosul, which has a population of over a million people potentially in the line of fire.  ",0
9822,Wikileaks: Bill Clinton BOASTS of Hillary’s ‘Working Relationship’ with Muslim Brotherhood,"Posted on October 27, 2016 by Pamela Geller 
The bombshells about this criminal are now breaking daily. It’s not a question of Trump, it is an imperative that Hillary be defeated. If the people choose Hillary, then they must and will be punished. “Wikileaks: Bill Clinton Boasts of Hillary’s ‘Working Relationship’ with Muslim Brotherhood,” By John Hayward, Breitbart , October 26, 2016: 
In a speech Bill Clinton gave at the home of Mehul and Hema Sanghani in October 2015, revealed to the public for the first time by WikiLeaks, former President Bill Clinton touted Hillary Clinton’s “working relationship” with the Muslim Brotherhood’s Mohamed Morsi in Egypt as an example of her diplomatic skills.President Clinton also gave his wife a lot of credit for negotiating the Iran nuclear deal, in a passage that began with the standard Democrat “stuff happens” shrugging defense for foreign policy failures: 
Finally, we live in a world, as I said, that’s full of good news and bad news. The United States cannot control it all, but we need a president who’s most likely to make as many good things happen as possible, and most likely to prevent big, bad things from happening. You can’t keep every bad thing from happening; who’s most likely to be able to get people involved in a positive way. Even the people who don’t like the Iran nuclear agreement concede it never would have happened if it hadn’t been for the sanctions. Hillary negotiated those sanctions and got China and Russia to sign off – something I thought she’d never be able to do. I confess. I’m never surprised by anything she does, but that surprised me. I didn’t think she could do it. The Chinese and the Russians to see past their short-term self-interest to their long-term interest and not sparking another nuclear arms race. 
And when the Muslim Brotherhood took over in Egypt, in spite of the fact that we were (inaudible), she developed a working relationship with the then-president and went there and brokered a ceasefire to stop a full-scale shooting war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which on top of what was going on in Syria and the (inaudible) Jordan would have been a calamity for the world. 
And when we were trying to reset our relations with Russia under President Medvedev, she and her team negotiated a New START Treaty, which limits warheads and missiles. And she lobbied it through the Senate. She had to get 67 votes, which means a lot of these Republicans who say that they don’t like her now are just kidding for election season. They trusted her, and she got it passed. You can’t get 67 votes in the Senate without a lot of Republican support. And I don’t know about you, but with all this tension and Mr. Putin trying to affect the outcome of the conflict in Syria, I think it’s a very good thing that we’re in a lower risk of any kind of accidental nuclear conflict with the Russians. She did that. 
You’ll rarely find a more tortured political framing of the Iran debacle than Bill Clinton boasting that the sanctions Barack Obama lifted were super-awesome, as even those who don’t think those sanctions should have been lifted agree. 
Mr. Clinton’s version of the Iran sanctions leaves out a few details , such as Russia’s keen financial interest in keeping Iranian energy out of the European market, and China’s desire to use Iran sanctions as a geopolitical bargaining chip. 
But the part about the Muslim Brotherhood is most interesting. If anything, he is selling Hillary Clinton’s “working relationship” with Egyptian Islamists short, because she used American diplomatic leverage for Morsi’s benefit even before he got elected, warning Egyptians about “backtracking” to a military regime at a key moment of the post-Mubarak campaign, when Morsi was running against a former member of Hosni Mubarak’s military. There have long been rumors that more subtle forms of U.S. “ pressure ” were used to secure Morsi’s office, as well. 
Then again, in public pronouncements, Clinton called Hosni Mubarak’s tottering regime “stable” and cautioned her Obama Administration colleagues against “pushing a longtime partner out the door.” 
A few days ago, declassified State Department documents revealed Clinton’s talking points for a 2012 meeting with Morsi hailed his election as a “milestone in Egypt’s transition to democracy,” and stated that she was to offer the Muslim Brotherhood leader “technical expertise and assistance from both the U.S. government and private sector to support his economic and social programs.” 
Clinton was also supposed to privately offer Morsi assistance with his police and security forces, which would be conducted “quite discreetly.” 
After Morsi was gone, she declared herself exasperated with Egyptian political culture and declared herself a cynical “realist.” That is pretty much the opposite of what everyone in the Obama Administration was saying while the “Arab Spring” was in the midst of springing its little surprises on autocratic but America-aligned (or at least America-fearing) regimes, which we were all supposed to feel guilty about selfishly supporting for so long. 
As for Clinton’s superb working relationship with Morsi, that eventually ended with Morsi’s wife railing against Clinton for supposedly dismissing him as “a simpleton who was unfit for the presidency,” and threatening to publish letters from Clinton to Morsi that would damage the former U.S. Secretary of State. Meanwhile, Mohammed Morsi is developing a solid working relationship with the Egyptian penitentiary system . 
Egypt has one of those icky military governments again, and while it won’t have fond memories of Hillary Clinton’s support for the Muslim Brotherhood regime, it will most likely work with whoever wins the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Therefore, a prospective President Hillary Clinton probably won’t suffer too much from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s appalling lapses in judgment.

9823,‘Loving’ Aims to Speak Softly to History - The New York Times,"If history is written by the victors, it is typically filmed by the   crowd pleasers. Whether Hollywood histories chronicle the exploits of brave gladiators, courageous soldiers or noble civilians, they almost always exalt the past in a similar cinematic register, with soaring speeches, swelling strings, sweeping montages, thrilling fights and breathless romances. When the filmmaker Jeff Nichols (“Take Shelter,” “Midnight Special”) was writing the spare, understated script for his new drama, “Loving,” he knew that his quiet approach was unusual, particularly for a film about a historical subject so well suited to the fall’s noisy film awards circuit. In 1958, Mildred Jeter and Richard Loving, an interracial couple, were married in Washington, D. C. A short time later, back home in Virginia, the pregnant Mrs. Loving and her new husband, a bricklayer, were yanked out of their bed by police enforcing the state’s Racial Integrity Act, which prohibited interracial marriage. They were arrested and ordered by a judge to dissolve their union or leave the state for 25 years. For nearly a decade, the Lovings persevered, until the 1967 Supreme Court case, Loving v. Virginia, struck down   laws. The Lovings’ case remade American history, yet Mr. Nichols described the emotional peak of the film as, “a man coming home and crying on the edge of the bed because he can’t take care of his wife. ” He spoke in his Arkansas drawl over lunch at a downtown Manhattan restaurant: “That’s what I’m giving people as a climax? But it’s so true and that’s what’s so crushing. That guy was good at one thing: going out and building a brick wall. That should have been enough. ” The film, starring Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga as the couple, has received some of the year’s best reviews for its deliberate restraint. “There are few movies that speak to the American moment as movingly  —   and with as much idealism,” The New York Times critic Manohla Dargis wrote, adding that the “insistent, quotidian quiet of ‘Loving’ can feel so startling. ” In part, that quietness emerged after Mr. Nichols watched Nancy Buirski’s intimate documentary “The Loving Story” and hours of archival footage of the couple. He was struck by Mildred’s polite dignity and Richard’s taciturn silence. When he learned that the Lovings opted not to attend the Supreme Court on the day of the ruling but instead receive the news by phone, he said his   approach came into focus. “Immediately I saw that end scene, which may or may not represent reality: Richard playing with his kids on the lawn and not saying anything,” Mr. Nichols said. He was aware enough of the danger of such a contrarian choice that he called his producers at Big Beach to warn them, or at least temper their expectations. “I remember saying, ‘I don’t think this is going to be ‘The Help,’ though ‘The Help’ made a lot of money and got nominated for a lot of Oscars,” he said. “I guess I must have known we were taking a risk in its execution but I never thought there was another way. ” However, when Mr. Nichols was looking for financing, he met one investor who was not so confident. “He’d shown the script to his bigwig boss who said, ‘I just don’t get it. It’s like a courtroom drama without the courtroom,’” he said. When this financier asked Mr. Nichols if he could “punch it up,” Mr. Nichols said he launched into the sort of rebellious speech that is absent in his film. “What you need to worry about right now is not whether I’m going to punch up this script so you can be involved,” he recalled saying. “What you need to be worried about is how I will ever come back to work with you guys ever again because that is the most simplistic, stupid response I’ve heard. ” Peter Saraf, a Big Beach producer on the film, said that the production company knew what it was getting into. “Jeff’s idea was to tell the story from Richard and Mildred’s point of view and stick to it,” he said. “You can’t commit to that and then say oh, but we need the big courtroom moment with the gavel falling. ” Showtime’s 1996 movie “Mr. and Mrs. Loving,” produced with Hallmark Entertainment and starring Timothy Hutton and Lela Rochon, hit more predictable beats and portrayed Richard as more charming and garrulous. But Mr. Edgerton said in a telephone interview that he was drawn to Mr. Nichols’s version of the character, who was, “just shut down and emasculated and weathered by this situation,” he said, and more in keeping with the man in the documentary footage. “Every year in Hollywood, true stories get made and we feel the need to renovate them, and suit them up,” Mr. Edgerton said, then continued: “That’s legitimate sometimes. But to make Richard more articulate or defiant or to place him in that courtroom would have negated the idea of trying to tell a true story truthfully. ” Or as Ms. Negga put it, when discussing her character on the phone, “It would have been really unfaithful and quite grotesque to have made her any different. ” Though the two stars have been nominated for Gotham Independent Film Awards, one of the many ceremonies that make up Academy Award season, they will not have the explosive reels of other, often more famous, contenders. In today’s market, quiet adult dramas don’t sell themselves, and reviews only go so far. So Mr. Nichols, who notes that he is “not a filmmaker who wants to operate in obscurity,” and his cast have been busy selling the film in a way that might have mortified the Lovings. “If Mildred were alive now, I don’t think she’d want to do any junkets, any of this nonsense, any of this hoopla,” said Ms. Negga, on a day in which she joked that she had done 782 interviews. “And there’s not much that would have terrified Richard more. ” Mr. Nichols initially objected when the film’s domestic distributor, Focus Features, wanted to use the movie’s few memorable lines in the trailer, including, “We may lose the small battles but win the big war. ” (As Mr. Edgerton said, “Mildred didn’t talk much but when she did it was kind of worth quoting. ”) Then he relented. “This film doesn’t speak with the histrionics of other potential award contenders, but it does fit into the frame of the award season and that’s still how they’re going to cut the trailer,” he said. “The    is just to get people into the theater. I get it. My hope is that people will go see the movie maybe expecting one thing but maybe pleased it’s something else. ” Mr. Nichols, polishing off his steak and fries along with his fifth of the day’s seven interviews, said that in the thundering horse race of the Oscar season: “‘Loving’ is not even a horse. We are a whole other animal. ”",0

Posted by Elliot Bougis | Nov 16, 2016 | Breaking News Just when you thought it was safe to go back on the Internet… 
I have been reporting for weeks now about the D.C.-based “pizza pedophilia” ring that is being exposed based on thousands of “Podesta emails” released by Wikileaks in the past month or two. 
As of last week, the case became even more explosive. 
— Thomas Bernpaine (@ThomasBernpaine) November 11, 2016 
Now, don’t get nervous because it looks like computer mumbo-jumbo. You only need to remember two things. 
1 –Every picture file is actually a code/pattern of numbers that our computers “translate” into images on the screen. 
2 – Some “extra” information has been discovered in at least one picture code/pattern from a Wikileaks email. 
I reported weeks ago about this “pedo ring” something called “photo steganography,” which is just the fancy term for the two points I explained just now. 
The image (.jpg) of the two girls eating pizza was discovered as an attachment in the Podesta emails by Wikileaks. Data can be hidden in a .jpg file. In that image, a zipped directory (PK) was hidden inside. That doesn’t happen by accident. The directory likely contains illegal imagery and/or discussion. It is highly suggestive of illegal activity connected to child pornography, child exploitation, and child abuse. 
Some have objected that the pizza.jpg file size is simply too small to contain any useful data (like an image, a link, a message, etc.), but the point is this: all the file would have to “smuggle” is a short password to open a secret website or .zip file. The hidden data could literally just be a few bits of information but it could open up thousands of gigabytes of data in the right website or compressed file. That’s how the users would access the dirty pictures, videos, messages, etc. 
So, from a technical angle, this method is very possible, and it makes sense of why the Podesta emails include so many strange photo attachments. Are all those attachments little “Trojan ponies” for sharing images, videos, passwords, payment resources, etc.? 
WATCH (Language/NSFW Warning): “Why do we even have an FBI? Is the FBI just covering for these people?” 
Let me be honest: 
I have researched corruption cases like this for many years, whether in current events or from historical records. So, I believe I have a somewhat thick skin when it comes to facing human sinfulness and evil like this. 
Last Friday night, however, I won’t lie: I totally lost it. 
All of a sudden, too many lightbulbs went off at once, too many connections hit me at once, too many implications dawned on me at once–and I just went into a kind of panic attack about how massive this whole cartel is, how well protected it is, and how truly destructive it is in real children’s lives. 
If you want to get an idea of what set me off, let me show you three images. 
BUT I WARN YOU: When you understand the context, these images are EXTREMELY DISTURBING. 
First, here is a photo of Tony Podesta’s favorite work of art in his home: 
Tony Podesta is a big fan of “The Arch of Hysteria” 
Next, here is an ad from Ping Pong Pizza, a restaurant in D.C. that has numerous, very disturbing connections to pedophilia and D.C. elites like the Podestas. Another “arch of hysteria”? 
Next we come to a police photo from the Jeffrey Dahmer case. 
VIEWER DISCRETION ADVISED: 
I wonder if Tony Podesta would also like this “arch of hysteria”… 
Finally, here is the logo for Comet Pizza, another D.C. restaurant with deep connections to Ping Pong Pizza and the Podestas. Can you see now why I “lost my [bleep]” last Friday? 
Worse, in terms of how protected this satanic ring of perverts is, I recently reported that even the DOJ is compromised . 
A man named Arun Rao has shown a disturbing interest in some sexually “creepy” images and expressions that are connected to the Podestas and this pedo ring. The problem is that Rao is an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the DOJ. 
Specifically, Rao is Supervisor of the Southern (“Greenbelt”) Division office for the DOJ’s District of Maryland in Chevy Chase, Maryland. This means that Rao’s district is virtually on top of the area in D.C. where Besta Pizza operates. In addition, Besta Pizza and two other associated properties are directly over abandoned underground tunnels, many of which could easily connect to Chevy Chase. 
On top of his social and geographical proximity to Alefantis, Rao’s DOJ division handles cases that seem tailor-made for busting—or covering up—the dark circles that sex traffickers hide in: federal racketeering, conspiracy, national and international fraud and corruption, immigration violations, counterfeiting, and —wait for it—child pornography . 
In closing I will leave you with three “infographics.” 
They are very complicated and “dense” so I don’t expect everyone to examine them. 
However, even if you don’t look into the details yourself, I want you to be aware of how vast this whole network of evil is, and, therefore, of how many hands and prayers we need on deck to expose it and bring it down.

First, a diagram of “key players” in the pizza restaurant side of the pedo ring. You can see the diagram for yourself here . 
Second, a much larger diagram of how this pizza-pedo ring connects to international kidnapping (esp. the Madeleine McCann case) and other DNC allies like “spirit cooker” Marina Abramovic. 
Finally, a truly massive diagram of connections that implicate nations and leaders around the world, and put the sex trafficking cartel in the context of a global network of drug dealers, slave traders, murderers, and media elites.

9825,Megalithic Site in India is Oldest Ancient Observatory in South Asia,"27 OCTOBER, 2016 by NATALIA KLIMCZAK 
A remarkable 7,000-year-old megalithic site that served as an astronomical observatory has been found in Muduma village in Telangana, India. The discovery has been hailed as one of the most significant archaeological findings in India over the last few decades. 
According to Times of India , the team of archeologists described it as ”the only megalithic site in India, where a depiction of a star constellation has been identified”. The ancient observatory dates to 5,000 BC and the researchers believe that it is the earliest astronomical observatory discovered in India and perhaps even in the whole of South Asia. 
The site consists of around 80 huge menhirs (standing stones), which are 3.5 – 4 meters tall. There are also about 2000 alignment stones, which are 30-60cm tall. According to experts, no other excavation site in India has so many menhirs concentrated in such a small area. The maximum concentration of menhirs is located in the central portion of the monument. The large standing stones that form an observatory in Telangana, India ( Satya Vijayi ) 
One of the surprising details discovered at the site is a depiction of the constellation known as Ursa Major, which is formed from small cup-sized pits carved into a standing stone. The group of about 30 cup-marks were arranged in the same shape in which Ursa Major can be observed in the night sky with the naked eye. The carving depicts not only the prominent seven starts, but also the peripheral stars too. 
Moreover, as ArcheoFeed.com reported: an “imaginary line drawn through the top two stars point to pole star or the North Star”. 
Researchers believe that the site still holds many secrets. The next planned research will take a place in December led by archeologists from Korea. The constellation Ursa Major as it can be seen by the unaided eye ( public domain ) 
Numerous prehistoric observatories have already been discovered around the world, including Peru, Britain and Armenia. Thousands of years ago people were trying to understand the sky and were often using their observations to make predictions for agricultural and ceremonial purposes. The site Zorats Karer from Armenia dates back to the same period as the observatory from India. As Natalia Klimczak from Ancient Origins wrote : 
“Zorats Karer is also known as Carahunge, Karahunj, Qarahunj. It is located in an area of around 7 hectares and covers the site nearby the Dar river canyon, close to the city of Sisan. The ancient site is often called the ”Armenian Stonehenge”, but the truth of what it is may be even more fascinating. According to researchers, Zorats Karer could be among the world’s oldest astronomical observatories, and is at least 3,500 years older than British Stonehenge. The site was rediscovered in 1984 by a team led by researcher Onik Khnkikyan. After a few months of work, Khnkikyan concluded that the site of Zorats Karer must have been an observatory. Moreover, with time, Armenian archeologists, astronomers and astrophysicists found that there were at least two other ancient sites important for prehistoric astronomy in the vicinity: Angeghakot and Metzamor.

In 1994, Zorats Karer was extensively analyzed by Professor Paris Herouni, a member of the Armenian National Academy of Science and President of the Radio Physics Research Institute in Yerevan. His expeditions revealed a great deal of fascinating information about the site. First of all, his team counted 223 stones, of which 84 were found to have holes. They measured the longitude, latitude and the magnetic deviation of the site. The researchers also created a topographical map of the monumental megalithic construction, which became the basis of further work. Finally, the main treasure of the site was unearthed – a collection of many impressive and unique astronomical objects. The researchers realized that several stones were used to make observations of the sun, moon and stars. They were located according to knowledge about the rising, culmination moments, and setting of the sun, moon and specific stars. The stones are basalt, somewhat protected by moss but smoothed by the rain and wind and full of holes and erosion. Many of the stones were damaged over time. 
In ancient times, the stones were shaped and arranged in what are known as the north and south arms, the central circle, the north-eastern alley, the separate standing system of circles and the chord. The stones are between 0.5 and 3 meters tall and weigh up to 10 tons. Some of them are related to burial cists.”

9826,Judge Approves Consent Decree to Overhaul Baltimore Police Dept. - The New York Times,"A federal judge approved a consent decree on Friday that would overhaul the Baltimore Police Department, days after the judge thwarted a Justice Department effort to delay a decision. The   agreement between the federal government and city leaders would introduce a wide range of police reforms, including training, new technology and community oversight. The agreement rose from a scathing 2016 Justice Department report that found systemic racial bias in the police department. “The talk is over,” Brandon Scott, a Baltimore city councilman who leads the Police Oversight Committee, said after the decision on Friday. “It’s time for us to handle our business. ” The approval came as a relief to supporters who feared the agreement might be delayed or canceled under the new presidential administration. The pact was signed on Jan. 12, eight days before Donald J. Trump was inaugurated. Its supporters knew President Trump and his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, would be less likely to support it. On Monday, the Justice Department sought a   delay so it could review all police reform agreements, including the one in Baltimore. But Judge James K. Bredar said Friday that he interpreted that request as the department’s trying to determine “whether it wants the court to enter the decree at all, or at least the current version of it. ” That opportunity had passed, he said. “The parties have already agreed to the draft before the court,” Judge Bredar wrote in his decision. “It would be extraordinary for the court to permit one side to unilaterally amend an agreement already jointly reached and signed. ” Mr. Sessions said in a statement that the decree “was negotiated during a rushed process by the previous administration and signed only days before they left office. ” “While the Department of Justice continues to fully support police reform in Baltimore, I have grave concerns that some provisions of this decree will reduce the lawful powers of the police department and result in a less safe city,” he said. He added that the agreement contained “clear departures from many proven principles of good policing that we fear will result in more crime. ” The Justice Department’s report found that the police in Baltimore, a city that is 63 percent black, disproportionately targeted black people, often for dubious reasons. The 2015 death of Freddie Gray, a      man, while in police custody led to violent riots. The   consent decree covers a wide range of reforms. It includes a requirement for officers to undergo 80 hours of training, including best practices on stopping, searching and arresting people, and technological upgrades like video cameras inside police vans. City leaders praised Judge Bredar’s decision to approve the agreement. Tessa   president of the Baltimore branch of the N. A. A. C. P. said on Friday that residents she had spoken to “really wanted this to go through,” and were worried the effort they had put into the agreement would be for naught. “For all of that just to fall apart because they didn’t want to go through with it would have hurt everybody,” she said. The city’s mayor, Catherine Pugh, said at a news conference that the decision was “a great victory for the citizens of Baltimore, as well as the Baltimore Police Department. ” The next step is most likely to be the federal appointment of an independent monitor who will ensure the city is adequately addressing bias complaints. “Until the independent court monitor is assigned, everything else is on hold,” said Mr. Scott, the councilman. In his statement, Mr. Sessions said the Justice Department “stands ready to work with Baltimore to fight violence crime and improve policing in the city. ”",0

9828,Hillary Clinton Is Set Back by Decision to Keep Illness Secret - The New York Times,"Shortly after receiving a diagnosis of pneumonia on Friday, Hillary Clinton decided to limit the information to her family members and close aides, certain that the illness was not a crucial issue for voters and that it might be twisted and exploited by her opponents, several advisers and allies said on Monday. To those she did inform, Mrs. Clinton was emphatic: She intended to “press on” with her campaign schedule, she said. Her confidants concluded that she did not want to be challenged over her preference to keep the pneumonia private and continue working. Mrs. Clinton’s inner circle was mindful of both her guardedness and her expectation of loyalty once her mind is made up. And she was optimistic that she could recover over the weekend, when she had only two brief events on her schedule, said the advisers and allies, who insisted on anonymity to disclose private conversations. But Mrs. Clinton’s penchant for privacy backfired. On Monday, her campaign scrambled to reassure voters about her health, a day after she grew visibly weak and was filmed being helped into a van: unsettling images that circulated widely and led her aides to disclose the pneumonia diagnosis two days after the fact. In a phone interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Monday night, Mrs. Clinton said she had kept her diagnosis a secret because “I just didn’t think it was going to be that big a deal,” and tried to shift the discussion to her Republican opponent, Donald J. Trump, and his lack of transparency. “It’s really past time for him to be held to the same standards,” she said. Mrs. Clinton’s aides acknowledged that they should have been more forthcoming and said she would release more details about her physical fitness and medical history this week, a concession to the political pressure that she is under because she chose not to reveal her diagnosis sooner. But the manner in which Mrs. Clinton’s illness became public has also revived concerns among supporters, and criticism among detractors, about her seemingly reflexive tendency to hunker down, often citing a “zone of privacy,” when she senses a political threat. Her desire for tight control over personal information deepened during the partisan wars of the 1990s, influenced her use of a private email server as secretary of state and now threatens to make her look, again, as though she has something to hide. “Usually you would think that the truth sets you free, but in the experiences that Hillary Clinton has lived through, that’s not necessarily accurate,” said Jay Jacobs, a Democratic Party leader in New York and close ally of the Clintons. Referring to 1990s investigations of the Clintons, he said: “Whether it’s Whitewater or Travelgate or other things, when the facts came out, it still didn’t solve the problem. They did nothing wrong, but there was still controversy. She is a very private person, and she would rather not put out information that she did not feel needed to be shared. ” The new onslaught of questions about her health and medical records has been deeply frustrating to Mrs. Clinton and her team, who have sought to highlight the disparity between her and Mr. Trump over issues of transparency. Mrs. Clinton has released her tax returns, while Mr. Trump has not. She has provided exhaustive details about her policy proposals, while he has not. And she released considerably more medical information last year  —   in a letter from her physician, Dr. Lisa R. Bardack  —   than Mr. Trump did in his doctor’s letter, which contained little more than    boasts about his “strength and stamina. ” Yet as much as they want the pressure to be on Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton and her advisers are now on the defensive. “She has been totally transparent on the important issues, including public policy ideas, far more than Trump,” said former Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, a longtime ally of Mrs. Clinton’s. “But there’s also a combination of a natural desire for privacy and the fear that information will be politically misused. ” Mrs. Clinton has long relied on a   intensely loyal group of aides who share her instincts for political warfare and her skepticism and even hostility toward calls for fuller disclosure. Some of these advisers, like Huma Abedin and Cheryl D. Mills, have worked with her since the 1990s, when Mrs. Clinton complained that a “vast   conspiracy” was targeting her and her husband, President Bill Clinton. Ms. Abedin and Ms. Mills were among those Mrs. Clinton told of her diagnosis on Friday. Neither replied to emails on Monday. Her campaign manager, Robby Mook, said Mrs. Clinton had not wanted her illness to deter her. “She just wanted to plow through it,” he told MSNBC, “and I think that’s part of what’s going to make her a great president. ” Most voters have not been moved by questions about Mrs. Clinton’s health: 74 percent of registered voters said they were unconcerned about her being healthy enough to carry out the job of president, a Fox News poll last month found. But trustworthiness is a glaring problem for Mrs. Clinton. Roughly six in 10 voters said they did not trust her, about the same percentage who said they distrusted Mr. Trump, according to a Washington   News poll released last week. Mrs. Clinton had several opportunities before Sunday to disclose that she had pneumonia, including one at a news conference on Friday where she discussed her plans to defeat the Islamic State, called for a rethinking of the Obama administration’s approach to North Korea and ridiculed Mr. Trump’s praise for the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. (At a   that night, Mrs. Clinton, known for more calibrated phrasings, loosely suggested that half of Mr. Trump’s supporters fell into a “basket of deplorables”  —   bigots of one kind or another, essentially. She apologized the next day.) On Sunday morning, when reporters learned that Mrs. Clinton had departed early from a ceremony in Lower Manhattan for the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, a campaign aide said only that she had been “overheated. ” It was not until more than five hours after the startling video surfaced online, showing an ailing Mrs. Clinton being helped into a van, that her campaign released a statement from Dr. Bardack saying Mrs. Clinton had been told she had pneumonia and put on antibiotics. The statement said she had become dehydrated and overheated at ground zero. The events quickly intensified pressure on both Mrs. Clinton, 68, and Mr. Trump, 70, to be more forthcoming about their health and medical histories. Mr. Trump has said he will release more medical information this week. But they also reinforced a central vulnerability for Mrs. Clinton that has nothing to do with physical  . “Antibiotics can take care of pneumonia. What’s the cure for an unhealthy penchant for privacy that repeatedly creates unnecessary problems?” David Axelrod, a former adviser to President Obama, wrote on Twitter. Clinton aides have ample reason to be careful on the subject of her health: Political opponents on the right have spread a variety of conspiracy theories insinuating that she is physically unfit for the presidency, and Mr. Trump has fanned those theories, repeatedly questioning her “stamina. ” After Mrs. Clinton had a coughing attack last week, Matt Drudge, editor of The Drudge Report, posted a spoof photo of her traveling press corps wearing surgical masks on her campaign plane. But on Monday, her campaign acknowledged its error. “We could have done better yesterday, but it is a fact that public knows more about HRC than any nominee in history,” Jennifer Palmieri, a spokeswoman, wrote on Twitter in response to Mr. Axelrod. Mrs. Clinton does not plan to return to the campaign trail until Thursday at the earliest, advisers said, and it is unclear how she and her doctor will respond to interview requests about her health. Late Monday, she expressed gratitude to  . “Like anyone who’s ever been home sick from work, I’m just anxious to get back out there. See you on the trail soon,” she said on Twitter, signing her post “H” to indicate that she had written it herself.",0
9829,How a $2 Roadside Drug Test Sends Innocent People to Jail - The New York Times,"Amy Albritton can’t remember if her boyfriend signaled when he changed lanes late that August afternoon in 2010. But suddenly the lights on the Houston Police patrol car were flashing behind them, and Anthony Wilson was navigating Albritton’s white Chrysler Concorde to a stop in a   parking lot. It was an especially unwelcome hassle. Wilson was in Houston to see about an   job Albritton, volunteering her car, had come along for what she imagined would be a vacation of sorts. She managed an apartment complex back in Monroe, La. and the younger of her two sons  —   Landon, 16, who had been disabled from birth by cerebral palsy  —   was with his father for the week. After five hours of driving through the monotony of flat woodland, the couple had checked into a motel, carted their luggage to the room and returned to the car, too hungry to rest but too drained to seek out anything more than fast food. Now two officers stepped out of their patrol car and approached. Albritton, 43, had dressed up for the trip  —   black blouse, turquoise necklace, small silver hoop earrings glinting through her   blond hair. Wilson, 28, was more casually dressed, in a white   and jeans, and wore a strained expression that worried Albritton. One officer asked him for his license and registration. Wilson said he didn’t have a license. The car’s registration showed that it belonged to Albritton. The officer asked Wilson to step out of the car. Wilson complied. The officer leaned in over the driver’s seat, looked around, then called to his partner in the report Officer Duc Nguyen later filed, he wrote that he saw a needle in the car’s ceiling lining. Albritton didn’t know what he was talking about. Before she could protest, Officer David Helms had come around to her window and was asking for consent to search the car. If Albritton refused, Helms said, he would call for a   dog. Albritton agreed to the full search and waited nervously outside the car. Helms spotted a white crumb on the floor. In the report, Nguyen wrote that the officers believed the crumb was crack cocaine. They handcuffed Wilson and Albritton and stood them in front of the patrol car, its lights still flashing. They were on display for   traffic, criminal suspects sweating through their clothes in the   heat. As Nguyen and Helms continued the search, tensions grew. Albritton, shouting over the sound of traffic, tried to explain that they had the wrong idea  —   at least about her. She had been dating Wilson for only a month she implored him to admit that if there were drugs, they were his alone. Wilson just shook his head, Albritton now recalls. Fear surging, she shouted that there weren’t any drugs in her car even as she insisted that she didn’t know that Wilson had brought drugs. The search turned up only one other item of interest  —   a box of BC Powder, an    pain reliever. Albritton never saw the needle. The crumb from the floor was all that mattered now. At the police academy four years earlier, Helms was taught that to make a drug arrest on the street, an officer needed to conduct an elementary chemical test, right then and there. It’s what cops routinely do across the country every day while making thousands upon thousands of drug arrests. Helms popped the trunk of his patrol car, pulled out a small plastic pouch that contained a vial of pink liquid and returned to Albritton. He opened the lid on the vial and dropped a tiny piece of the crumb into the liquid. If the liquid remained pink, that would rule out the presence of cocaine. If it turned blue, then Albritton, as the owner of the car, could become a felony defendant. Helms waved the vial in front of her face and said, “You’re busted. ” Albritton was booked into the Harris County jail at 3:37 a. m. nine hours after she was arrested. Wilson had been detained for driving without a license but would soon be released. Albritton was charged with felony drug possession and faced a much longer ordeal. Already, she was terrified as she thought about her family. Albritton was raised in a speck of a town called Marion at the northern edge of Louisiana. Her father still drove lumber trucks there her mother had worked as a pharmacy technician until she died of colon cancer. Albritton was 15 then. She went through two unexpected pregnancies, the first at age 16, and two   marriages. But she had also pieced together a steady livelihood managing apartment complexes, and when her younger son was born disabled, she worked relentlessly to care for him. Now their future was almost certainly shattered. The officers allowed her to make a collect call on the coinless cellblock pay phone. She had a strained relationship with her father and with her son’s father as well instead she dialed Doug Franklin, an old friend who once dated her sister. No one answered. Near dawn the next morning, guards walked Albritton through a tunnel to the Harris County   tower’s basement, where they deposited her in a   holding room with another woman, who told Albritton that she had murdered someone. Albritton prayed someone would explain what would happen next, tell her son she was alive and help her sort out the mess. She had barely slept and still hadn’t eaten anything. She heard her name called and stepped forward to the reinforced window. A tall man with thinning hair and   glasses approached and introduced himself as Dan Richardson, her   defense attorney. Richardson told Albritton that she was going to be charged with possession of a controlled substance, crack cocaine, at an arraignment that morning. Albritton recalls him explaining that this was a felony, and the maximum penalty was two years in state prison. She doesn’t remember him asking her what actually happened, or if she believed she was innocent. Instead, she recalls, he said that the prosecutor had already offered a deal for much less than two years. If she pleaded guilty, she would receive a   sentence in the county jail, and most likely serve only half that. Albritton told Richardson that the police were mistaken she was innocent. But Richardson, she says, was unswayed. The police had found crack in her car. The test proved it. She could spend a few weeks in jail or two years in prison. In despair, Albritton agreed to the deal. Albritton was escorted to a dark   courtroom. A guilty plea requires the defendant to make a series of statements that serve as a confession and to waive multiple constitutional rights. The judge, Vanessa Velasquez, walked her through the recitation, Albritton recalls, but never asked why she couldn’t stop crying long enough to speak in sentences. She had managed to say the one word that mattered: “guilty. ” Police officers arrest more than 1. 2 million people a year in the United States on charges of illegal drug possession. Field tests like the one Officer Helms used in front of Amy Albritton help them move quickly from suspicion to conviction. But the kits  —   which cost about $2 each and have changed little since 1973  —   are far from reliable. The field tests seem simple, but a lot can go wrong. Some tests, including the one the Houston police officers used to analyze the crumb on the floor of Albritton’s car, use a single tube of a chemical called cobalt thiocyanate, which turns blue when it is exposed to cocaine. But cobalt thiocyanate also turns blue when it is exposed to more than 80 other compounds, including methadone, certain acne medications and several common household cleaners. Other tests use three tubes, which the officer can break in a specific order to rule out everything but the drug in question  —   but if the officer breaks the tubes in the wrong order, that, too, can invalidate the results. The environment can also present problems. Cold weather slows the color development heat speeds it up, or sometimes prevents a color reaction from taking place at all. Poor lighting on the street  —   flashing police lights, sun glare, street lamps  —   often prevents officers from making the fine distinctions that could make the difference between an arrest and a release. There are no established error rates for the field tests, in part because their accuracy varies so widely depending on who is using them and how. Data from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement lab system show that 21 percent of evidence that the police listed as methamphetamine after identifying it was not methamphetamine, and half of those false positives were not any kind of illegal drug at all. In one notable Florida episode, Hillsborough County sheriff’s deputies produced 15 false positives for methamphetamine in the first seven months of 2014. When we examined the department’s records, they showed that officers, faced with somewhat ambiguous directions on the pouches, had simply misunderstood which colors indicated a positive result. No central agency regulates the manufacture or sale of the tests, and no comprehensive records are kept about their use. In the late 1960s, crime labs outfitted investigators with mobile chemistry sets, including small plastic test tubes and bottles of chemical reagents that reacted with certain drugs by changing colors, more or less on the same principle as a home pregnancy test. But the reagents contained strong acids that leaked and burned the investigators. In 1973, the same year that Richard Nixon formally established the Drug Enforcement Administration, declaring “an   global war on the drug menace,” a pair of California inventors patented a “disposable comparison detector kit. ” It was far simpler, just a glass vial or vials inside a plastic pouch. Open the pouch, add the compound to be tested, seal the pouch, break open the vials and watch the colors change. The field tests, convenient and imbued with an aura of scientific infallibility, were ordered by police departments across the country. In a 1974 study, however, the National Bureau of Standards warned that the kits “should not be used as sole evidence for the identification of a narcotic or drug of abuse. ” Police officers were not chemists, and chemists themselves had long ago stopped relying on color tests, preferring more reliable mass spectrographs. By 1978, the Department of Justice had determined that field tests “should not be used for evidential purposes,” and the field tests in use today remain inadmissible at trial in nearly every jurisdiction instead, prosecutors must present a secondary lab test using more reliable methods. But this has proved to be a meaningless prohibition. Most drug cases in the United States are decided well before they reach trial, by the far more informal process of plea bargaining. In 2011, RTI International, a nonprofit research group based in North Carolina, found that prosecutors in nine of 10 jurisdictions it surveyed nationwide accepted guilty pleas based solely on the results of field tests, and in our own reporting, we confirmed that prosecutors or judges accept plea deals on that same basis in Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Jacksonville, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Newark, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, San Diego, Seattle and Tampa. This puts field tests at the center of any discussion about the justice of plea bargains in general. The federal government does not keep a comprehensive database of prosecutions in county and state criminal courts, but the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data at the University of Michigan maintains an extensive sampling of court records from the 40 largest jurisdictions. Based on this data, we found that more than 10 percent of all county and state felony convictions are for drug charges, and at least 90 percent of those convictions come by way of plea deals. In Tennessee, guilty pleas produce 94 percent of all convictions. In Kansas, they make up more than 97 percent. In Harris County, Tex. where the judiciary makes detailed criminal caseload information public, 99. 5 percent of   convictions are the result of a guilty plea. A majority of those are felony convictions, which restrict employment, housing and  —   in many states  —   the right to vote. Demand for the field tests is strong enough to sustain the business of at least nine different companies that sell tests to identify cocaine, heroin, marijuana, methamphetamine, LSD, MDMA and more than two dozen other drugs. The Justice Department issued guidelines in 2000 calling for   packaging to carry warning labels, including “a statement that users of the kit should receive appropriate training in its use and should be taught that the reagents can give   as well as   results,” but when we checked, three of the largest manufacturers  —   Lynn Peavey Company, the Safariland Group and Sirchie  —   had not printed such a warning on their tests. (Lynn Peavey Company did not respond to our request for comment. A spokesman for the Safariland Group said the company provides   agencies with extensive training materials that are separate from the tests and their packaging. We asked John Roby, Sirchie’s chief executive, about the missing warnings and requested an interview in May. He responded in writing a month later saying that the boxes carrying Sirchie’s cocaine tests had been updated and now display a warning that reactions may occur with both “legal and illegal substances. ” After our inquiry, Sirchie added another warning to its packaging, listing at the bottom of its printed instructions: “ALL TEST RESULTS MUST BE CONFIRMED BY AN APPROVED ANALYTICAL LABORATORY! ”) Even trained lab scientists struggle with confirmation bias  —   the tendency to take any new evidence as confirmation of expectations  —   and police officers can see the tests as affirming their decisions to stop and search a person. Labs rarely notify officers when a false positive is found, so they have little experience to prompt skepticism. As far as they know, the system works. By our estimate, though, every year at least 100, 000 people nationwide plead guilty to   charges that rely on   results as evidence. At that volume, even the most modest of error rates could produce thousands of wrongful convictions. After he arrested Amy Albritton, Officer Helms sent what remained of the crumb he found on the floor of her car to the Houston Police Department crime laboratory. He listed it as “. 02 grms crack cocaine” and noted on the submission form that he was also sending a “syringe   unknown substance . 01 gr”  —   presumably the needle Officer Nguyen reported pulling from the ceiling lining and that Albritton had not seen and still could not explain. (Helms’s submission form, which was separate from the arrest report, said it came not from the ceiling but from the “suspect visor. ”) The last item Helms turned in was a ziploc bag of the “unknown wht powder” that had been removed from the BC Powder package. “HOLD + ANALYZE FOR COURT,” Helms wrote by hand. And then, with no court case pending, the evidence sat on hold, one of several thousand samples in the laboratory’s backlog of untested pills, plants, powders and assorted crumbs and pebbles. Albritton served 21 days of her   sentence. When she was released, she took a taxi to the motel where she had planned to stay with Wilson, whom she never saw again after the arrest. (Helms and Nguyen would not comment for this article Wilson did not respond to requests.) The manager had kept her clothes, so she took a room again and waited for her friend Doug Franklin to fly in from Louisiana. The plan was that he would lend her the money to get her impounded car and keep her company on the drive home. When they retrieved the car, it had been sitting in the summer heat for more than three weeks. Albritton was overwhelmed by the smell of rotting hamburgers. When Albritton pleaded guilty, she asked Franklin to explain the situation to her bosses at the   firm, but Franklin decided it was safer to say nothing. She was going to be fired in any case, he reasoned, and alerting an employer about the drug felony would only hurt her future prospects. Albritton had managed the Frances Place Apartments, a   brick complex, for two years, and a free apartment was part of her compensation. But as far as the company knew, Albritton had abandoned her job and her home. She was fired, and her furniture and other belongings were put out on the side of the road. “So I lost all that,” she says. Albritton’s older son, Adam, then 24, had been living on his own for years and learned of his mother’s arrest only after she had begun her sentence. While Albritton was incarcerated, her younger son, Landon, remained with his father, who had threatened in the past to seek custody but never followed through. Albritton’s father, Tommy Franklin (no relation to Doug) was openly skeptical about her claim of innocence. “If the law said you had crack, you had crack,” she recalls him telling her. Albritton gave up trying to convince people otherwise. She focused instead on Landon. Using a wheelchair, he needed regular sessions of physical and occupational therapy, and Albritton’s career managing the rental complex had been an ideal fit, providing a free home that kept her close to her son while she was at work, and allowing her the flexibility to ferry him to his appointments. But now, because of her new felony criminal record, which showed up immediately in background checks, she couldn’t even land an interview at another apartment complex. With a felony conviction, she couldn’t be approved as a renter either. Doug Franklin allowed Albritton and Landon to move in with him temporarily, and Albritton took a   job at a convenience store. Through all of this, the crumb of evidence remained in storage in the Houston crime lab. It was a closed case, and the prosecutor, as was standard practice, had filed a motion to destroy the evidence. Only some final paperwork  —   a request from the lab and a judge’s signature  —   was needed. But this was an extremely low priority in a complex bureaucracy. By 2010, the lab had been discredited by a decade of botched science and scandal. Thousands of untested rape kits were shelved from unsolved assaults. Errors in fingerprint matches were discovered in more than 200 cases. The lab had lost key blood samples employees had tampered with or falsified other evidence. And it was continuing to struggle with a significant backlog of   evidence  —   one that stemmed from what amounted to an epic experiment in field testing. When Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast in August 2005, more than 250, 000 mostly black refugees streamed into Houston, and local authorities openly anticipated a crime surge in which the refugees were portrayed as   perpetrators. Charles McClelland, who retired in February as Houston’s police chief and was then an assistant chief, says the department decided that pursuing   charges would also help suppress the number of predicted robberies and burglaries. “Anecdotally, it makes sense: Where does a person who has a   problem get the money to buy drugs?” McClelland argues. “One could easily make the connection that they’re committing crimes. ” The city distributed thousands more of the color field tests than usual to patrol officers, and drug evidence swamped the   section of the lab. Even as the Katrina refugees gradually left Houston, the emphasis on   drug enforcement remained. By 2007, annual submissions to the lab had climbed to 22, 000, even as budget cuts had reduced the staff, leaving the scientists with far more samples than they could competently analyze. In 1972, the Department of Justice published a training guide for forensic chemists in the nation’s crime labs, emphasizing that they were “the last line of defense against a false accusation,” but 40 years later, that line had largely vanished. A federal survey in 2013 found that about 62 percent of crime labs do not test drug evidence when the defendant pleads guilty. But the Houston crime lab, for all its problems, would not be among them. James Miller, the lab’s   manager, had long practiced a kind of evidentiary triage. Evidence tied to pending drug manufacturing, sale or possession cases  —   50 a year on average  —   would receive immediate attention, because only laboratory analysis would be admissible in court. But evidence from cases in which the defendants pleaded guilty before going to trial  —   the overwhelming majority of the remaining thousands of submitted drugs samples  —   would also be tested. The city had no legal requirement to confirm that the substances were the illegal drugs the police claimed they were. But in Miller’s lab, everything would be checked, even if it took years. “All along, we’ve said we’re about the science,” he says  —   not securing convictions. So the evidence sat, waiting. The forensic scientists in Miller’s lab keep untested samples in Manila envelopes locked in cabinets below their work benches. Some sat there for as long as four years, lab records show. Albritton’s evidence stayed locked up for six months. On Feb. 23, 2011  —   five months after Albritton completed her sentence and returned home as a felon  —   one of Houston’s forensic scientists, Ahtavea Barker, pulled the envelope up to her bench. It contained the crumb, the powder and the   syringe. First she weighed everything. The syringe had too little residue on it even to test. It was just a syringe. The remainder of the “white chunk substance” that Officer Helms had tested positive with his field kit as crack cocaine totaled 0. 0134 grams, Barker wrote on the examination sheet, about the same as a tiny pinch of salt. Barker turned to gas   spectrometry analysis, or   the gold standard in chemical identification, to figure out what was in Albritton’s car that evening. She began with the powder. First the gas chromatograph vaporized a speck of the powder inside a tube. Then the gas was heated, causing its core chemical compounds to separate. When the individual compounds reached the end of the tube, the mass spectrometer blasted them with electrons, causing them to fragment. The resulting display, called a fragmentation pattern, is essentially a chemical fingerprint. The powder was a combination of aspirin and caffeine  —   the ingredients in BC Powder, the    painkiller, as Albritton had insisted. Then Barker ran the same tests on the supposed crack cocaine. The crumb’s fragmentation pattern did not match that of cocaine, or any other compound in the lab’s extensive database. It was not a drug. It did not contain anything mixed with drugs. It was a crumb  —   food debris, perhaps. Barker wrote “N. A. M. ” on the spectrum printout, “no acceptable match,” and then added another set of letters: “N. C. S. ” No controlled substance identified. Albritton was innocent. Inger Chandler oversees the small   unit of the Harris County district attorney’s office, where she has been a prosecutor for 12 years.   units are a fairly new concept in law enforcement: Prosecutors   convictions in light of new evidence, often in the form of previously unavailable DNA tests.   units originally focused on murder and rape cases, but they also increasingly investigate drug convictions. In early 2014, Chandler took a call while sitting at her desk, encircled by stacks of case files and pictures of her toddler twins. Eric Dexheimer, a reporter at The Austin   told her he had noticed a series of unusual exonerations coming out of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. He’d tracked 21 drug convictions across Texas that had been reversed because labs had found that the drugs in question weren’t really drugs. The laboratory results came after defendants had already pleaded guilty. Did Harris County have any other bad drug convictions beyond what the courts had overturned? Chandler didn’t know, but she said she would try to find out. Chandler called Miller, the   manager at the lab, and asked him if there was something wrong with any of their drug convictions. Miller was not surprised to hear from Chandler. He explained that the lab had indeed found problems with their drug convictions when his forensic scientists found discrepancies in the evidence  —   officially labeled “variants”  —   they sent the details by email to the district attorney’s office, and they had been doing so for years. Chandler hadn’t known any of this. She found the email inbox for lab notices, and it did indeed contain hundreds of messages that were sent from the lab. One after another, the lab notices said, “No Controlled Substance. ” In cases involving drug possession, that meant the defendants were not guilty. (Drug manufacturing and selling charges can hold even if the underlying substance is not illegal.) It was unclear if anyone had ever followed up on the notices. When Chandler entered several of the court case numbers into the district attorney’s   system, however, she found that a majority of the convictions remained in place. She started a list. Over the course of the following year, she found that the district attorney’s office had failed to correct 416 “variants” between January 2004 and June 2015, all of them in cases that ended in guilty pleas. Some variants were legally ambiguous  —   the field test was positive, but for the wrong drug the drug weights were incorrect or there was too little of the evidence to analyze  —   but in 251 cases, the results were simple: “No Controlled Substance. ” Under the 1963 Supreme Court opinion in Brady v. Maryland, prosecutors must provide defendants with exculpatory evidence, even after a conviction. Chandler could have met that mandate simply by alerting the convicting court and the defense attorneys to the lab reports  —   “Every other Brady situation, as long as I give notice, I’m done,” she says  —   but in these cases, Chandler says, she knew very few of the wrongful drug convictions would be reversed if she let the system handle each of them individually. The exoneration effort needed to be centralized, so that someone would become responsible for finding the defendants themselves. Chandler took the list to Devon Anderson, Harris County’s district attorney. Anderson, a former   judge, had been the top prosecutor for only seven months. Her husband, Mike Anderson, who took office as district attorney in January 2013, died of cancer eight months into his term, and Gov. Rick Perry appointed her to replace him. Now, as Chandler described the problem, Anderson felt sickened. The litany of wrongful convictions was not just enormous  —   it was still growing. Her office, she says, was to blame for “a breakdown at every point in the system. ” She hired a former prosecutor to research the cases and find the defendants. “It may sound corny, but it’s true: Our duty under Texas law is to seek justice,” she says. “A lot of people think it’s convictions, but it’s justice. ” In April 2014, The   published Dexheimer’s story, which focused on 21 wrongful drug convictions across Texas caused by lab delays. But prosecutors in Harris County were still uncovering the scale of their own problem. Based in part on the information gathered by Marie Munier, the former prosecutor Anderson hired to examine the drug convictions, we determined that 301 of the 416 variants began as arrests by the Houston Police Department, with the rest coming from surrounding municipalities, and that 212 of those 301 arrests were based on evidence that lab analysis determined was not a controlled substance, or N. C. S. In our own examination of those 212 cases  —   thousands of pages of arrest reports, court filings and   records, along with interviews of prosecutors, police executives, officers, defense attorneys and innocent defendants who pleaded guilty  —   we saw a clear story about both who is being arrested and what is happening to them. The racial disparity is stark. Blacks made up 59 percent of those wrongfully convicted in a city where they are 24 percent of the population, reflecting a similar racial disparity in drug enforcement nationally. Patrol units, not trained narcotics detectives, appeared to be the most prolific   users. The kits, or the officers interpreting them, got it wrong most often when dealing with small amounts of suspected drugs.   percent of the N. C. S. cases involved less than a gram of evidence. The smallest possession cases are the ones in which a field test can be of greatest consequence if officers find larger quantities of white powder in dozens of baggies or packaged in bricks, they have sufficient probable cause to make an arrest regardless of what a color test shows. (Though in those cases, too, they are generally required to test the drugs.) It’s widely assumed in legal circles that these wrongfully convicted people are in fact drug users who intended to possess drugs. Barry Scheck, a founder of the Innocence Project, a nonprofit group that seeks to overturn wrongful convictions, says some who work toward exoneration have complained to him that those exonerated of drug charges often are just accidentally not guilty, and shouldn’t be added to the National Registry of Exonerations. The assumption is not entirely without basis  —   162 of the 212 N. C. S. defendants had criminal histories involving illegal drugs. However, 50 had no criminal history involving drugs at all. All of the 212 N. C. S. defendants struck plea bargains, and nearly all of them, 93 percent, received a jail or prison sentence. Defendants with no previous convictions have a legal right in Texas to probation on   charges, even if they’re convicted at trial. But remarkably, 78 percent of defendants entitled to probation agreed to deals that included incarceration. Perhaps most striking: A majority of those defendants, 58 percent, pleaded guilty at the first opportunity, during their arraignment the median time between arrest and plea was four days. In contrast, the median for defendants in which the field test indicated the wrong drug or that the weight was inaccurate  —   that is, the defendants who actually did possess drugs  —   was 22 days. Not only do the innocent tend to plead guilty in these cases, but they often do so more quickly. On July 29, 2014, Munier sent a letter to Amy Albritton. It was a form letter, one of hundreds Munier was sending to exonerated defendants, opening with the salutation “Dear Sir or Madam,” but the contents were highly personal. It stated that the Harris County district attorney’s office had learned that the drug evidence in Albritton’s case was not a controlled substance: “Accordingly, you were prosecuted for a criminal drug offense and convicted in error. ” Munier mailed the letter to the address on Albritton’s driver’s license, but Albritton did not receive it. She had long since moved on. She had struggled to rebuild her life as a felon. The hours at the convenience store were erratic, so she started waiting tables and tending bar as she tried to find work in property management again. In 2013, she heard about a small set of rentals in Baton Rouge that needed someone to run them day to day. The pay was low compared with what she had made at Frances Place, and there was no free apartment. But the owner agreed to interview Albritton, even with her drug felony, and quickly hired her. She had almost nothing to pack besides her clothes and Landon’s before relocating to the state capital. The reason this property owner was willing to hire a drug felon became apparent soon enough. The apartments were in disrepair, with broken heaters and plumbing, and the owner forced his property manager to deal with angry tenants. She had gone to work for a slumlord. Albritton quit and took a bartending position at the restaurant attached to a Holiday Inn near Louisiana State University. Tips included, she was earning about $15, 000 a year, but she liked her   and impressed her bosses. One of them tried to promote her to shift supervisor, Albritton recalls, but the promotion was denied when a   check by the hotel chain’s corporate office flagged the Houston conviction. She could pour drinks and do nothing more. She remembers how desperate she had been to leave her jail cell, naïvely believing that the punishment for pleading guilty would end with her sentence. “No,” she says. “You’re not ever free and clear of it. It follows you everywhere you go. ” In the two years since the efforts to overturn wrongful convictions began at the Harris County district attorney’s office, Inger Chandler and her colleagues at the integrity unit have struck 119 N. C. S. convictions from the record. At least 172 remain. They haven’t been able to locate all of the wrongly convicted, at times even after hiring private investigators, and some defendants they have reached have declined to interact with the courts, even to clear their record. Last year, as we examined records in Harris County, we came upon Albritton’s file and decided to search for her ourselves to find out what had happened to one representative figure out of hundreds. Her case fit the larger pattern of convictions for no controlled substance: It moved rapidly, with Albritton pleading guilty within 48 hours of her arrest, and it involved an exceedingly small amount of supposed drugs. We searched for Albritton in public databases, finding likely relatives but no phone numbers or a current address. We called her sister, who said that Albritton was in Baton Rouge and provided a cellphone number. It was disconnected. But knowing where Albritton lived now, we found a Facebook profile she had been updating regularly with details of her life, including her work. Interestingly, we also found that Albritton had pleaded guilty to a 2008 misdemeanor, a D. U. I. conviction in Louisiana, despite breathalyzer results showing her   level at 0. 0. When we asked her about this, she said that she had caused a collision by pulling onto the wrong side of a   highway, and because she was guilty of that, she did not protest the other charges she’s still unable to explain why she confessed to a crime there was no evidence she committed. In August, we called and left a brief message for Albritton at the Sporting News Grill. She returned the call a couple of hours later, her voice small, wondering what this was about. When we described the details from the lab report and the letter from the district attorney that she never received, Albritton gasped. She didn’t make a sound for several seconds before shouting into the phone: “I knew it! I told them!” If Albritton’s case is one of hundreds in Houston, there is every reason to suspect that it is just one among thousands of wrongful drug convictions that were based on field tests across the United States. The Harris County district attorney’s office is responsible for half of all exonerations by   units nationwide in the past three years  —   not because law enforcement is different there but because the Houston lab committed to testing evidence after defendants had already pleaded guilty, a position that is increasingly unpopular in forensic science. Crime labs have been moving away from drug cases to focus on DNA and evidence from violent crimes. In some instances, the shift has been extreme. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department’s forensic laboratory analyzes the evidence in, on average, 1, 757 drug cases a year. Many of its 8, 000 annual possession arrests depend on   results. The United States Department of Justice was once among the leading voices of caution regarding field tests, and encouraged all drug evidence go to lab chemists. But in 2008, the Justice Department funded a program developed by the National Forensic Science Technology Center, a nonprofit that provides   training, to reduce   backlogs. Titled Field Investigation Drug Officer, the program consisted of a series of seminars that taught local police officers how to administer color field tests on a large scale. In its curriculum, the technology center states that field tests help authorities by “removing the need for extensive laboratory analysis,” because “the field test may factor into obtaining an immediate plea agreement. ” The Justice Department declined repeated interview requests. Field tests provide quick answers. But if those answers and confessions cannot be trusted, Charles McClelland, the former Houston police chief, says, officers should not be using them. During an interview in March, McClelland said that if he had known of the false positives Houston’s officers were generating, he would have ordered a halt to all field testing departmentwide. Police officers are not chemists, McClelland said. “Officers shouldn’t collect and test their own evidence, period. I don’t care whether that’s cocaine, blood, hair. ” Judges, too, have the power, and a responsibility, some argue, to slow down the gears of the system. Patricia Lykos, the Harris County district attorney from 2009 to 2013, says that when she served as a   judge in the 1980s and 1990s, she would ask the defendants questions about their lives and the crimes they were accused of committing. If she wasn’t satisfied that the defendant was guilty of the charge, Lykos says, she wouldn’t accept the plea. At times the situation is even easier to decipher, says David LaBahn, president of the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys. The defendant can be heard arguing his or her innocence to the appointed attorney. In such   cases, when the prosecutor doesn’t have a lab report, “if I’m that judicial officer, this case is continued”  —   adjourned  —   “until everybody can do their job,” LaBahn says. But that means the defendant, depending on his or her custody status, could go back to jail until the case proceeds, presenting a significant dilemma. Last year, Devon Anderson, the current Harris County district attorney, prohibited plea deals in   cases before the lab has issued a report. The labs issue reports in about two weeks, but defendants typically wait three weeks before they can see a judge  —   enough time to lose a job, lose an apartment, lose everything. And yet since Anderson implemented the rule, case dismissals have soared 31 percent, primarily because the lab has proved defendants not guilty. People plead guilty when they’re innocent because they see no alternative. People who have just been arrested usually don’t know their options, or even that they have an option. “There’s a   in there, and it’s called the defense lawyer,” says Rick Werstein, the attorney now representing Albritton as she seeks to finalize her exoneration. Defense lawyers can demand a lab analysis, and they exist to help defendants navigate the consequences of the jail time while they wait, even as they explain the even higher costs of a felony conviction. They are fully authorized to pursue alternative deals.’ ”In fact, Richardson, Albritton’s original   lawyer, says the prosecutor offered her a deferred adjudication, in which she may have been able to wait for the results of a lab test outside the walls of a jail cell. Richardson, who first said he had no memory of their conversations, says he told her about the offer but she refused it. Albritton says she has never heard of anything called deferred adjudication. Neither could explain what actually happened. Perhaps they simply accepted that the field test, with its promise of scientific inevitability, would eventually convict her. “The entire country works on these   kits, right?” Richardson asks.” ’In the past three years, people arrested based on   field tests have filed civil lawsuits in Sullivan County, Tenn. Lehigh County, Pa. Atlanta, Ga. and San Diego, Calif. Three of the four cases also named the manufacturers Safari land Group or Sirchie as defendants. Three of the cases have already been settled. In one of them, the Sullivan County case, Safariland secured a gag order on the plaintiff, explicitly to prevent media coverage, before entering settlement negotiations. The plaintiffs in each of the suits were people who were arrested, refused to plead guilty and were detained for a month or longer. So far, we have been unable find anyone who pleaded guilty based on   results and later filed suit, though Werstein said he and Albritton are considering their additional legal options. The Texas Criminal Court of Appeals overturned Albritton’s conviction in late June, but before her record can be cleared, that reversal must be finalized by the trial court in Houston. Felony records are digitally disseminated far and wide, and can haunt the wrongly convicted for years after they are exonerated. Until the court makes its final move, Amy Albritton  —   for the purposes of employment, for the purposes of housing, for the purposes of her own peace of mind  —   remains a felon, one among unknown tens of thousands of Americans whose lives have been torn apart by a very flawed test.",0
9830,How To Repair Strained Or Broken Relationships,"A subject not often discussed is the topic of how to repair strained or broken relationships. It is one that comes up in everyone’s life, so it will be useful to make a few suggestions about it here. We will talk about relationships from friends, family, and lovers.
Relationships among friends we will treat first. The first step in this process is to make an evaluation to determine whether the relationship is worth saving or rehabilitating. It is a simple fact of life that some relationships have an expiration date; when two people no longer have anything in common, or their paths take them in divergent directions, it may be difficult to find common ground. In this situation, it is always better to let the relationship die a natural death slowly, rather than rapidly. Abrupt terminations may leave the other party with negative feelings, and this should be avoided if at all possible.
There are some instances where repair is not possible. When someone has committed a fundamental violation of trust or respect, this is a warning sign that the person was never a friend in the first place. Another point to keep in mind is that repair of a broken relationship requires—no, demands—the participation of both parties. If the other person is unwilling to participate in the process, then your efforts will be futile, and will come to nothing.

Once we have determined that the friendship is worth repairing or sustaining, the next step is to decide how to make the first approach to the other party. In this we must try to evaluate the reasons for the problems in the first place. We should make an honest assessment about how things got to where they are. Did someone say or do something that caused hard feelings on the other side? Was there some intervening cause that made the two parties diverge in plans and activities? These types of questions must be honestly and repeatedly asked. We have a tendency to minimize our own hurtful actions and exaggerate those of others, and this must be kept in mind.
The key rule at this point is to try to put ourselves in the shoes of the other party. We must try to see things from our friend’s perspective. For many people this can be difficult, as it involves getting past our own feelings of hurt or rejection and into the shoes of the other person. And yet it is essential. Very frequently the reasons for strained or broken friendships lies in the fact that there is some problem going on in the other person’s life. Only by being a perceptive student of human nature can we divine the cause. Sometimes the only thing that caused the strained relationship was some misunderstanding that was easily curable.
Keep in mind that we must try—at least in our own minds—to discover the source of the other person’s problem. This is not always possible, as human beings are not always rational. But we can at least make the effort. I remember in the film Hoffa that there was a great line from Jack Nicholson. He told one of his men, “Real problems, real grievances can be resolved. They can be negotiated. But imaginary grievances? That man is going to hate you for life.” I have no idea if Jimmy Hoffa every actually said this, but it sounds like something he would have said. He meant that we should avoid hurting the pride of our friends. We should be acutely aware how it is sometimes the intangible slights that can most rankle with a man.
When you have decided to make the first step, it is always better to initiate contact directly. Do not wait for the other person to do it. Depending on the circumstances, this should be done discreetly and without too much in the way of overpowering insistence. There is a certain type of finesse that a man should have at critical times, and this is one of them. The approach should be direct, but neither insistent nor demanding. A fish is best hooked with a lure gently laid.
Of vital importance here is that the approach be sincere. One should genuinely want to contact the other party. Sincerity is the glue that binds friendships together and permits their longevity. There should be no hypocrisy or falsity in any of our dealings with friends. This kind of thing is immediately apparent and, once detected, its whiff surrounds the offending party like a permanent cloud. If the other party is receptive to the approach, we can then gradually feel our way forward, taking care to avoid the reasons why the friendship became strained in the first place. Things may never quite go back to what they were, but at least we can find solid ground for a new frame of reference.
Two examples will suffice here. The historian William Shirer worked closely with famed correspondent Edward R. Murrow when the two were in Germany in the 1930s. Yet after the war was over, the two grew apart. Shirer’s account of the estrangement suggests that he was repelled by Murrow’s enthusiastic adoption of the anticommunist hysteria of the time. Shirer found himself gradually blackballed from most major news networks before being forced out completely. He broke with Murrow over these events. Many decades later, he approached Murrow; all venom spent, the two were able to find common ground again.

Another example makes the same point. Theodore Roosevelt was a strong-willed, insistent man, to say the least. He was in a position to choose his successor as president, and to this end he selected a man very different from him, the affable and rotund William Howard Taft. Taft eventually began to find Roosevelt an overbearing and unwelcome presence in his life. The two men eventually broke completely, a result of their personality differences and different conceptions of leadership. To his credit, Roosevelt eventually approached his old friend privately to patch things up. They were never the same, of course, but at least some cordiality was restored.
Relationships with family are of a fundamentally different sort. Because we are linked by bonds of blood (or perhaps marriage), it will be more difficult to disentangle ourselves from those with whom we have become estranged. On the other hand, it may be easier to repair such grievances, or at least find common ground, since there may be more shared experiences with the other party that act in our favor. The key here is not to expect too much. Although shared history and common blood may work in our favor, they can be counterbalanced to some extent by the fact that irrational family antagonisms can run deeper than those from strained friendships. Patience and persistence are most important here, perhaps more so than friendships with those unrelated to us.

Repairing strained relationships with lovers is perhaps the most difficult. When a man and woman have been united in the past through the coital act, an entirely different set of emotions and motivations come into play. Relationships between lovers can fail or become strained for an infinite number of reasons, and it would be impossible to discuss all of them here. It is enough for me to state my opinion that it is nearly impossible to bring an intimate sexual relationship back to what it was after it has been broken.
Strained is one thing; broken is quite another. My own experience leads me to believe that once a sexual relationship is done, it is done. One cannot really go back to what it was before. Amicable dealings are certainly possible, and happen all the time; but I would not call this friendship. I would call it an uneasy equilibrium. Love’s inflammatory presence scorches all it leaves in its wake.

9831,Cheap-Labor Lobby Funds New H-1B Song-and-Dance Movie - Breitbart,"Movie theaters around the country are screening a glamorous new movie about a    Indian     in the United States  —   but viewers aren’t told that the movie was funded by lobbyists to help import more foreign workers for the moviegoers’ own   jobs. [The movie, “For Here Or To Go?” offers a very flattering image of the almost 1 million       holding   jobs throughout the United States. The   movie follows the efforts by   contract workers to get green cards and dates. It features a      number, but it sidelines the wishes and worries of many   young Americans whose salaries and careers are being undercut by the flood of cheap   contract workers.  The movie’s basic message is that foreigners are entitled to live in the United States if they want to do so, regardless of American law or Americans’ wishes. “You can build your life where you choose to. The question is and always will be this: Where do you think you belong? Where is home?” says one supporting character to the lead character. “I have actively supported this movie realizing its importance as an advocacy tool [and] many renowned venture capitalists, founders, entrepreneurs, academics have also been supporting it,” said an online statement from Tahmina Watson, an immigration lawyer serving Indian and Chinese customers in Seattle, Wash. “Some [supporters’] names include Brad Feld, renowned [venture capitalist] [  booster] Vivek   academic and think tank, the Instagram founder [Mike Krieger] and many many more,” she wrote March 31. Investor “Brad Feld donated $25, 000 to the movie!   …     my dear friend and [immigration lawyer] member Joel Paget who donated a huge sum to the movie,” she wrote.  In 2016, presidential candidate Donald Trump promised to revamp the program so that it doesn’t hurt Americans workers. “These are temporary foreign workers, imported from abroad, for the explicit purpose of substituting for American workers at lower pay,” said a March 2016 statement from the campaign. “I remain totally committed to eliminating rampant, widespread   abuse. ” That promise was a winning argument for many university educated voters who were being pressured by peers and employers to pull the lever for Hillary Clinton.  However, many   companies favor the   program, so it remains largely unchanged since Trump took office. Immigration lawyers expect the administration to start issuing another 85, 000   visas starting April. Multiple Democratic and GOP politicians hope to further expand the     program.  For example, SGOP Sen. Orrin Hatch said in a March 30   that “we’ve had a process for bringing   workers from other countries to the United States to fill jobs for which there is a shortage of American labor   …     But the system is   . Our immigration laws cap the number of   worker visas —  also called   visas —  that employers may obtain each year at a number that is far below demand. ” Also, both Hatch and North Carolina’s GOP Thomas Tillis want to provide a path to citizenship to any foreigner who pays for a graduate degree at an American university. “Our laws also lack a straightforward path for companies to hire foreign students at American universities on a permanent basis after graduation   …     This makes no sense,” said Hatch. “We should have a policy that basically staples a green card on the back of their diploma, with the agreement that they will work and contribute to the American economy,” Tillis said  . But that “staple” policy would create an unlimited supply of Indian, Chinese, South Americans, European and African professionals eager to underbid salaries sought by young and   American professionals. In Washington, the new movie is being touted by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine and by the CATO Institute, which favors an easy flow of labor across national borders. It is also being supported by Facebook billionaire Mark Zuckerberg’s   lobby, FWD. us, via its head, Todd Schulte. The movie is also being touted by Jose Andrews, an immigration proponent who hires cheap labor for his D. C. restaurants. It is “the movie that you want to watch  —  it is an amazing story of immigrants in America. ” “We’re trying to tell a new story here  …     and I’m fully supportive of it,” said Ash Kalra, an   city councilor in San Jose, California, “This is really where the best and brightest of the Indian community have come to contribute. ” Last September, the movie was shown to staffers in Congress, said Watson. September 2nd 2016 was a very special day.  It was the day that the movie For Here or To Go? had a special private screening at the Rayburn House   one of the Buildings where Congressmen have their offices. Fresh off the heels of the announcement of International Entrepreneur Rules, this movie screening was so timely. The private screening was attended by staffers, lawyers, lobbyists and other influencers. We were especially grateful that the White House Assistant Director of Entrepreneurship Doug Rand attended in person. We were also delighted that Senator Tim Kaine’s office was represented.  While Sen. Kaine is now candidate for Vice President, he was one of the original   of the Startup Visa. A huge thank you goes to my very own Congressman Adam Smith ( ) who   in holding the event.  The Congressman’s office went above and beyond in helping with the event, for which we are so grateful. We were also able to partner with Unshackled Ventures, an organization that recognizes the invaluable contributions of international entrepreneurs and has been at the forefront of the issue. And lastly, we wouldn’t have had refreshments without the generous support of FWD. us and it’s president Todd Schulte. In addition, two of my colleagues Joel Paget, immigration lawyer in Seattle and Sonal Verma in Washington DC both gave incredible support and encouragement in holding the event.   …     Rishi and I had the privilege of attending a reception at the CATO institute where we had the distinct pleasure of meeting immigration policy extraordinaire Alex Nowrasteh! The movie is opening at 29 theater screens, including four screens in the D. C. area, three in Texas and six screens in California. The annual inflow of roughly 110, 000     takes jobs for   rates at U. S.  companies, universities, and  . That makes sense for the foreign workers because many hope to get the hugely valuable   prize of citizenship from the U. S. government after perhaps ten years of work. The citizenship bonus can also be duplicated for their parents, siblings, children ad grandchildren. The deal is also rational for U. S. employers because they pay   rates and also don’t have to pay the citizenship bonus to the   workers. That good for many U. S. companies because it means they can get subcontracting work done for cheaper and because it also lowers the marketplace salaries for all U. S. professionals.    are hired by many   companies, displacing Americans who want jobs with Microsoft or Facebook, Caterpillar or   Goldman Sachs or McDonald’s. At least 100, 000   are also employed in universities, hospitals,   and government research centers as professors, scientists, doctors, and therapists.  But critics  —   and much evidence  —   say the   program is rife with corruption, including fake resumes, fraudulent visa applications,    payments, workplace and hiring discrimination against Americans, as well as false claims by lobbyists and corporates that too few Americans want to work at companies such as Goldman Sachs or Facebook.  Additional   programs deliver  The inflow of   workers cuts salaries for young Americans who are in direct competition with    —   mostly software experts, medical researchers, accountants, doctors, statisticians.  But it also reduces the salaries of other American professionals  —   designers, journalists, business school graduates and even    —   by increasing the nation’s supply of skilled, flexible   experts who can perform a variety of skilled jobs.  A 2016 report by the National Academies of Science showed that   immigration annually transfers roughly $500 billion from American employees over to investors and employers.

9833,The struggle continues for a binding treaty to #StopCorporateAbuse,"The struggle continues for a binding treaty to #StopCorporateAbuse By Adam Parsons Posted on November 9, 2016 by Adam Parsons 
In the last week of October, civil society came another step closer to achieving a legally binding instrument on transnational corporations (TNCs) and other business enterprises with respect to human rights. Delegates from many large social movements and networks met alongside state representatives at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland, to further proceedings for an open-ended intergovernmental working group set up two years ago. Despite considerable opposition from Western powers to a binding treaty in any form (particularly the United States, United Kingdom and other countries of the European Union), activist groups are now ramping up the struggle as part of a Global Campaign to Reclaim Peoples’ Sovereignty, Dismantle Corporate Power and Stop Impunity . 
The fact that this process is now an official part of the UN agenda is itself remarkable. Since the 1970s, there have been a long series of failed attempts to develop binding international systems to regulate corporations for their human rights violations. The abortive efforts to create a code of conduct for TNCs through the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) were completely thwarted by the early 1990s, until fresh proceedings were launched in 1998 under a subordinate body of the then-Human Rights Commission. In 2003, the Sub-Commission approved a ‘non-voluntary’ set of norms that could hold TNCs accountable, although these were rigidly opposed by the business sector, and ultimately declared to have ‘no legal standing’ by the Human Rights Commission. 
As an alternative, the UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed a Special Representative for Business and Human Rights, Professor John Ruggie, who became renowned for pursuing a less ambitious or ‘partnership’ approach to corporate regulation. His UN Guiding Principles, when eventually released in 2011, were accepted by all governments but remain voluntary and non-binding, only calling on corporations to act with due diligence. Civil society organisations wholly decried the inadequacy of the proposed follow-up mechanisms, which they stated even risked undermining efforts to strengthen corporate responsibility and accountability for human rights. 
Against this background, it was therefore a huge step forward in 2013 when a grouping of countries, predominantly from the Global South, called for a renewal of efforts towards a legally binding framework to regulate the activities of TNCs and to provide appropriate protection, justice and remedy to the victims of human rights abuses. An historic resolution was adopted by a majority of States (again mostly from the Global South, including Russia and China) at the Human Rights Council in June 2014, establishing an intergovernmental working group with the mandate of drafting a legally binding instrument. It is the first time in almost 25 years that a UN intergovernmental body is dedicating itself to the regulation of corporations, which is set to be an intensive process with considerable hurdles if a genuine legal regime for TNCs is to be eventually agreed and implemented. 
‘Damage to life’ 
The case for holding TNCs to account for their activities could not be tighter, considering the gap that exists in the international legal architecture which means they cannot be prosecuted directly for human rights abuses. Yet the harm that TNCs are wreaking is well-documented, referred to by the Global Campaign as ‘damage to life’; for example, through repressing social struggles and resistance, causing pollution in the extractivist industries, displacing indigenous peoples from their land, exploiting workers through poor labour conditions, and so on. Over several years, a Permanent People’s Tribunal has given representatives from affected communities the opportunity to testify on the socio-environmental impacts of harmful corporate activities, and to highlight the numerable cases that demonstrate how TNCs are able to act with effective impunity. Indeed it is the consistent work of many human rights defenders that has brought the issue of corporate impunity to the agenda of the Human Rights Council, leading to demands for the rights of affected persons to be central to a binding treaty, both in terms of regulation and remedy. 
Campaigners talk of an entire ‘architecture of impunity’ that has protected the operations of TNCs for decades, and placed the rights of corporations above the rights of people through the privatisation of legal norms and institutions. Some of the largest TNCs have greater economic power than many nation states, while their tremendous political power is reinforced and protected on a legal level by a multitude of norms, treaties and agreements. Often described as a new global corporate law, or the lex mercatoria , it is made up of mechanisms such as the Investor to State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provisions and arbitration tribunals that are enshrined in bilateral trade agreements; or the International Monetary Fund’s imposed structural adjustment programs (now replicated in Europe under the so-called Competitiveness Pact policies); or the World Trade Organisation’s dispute-settlement system. While the rights of TNCs are shielded by this complex global legal framework based on trade and investment rules, there are no adequate counterweights or enforceable mechanisms to control the social, cultural, environmental or labour impacts of their operations. The result is a normative asymmetry between the binding norms that protect investor interests, and the soft law that reduces TNCs obligation to respect human rights to mere voluntary measures. 
A binding treaty to regulate the activities of TNCs could therefore provide a vital counterpoint to the controversial free trade and investment agreements that are being continually negotiated in secret, without any democratic legitimacy. As the UN’s Independent Expert on the Promotion of a Democratic and Equitable International Order, Alfred de Zayas, has forcefully argued , these ongoing agreements—such as the TTIP, TPP, CETA and TISA—are all prepared without the inclusion of key stakeholders or parliaments, and are thus in direct violation of international human rights law. They also enable international investors to override the national sovereignty of democratic States, and seek to impose their own system of ‘arbitration’ that isn’t required to adhere to any nation’s law and constitution. Inequality and asymmetry are built into the legal foundations of the current trade and investment regime, which is solely intended to serve the immediate profits of investors, speculators and transnational enterprises, at the wider expense of social and economic progress. 
Inverting the normative pyramid 
In this context, the implications of mainstreaming human rights into trade agreements and WTO practice through a legally binding instrument are potentially radical and transformative. The basic intent of civil society proposals is to invert the international normative pyramid to place the rights of social majorities at the top, hence the repeated calls for a final treaty to obligate States to introduce a binding human rights supremacy clause into all trade and investment agreements they sign, in conformity with the principles of the UN Charter. The repeated calls for States to comply with their extraterritorial obligations in the area of economic, social and cultural rights—as set down in the Maastrict Principles —is also central for ensuring that human rights can assume their rightful role as the legal basis for regulating global trade and finance. 
As a result of invoking the pre-eminence of these hierarchically superior norms, it could require renegotiating all existing trade and investment agreements, and could certainly overturn the investor-to-state dispute settlement (ISDS) regime, as well as the secretive corporate arbitration system in its entirety. Indeed if States and TNCs were truly compelled to respect and comply with the conventions, recommendations and declarations that are the established basis of international human rights law, then it could lead to an exhaustive list of necessary reforms to the global economic system: strict regulations on financial transactions and speculation, the closure of tax havens, the cancellation of illegitimate public and sovereign debt, the reversal of privatisations on public goods and services to ensure the right to food and health, and so much more. 
This greater vision is upheld by a joint civil society proposal to elaborate an International People’s Treaty , which aims to go much further than articulating the need for control mechanisms to halt human rights violations committed by TNCs. The growing demand for access to justice is also linked to the ideal of creating international law “from below,” and establishing “peoples’ sovereignty over the commons” by opposing the expansion of TNCs into sectors that should be controlled by communities and citizens. As part of a work-in-progress, the current base document for global consultation has a lengthy section on alternatives to the dominant socioeconomic paradigm, emerging from the experiences and proposals of the many social movements, scholars, activists and affected communities who are resisting the growing power of TNCs in their diverse spheres. 
A radical alternative proposal 
At the centre of these proposals is the need to promote effective mechanisms for the realisation of fundamental human rights as governments formulate a new international political, economic and legal order, based upon an equitable distribution of wealth and respect for nature. The principle of sharing is therefore recognised as the basis of all transitional measures that promote cooperation and solidarity, as emphasised in the section of the People’s Treaty on envisioning new economies: 
“To address the basic needs of more than half of the world’s population and end the disruption of the vital cycles of the Earth system, global and national economies have to redistribute wealth to reduce asymmetries under the limits of nature. Some sectors and countries still need to improve their wellbeing while others need to reduce their overconsumption and waste. Well-being for all will only be sustainable when we share what is possible and available. The real challenge is not only to eliminate poverty but, more importantly, to eliminate the concentration of wealth and power and achieve economic and social justice based on rights.” 
No doubt many will dismiss this broader vision of global equity and justice as politically unrealistic, in light of the growing number of corporate abuse scandals across the world, and the continuing disregard for basic labour and human rights standards in many developing countries. Campaigning groups are still trying to resist corporate capture of the process for a binding treaty through the Human Rights Council, and are calling on all States to at least participate in good faith, considering the overt antagonism of the European Union during the first session held in 2015. The prospect of achieving a concrete draft proposal next year in line with progressive civil society demands is currently less than optimistic, even with the staunch support of countries like Ecuador, Cuba and Bolivia. Without massive, continual and unending support from ordinary citizens for securing the basic socioeconomic rights of all—as envisioned in STWR’s flagship publication , Heralding Article 25 —the balance of power will remain firmly in the hands of transnational capital and its servile political representatives. 
Nevertheless, the treaty process remains an important opportunity for interlinking popular resistance struggles, building counterpower, and slowly cracking the immense wall of corporate impunity. It is a process that should concern not only human rights activists, but everyone who campaigns for a more democratic, sustainable and egalitarian world that places people and nature ahead of transnational corporate interests.

9834,CNN Op-Ed: Saudis Loved Melania Trump Because She Represents Submission to Men - Breitbart,"Bangladeshi pundit Anushay Hossain writes for CNN: “The ugly truth behind Saudi Arabia’s love for Melania Trump” is that her husband, President Donald Trump, makes her behave the way “the Saudi government likes women to behave. ”[Furthermore, she writes, the First Lady does not deserve feminist credit for choosing not to wear a headscarf, because “that choice really is not as big of a deal as people are making it out to be. ”  From CNN: Donald Trump’s first major trip overseas may be fraught with diplomatic land mines for the President, but the Trump administration can at least comfort itself with the clear hit that Melania Trump has been with the Saudi press. The fact that Melania is communicating with the media and the public in Saudi Arabia  —   mainly through what Saudi news reports have deemed her “classy and conservative” fashion choices  —   works well in the notoriously   kingdom. Her intense appeal makes sense, considering the first lady represents so much that Saudi citizens find familiar and can relate to, especially visually. Melania walks behind her husband, is quiet and reserved, does not make obvious demands (at least not ones we can hear) and most importantly, she looks beautiful and polished. All of that should come as no surprise, given whom Melania is married to. After all, how the Saudi government likes women to behave is similar to how Donald Trump has said he likes women to behave. And they both prefer women to look pretty in pictures, rather than hold actual positions of power. Read the rest of the hot take here.",0
9835,How to Plan Your First Ski Vacation - The New York Times,"If you’ve never taken a   vacation, you may be missing out on one of wintertime’s most fun diversions, said Nadine Davidson, a travel planner with the Los Angeles travel agency TravelStore who specializes in ski trips. “Skiing is an opportunity to be immersed in a beautiful snowy environment,” Ms. Davidson said, “and you don’t have to be a   skier to enjoy a ski getaway. ” Here, she shares her advice on planning a   ski trip: BUDGET WISELY Although ski vacations can accommodate a range of budgets, travelers should be aware that trips usually involve paying for lift tickets, which are around $100 a day at many ski resorts, as well as equipment rental, which runs from $75 to $100 daily. Additionally, Ms. Davidson recommended that novice skiers sign up for a few lessons to learn how to ski safely  —   these can run $50 an hour for group lessons and $100 or more for private sessions. FACTOR IN TERRAIN AND CROWDS For beginners, Ms. Davidson said, a successful ski getaway means picking a resort with manageable terrain and minimal crowds, because packed slopes can be daunting for newcomers. Aspen, Colo. for example, isn’t the ideal destination for inexperienced skiers because Aspen Mountain is full of challenging terrain. And although an area like Mammoth Mountain in California has plenty of beginner terrain, it is usually crowded, whereas June Mountain, about 30 minutes away, sees fewer skiers but also has gentle terrain. Ms. Davidson said new skiers could also buy an   ski trip from a reliable ski operator such as Ski. com these trips take factors into consideration that are relevant to novices. CONSIDER YOUR GROUP When choosing a ski destination, the needs of your fellow travelers matter. If children are in tow, for example, you will probably want a resort with a day care or a ski school for children. Also, if you’re with young children or older travelers, it’s smart to pick a resort where the walk from the resort to the ski area is no more than five minutes. “Kids and older skiers may find it challenging to carry bulky and heavy ski equipment too far,” Ms. Davidson said. PLAN ALTERNATIVE ACTIVITIES You may plan your ski vacation months in advance, but you won’t know what the conditions at your destination will be until just before your trip. “Some areas like Whistler in Canada can go from great snow one day to rain the next, which means that skiing is out,” Ms. Davidson said. To avoid disappointment, have nonskiing activities planned as backups such as snowmobiling, dog sledding and ice skating. Also, some popular destinations have a vibrant cultural scene such as Beaver Creek, Colo. which is home to the Vilar Performing Arts Center, which hosts   plays and music performances.

9836,How Drone Pilots Talk,"Posted on November 4, 2016 by DavidSwanson 
For the past eight years millions of people have expended billions of words speculating about exactly how the United States kills people with missiles from drones (and missiles from other sources, such as manned aircraft, targeting people identified with drones). There is good reason to believe that for each such attack there exists a video and audio record of what the drone pilots saw and what they and their colleagues said to each other as they decided to launch a missile and as they observed its results. 
This is a level of documentation we rarely have with killings by domestic police officers, who are typically filmed by observers with phones, a method of documentation that excludes the leadup and the aftermath. 
It’s also a level of documentation that is almost entirely denied to the public, meaning that it doesn’t actually do us much good. As far as I know we have not seen a single video or heard a single audio recording of a drone murder. The “Collateral Murder” video is a powerful record of a non-drone attack. 
With drones, however, we do have one (incomplete) transcript of what was said during the hours leading up and the minutes following one particular attack. This was an attack in Afghanistan in February 2010 that killed zero fighters but numerous innocent civilians. According to survivors, 23 men, women, and children were killed. According to the U.S. military 15 or 16 were killed and 12 wounded. The U.S. military apologized and paid some $4000 to the family of each acknowledged victim. 
The ACLU obtained the transcript in 2011, and it was published by the Los Angeles Times , which wrote an account of the incident, but I didn’t pay much attention until the new film, National Bird , dramatized part of it. I think it deserves a bit longer excerpt than either the Times or National Bird provided. So, here is my selection plus commentary. Feel free to read the whole thing at the links above and make of it what you may. 
00:38 (JAG25): We are going to hold on containment fires and try to attempt PID, we would really like to take out those trucks. 
PID means positive identification. This individual is eager to send missiles into trucks on the ground in Afghanistan but is aware of the need to identify somebody in one or more of them as an armed fighter. In fictional fantasies like Eye in the Sky or presidential speeches, targets must exclude any possibility of killing civilians and the targeted people must be known, specifically identified, be beyond any possibility of arrest, and be “immediate and continuing” threats to the United States of America. None of those criteria or anything like them are even discussed in this actual drone attack. Instead, the question of whether to launch hellfire missiles at automobiles is whether the targeted people are males over 10 years old and whether at least one of them has a gun. As we’ll see, even those standards are not met, but they are discussed. 
00:38 (Slasher03): Copy that. Break, break, Slasher, we passed you coords for the vehicle on the west side of the river again you have multiple dismounts in the open break. On the east side of the river there’s an additional vehicle majority of the dismounts are inside a compound located just to the north of that vehicle if you get eyes on that compound. Compound has multiple movers as well as one pickup truck hot. 
00:38 (Slasher03): Kirk97, Slasher in addition if you’re able to pick up illumination it appears the two vehicles are flashing lights signaling between. 
Before anyone was murdered on this day, everyone was discussed for hours with words like “vehicle,”“compound,”“dismounts,” and “movers”— which simply has to have a different impact than “cars,”“houses,”“pedestrians,” and “people walking around.” 
… 
00:41 (Pilot): Does he have a weapon? 
00:41 (Sensor): Can’t tell yet 
00:41 (MC): Can’t tell 
CLASSIFIED 
… 
00:42 (Kirk97): Jag25/Slasher03/Kirk97 we are eyes on a vehicle, personnel in the open, definite tactical movement, cannot PID weapons at this time, how copy? 
… 
Still, they are hoping to positively identify a weapon. But, in the absence of that justification, they have spotted “definite tactical movement.” How, one wonders, given that these were a bunch of civilian commuters, does such movement differ from a handful of families and students walking about and arranging themselves into a couple of SUVs and a pickup truck? 
00:43 (Sensor): possible mortars (reference to what the JTAC is trying to PID) 
00:43 (Pilot): Kirk97, good copy on that, be advised personnel in the open, by the vehicles moving tactically definitely carrying objects at this time we cannot PID what they are however we’ve got eyes on and we are working our best 
… 
So now there are automobiles with objects and human beings in them, and those automobiles are moving (as they are principally designed to do). 
00:44 (Jag25): Jag25, roger, ground force commander’s intent is to destroy the vehicles and the personnel, right now Kirk97 is showing that the individuals egressed the trucks holding cylindrical objects in their hands *radio static* 
… 
Personnel egressed some trucks, meaning that some people got out. And they had objects with them. As you read on, see if you notice eagerness or wariness to interpret such a phenomenon as a threat. 
00:44 (Pilot): Be ready for a lot of (exploitive deleted) squirters dude 
00:44 (Pilot): These guys look to be lookouts, man 
… 
People who get out and walk away from a group are “squirters” though not yet “bugsplat” (what drone pilots have sometimes called those they’ve killed). They are also “lookouts.” This identification of them as “lookouts” is made on the basis of the fuzzy little green linear shapes these people appear as in the video being observed, not on the basis of a high resolution color image in which something like binoculars or facial expressions could be identified. 
00:45 (MC): See if you can zoom in on that guy, ‘cause he’s kind of like 
00:45 (Pilot): what did he just leave there 
00:45 (Pilot): Is that a *expletive* rifle? 
00:45 (Sensor): Maybe just a warm spot from where he was sitting; can’t really tell right now, but it does look like an object 
Well an object could be a rifle. There’s at least a 1% chance, as Dick Cheney would say. 
00:45 (Pilot): I was hoping we could make a rifle out, never mind 
Why was this man or woman hoping that? Why not fearing it? After all, it could mean being ordered to do something horrific: to kill. Even believing that killing to be somehow justified and possibly even somehow legal, the drone pilot of our imagination faces it regretfully and somberly. Not these guys. 
00:45 (Sensor): The only way I’ve ever been able to see a rifle is if they move them around, when their holding them, with muzzle flashes out or slinging them across their shoulders 
… 
And yet no such identification happens on this day. Nonetheless, 23 people lose their lives while others lose their limbs. You can see the survivors and hear them tell their stories in National Bird. 
00:48 (Slasher03): jaguar25, slasher03 again, on the west side you have 10 pax that are dismounts that appear to be huddled down, hunkered down, holding position they are all static on the east side, you have the original vehicle with 2 dismounts waiting outside, believe you had up to two to three to four that are still inside the vehicle, then just north of that position you have the compound where our 1 individual exited the vehicle and rendezvous, you have multiple movers within that compound as well as a hot pickup truck 
… 
Pax does not of course mean peace. It means passengers. “Hot” I believe actually means hot, as pilots are able to observe heat recorded by heat sensors. They sometimes observe the cooling of a body on the ground as the blood leaves it. 
END OF 0023z VIDEO SEGMENT BEGINNING OF 0054z VIDEO SEGMENT 
… 
The line above suggests that there is a video we could be shown. Exactly whose embarrassment — er, I mean, national security — overrides our right to see it? 
00:54 (Jag25): … we believe we may have a high level Taliban commander … 
… 
Don’t they always? If you want to prove they don’t always, make the videos public. 
00:55 (Pilot): wouldn’t surprise me if this was one of their important guys, just watching from a distance, you know what I mean? 
00:55 (Sensor): yea he’s got his security detail 
… 
A group of people, by virtue of containing multiple people, is now wishfully seen as a Taliban bigshot with a “security detail.” 
00:55 (Pilot): … Be advised on the west side of the river we still have one vehicle with ten pax, two lookouts, could be definite tactical movement with a commander over watching, definitely suspicious how copy? 
… 
These bees are acting suspicious, said Winnie the Pooh. 
00:56 (JAG): roger good copy, due to distance from friendlies we are trying to work on justification, we’re gonna need PID 
00:56 (Pilot): Good copy on that, no PID on weapons at this time only tactical movements on the west side, can you pass coords for the east please? 
… 
00:59 (Sensor): not sure what compound they came from or what we are apparently dealing with. 
… 
These guys have no idea who they are looking at, but they are working on coming up with a “justification” to murder them. 
00:59 (Pilot): what about the guy under the north arrow, does it look like he is hold’n something across his chest 
00:59 (Sensor): yea it’s kind of weird how they all have a cold spot on their chest 
00:59 (Pilot): It’s what they’ve been doing here lately, they wrap their *expletive* up in their man dresses so you can’t PID it 
… 
The conversation oozes with respect for the people whose country is being “liberated.” 
1:00(Sensor): maybe five in the back of the bed 1:00 *broken radio chatter* 
1:00 (Jag25): Jag25 have you loud and clear 
… 
1:01 (Pilot): Jag25, Slasher03, Kirk97 it looks like the dismounted pax on the hilux pickup on the east side is carrying something, but we cannot PID what it is at this time but he is carrying something 
1:02 (Sensor): He slung it on his shoulder whatever it was, just switched arms with it or something, and is getting in the truck 
… 
01:03 (Sensor): the screener is reviewing, they think something is up with that dude as well. I’ll take a quick look at the SUV guys, sorry 
1:03 (JAG25): Slasher03 JAG25 1:03 (Sensor): what do these dudes got, yeah I think that dude had a rifle 
1:03 (Pilot): I do too 
… 
There’s a wishful guess that a group of two dozen people traveling through an extremely dangerous country might have a gun. Wait and see what that is taken to justify. 
1:04 (Pilot): All players, all Players from KIRK97, from our DGS the MAM that just mounted the back of the hilux had a possible weapon, read back possible rifle 
… 
1:04 (JAG25): Kirk we notice that, but you know how it is with ROEs, so we have to be careful with those, ROE’s *broken radio chatter* 
… 
1:04 (Sensor): sounds like they need more than possible 
… 
A MAM is a military aged male and an ROE a rule of engagement. These guys are figuring out that they should come up with more than the possibility of a gun before blowing up this convoy. 
1:05 (JAG25): copy, slasher03 1:05 (Sensor): that truck would make a beautiful target, ok that’s a Chevy suburban 
1:05 (Pilot): yeah, 
… 
Beautiful. 
1:07 (MC): screener said at least one child near SUV 1:07 (Sensor): bull (expletive deleted)…where!? 
1:07 (Sensor): send me a (expletive deleted) still, I don’t think they have kids out at this hour, I know they’re shady but come on 
1:07 (Pilot): at least one child… Really? Listing the MAM, uh, that means he’s guilty 
1:07 (Sensor): well maybe a teenager but I haven’t seen anything that looked that short, granted they’re all grouped up here, but. 
… 
The eagerness to spot a gun is just not matched by eagerness to spot a child. And having a child on the road with his or her family early in the morning is taken as a sign of evil deeds. Or if the child is a military aged male (later defined as having an age in the “double digits”) that is taken as “guilt.” Guilt is the language of a court. Drone piloting has often been discussed as law enforcement, although it violates numerous laws and does not enforce any. 
1:07 (Pilot): Yeah review that (expletive deleted)…why didn’t he say possible child, why are they so quick to call (expletive deleted) kids but not to call (expletive deleted) a rifle 
1:08 (MC): two children were at the rear of the SUV… I haven’t seen two children 
… 
1:09 (Sensor): little bit of movement by the SUV. I really doubt that children call, man I really (expletive deleted) hate that. 
… 
1:10 (MC): is this the child entering the rear of the SUV? 
1:10 (Sensor): they’re moving, I’ll stay with the pickup truck 
… 
1:11 (Pilot): they just threw someone into the back of that truck, and were like, wrestling with somebody did you see that? 
1:11 (Senor):Yeah I saw those two dudes wrestling. 
1:11 (Pilot): they probably are really using (expletive deleted) human shields here, that’s probably what that is. 
… 
Here is an incredible case of believing ones own propaganda. People are here imagined to be forcing victims into their trucks in order to use them as “human shields,” a phenomenon as ill conceived in U.S. culture as “voter fraud.” 
1:21 (Pilot):yeah, exactly man. So what’s the, we passed him potential children and potential shields, and I think those are both pretty accurate now, what’s the ROE on that? 
1:21 (Sensor): Ground commander assessing proportionality, distinction 
… 
And here we are back to eye-of-the-murderer medieval “just war” theory in which someone pretends to determine that killing a certain number of children would be “proportionally” acceptable, although no empirical test of such a thing has ever been devised, and President Obama claims that no shots are fired by his drone warriors without “near certainty” that no civilians will be harmed. You can’t calculate how many civilians are acceptable to kill AND claim that you’re certain of not killing any. 
01:32 (Sensor): Wonder what these other dudes at this compound are doing. Picked‐up at third vehicle on their train. 
01:33 (MC): Guilty by association. 
… 
I suppose they know that’s not a legal term. 
01:48 (Pilot): JAG25 just want to confirm that you copied we have about 20 pax dismounted, they are outside the trucks praying at this time and we’re 3 1⁄2 miles from the friendly location. 
… 
01:48 (Sensor): … Praying? I mean seriously, that’s what they do. 
01:48 (MC): They’re gonna do something nefarious. 
… 
When I was very briefly in Afghanistan I didn’t meet anyone who didn’t pray. I also didn’t meet anyone who did anything nefarious. I have also never heard a presidential speech in which President Obama explains that he targets people who pray. 
01:50 (MC): Adolescent near the rear of the SUV. 
01:50 (Sensor): Well, teenagers can fight. 
01:50 (MC): Pick up a weapon and you’re a combatant, it’s how that works. 
… 
Got that? 
01:52 (Sensor): Oh sweet target. I’d try to go through the bed, put it right dead center of the bed. 
01:53 (MC): Oh that’d be perfect. 
01:52 (Sensor): Like more of them from the other vehicles are around this one right now. 
… 
Such cool, level headed reluctance to use excessive force is no doubt what we would hear in police videos as well. 
01:54 (Sensor): MAM near SUV appear to be holding a weapon. 
01:54 (Jag25): Roger, still awaiting confirmation. 
01:54 (Pilot): JAG25 be advised, our screener just called 1 MAM near the SUV in the line of 3, appears to be holding a weapon. 
… 
01:56 (MC) :one weapon on ground may have picked it up and walking around the pickup. 
01:56 (Sensor): I didn’t quite catch that but I believe it. 
… 
I didn’t see it either. Should I believe it too? 
02:29 (Pilot): Can’t wait till this actually happens, with all this coordination and *expletive* 
(agreement noises from crew) 
02:29 (Pilot): Thanks for the help, you’re doing a good job relaying everything in (muffled), MC. Appreciate it 
… 
02:48 (Sensor): Still a sweet *expletive* target, geez….Take out the lead vehicle on the run and then uhh bring the helos in 
… 
02:54 (MC): Looks like they’re bringing a Reaper in 
… 
02:54 (Sensor): *Expletive*that, man 
02:54 (MC): just claim we’re here first 
02:54 (MC): At least we know these guys have weapons 
02:55 (Muffled talking off comms, some profanity, a chuckle) 
… 
Laughing and eagerness to be the one to pull the trigger. 
02:58 (Sensor): Hey, that dude just put a weapon down right above the truck. See it? 
02:59 (Pilot): See it. See if DGS will call that 
… 
DGS is an office that is supposed to approve before eager pilots push the button. A veteran in National Bird describes routinely trying to restrain the eagerness of pilots at Creech Air Force Base to kill. 
03:01 (Sensor): Aww where is he going? Just pulling off the road maybe. They probably mostly left their weapons in the vehicles. I’ll be damned, it looks like a short dude back there. 
… 
No weapons? They must be inside. A child? It must be a short dude. 
03:05 (Pilot): Jag 25 standby one. Kirk 97, we’re checking. Looks mostly to be military aged males. We have seen approximately two children. Standby. 
03:05 (Pilot): Dude the only thing I can see if this isn’t something [expletive deleted]is the locals trying to get away. You know what I mean? But I don’t think so. 
… 
Here a pilot surmises the situation accurately but chooses not to believe it. 
03:06 (Sensor): 24 or 25 at the praying stop. 
03:07 (Sensor): CLASSIFIED view I saw the one that looked short enough to be a child. 
… 
03:08 (Pilot): And Jag 25, our screeners are currently calling 21 MAMs no females, and 2 possible children. How copy? 
03:08 (JAG25): Roger. And when we say children, are we talking teenagers or toddlers? 
03:08 (Sensor): I would say about twelve. Not toddlers. Something more towards adolescents or teens. 
03:08 (Pilot): Yeah adolescents 
… 
03:10 (Pilot): And Kirk 97, good copy on that. We are with you. Our screener updated only one adolescent so that’s one double digit age range. How Copy? 
03:10 (JAG25): We’ll pass that along to the ground force commander. But like I said, 12‐13 years old with a weapon is just as dangerous. 
03:11 (Sensor): Oh we agree. Yea. 
… 
04:05 (Pilot) : Yeah. Alright, so the plan is man, uh, we’re going to watch this thing go down, the helo’s are going to take out as much as they can and when they Winchester we can play clean up. 
… 
04:07 (Pilot) : As long as you keep somebody that we can shoot in the field of view I’m happy. 
… 
Happy! It’s good to stay positive about your job! Everybody knows that. 
04:09 (Pilot) : Yeah, well that’s what we were talking on this. I was talking to the JTAC he said the exact same thing man. Um they called them an adolescent. We called it you know… most likely double digits age range. And he was like that’s old enough to be dangerous. 
… 
04:13 (Pilot): It’s a cool looking shot 
04:13 (Sensor): O, awesome",0

Legend: Leader and polling margin from RealClearPolitics . SoS’s party from WikiPedia . A.G’s party from Ballotpedia . 
* Previous week’s margin in parenthesis (thus). Flipped states ( thus ). 
Still very much a horse-race; Clinton flipped Florida (though by a tiny amount); but Trump flipped Nevada and North Carolina. (All this data is averaged over the 10/26 – 11/6 time frame, and I can’t imagine they capture late shifts in any direction.) To the Times interactive once again : 
Remember the interactive focuses on swing states, listed in the table above. We give Trump every state where he is ahead: Ohio, North Carolina, Nevada (!), Iowa. Trump has 44 paths to victory; Clinton, 19. We reserve Florida and New Hampshire, because Clinton’s margin in both states is razor thin, and give her Virgina, Pennsylvania, Wisconson, and Colorado: 
So even if Trump wins Florida, he has to win New Hampshire, too. Hoo boy. And to think all this campaign had to do was gag him and take away the Android phone he was tweeting from. The slightest bit of self-discipline on Trump’s part, and Clinton is suddenly in the race of her life. Shows her extreme weakness as a candidate, and the decadence of the Democrat nomenklatura that forced her nomination through, not to mention the decadence of the political class, which can’t seem to get approximately half the electorat to accept their view that Trump is history’s worst monster, despite extraordinary unity of purpose and a deluge of propaganda. Prediction: This election will resolve nothing, and volatility will increase. 
Now let’s look at the House and Senate: 
This week, the House: 
Looking good for our friend, gridlock. 
This week, the Senate: 
Last week: 
It’s a tossup (though you’ve gotta note 7 of the 8 toss-ups are Republicans. I wonder if the coin will land on its edge?

Policy 
“Why the age for Social Security benefits doesn’t need to go up to 70” [ MarketWatch ]. Part of a symposium. Wall Street is already gearing up to have another go at a Grand Bargain, which (IMNSHO) Clinton supports (given that she supports the logic of Simpson-Bowles, as shown by Wikileaks). 
“Marijuana News Roundup: 3 of 5 States on Track to Approve Recreational Use” [ 247 Wall Street ]. Arizona (Proposition 205): 48% in favor; 47% opposed; 4% undecided California (Proposition 64): 58% in favor; 37% opposed; 5% undecided Maine (Question 1): 50% in favor; 41% opposed; 9% undecided Massachusetts (Question 4): 62% in favor; 33% opposed; 4% undecided Nevada (Question 2): 47% in favor; 43% opposed; 11% undecided

Our Famously Free Press 
The Voters 
“The Verifier – Polling Place Equipment – 2016” [ Verified Voting ]. Handy tool that shows voting systems state-by-state. 
“[E]lectronic voting machines aren’t as commonplace as one might assume. Three-quarters of the country will vote on a paper ballot this fall, says Pamela Smith, president of Verified Voting, a group that promotes best practices at the polls. Only five states—Delaware, Georgia, Louisiana, South Carolina, and New Jersey—use “direct recording electronic” (DRE) machines exclusively. But lots of other states use electronic machines in some capacity” [ Wired ]. 
“Lack of poll workers and low numbers of voting machines are key contributors to long voting lines, and precincts with more minorities experienced longer waits” [ Brennan Center ]. No duh! 
“MIAMI CUBANS 4 TRUMP AND THE BATTLE FOR THE NATION” [ Cuba Counterpoints (MsExPat)]. 
“[Philadelphia’s] crippling weeklong transit strike ended early Monday, ensuring that all buses, trolleys and subways will be up and running by Election Day” [ AP ]. 
Downballot 
“As the final, frantic hours of the campaign for control of Congress come to a close, Democrats look like slightly-better-than-even favorites to reclaim the Senate, while Republicans appear certain to hold the House after a Donald Trump-induced October scare” [ Politico ]. “If Democrats manage to flip the Senate, senior party aides and strategists involved in battleground races said they’re looking at a majority of 52 seats, best case. That would be a letdown from their earlier hopes of a 54- or 55-seat advantage and put Republicans in the pole position to win back the chamber in 2018.” 
The Trail 
Best pro-Trump piece I’ve seen: “The GOP’s ‘Ungrateful Bastard’ Caucus” [ American Greatness ]. 
Best pro-Clinton piece remains: “Vote for the Lying Neoliberal Warmonger: It’s Important” [ Common Dreams ]. 
The best reasons I can think of to vote for each candidate (as opposed to against the other candidates). In no particular order: Trump: A realist foreign policy Clinton: More of the same Stein: Break the two-party duopoloy Johnson: Sanity on marijuna legalization 
These reasons are, of course, entirely incommensurate. 
“The American Conservative Presidential Symposium” [ The American Conservative ]. Michael Tracey: “Trump might be better than Hillary on foreign policy (my top issue), but he’s far too volatile to conclude that with any certainty, and he may well end up being catastrophically worse. The Clintons’ outrageous stoking of a war fervor over Russia is quite simply depraved and should disqualify them from reentering the White House…. Democrats deserve punishment for nominating a candidate with such severe legal problems, stifling a genuine populist insurgent in the most craven possible fashion (I supported Bernie Sanders but find his recent hectoring pro-Clinton conduct highly off-putting). Their shambolic, ‘rigged’ primary process can’t be countenanced, nor can the 2016 electoral debacle as a whole, so I’ll do my small part in rejecting this horror show by declining to vote.” 
Realignment 
“America’s Ruling Elite Has Failed and Deserves to Be Fired” [ Of Two Minds ]. ” The last failed remnants of the state-cartel hierarchies left over from World War II must implode before we can move forward. Healthcare, defense, pharmaceuticals, higher education, the mainstream media and the systems of governance must all decay to the point that no one can be protected from the destructive consequences of their failure, and no paychecks can be issued by these failed systems.” Tellingly, the author omits the FIRE sector. So I would say their definition of elite is odd. 
“[E]ducation levels are a more significant factor this year. Obama won a majority of those with a high school diploma (or less) in 2012, while Romney won college-educated voters. This year the numbers are reversed. Among white voters with only a high school education, Trump leads by over 25 points. Among whites with a college degree, Clinton leads by about 10 percent. This is the first time since serious polling began in 1952 that this has happened [ RealClearPoltiics ]. And when I ask myself who sent the United States heading toward Third World status, it’s not those without college degrees. In fact, it’s Clinton’s base. 
“The Last Gasp of the American Dream” [ The Archdruid Report ]. 
[M]illions of Americans trudge through a bleak round of layoffs, wage cuts, part-time jobs at minimal pay, and system-wide dysfunction. The crisis hasn’t hit yet, but those members of the political class who think that the people who used to be rock-solid American patriots will turn out en masse to keep today’s apparatchiks secure in their comfortable lifestyles have, as the saying goes, another think coming. Nor is it irrelevant that most of the enlisted personnel in the armed forces, who are the US government’s ultimate bulwark against popular unrest, come from the very classes that have lost faith most drastically in the American system. The one significant difference between the Soviet case and the American one at this stage of the game is that Soviet citizens had no choice but to accept the leaders the Communist Party of the USSR foisted off on them, from Brezhnev to Andropov to Chernenko to Gorbachev, until the system collapsed of its own weight… 
If George W. Bush was our Leonid Brezhnev, as I’d suggest, and Barack Obama is our Yuri Andropov, Hillary Clinton is running for the position of Konstantin Chernenko; her running mate Tim Kaine, in turn, is waiting in the wings as a suitably idealistic and clueless Mikhail Gorbachev, under whom the whole shebang can promptly go to bits. While I don’t seriously expect the trajectory of the United States to parallel that of the Soviet Union anything like as precisely as this satiric metaphor would suggest, the basic pattern of cascading dysfunction ending in political collapse is quite a common thing in history, and a galaxy of parallels suggests that the same thing could very easily happen here within the next decade or so. The serene conviction among the political class and their affluent hangers-on that nothing of the sort could possibly take place is just another factor making it more likely. 
“Why Trump Is Different—and Must Be Repelled” [Adam Gopnik, The New Yorker ]. 
For the past months, and into this final week, as for much of the past year, many New Yorkers have been in a position that recalls parents with a colicky baby: you put the baby down at last, it seems safely asleep, grateful and unbelievably exhausted you return to bed—only to hear the small tell-tale cough or sob that guarantees another crying jag is on the way. The parents in this case, to fill in the metaphorical blanks, are liberal-minded folk; the baby’s cries are any indicators that Donald Trump may not be out of the race for President—as he seemed to be even as recently as last week—and may actually have a real chance at being elected. Disbelief crowds exhaustion: this can’t be happening. If the colicky baby is a metaphor too sweet for so infantile a figure as the orange menace, then let us think instead, perhaps, of the killer in a teen horror movie of the vintage kind: every time Freddy seemed dispatched and buried, there he was leaping up again, as the teens caught their breath and returned, too soon, to their teendom. 
Of course, Gopnik — a bad-faith liberal who should really stick to writing gauzy atmospheric pieces about Paris — is both passive-aggressive and infuriatingly smug. To “fill in the metaphorical blanks,” both the “colicky baby” and the teen horror movie villain are infantilized and displaced versions of The Other: The Trump voter that Eurostar-rider Gopnik hates and fears, because he’s afraid their going to kill him and take his stuff. 
Democrat Email Hairball 
“Dow surges 300 points as FBI clears Clinton on eve of election” [ USA Today ]. Hmm. Insider’s paradise.. . 
Stats Watch 
Gallup US Consumer Spending Measure, October 2016: ” In October, Americans’ daily self-reports of spending averaged $93, similar to September’s $91 average. However, it is among the highest for the month of October in the survey’s nine-year trend” [ Econoday ]. “The latest spending average is similar to the $91 recorded in October 2008, a measure taken at the beginning of a steep slide in Americans’ spending amid the financial crisis of 2008.” Eight years of crap and back to square one, except for the lost wealth, of course. Best economy ever! 
Labor Market Conditions Index, October 2016: “Average hourly earnings are one of 19 indicators tracked in the labor market conditions index but the component no doubt made an outsized contribution to the October composite which rose” [ Econoday ]. (This is the Fed’s experimental index.) “Elements of last week’s employment report, especially wages, are consistent with a pivot higher for the labor market and today’s gain in this index could be offering its own signpost.” Dear Lord, a “pivot. I thought “pivot” was a Beltway word, but it seems to have migrated. Ugh. 
Employment Situation (11/4): “[T]he deceleration of employment growth continues in what’s now been a very steady decline going on 2 years. And with employment growth decelerating at this rate it’s likely the unemployment rate will remain elevated indefinitely” [ Mosler Economics ]. 
Real Estate: “When it comes to the state of the industrial real estate market, landlords continue to have the upper hand over tenants, due to ongoing market factors, according to the Third Quarter Industrial Outlook report recently issued by commercial real estate firm JLL” [ Logistics Management ]. “Looking at total U.S. absorption, JLL observed that more than one-third is derived from four key markets that indicate a bulk of the activity still remains in primary industrial cities. These markets include: Chicago at 6.4 percent; Houston at 8.5 percent; Dallas/Fort Worth at 8.6 percent; and Philadelphia/Harrisburg at 10.5 percent…. When asked to rank the top three types of occupiers for industrial estate property at the moment, [Aaron Ahlburn, director of industrial research for JLL] cited e-commerce, traditional retail, and 3PL [third-party logistics] and logistics/parcel delivery players.” So, a bet on continued globalization? 
Shipping: “Truck, rail pricing power may shift in early 2017” [ Journal of Commerce ]. “Shippers moving freight throughout the US are enjoying the kind of pricing power they usually only hold during recessions, thanks to a thick layer of excess truck capacity and overstocked inventories, combined with lower fuel costs and fuel surcharges. The strong dollar and skittish consumer demand, at least for items bigger than packages, also play a role.” Weirdly, the happy talk headline isn’t supported by any data in the article. 
Shipping: “Calls grow for Pakistan to adopt shipbreaking code in wake of last week’s deadly inferno” [ Splash247 ]. “The speakers at the [National Trade Union Federation] protest called for a shipbreaking code to be instituted in Pakistan, noting how workplace accidents at Indian breaking yards had dropped since New Delhi put in its own ship recycling regulations.” 
Shipping: “The world’s seas were a safer place for those navigating them from June to September 2016, maritime security intelligence firm Dryad Maritime reported.Security incidents, including piracy, boardings and robberies, fell compared with the first half of 2016” [ Lloyd’s List ]. 
Shipping: “Cargo thieves have traditionally targeted compact high-value items such as cash and electronics, but lately, improved warehouse security has pushed the crooks to diversify their portfolios and start stealing a range of items, including food, alcohol, and clothing” [ DC Velocity ]. “Rather than lurking around DCs [distribution centers], cargo thieves are increasingly focused on mobile targets like trucks and trailers. Examples of recent thefts include hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of salmon in Norway, cases of whiskey in London, and truckloads of nuts around the globe…. In another escapade, thieves snatched six pallets of maple syrup destined for Japan from a Montreal company’s truck yard, making off with $150,000 in sweet merchandise…. In past years, these items might have been difficult to resell, but the Internet makes it easy to locate a buyer for almost anything.” 
Shipping: ” transportation hiring suggests companies increasingly are putting workers in place to meet another big seasonal push toward web-based sales. They’ll need sales demand to show up since hiring in the retail and manufacturing sectors both slipped back last month. Jobs at goods-producing companies overall were flat in October, a sign that any expansion in demand in the next couple of months will have to come from shipments heading to consumers” [ Wall Street Journal ].

Class Warfare 
On neoliberalism [Matt Stoller, Facebook , via Atrios ]. 
Neoliberalism is a kind of statecraft. It means organizing state policies by making them appear as if they are the consequences of depoliticized financial markets. It involves moving power from public institutions to private institutions, and allowing governance to happen through concentrated financial power. Actual open markets for goods and services tend to disappear in neoliberal societies. Financial markets flourish, real markets morph into mass distribution middlemen like Walmart or Amazon. 
Neoliberalism is not faith in free markets. Neoliberalism is not free market capitalism. Neoliberalism is a specific form of statecraft that uses financial markets as a veil to disguise governing policies.

The Palm Beach Post reported in July that the Trump International Golf Club is required to allow charities to use its facilities because the course is built on county land. Each year the charity is selected by a different county commissioner. This year, County Commissioner Melissa McKinlay selected the Boys and Girls Clubs of Palm Beach County to receive the benefit. And Trump’s course signed on to sponsor the fundraiser. 
But McKinlay learned this week from Assistant County Administrator Todd Bonlarron that Trump’s people were requiring the charity to pay $20,000 in golf and catering fees. In the past, fees had reportedly been capped at $5,000. 
In an email this week, Mark Casale, vice president philanthropy for the Boys and Girls Clubs, told McKinlay and Assistant County Administrator Todd Bonlarron that Trump’s course was effectively asking for half of the proceeds from the fundraiser.

9840,Oakland Fire Was a Rare Mass Casualty Blaze. Fire Codes Help Explain Why. - The New York Times,"The fire that killed at least 30 people in a    space in Oakland, Calif. on Friday was one of the deadliest in the United States in many years, a tragedy that highlighted both the importance of fire safety codes and the vital role they have played in turning mass casualty blazes into rare events. They have become infrequent thanks to safety measures that started to emerge at the turn of the 20th century, when fires at theaters and nightclubs not infrequently killed hundreds of people. “The adoption and implementation of fire codes, having an effective enforcement system that’s been put in place at the city, county or state level  —   those have been the key elements that have made the difference we have seen,” said James Pauley, president of the National Fire Protection Association. “When a deadly fire happens it is usually because something isn’t followed or something goes wrong or we learn something new.” He pointed to the first standards for sprinkler installation and the construction of fire escape routes, implemented in the early 1900s, as a watershed moment for fire safety. Many of the new standards were motivated largely by deadly blazes like the Triangle fire in 1911, which claimed 146 lives in New York. The Oakland fire highlighted the unique danger faced by what experts call “assembly occupancy” buildings like theaters and nightclubs, where large numbers of people are typically crammed into one or two big, often darkened spaces with a handful of exits. Venues like that were at particular risk in the 19th and early 20th century. A fire at the Iroquois Theatre in Chicago killed 602 people in 1903 and one at the Coconut Grove nightclub in Boston killed 492 people in 1943, according to a report by the National Fire Protection Association. The space in Oakland appears to have been especially vulnerable: it was a warehouse that had been converted into a makeshift nightclub and labyrinth of artist studios spread across two floors connected by a rickety staircase made of wooden pallets. The building had only two exits. Theater and nightclub fires, both today and in the past, tend to have a few things in common: overcrowding, combustible interior decorations, inadequate exits or stairwells, and heat sources like candles, stage lights or pyrotechnics that can spark a blaze. That was the case in the last mass casualty fire that struck an American nightclub. One hundred people died when a pyrotechnic display at a concert in West Warwick, R. I. started a fire that consumed the Station nightclub in a matter of minutes in 2003. The walls were covered in flammable material and the building had no sprinklers, allowing the flames to spread rapidly, according to a report on the disaster  by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, an agency of the Department of Commerce. The scene was captured on video by a local TV news cameraman who was filming a segment inside the club when the fire began. Panicked patrons can be seen scrambling for the front door, and concertgoers trampled one another as a bottleneck formed. The most recent mass casualty blaze in the United States, until the Oakland fire, occurred at a Texas fertilizer plant in 2013, when a deliberately set fire set off an ammonium nitrate explosion that killed 15 people, injured 260 more and damaged buildings across the town of West. Perhaps the greatest danger when it comes to fire safety is complacency, Mr. Pauley said  —   a feeling people may develop that disaster is unlikely to strike them because it hasn’t so far. That can manifest itself in many small but dangerous ways: a blocked fire escape or broken sprinkler system that is never addressed because it has never been needed. “Fire is not one of the things that is generally on people’s minds today as something that they need to be concerned about,” Mr. Pauley said.",0
9841,Trump’s Tulsi Gabbard Factor,"Trump’s Tulsi Gabbard Factor November 21, 2016 
Exclusive: By inviting in Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat hostile to “regime change” wars, President-elect Trump may be signaling a major break with Republican neocon orthodoxy and a big shake-up of the U.S. foreign policy establishment, writes Robert Parry. 
By Robert Parry 
Two weeks after Donald Trump’s shocking upset of Hillary Clinton, the imperious and imperial neoconservatives and their liberal-interventionist understudies may finally be losing their tight grip on U.S. foreign policy. 
The latest sign was Trump’s invitation for a meeting with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, on Monday. The mainstream media commentary has almost completely missed the potential significance of this start-of-the-work-week meeting, suggesting that Trump is attracted to Gabbard’s tough words on “radical Islamic terrorism.” Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii. 
Far more important is that Gabbard, a 35-year-old Iraq War veteran, endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries because of his opposition to neocon/liberal-hawk military adventures. She starred in one of the strongest political ads of the campaign, a message to Hawaiians, called “The Cost of War.” 
“Bernie Sanders voted against the Iraq War,” Gabbard says. “He understands the cost of war, that that cost is continued when our veterans come home. Bernie Sanders will defend our country and take the trillions of dollars that are spent on these interventionist, regime change, unnecessary wars and invest it here at home.” 
In the ad, Gabbard threw down the gauntlet to the neocons and their liberal-hawk sidekicks, by accusing them of wasting trillions of dollars “on these interventionist, regime change, unnecessary wars.” Her comments mesh closely with Trump’s own perspective. 
After the meeting on Monday, Gabbard released a statement confirming that the focus of the discussion had been her opposition to escalating the war in Syria by following neocon/liberal-hawk suggestions for a “no-fly zone” that would require widespread U.S. military destruction of Syrian government installations and the killing of a large number of Syrians. 
“President-elect Trump asked me to meet with him about our current policies regarding Syria, our fight against terrorist groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS, as well as other foreign policy challenges we face,” Gabbard said. “I felt it important to take the opportunity to meet with the President-elect now before the drumbeat of war that neocons have been beating drag us into an escalation of the war to overthrow the Syrian government — a war which has already cost hundreds of thousands of lives and forced millions of refugees to flee their homes in search of safety for themselves and their families. … 
“While the rules of political expediency would say I should have refused to meet with President-elect Trump, I never have and never will play politics with American and Syrian lives. … 
“I shared with [President-elect Trump] my grave concerns that escalating the war in Syria by implementing a so-called no fly/safe zone would be disastrous for the Syrian people, our country, and the world. It would lead to more death and suffering, exacerbate the refugee crisis, strengthen ISIS and al-Qaeda, and bring us into a direct conflict with Russia which could result in a nuclear war.” 
Trading Places 
So, the surprise election results on Nov. 8 may have represented a “trading places” moment for the neocons and liberal hawks who were eagerly counting the days before the “weak” President Barack Obama would turn over the Commander-in-Chief job to former Secretary of State Clinton who had made clear that she shared their hawkish agenda of escalating the war in Syria with a “no-fly/safe zone,” and ratcheting up the New Cold War with Russia. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton addressing the AIPAC conference in Washington D.C. on March 21, 2016. (Photo credit: AIPAC) 
There was even speculation that one of Clinton’s neocon favorites within the State Department, Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Victoria Nuland, might be rewarded with State’s top job for her “regime change” in Ukraine that sparked the start of the New Cold War in 2014. 
Nuland, the wife of arch-neocon Robert Kagan , sabotaged President Obama’s emerging strategy of collaborating with Russian President Vladimir Putin on sensitive global issues. In 2013-14, Putin helped orchestrate two of Obama’s brightest foreign policy successes: Syria’s surrender of its chemical weapons arsenal and Iran’s guarantee that it would not develop nuclear weapons. 
But those agreements infuriated the neocons who favored escalating both crises into direct U.S. bombing campaigns aimed at Syria and Iran – in accordance with the desires of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Saudi monarchy. Yet. there was perhaps even greater alarm at what the next move of the Obama-Putin tag team might be: demanding that Israel finally get serious about a peace deal with the Palestinians. 
So, the neocons took aim at Ukraine, which neocon National Endowment for Democracy President Carl Gershman identified as “the biggest prize” and an important stepping stone to an even bigger prize, a “regime change” in Moscow removing Putin . 
While Gershman’s NED funded (with U.S. taxpayers’ money) scores of projects inside Ukraine, training anti-government activists and journalists, Nuland took the point as the key organizer of a putsch that removed elected President Viktor Yanukovych on Feb. 22, 2014, and replaced him with a fiercely anti-Russian regime. 
Given the geopolitical sensitivity of Ukraine to Russia, including its naval base on the Crimean peninsula, Putin had little choice but to react, supporting a referendum in Crimea in which 96 percent of the voters favored leaving Ukraine and rejoining Russia – and assisting ethnic Russian rebels in the east who resisted the violent ouster of their president. 
Of course, the mainstream Western news media presented these developments as simply a case of “Russian aggression” and a “Russian invasion.” And, faced with this new “group think,” Obama quickly abandoned his partner, Putin, and joined in the chorus of condemnations. 
Nuland emerged as a new star inside the State Department, a hero of the New Cold War which was expected to funnel trillions of tax dollars into the Military-Industrial Complex. 
Trump’s Heresy 
But Trump surprisingly adopted the position that Obama shied away from, a recognition that Putin could be an important asset in resolving major international crises. The real-estate-mogul-turned-politician stuck to that “outside-the-mainstream” position despite fierce attacks from rival Republicans and Democratic presidential nominee Clinton, who even mocked him as Putin’s “puppet.” President Barack Obama meets with President Vladimir Putin of Russia on the sidelines of the G20 Summit at Regnum Carya Resort in Antalya, Turkey, Sunday, Nov. 15, 2015. National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice listens at left. (Official White House Photo by Pete Souza) 
After Trump’s upset victory on Nov. 8, many pundits assumed that Trump would fall back in line with Washington’s hawkish foreign-policy establishment by giving top jobs to neocons, such as former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton and ex-CIA Director James Woolsey, or Netanyahu favorites, such as former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney or ex-New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. 
So far, however, Trump has followed a different course, more in line with the libertarian thinking of the Koch brothers – not only the more famous ones, Charles and David, but also their long-estranged brother William, who I’m told have become behind-the-scenes advisers to the President-elect. 
Though Trump did offer high-profile meetings to the likes of Romney and Giuliani, he has yet to hand over any key foreign-policy job to the Republican neocon wing. His one major announcement in that area has been naming as National Security Advisor retired Gen. Michael Flynn, who led the Defense Intelligence Agency when it produced a prescient warning that U.S. policy in Syria would lead to the creation of an “Islamic State.” 
Though Flynn is regarded as a hardliner in the fight against Islamic jihadist terror, he is seen as an independent thinker regarding how best to wage that war. For instance, Flynn has objected to the notion that drone strikes, i.e., killing off individual jihadists, is a route to success. 
“We’ve tended to say, drop another bomb via a drone and put out a headline that ‘we killed Abu Bag of Doughnuts’ and it makes us all feel good for 24 hours,” Flynn said . “And you know what? It doesn’t matter. It just made them a martyr, it just created a new reason to fight us even harder.” 
That leaves open the possibility that a President Trump might eschew the “whack-a-mole” approach that has bedeviled the “war on terror” and instead go after the “mole nest” – if you will – the Saudi monarchy that has long financed Islamic extremists both through the fundamentalist Wahhabi brand of Sunni Islam and by supplying money and weapons to jihadists dating back at least to the Afghan mujahedeen in the 1980s, the origin of modern Islamic terrorism. 
Traditional U.S. politicians have recoiled from facing up to the hard reality that the Saudi monarchy is the real “terror central” because of Saudi Arabia’s enormous riches and influence, which is now enhanced by its quiet alliance with Israel in their joint campaign against the so-called “Shiite crescent,” from Iran through Syria to Lebanon’s Hezbollah. 
Taking on this Saudi-Israel nexus has long been regarded as political suicide, given Israel’s extraordinary lobbying power and Saudi Arabia’s exceptional wealth. But Trump may be assembling a team that is “crazy” enough to take on that mission. 
So, while the fight over the future of U.S. foreign policy is far from over – the neocons will surely flex their muscles at the major think tanks, on the op-ed pages and inside the halls of Congress – the Trump transition is showing some creativity in assembling a national security team that may go in a very different direction. 
Much will become apparent in Trump’s choice of Secretary of State. If it’s someone like Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, or Rep. Gabbard or a libertarian from the Kochs’ world, that would be bad news for the neocons. If it’s someone like Romney, Giuliani, Bolton or Woolsey, then that will mean that President-elect Trump has blinked and the neocons can breathe a sigh of relief.

9842,Sean Spicer: Donald Trump Asked Gen. Flynn to Resign After ‘Erosion of Trust’ - Breitbart,"White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters at the White House that President Donald Trump asked his national security adviser Gen. Michael Flynn to resign in response to an “erosion” of trust between the two. [“The issue pure and simple came down to a matter of trust and the president concluded that he no longer had the trust of his national security adviser,” Spicer said during the White House press conference on Tuesday. He also revealed that there was “a series of other questionable instances” that also contributed to the erosion of the president’s trust.  Spicer said that Trump was “concerned” about Flynn after it was clear that he had misled the Vice President about phone conversations with his Russian counterparts about sanctions. After the Justice Department notified the White House counsel that they had evidence Flynn was not telling the truth, Spicer confirmed that they investigated the legal ramifications of his actions. Spicer revealed that the Justice Department didn’t notify the administration about their knowledge of the calls until January 26, nineteen days ago.  Spicer added that Flynn’s actions were not illegal, as determined by the White House counsel, but it created what he called an “unsustainable situation. ” “That’s why the president decided to ask for his resignation, and he got it,” Spicer added.",0
9843,Four Elements on the Periodic Table Get New Names - The New York Times,"Time to rewrite the science textbooks: The periodic table has new names for four elements. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, the gatekeeper to the periodic table, announced on Wednesday the proposed names for elements 113, 115, 117 and 118: nihonium, moscovium, tennessine and oganesson. The new names for the four superheavy, radioactive elements will replace the seventh row’s uninspired placeholders of ununtrium, ununpentium, ununseptium and ununoctium. Iupac officially recognized the elements in December and gave naming rights to teams of scientists from the United States, Russia and Japan, who made the discoveries. The proposed names had to follow Iupac rules and are now available for public review. People have until November to object to the proposals, and Iupac has the final say. Nihonium, symbol Nh, was discovered by scientists at the Riken institute in Japan. They are the first from Asia to earn the right to propose an addition to the table. The name comes from “Nihon,” which is one of the two Japanese words for Japan. The other word, “Nippon,” made its way to versions of the periodic table in 1908 as element 43, nipponium, but was never officially accepted. At the time, researchers were unable to replicate the experiments of Masataka Ogawa, a Japanese chemist who isolated the element. Two decades later, it was revealed that Dr. Ogawa had in fact found a new element: element 75, by then already known as rhenium. The team that discovered element 113 told Iupac that they had chosen nihonium in part to honor the work of Dr. Ogawa. A trio of research institutions  —   the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, in Russia Oak Ridge National Laboratory, in Tennessee and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, in California  —   were given the right to propose names for elements 115 and 117. Moscovium, symbol Mc, is named for Moscow, which is near the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. Tennessine, symbol Ts, gets its name from the state of Tennessee, where Oak Ridge National Laboratory is. After californium, it is the second element named for one of the 50 states. Naming rights for element 118 belonged to the same Russian researchers and the Americans from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. They selected Oganesson, symbol Og, for Yuri Oganessian, who helped discover several superheavy elements. If accepted, it will be only the second time that an element is named for a living person. The first was element 106, seaborgium, named for Glenn T. Seaborg. The names may disappoint some people, like the 150, 000   music fans who signed a petition to get element 115 named “lemmium” after Lemmy Kilmister of the band Motorhead, or the 50, 000 Terry Pratchett book lovers who wanted element 117 to be named “octarine,” or New York Times readers who suggested “trumpium” and “godzillium” for the new elements.",0
9844,"Second Explosion Rocks Sweden in 24 Hours, Suspected Bomb","A specialist bomb squad has been scrambled to the Swedish city of Gothenburg after an explosion, just 24 hours after a suspected car bomb rocked Stockholm. [The incident occurred in the stairwell of an apartment block just after 10 pm on Friday evening,   reports.  “I thought it was another country that has come to attack. I thought it was a war  …    ” said one witness. Authorities suspect the blast was caused by an “attack” involving some form of homemade device, and the National Guard and a police bomb squad were called to the scene. “We suspect that there are some kind of bomb attacks carried out here” said Pål Engebretsen, the police officer leading the investigation last night. “Some people were seen running from the scene in connection with a bang, but who these people are we do not know at present” added police press officer Thomas Fuxborg on Saturday morning. JUST NU: Explosion i Göteborg  —   dörr söndersprängd i Majorna https:  .  pic. twitter.   —     (@GoteborgsPosten) March 10, 2017,  “We will examine who lives near the stairwell and knock on doors to see if anyone saw or heard anything yesterday” he continued. By Saturday morning, the emergency services, National Guard and police bomb squad had left the scene. “We have not received the results of the technical investigation yet” added Mr. Fuxborg. “But bomb technicians found no metal residues which usually indicates a hand grenade was used, but something else has exploded there. What it is is still unclear”. He said it was possible the device was homemade and said motives could include scaring someone specific in the building or simply “mischief”. The number of grenade attacks and car fires in the relatively small nation has shot up in recent years  —   allegedly because of warring migrant gangs  —   and the number of fatal shootings has doubled in nine years. Since Mr. Trump made his intervention last month, there have been grenade attacks in Stockholm and Malmö, shootings and riots in the “No Go Zone” of Rinkeby in Stockholm, and ambulance workers demanding “military” defence so they can enter the area.",0
9845,2 Men Wrongfully Convicted in 1980 Fire Will Receive $31 Million - The New York Times,"City and state officials in New York have agreed to pay two men who were wrongfully convicted of setting a fire in 1980 in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn about $31 million to settle their claims of being unjustly prosecuted. The   blaze caused the death of a woman and her five children. The two men, Amaury Villalobos and William Vasquez, spent almost 33 years in prison on charges of murder and arson before their guilty verdicts were overturned in 2015 in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn on the recommendation of the Conviction Review Unit of the Brooklyn district attorney’s office. A third man convicted in the blaze, Raymond Mora, was also cleared by the ruling, but he died in prison in 1989. According to a statement by Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller, who has the power to settle claims, the city will pay Mr. Villalobos and Mr. Vasquez $9. 7 million each. Officials in the office of Eric T. Schneiderman, the state attorney general, said the state had agreed to pay each man $5. 75 million. “Following a careful and thorough review of the facts of this case, my office was able to reach a settlement with the claimants that will serve the best interests of all parties,” Mr. Stringer said in a statement on Friday. “We have reached an agreement that recognizes the years these men spent incarcerated and allows them and their families closure. ” In February 1980, a townhouse at 695 Sackett Street burned to the ground, and the   tenants  —   Elizabeth Kinsey, 27, and her five children  —   were killed. The townhouse’s owner, Hannah Quick, told the police at the time that it had been arson and that she had heard the three defendants inside the townhouse just before the fire and then had seen them walk out. Ms. Quick, a drug dealer, said she had been feuding with one or two of the men over drugs. All of the men were convicted at a trial in 1981. But years later, as she was dying, Ms. Quick told her daughter that she had lied about the men’s involvement in the fire. The case found its way to the Conviction Review Unit, whose leader, Mark J. Hale, said he had no idea how the case had proceeded to trial in the first place. In an interview conducted when the men were exonerated, Mr. Hale said that Ms. Quick’s motives to lie might have included liability for the fire and an insurance payment she received. Although a fire marshal testified at the men’s trial that he had found evidence of arson, Mr. Hale said evolving fire science disproved the 1980 analysis. Reports by experts that were filed by Mr. Villalobos’s lawyer and the district attorney’s office showed that despite the initial testimony, there was no evidence of arson and the fire was most likely an accident. “It’s a significant settlement,” Joel Rudin, Mr. Vasquez’s lawyer, said. “This is a case where the system completely failed these men. ”",0

[10/31/16] MIKE ADAMS – As America inches toward open revolt over the runaway criminality and collusion of the democrats and the media , another kind of revolt is taking place inside the FBI. According to multiple sources in the independent media — now the only remaining “free press” in America — FBI director James Comey was forced into announcing a reopening of the criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server by “livid” FBI agents who threatened to go public if Comey didn’t act. 
James Comey, long since suspected to be a Clinton operative who deliberately allowed Hillary Clinton to get away with a vast number of felony crimes and national security violations, now finds himself with his back against the wall. If he releases the evidence against Hillary Clinton already possessed by the FBI, he will face the wrath of Obama, the Clintons, the corrupt Loretta Lynch (DOJ) and the entire leftist media. If he once again gives Hillary Clinton a free pass on her numerous crimes, he then faces a mutiny inside the FBI which promises to bypass his authority and leak the criminal evidence directly to the alternative media. FBI agents under Comey are desperately trying to save their agency from going down in flames 
Agents inside the FBI, in other words, refuse to allow James Comey to let the agency go down in flames as just another corrupt branch of the “Clinton crime family.” Via the Daily Mail UK : 
James Comey’s decision to revive the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email server and her handling of classified material came after he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the FBI , including some of his top deputies, according to a source close to the embattled FBI director. 
This dovetails with my own sources who tell me that the recent acquittal of the Oregon ranchers has also driven a stake through James Comey’s reputation, as he is the FBI official who reportedly ordered the execution of Robert “LaVoy” Finicum, whose suspected execution by FBI agents was caught on tape . 
Because the Oregon ranchers have now been acquitted by a jury, it means FBI head James Comey seems to have ordered the shooting and killing of an innocent man . 
Under Comey — and to the dismay of the many great agents working inside the FBI — Comey may have turned the agency toward a lawless armed tyranny that guns down innocent Americans while letting corrupt criminal politicians go free. For many FBI agents who have spent their entire careers serving the FBI as honest, dedicated federal agents, the thought of allowing James Comey to single-handedly commit political arson and burn down the FBI’s hard-won reputation is just too much to bear. 
Resignations are beginning to pile up on Comey’s desk as livid FBI agents head for the exits… 
Via the Daily Mail: 
“The atmosphere at the FBI has been toxic ever since Jim announced last July that he wouldn’t recommend an indictment against Hillary,” said the source, a close friend who has known Comey for nearly two decades… [Comey] told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents. The letters reminded him every day that morale in the FBI had hit rock bottom. 
“And while the decision to reopen the case may appease FBI agents and republicans, in the short-term, we suspect it does very little to restore overall faith in his competence. As such, we continue to question just how long Comey can hold out before being forced to resign his post,” adds Zero Hedge . “At a bare minimum, in light of his continued questionable judgement and serious doubts raised about the integrity of the first investigation, we fail to understand how an independent investigation into Hillary’s email server isn’t warranted.” James Comey is an arsonist, and he’s going to burn the FBI to the ground unless his agents mutiny 
The upshot of all this is that James Comey is an arsonist. If his own agents don’t force him to apply the law to the Clinton investigations, Comey will burn the agency to the ground, leaving its reputation in ashes. And that, sadly, will make the world a very dangerous place for all the FBI agents in the field, because everyday Americans would begin to see them all as corrupt, lawless tyrants working as part of a criminal regime in Washington that refuses to apply laws to its own kind. 
The truth is that most FBI agents are hard working, professional men and women who are desperately trying to shut down the operations of terrorists, financial fraudsters, kidnappers, murderers and other dangerous criminals. Yet if James Comey doesn’t defend the FBI’s reputation by indicting Hillary Clinton , he will likely be placing FBI field agents in grave danger as they face the wrath of citizens who begin to see them all as part of a corrupt criminal tyranny run by the political mafia in D.C. 
Comey, in other words, is more dangerous to the entire FBI than any other single person in Washington right now. If he doesn’t find his moral compass and guide the FBI through this crisis with law and order intact, he’s going to go down in history (and in flames) as the man who forever destroyed the credibility of the FBI and likely turned his field agents into ready targets for an enraged populace. 
No doubt, he’ll get an extra bonus from Loretta Lynch if he once again decides to nullify the rule of law in America and announce that Hillary won’t be subject to the same laws that would immediately ensnare anyone else. Remember: If Comey gives Hillary Clinton a free pass, he demonstrates to all Americans that lawlessness is now the accepted standard of conduct in Washington . And if our political leaders will not be held to account for their crimes, then practically speaking, why should any citizen feel compelled to follow any federal laws at all? James Comey: If you want to salvage the FBI’s reputation, announce a recommendation for the indictment of both Hillary Clinton and Loretta Lynch 
If there’s one thing abundantly clear in all this, it’s that both Hillary Clinton and Loretta Lynch should be behind bars . Clinton is a lifelong criminal and mafia boss. Lynch is a third-rate attorney who was tossed into the DOJ solely because of her gender and skin color, not her credentials. And neither one respects the laws of America, of course. Both are deeply corrupt. 
If the FBI hopes to have any reputation remaining after the Hillary Clinton campaign implodes either before or on November 8th, Comey needs to come out strong right now and lay out the evidence that unambiguously shows Hillary Clinton had CLEAR INTENT to violate national security laws , among other serious crimes. 
All Comey would have to say is something like, “In the view of the FBI, Hillary Clinton is clearly not qualified to serve as Commander in Chief, and we recommend she be indicted for violations of national security…” and so on. With a single sentence, Comey could reinvigorate the FBI and position himself as an historic American hero. 
Right now, I’d imagine the Clinton machine is mailing bloody body parts in tiny wooden coffins to James Comey’s home address, along with notes that say something like, “You’re next.” Let’s watch and see if he grows a spine and refuses to be intimidated. Post navigation",0
9847,"With ‘Brexit,’ Washington’s Direct Line to the Continent Suddenly Frays - The New York Times","American officials struggling to reimagine their strategy after Britain’s decision to divorce the European Union say the most urgent challenge will be to find a way to replace their most reliable, sympathetic partner in the hallways of European capitals. It will not be easy. No country shares Washington’s worldview quite the way Britain does, they say it has long been the United States’ most willing security ally, most effective intelligence partner and greatest enthusiast of the   mantras that have been a keystone of America’s internationalist approach. And few nations were as willing to put a thumb as firmly on the scales of European debates in ways that benefit the United States. Now that quiet diplomatic leverage  —   including moderating European trade demands and   nations to contribute more to NATO military missions  —   is suddenly diminished. Even if Britain eventually regains its influence on the Continent, a big if, it will be deeply distracted for years. Moreover, the loss of Britain’s strong voice in Europe comes at a particularly bad moment: just as the United States and its allies are debating how to handle a revanchist Russia and reinvigorate NATO, hurry along an   trade pact that has been languishing, and work through a diplomatic settlement in Syria that could relieve the migrant crisis in Europe. “When Vladimir Putin is cheering,” David Miliband, the former British foreign minister, said on “Meet the Press” Sunday, “then you know you have got a problem in the international system. ” And then, of course, there is the threat of the Islamic State, which has found in Europe a new battlefield, one in which the development and sharing of intelligence, seamlessly, is critical. Addressing those challenges was daunting enough, American officials say, in the face of the tenor of the American presidential campaign, particularly Donald J. Trump’s questioning of whether alliances are worth it if allies are not willing to pay more for American protection. But now, with Britain’s exit, called Brexit, whatever passed for   plans  —   a Europe that gradually takes a greater role in its region and the Middle East as America devotes more attention to Asia  —   are imperiled. Like the Arab Spring, the result of Britain’s referendum took Washington by surprise. As late as early last week there was something between a hope and an assumption that the vote would “go the other way,” as Secretary of State John Kerry said in Rome on Sunday. As a result, there was no serious planning for the   work of reimagining the European relationship, a task that will face President Obama for the next six months, and his successor for years to come. Mr. Kerry, usually the optimist, sounded almost downbeat as he arrived in Italy. He did not make any references to a “shriveled Europe,” as one of his top aides did in a conversation over the weekend. But he made clear that European allies are also going to have to rethink their relationships with the United States. “  of the nations in the E. U. are members of NATO,” he said less than a minute into his meeting with his Italian counterpart, Paolo Gentiloni. He warned that the most critical step was to “work together to provide as much continuity, as much stability, as much certainty as possible” to “protect the values and interests that we share in common. ” The problem is that no one shares those values and interests quite the way the British do, a belief that no American diplomat would utter in public for fear of offending other members of the European Union. But British officials who have been at the center of that daily interaction say the concern goes both ways. “I worry that we will have less clout on our own: In the future we won’t have as much influence on Europe’s response to Putin’s transgressions, Iran’s nuclear ambitions, or the E. U.’s foreign and security policy,” said Peter Westmacott, one of Britain’s most experienced diplomats and, until January, ambassador to the United States. “And we will be less able to ensure it is U. S. . ” He added that without Britain’s direct involvement, Europe was likely to be less enthusiastic about free trade. Still, Mr. Westmacott noted that “we should be able to cooperate much as in the past on counterterrorism, on intelligence, on cyber and on military issues,” assuming that “our economy does not shrink too much as markets, investors and the Scots take stock of Thursday’s outcome. ” All of which raises the question: If Britain can no longer play that indispensable role for Washington, surely there is another country that can? Perhaps, but it is hard to think of who. It is not a role Germany has shown a real willingness to step into. Its   War II ethos still holds it back from committing combat forces, and it is not a member of the inner circle of intelligence sharing called the “Five Eyes,” a club made up of the Anglo victors of World War II. (The other three are Canada, Australia and New Zealand.) A lengthy negotiation to improve the intelligence relationship last year ended with only modest changes. For all of its cooperation with the United States on a variety of issues, Germany still harbors deep suspicions of the United States that were fueled by the revelations from Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, including the American surveillance of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cellphone conversations. And American officials were shocked recently when Germany’s foreign minister,   Steinmeier, warned that recent NATO exercises to deter Russia from thinking about destabilizing Poland and the Baltic members of the military alliance amounted to “  and warmongering. ” France has also not been as natural a fit with the United States as Britain. While relations have changed drastically since the George W. Bush administration, Paris often goes its own way, including its recent strategy for restarting   talks. The Italians, for their part, are too broke, the Netherlands is too small, and Poland does not yet have the clout of older NATO members. Moreover, there is a question of leadership. British leaders were the Europeans most closely aligned with the American negotiating position in the major trade and investment deal being hashed out between the United States and some of its largest trading partners. When Mr. Obama visited London in April, he warned voters that Britain would be excluded from the deal if it left the bloc and would “go to the end of the queue” for its own bilateral trade agreement. But the United States would also lose Britain’s voice in moderating Europe’s trade demands. The intelligence challenges created by Brexit are more subtle. Bilateral cooperation will continue as tightly or more tightly than ever to try to prevent terrorism. But the hope that Britain could improve intelligence sharing among the major European powers  —   something that is sorely needed  —   is most likely dashed even as terrorism threats have risen. Over a lunch near the White House a few weeks ago, a senior intelligence official said the obvious solution to intelligence gaps was a far more powerful,   intelligence service. It is hard to imagine a new intelligence institution, however, without   and GCHQ  —   the British equivalents of the C. I. A. and the N. S. A.  —   playing a lead role. And given Britain’s likely preoccupation with the Brexit fallout, it is far from clear how high a priority a new intelligence organization, or a rethinking of NATO strategy, would be for Britain. There is a counterargument that Britain could emerge as a stronger security partner for the United States, that it will value its role in NATO and other institutions all the more. Adm. James Stavridis, who served as the 16th supreme allied commander in Europe and is the dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, presented that view in an article in Foreign Policy. He said that a “new British government will presumably be a very motivated NATO partner. ” “Now that it has chosen to become a relatively marginal economic player on the international stage,” he continued, “it will have to look for new ways to demonstrate value in its partnership with the United States if it hopes to maintain anything like the ‘special relationship’ it has become accustomed to (and dependent on). ” But even if Britain seeks a more active role in NATO, it may not be accepted as one by its other members Britain has often been referred to as an American puppet  —   with other states noting that former Prime Minister Tony Blair followed Mr. Bush into Iraq with few questions. There is nothing permanent about political unions and alliances, of course, and some argue that Britain’s departure from the European Union is not necessarily a calamity for Washington. As James F. Jeffrey, a former American diplomat in the Middle East, and Simon Henderson of the Washington Institute wrote last week, “The U. S. and U. K. were bosom allies for 30 years before Britain joined the E. U. ” But part of what made the special relationship special in an era of global diplomacy was Britain’s ability to act for Washington with the Europeans, to bridge the gap. Now, as one White House official put it, the bridge has been wiped out by a surge that few predicted.",0
9848,Rio Olympics: Drama in the Pool and a Super Tuesday - The New York Times,"Women’s   Breaststroke: In the days leading up to this race, the American Lilly King criticized her Russian opponent, reigning world champion Yulia Efimova, for her “drug cheating,” a reference to Efimova’s   doping suspension which ended in early 2015. During qualifying the two rivals exchanged   taunts, which led to a tense final. In the end, King had the last word, breaking an Olympic record in the process. Her time of 1:04. 93 beat the 1:05. 17 swam by Australia’s Leisel Jones in 2008. Efimova took the silver at 1:05. 50. Follow us here for the latest updates on our Olympics coverage. In a   interview with NBC, King said, “You wave your finger No. 1 and you’ve been caught drug cheating?” “I’m not a fan,” she added. Read Karen Crouse’s story on the race and the rivalry here. Men’s 100 Backstroke: The United States has claimed every gold medal in the men’s   backstroke since Canada’s Mark Tewksbury touched the wall   of a second before the American Jeff Rouse in 1992. Ryan Murphy, a   Olympian, kept the streak intact Monday and set an Olympic record in the process. He was timed in 51. 97, missing the world record, set by Aaron Peirsol in 2009, by   of a second. Xu Jiayu of China won the silver, barely, over Murphy’s teammate, David Plummer. Xu was timed in 52. 31 to Plummer’s 52. 40.  —   KAREN CROUSE On paper, Tuesday looks like one of those days destined for Olympic magic and neverending highlight reels. Gymnastics: Simone Biles and the U. S. women’s gymnastics team are the heavy favorites in the team competition. The Americans dominated in individual qualifying and would have to fall hard to miss gold. Swimming: Katie Ledecky made her   freestyle debut in an   competition at last summer’s world championships and won. If she wins the gold against a strong field that includes Sarah Sjostrom of Sweden, Ledecky will be   of the way to becoming the first swimmer since Debbie Meyer in 1968 to win the 200, 400 and 800 at the same Olympics. One of the most anticipated showdowns of the Rio Games takes place when Michael Phelps tries to avenge his 2012 Olympic loss to South Africa’s Chad Le Clos in the   butterfly.

How to Watch: NBC broadcasts on a tape delay, but you can stream all the events here. Japan returned to the top of the men’s gymnastics world, beating Russia and China in the team event. The event was a renewal of the longtime gymnastics rivalry between Japan and China. China had won the last two gold medals, in 2008 and 2012. But Japan had Kohei Uchimura, the world’s best gymnast  —   and perhaps the best of all time  —   anchoring their team. In the final rotation, Japan took on Russia    in the floor exercise, holding a slim lead of 0. 208 points. Japan went first. After an outstanding score from Kenzo Shirai and a good one from Ryohei Kato, Uchimura locked down the win with a 15. 6. Combined, it was the best team floor exercise score of the night. Russia finished second, and China took the bronze. A second Olympic boxer has been arrested and jailed on charges of sexual assault, a Brazilian police official said Monday, raising concerns over safety at the athletes’ village for the locals who work there. The arrest of the boxer, Jonas Junius of Namibia, came on Sunday after a judicial order requesting it. The authorities transferred Junius from a police precinct to a   prison in Rio de Janeiro on Monday, said a police official, Rodrigo Moreira. The accuser was Brazilian, Moreira said. The boxer “attempted to grab and kiss the cleaning lady” in the hallway of the 11th floor of a building in the Olympic Village on Sunday, the Rio de Janeiro state civil police said in a statement. The woman immediately contacted the police, Moreira said. The arrest came just two days after the Moroccan boxer Hassan Saada was arrested on similar charges, which led to his missing an Olympic bout Saturday and being disqualified for the rest of the Rio Games. He has been transferred to the same prison Junius was sent to on Monday and is serving a   preliminary prison sentence. Junius, who carried his country’s flag in Friday’s opening ceremony, was scheduled to fight Hassan Amzile of France on Thursday in a   bout in the round of 32. —   VINOD SREEHARSHA Swimming: Conor Dwyer won the bronze medal in the men’s   freestyle, missing a silver by 0. 03 seconds when Chad le Clos of South Africa edged him at the wall with a 1:45. 20.

9849,Americans Go to the Polls to Choose Destiny for Nation,"Americans Go to the Polls to Choose Destiny for Nation November 08, 2016 Americans Go to the Polls to Choose Destiny for Nation 
Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump face voters on Tuesday as millions of Americans turn out on Election Day to pick the next U.S. president and end a bruising campaign that polls said favored Clinton. In a battle centered largely on the character of the candidates, Clinton, 69, a former secretary of state and first lady, and Trump, 70, a New York businessman, made their final, fervent appeals to supporters late on Monday to turn out the vote. World markets braced for the outcome of one of the most contentious U.S. presidential elections in history, with stocks up slightly on cautious expectations of a Clinton win. The dollar and bond yields slipped, while gold inched up. Oil markets were rattled as well. Clinton arrived to cast her ballot at an elementary school in her hometown of Chappaqua, New York, on Tuesday morning. Trump, who planned to vote later in Manhattan, began Election Day with a ritual call to the ""Fox & Friends"" morning news show. ""I'm a little bit superstitious,"" he said. ""I've won many primaries speaking to you first in the morning. Each then hoped to hold an evening victory rally about a mile apart in New York City. 
The final week of campaigning was a grinding series of get-out-the-vote rallies across battleground states where the election is likely to be decided. 
""We choose to believe in a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America,"" Clinton said in Philadelphia before a crowd of 33,000 - the largest of her campaign. 
She was joined by Democratic President Barack Obama; his wife, Michelle; and Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, along with singers Jon Bon Jovi and Bruce Springsteen. 
She later made another star-studded appeal in Raleigh, North Carolina, flanked again by Bon Jovi and by Lady Gaga in a midnight rally.

9850,"In an Age of Terror, an Early Start on the Presidential Transition - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   At a luxurious hilltop estate with sweeping vistas of the Hudson River, an adviser to President Obama began meeting on Wednesday with aides to the candidates vying to replace him to make the first, early preparations for the day when Mr. Obama leaves office. During a   gathering on the grounds of Kykuit, the manor built by John D. Rockefeller, they will attend breakout sessions, working lunches and dinners, and    discussions on how to execute a seamless transfer of power in an age when the threat of a terrorist attack like the one on Sept. 11, 2001, requires a fully functioning White House at all times. That need was brought home forcefully to President George W. Bush after   and his concern that his successor lose no time in taking the reins of power led to what is regarded as a model transition when it was time for him to leave office. Now, in an acknowledgment that its time is running out, the Obama White House has begun planning for the next transition, a task akin to a giant corporate merger, but one that involves the federal government’s 4, 000 senior executives and a $4 trillion budget. And it will all be compressed into the 72 days between the election on Nov. 8 and the Jan. 20, 2017, inauguration. “It is the most complex, most difficult takeover on the planet today, and probably in history,” said Max Stier, the founder and president of the Partnership for Public Service, the nonprofit group that is hosting the retreat and has established a Center for Presidential Transition to guide the process from the outside. Mr. Stier declined to discuss the details of the meeting, including its participants, saying it was designed to provide a “safe space” for frank and confidential discussions about the transition process. But he said it was vital that the preparations begin now, removed from the chaos and rancor of the presidential campaign and the pressures of a White House bent on pressing Mr. Obama’s agenda while there is still time. “Campaigns were always loath to do early or aggressive   planning for fear that they will be accused of measuring the drapes or being presumptuous, so they ended up doing it at the last minute,” said Mr. Stier. “And the White House doesn’t want to be viewed as lame duck, but they also, as stewards of our government, really need to ensure that the handoff is as thorough and clean as possible. ” Mr. Obama began pressing his senior advisers to begin planning for the transition late last fall, telling them he wanted to take the process seriously and match or exceed the job done by Mr. Bush, to whom he and his team give high marks for a   handover in January 2009. “He indicated that he wanted this to be a serious process,” Anita Decker Breckenridge, Mr. Obama’s deputy chief of staff for operations and the point person on the process, said in an interview. Ms. Decker Breckenridge was herself the beneficiary of memorandums, briefing books and other materials prepared by Mr. Bush’s departing staff members that she called invaluable when she began work on Mr. Obama’s first day in office as the chief of staff at the National Endowment for the Arts. The president “wants to do the same, if not better, for the next administration,” Ms. Decker Breckenridge said he told her. “This is just, at its core, good democracy, good government, and it’s critical. ” Denis McDonough, Mr. Obama’s chief of staff, convened a meeting of the cabinet last month to begin thinking through plans for the transition, and Ms. Decker Breckenridge has begun meeting weekly with Andrew Mayock, a senior adviser at the Office of Management and Budget, to compare notes and go through task lists. Mr. Mayock will attend this week’s meetings in New York. It was fear that drove Mr. Bush to plan early and carefully for an effective transition after terrorist attacks disrupted his presidency less than eight months after he took office, according to the former senior officials who executed the transition plan. “We talked about   and, ‘Thank goodness it was Sept. 11 and not Feb. 11 because we would have been completely incapable of dealing with it then,’ ” said Clay Johnson III, a top Office of Management and Budget official in Mr. Bush’s White House who was a central player in his 2000 transition into office and his 2008 handover to Mr. Obama. “There are just so many more things that a new president has to be prepared for and say grace over now, it’s just the nature of our world. ” In its 2004 report, the independent   commission noted that Mr. Bush did not have his full complement of senior officials in place until six months after he took office, creating a dangerous situation that could be exploited in the future. Mr. Bush took the issue to heart, telling his top advisers as early as 2007 that they were to begin planning for the handover. “He told me this is the first transition in modern American history when the homeland has been under threat, and we need to make sure that it’s as good as it can possibly be,” said Joshua B. Bolten, his chief of staff at the time. Mr. Bolten, who had been a   aide to the elder President George Bush, recalled how his transition out of office in 1993  —   like those of his predecessors  —   had been relatively “thin” and poorly planned. “It’s different now because we’re vulnerable, and we are essentially under attack here at home from terrorist elements,” Mr. Bolten said the younger Mr. Bush indicated. “There’s a particular moment of vulnerability as we switch over that terrorists may want to try to take advantage of. ” Mr. Bush’s advisers handed Mr. Obama’s aides detailed memorandums on policy issues and agency work plans after the election. They also collaborated on a tabletop exercise one week before Mr. Obama’s inauguration in which they postulated several simultaneous explosive attacks on American cities, and sat side by side in the Situation Room gaming out how the government would respond. Since then, Congress has enacted legislation to codify some elements of the   transition process. Mr. Obama signed the most recent revisions into law without fanfare last month, and they are guiding Ms. Decker Breckenridge’s lengthy   list. The measure sets an early May deadline  —   six months before Election Day  —   for the president to create a transition coordinating council at the White House and a transition directors council for federal agencies, each of which must appoint a senior career employee to manage the handoff. Well before those dates, the National Archives and Records Administration  —   which by law must take custody of all the departing president’s records by 12:01 p. m. on Jan. 20  —   has to begin copying a vast amount of digital material to its servers. The job has grown exponentially larger in recent years as the White House has become increasingly wired and data driven. (When Mr. Obama took office, there were fewer than a dozen laptops in use at the White House now, nearly every employee has one.) While the Clinton administration produced roughly three terabytes  —   or trillions of bytes  —   of records, including 20 million emails, the Bush administration eight years later had to transfer about 80 terabytes, including 200 million emails. The archives administration projects that this president will turn over two and a half times as much: 200 terabytes. Recognizing the magnitude of the job, the White House resolved to begin the process, which involves copying the large files of email records, photographs and videos that have become a staple of White House communications during Mr. Obama’s term, several months earlier than in the past. It is expected to commence this month. A smooth transition has not always been a priority, and there are cautionary tales. In 2002, the General Accounting Office reported that “damage, theft, vandalism and pranks” had occurred at the White House during the transition from Bill Clinton to Mr. Bush, including several instances of computer keyboards missing their “W’s. ” But presidents and candidates have a powerful interest in an effective transition. “You want to protect the presidency as an institution, and you also want to use transition as part of your legacy  —   you want to go out well,” said Martha Joynt Kumar, whose 2015 book, “Before the Oath,” dissects the 2008 transition. “For the campaigns, the impetus comes from wanting to be able to govern on Day 1. The beginning of an administration is when you have the greatest opportunity to bring about change but the least capacity to figure out how to do it. ” It is not yet clear, however, how much the presidential campaigns are prioritizing the transition. Hillary Clinton, who has not yet selected anyone to lead transition planning, sent a midlevel policy staffer to this week’s meetings. Bernie Sanders tapped Michaeleen Crowell, his Senate chief of staff, among others, to participate. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio dispatched Kerry Knott, who served as chief of staff to Dick Armey, a former House majority leader, to attend and serve as the point person for transition preparations. Michael Glassner, Donald J. Trump’s national political director, was also planning to attend. Officials for Senator Ted Cruz’s campaign did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Ted Kaufman, a former senator of Delaware, who introduced legislation enacted in 2010 governing presidential transitions and who helped design the 2016 law, said savvy candidates would take the issue seriously. “It was clear to me that you couldn’t wait until Election Day and leave yourself with basically two months to do this  —   you had to plan way in advance,” he said. “Anybody who is running knows that your first term is when you’re going to get done 90 percent of what you’re going to get done  —   second terms are to be survived  —   and the first 100 days is when you are going to accomplish most of it. So you have to be ready. ”",0

I am so sick of Clinton’s and I can’t believe anyone would vote for her. This FBI that is lying and trying to change documentation should be held to a legal standard and people who have tried to hide documentation and have lied should be thrown in prison for treason! 
As far as how the media treats Hillary Clinton, if you’ve noticed, they treat her like a queen. The liberal media likes to pamper, lie, and make sure America knows she is the best option. We, however, know better. So does Jason Chaffetz. 
For those of you who do it know who Chaffetz is, he is the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman who famously told the guy who destroyed Hillary’s email server that he was served on live TV. Now he just served up a brutal threat to Hillary Clinton and she is running scared. 
HOUSE COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT REFORM CHAIRMAN JASON CHAFFETZ CONFIRMED IT WILL HOLD ADDITIONAL HEARINGS ON DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE HILLARY CLINTON’S PRIVATE EMAIL SERVER WHEN MEMBERS RETURN FROM RECESS.

“Undoubtedly there will be, based on the documents the FBI released today there are new facts that need to be investigated. I’m very concerned about the quid pro quo that was in negotiation between the State Department and the FBI,” Chaffetz told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “Chairman Nunes and I believe Patrick Kennedy should be relieved of his duties immediately pending an investigation.

9852,The Secret History of Colombia’s Paramilitaries and the U.S. War on Drugs - The New York Times,"CALABAZO, Colombia  —   Skinny but imposing with aviator glasses, a bushy mustache and a toothy smile, Julio Henríquez Santamaría was leading a community meeting in this sylvan hamlet when he was abducted by paramilitary thugs, thrown into the back of a Toyota pickup and disappeared forever on Feb. 4, 2001. Ahead of his time, Mr. Henríquez had been organizing farmers to substitute legal crops like cacao for coca, which the current Colombian government, on the verge of ending a civil war fueled by the narcotics trade, is promoting as an antidrug strategy. But Hernán Giraldo Serna, or his men, didn’t like it, or him. From his early days as a   marijuana farmer, Mr. Giraldo had grown into El Patrón, a narcotics kingpin and paramilitary commander whose   mission had devolved into a murderous criminal enterprise controlling much of Colombia’s   northern coast. Mr. Henríquez was hardly his only victim Mr. Giraldo, whose secondary alias was the Drill because of his rapacious appetite for underage girls, had all kinds. But Mr. Henríquez became the emblematic one, with a family tenacious enough to pursue Mr. Giraldo even after he, along with 13 other paramilitary leaders, was whisked out of Colombia and into the United States on May 13, 2008, to face drug charges. It happened in a    extradition that stunned Colombia, where the men stood accused of atrocities in a transitional justice process that was abruptly interrupted. In the whoosh of a jet, and at the behest of the Colombian president, Álvaro Uribe, the United   war on drugs seized priority over Colombia’s efforts to confront crimes against humanity that had scarred a generation. Victims’ advocates howled that it was like exporting “14 Pinochets. ” Mr. Henríquez’s family, meanwhile, quietly vowed to hold at least one of them accountable for the Colombian blood that stained the cocaine shipped to American shores. “We hope that the effort we have made over all these years means that things won’t end with impunity,” said his daughter Bela Henríquez Chacín, 32, who was 16 when her father was murdered and hopes to speak at Mr. Giraldo’s sentencing in Washington next month. The Henríquezes will be the first foreign victims ever given a voice in an international drug smuggling case in the United States, experts believe. Whether this recognition is more than symbolic remains to be seen. Mr. Giraldo’s fellow extraditees have received relatively lenient treatment for major drug traffickers who were also designated terrorists responsible for massacres, forced disappearances and the displacement of entire villages, an investigation by The New York Times found. Once the paramilitary Colombians  —   several dozen, all told  —   have completed their American prison terms, they will have served on average seven and a half years, The Times found. The leaders extradited en masse will have served an average of 10 years, at most, for drug conspiracies that involved tons of cocaine. By comparison, federal inmates convicted of crack cocaine trafficking  —   mostly   dealers who sold less than an ounce  —   serve on average just over 12 years in prison. What’s more, for some, there is a special dividend at the end of their incarceration. Though wanted by the Colombian authorities, two have won permission to stay in the United States, and their families have joined them. Three more are seeking the same haven, and still others are expected to follow suit. “In the days of Pablo Escobar, they used to say they preferred a tomb in Colombia to a prison in the United States,” said Alirio Uribe Muñoz, a member of the Colombian Congress. “But maybe now extradition is a good deal. ” For 52 years, with abundant American support, the Colombian government has been locked in a ferocious armed conflict with leftist insurgents. Though it initially empowered paramilitary forces as military proxies, the government withdrew official sanction decades later, long after landowners and cartels had   them. Before their demobilization in the   the militiamen came to rival the guerrillas as drug traffickers and outdo them as human rights abusers. Now, eight years after the paramilitaries were extradited, Colombia has reached a peace deal with their mortal enemies, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (the FARC). Facing an Oct. 2 vote on the accord, the country is in the midst of a polarizing debate about crime and punishment for the FARC, informed by what went wrong during the paramilitary peace process. Nobody is advocating that justice be abdicated to the United States this time. But the paramilitary chapter of the country’s history is not closed, and remains “totally full of blanks,” said María Teresa Ronderos, the author of “Recycled Wars,” a   history of Colombian paramilitarism. “Nobody knows what happened to those guys. ” For years, the Justice Department shrouded the militiamen’s cases in secrecy, not only sealing sensitive documents but also hiding basic information and sometimes even erasing defendants like Mr. Giraldo from the public docket. Using interviews, recently unsealed legal briefs, transcripts of hearings, internal government documents, and information obtained from Colombia and the United States, The Times examined the cases of 40 extradited paramilitary members and associates. Most were handsomely rewarded for pleading guilty and cooperating with the American authorities they were treated as   offenders despite extensive criminal histories in Colombia and they received credit for time served there, even though the official rationale for their extradition was that they were committing crimes in Colombian jails. Take Salvatore Mancuso, who the government said “may well be one of the most prolific cocaine traffickers ever prosecuted in a United States District Court” and whom Colombian courts found responsible for the death or disappearance of more than 1, 000 people. Under the terms of his plea agreement, he faced 30 years to life in prison. Because of his extensive cooperation, however, prosecutors  —   one of whom characterized Mr. Mancuso in an interview as “always a gentleman to me”  —   asked for just under 22 years. A federal judge sentenced him to 15 years and 10 months. In the end, he will spend little more than 12 years behind bars in the United States. “It’s crazy,” said Roxanna Altholz, the associate director of the International Human Rights Law Clinic at the University of California, Berkeley, who represents the Henríquezes. “These individuals are the worst of the worst. They are drug lords and war criminals. Why should they be getting any benefits?” Early on, federal prosecutors addressed Ms. Altholz’s qualms by saying, “We’re going to put them away it doesn’t matter what for. ” But as she and other human rights advocates saw it, it did matter: Crimes against humanity outrank drug crimes, and the United States could have indicted the men for crimes of torture, too  —   or simply given the Colombian transitional justice system a chance. The American authorities think the extraditions served a critical purpose at a historic juncture, “demonstrating to the Colombian people that there are no such things as untouchables,” as one put it. Eventually, said a Department of Justice spokesman, Peter Carr, the Americans provided the Colombians with “unique and unprecedented” access to imprisoned foreign defendants so that the transitional justice process, called Justice and Peace, could continue. Mr. Giraldo will be the last of the extradited paramilitaries sentenced. Though the United States Marshals Service said it was improbable that The Times would be able to meet with him  —   demanding that permission be obtained from the prisoner, his lawyer, his warden, an assistant United States attorney general and a federal judge  —   a reporter and a photographer did succeed in visiting Mr. Giraldo at a Virginia jail last month. In a baggy blue coverall, El Patrón, 68 now, appeared a markedly deflated version of his formerly fearsome self. His hair has grayed, his weight has dropped, his step has slowed. He passes his days weaving purses from   bags and selling them to other inmates for “siete pollos,” seven portions of chicken from the commissary. “Look,” he said proudly, tugging at the shoulder strap of a   bag. “They are  . ” Shortly before midnight on May 12, 2008, Mr. Giraldo was jostled awake in a jail in Barranquilla, instructed to pack a small suitcase and then hustled onto a flight to Bogotá, the capital. No explanation was offered. Once in Bogotá, he was handcuffed to waist chains, shackled at the ankles and loaded onto an American government plane with a veritable who’s who of paramilitary heavyweights. They flew in stony silence, furious that Colombia’s   president, with whom they had a “shared ideology,” as Mr. Giraldo put it, had broken his promise not to extradite them. After years of declining to turn over the men, President Uribe had suddenly made an urgent appeal to the Americans: Those wanted paramilitary leaders? Take them. Immediately. He wanted them picked up after the Colombian Supreme Court closed for the day and flown out before the court resumed the next morning, said a United States official who agreed to speak only on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Uribe said he feared that the court might block the extraditions if they did not act hurriedly. The Americans snapped into action, though it was a logistical challenge. They needed to “move the men from four corners of Colombia to one location, then the aircraft needed to go wheels up with all prisoners onboard prior to the court opening for business the next day,” the official said. At one point, the official said, the Drug Enforcement Administration had six aircraft “in play” to ferry the men through Bogotá and Guantánamo, Cuba, to courthouses in Florida, New York, Texas and Washington, D. C. Why did the American government go to such lengths to accommodate a Colombian president who, as it turned out, may have had political motivations of his own? “The driving policy during the Bush administration was cooperation on   efforts,” said José Miguel Vivanco, the director of Human Rights Watch’s Americas division. “Not human rights, not atrocities, not to make victims of crimes against humanity committed by these bastards have a day in court in Colombia. “So what do you do if overnight you get as a gift from the president of Colombia 14 guys wanted for narcotics? You just welcome them. ” This is a crime story tangled up in geopolitics. Colombia is the United States’ closest ally and largest aid recipient in the region, and the partnership has focused on combating narcotics, guerrillas and terrorism. Both the guerrillas and the paramilitary groups funded their activities with drug money, collecting “war taxes” and providing security for traffickers in their areas. But the drug enforcement authorities focused primarily on the   at first the paramilitaries, while opponents in the war on drugs, were technically on the same side as the Colombian and American governments in the civil war. After 2000, however, when paramilitary troops reportedly committed at least 75 massacres, Washington shifted its perspective. On Sept. 10, 2001, a day before his attention turned elsewhere, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell designated the United   Forces of Colombia, known as the AUC, a foreign terrorist organization, just like the FARC. Drug indictments of key paramilitary leaders followed, and Mr. Uribe, elected in 2002 with a vow to crack down on leftist rebels, used the threat of extradition to motivate the paramilitary leaders to lay down their arms. Unlike his predecessor, Mr. Uribe, whose    toughness made him a popular   president, wholly embraced extradition as a drug   tool. “The biggest commodities traded between Colombia and the U. S. were coffee, cocaine and ” said Robert Feitel, Mr. Giraldo’s lawyer. But for years, Mr. Uribe carved out an exception for the paramilitary men, saying he wanted to give Justice and Peace a chance. The initial Justice and Peace Law was relatively toothless a Times editorial called it the “Impunity for Mass Murderers, Terrorists and Major Cocaine Traffickers Law. ” But in 2006, the Colombian Constitutional Court strengthened it, granting victims a central role, increasing the maximum punishment to eight years in prison, and demanding full and truthful confessions. Much to Mr. Uribe’s consternation, the leaders then began confessing not only their war crimes but also their ties to his allies and relatives. The Colombian Supreme Court  —   responsible for investigating lawmakers  —   undertook an aggressive “ ” inquiry that ensnared many in the president’s coalition. Mr. Uribe fought back, accusing the justices of leftist bias and conspiracies against him. His intelligence agency illegally wiretapped the Supreme Court and individual judges he denied involvement. Then in April 2008, Mario Uribe, the president’s cousin and a former Senate president, was arrested and accused of conspiring with paramilitary death squads. A few weeks later, Colombia woke up to police photos of the paramilitary leaders being boarded onto American planes. “The whole country was shocked,” said Miguel Samper Strouss, a former vice minister of justice in charge of transitional justice policy. “It was like they had extradited our chances for knowing the truth and for getting justice and reparation for our victims. ” By 2008, the Justice and Peace process, while slow and flawed, had become a real process. Some 200, 000 victims had registered to participate thousands of crimes had been confessed and thousands of hidden graves revealed. Publicly, Mr. Uribe  —   whose representatives did not respond to The Times  —   justified his interruption of this process by claiming that the men had been continuing to run their illegal operations from jail. The commanders themselves, however, firmly believed that Mr. Uribe shipped them out to silence them. And many of their victims’ leading advocates agreed. “They were, collectively, going to deliver testimony that directly implicated Uribe,” said Senator Iván Cepeda, who founded the influential Movement for Victims of State Crimes. “Afterward, the authorities entered the cells where they had their computers, their USBs, and they took it all. All the work they had been doing, all the proof they were going to present to Justice, disappeared. “Those extraditions marked a before and an after,” Mr. Cepeda continued. “If the intention really was to achieve silence and impunity, it was obtained to a high degree. Only now, after so many years, are we starting to see results. ” At the Northern Neck Regional Jail in Warsaw, Va. the other Colombians used to rise when Mr. Giraldo entered an English language classroom. They would sharpen his pencils and fetch his papers, said Ted Hull, the superintendent. Were it not for that, Mr. Giraldo’s jailers would have had no hint that he was ever a force to be reckoned with. That the senior prisoner who limps from sciatica and speaks with his hands because he never conquered English once ran a paramilitary bloc found responsible for 1, 800 serious human rights violations with over 4, 000 victims  —     they said. Mr. Giraldo is now the type of docile inmate who reflexively crosses his wrists behind his back even when they are not cuffed. Yet here in the territory that Mr. Giraldo controlled, from the bustling market in the port city of Santa Marta up through the Sierra Nevada foothills and back down to the Caribbean coast, he remains the    godfather in the brimmed hat and jaunty scarf whose commanding presence is still palpable. “This man, from the time he demobilized, left behind armed groups guarding his territory,” said Priscila Zúñiga, the security adviser to Santa Marta’s mayor. “We have not stopped, from 2006 to 2016, having an illegal armed presence in the area. ” Now it’s called the Giraldo Clan. Ms. Zúñiga spoke in the modular office that she has stationed beside the   marketplace, along with a new police post inside, to signal that the government is wresting control from Mr. Giraldo’s men, who still try to extort an “inoculation” fee for “protection” in his name. The heavy police presence jumps out at visitors, but in general the region hides its   history, and lurking menace, well. It is nearly impossible to imagine   bodies buried in secret graves beneath this   landscape, where   peaks rise above   beaches dotted with weathered fishing boats as boughs of arborescent ferns dip into rivers with women scrubbing laundry. From the start, Mr. Giraldo’s personal history, pieced together from interviews, court records, government documents and his public confessions, intersected with Colombia’s intense civil conflict. He was born in 1948, the year that kicked off the decade of politically motivated bloodletting known as La Violencia. He did not seem destined for leadership. He had a   education when he left home to become an itinerant farmhand. His lawyer, who likes to turn a phrase, says that even now, Mr. Giraldo remains “a quintessential campesino at heart”  —   “the kind of guy who wants to get up at the crack of dawn, and draw lines in the hardened earth under a blazing sun. ” By the 1970s, Mr. Giraldo was rising early to get in on “la bonanza marimbera”  —   the marijuana boom that preceded the cocaine boom. He organized a mule transport service to gather the marijuana from isolated farms and deliver it to the coast. He was first drawn into violence after his younger brother was killed during a robbery at the Santa Marta market. To avenge the death, Mr. Giraldo contracted a private security group led by a thug called Dracula six men were murdered at the start of a long “social cleansing” campaign to eliminate “undesirables”  —   thieves, prostitutes, homosexuals, unfaithful women, witches and leftists. After Dracula himself was killed, Mr. Giraldo took over his business, inheriting its subsidiary interest in the nascent cocaine industry controlled by the Medellín cartel. He transformed the   security group into a ragtag militia when the FARC sought a foothold in his territory and tried three times to assassinate him. His troops trained under an Israeli mercenary, and to practice what they had learned, they slaughtered union workers at banana farms that were supposedly guerrilla strongholds. Mr. Giraldo was arrested as a mastermind of the massacres. That was when he came onto the Americans’ radar, identified in a diplomatic cable as a “  assassin of the Medellín cartel” whose detention “demonstrates that Colombian officials are not turning a blind eye to murders committed by the rightists. ” Eventually he was convicted and sentenced to 20 years. But by that point, eluding justice, he had exiled himself in the remote Sierra Nevada. From there he ruled his dominion for almost two more decades, protected by a personal security detail of 200 men but also by the elite families that backed him and the rural people dependent on him, the local authorities say. “He didn’t use a camp per se, like the guerrillas,” Ms. Zúñiga said. “His camp was the community because he was part of the community. So the houses were his houses, the farms were his farms. “Despite being, for us, a criminal, he was always seen with much respect  —   and not just respect out of fear, but respect for the order he gave to the area, because there was a great absence of the state there. ” When Mr. Henríquez’s older daughter, Nadiezhda, first met Mr. Giraldo, she encountered an almost benign side of him as a local authority. A young teacher then, she appreciated it when Mr. Giraldo resolved a dispute between her tiny school and the local fishermen storing their gear in the classrooms. She also got a glimpse at his more sinister side, however. She lost her three female students when their mother sent them away to protect them from El Patrón. “He was starting to rape girls,” she said. Like a feudal overlord, Mr. Giraldo exercised “a kind of droit du seigneur” over girls in the region, said a Colombian law enforcement official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the news media. “People brought him their daughters or facilitated his sexual relations with them because it was a way to safeguard their lives  —   if you have ties to the chief, you feel protected,” he said. After Mr. Giraldo laid down his arms, a prosecutor asked him at a public hearing why he was called the Drill. He blushed, but seemed proud of the nickname, observers said. The prosecutor then asked pointedly if it had anything to do with rumors that he liked virgin girls. “That could be,” he said. Colombian prosecutors began to take a closer look at his relations with girls and women, starting with the mothers of the 24 children he acknowledges. Eventually, they labeled Mr. Giraldo “the biggest sexual predator of paramilitarism. ” In the Justice and Peace process, he accepted responsibility for 35 acts of   violence  —   some committed by his subordinates  —   including the rape of 11 girls under age 14. The prosecutors’ summary of the cases reads like a litany of uninformed consent wrapped inside a pathological dynamic. Victim No. 6: “It is documented that in the month of October of 2004,” the girl, referred to as Yajanis, visited an aunt who worked at Mr. Giraldo’s ranch. A few months later, “he proposed that she be his girlfriend, a proposition that she accepted, and on Dec. 25, 2004, they had their first sexual relations, when Yajanis was barely 13. ” He was 56. Based on an analysis of birth certificates, Humanas Colombia, a feminist organization, estimated that at least 13 underage girls bore children who were the “product of violent carnal intercourse committed” by Mr. Giraldo. Nine were under 14 when they gave birth. And some victims were probably too young to get pregnant, like the    daughter of one of his cooks. Adriana Benjumea Rúa, the director of Humanas, said Mr. Giraldo had bought the child dolls and instructed her, ‘Never tell your mama, because I will kill her. ’” From the moment police inspectors arrived here to investigate the disappearance of Julio Henríquez, they were stonewalled. “The law of silence prevailed,” a police report said. Mr. Henríquez’s wife and older daughter had faced the same fears when they rushed to this village after getting the phone call that he had been abducted. “Leave it alone,” they were told, which infuriated Nadiezhda Henríquez Chacín, 42, now a human rights lawyer and a fierce one. “They will kill me one day, but it won’t be because I was afraid,” she said in an interview in Bogotá. An ardent environmentalist, her father himself had been fearless, determined to work alongside farmers and fishermen to reclaim the rugged region from the drug trade, she said. On his large property, he was creating a nature preserve, planting indigenous trees and uprooting marijuana and coca planted without his consent. He was not antidrug in a moralistic way, but alarmed by the deforestation caused by coca cultivation, his daughter said. Mr. Giraldo maintained at a hearing in Colombia that he had no direct involvement in Mr. Henríquez’s disappearance, but that he had instructed his men, “Everything that smells of subversion has to be removed from the area. ” And Mr. Henríquez had belonged to the   guerrilla movement, though he had been granted amnesty 17 years before his abduction. But his new activism  —   he had just formed a nongovernmental organization called Mother Earth  —   was a   threat, an   soldier, Carmelo Sierra, told prosecutors. “It’s obvious Mr. Hernán did not agree with what this man was proposing to the peasants, because he grows coca  —   and because encroaching on his turf was sufficient motive to kill somebody,” Mr. Sierra testified. “The Mafia does not forgive. ” Mr. Sierra said Mr. Giraldo had sent a son, El Grillo (the Cricket) to deliver a warning: Leave town or deal with the consequences. But Mr. Henríquez did not budge. So seven of Mr. Giraldo’s men were plucked from a morning lineup, instructed to change into civilian clothing, loaded onto a flatbed and sent down the mountain “to disappear the gentleman from the NGO. ” “I sincerely do not know what happened to him,” Mr. Sierra testified. “I don’t know if they slit his throat, or chopped him into pieces. I don’t know how he died nor where they buried him. ” Eight months later, antidrug agents investigating Mr. Giraldo’s business were murdered along with tourists and a hotel worker at a beachside restaurant. This unleashed a big counternarcotics operation and then a bloody paramilitary power struggle, at the end of which Mr. Giraldo’s “resistance front” suffered a hostile takeover by another warlord, Rodrigo  . In 2004, Mr. Giraldo and Mr.   were indicted in Washington in a conspiracy to manufacture and distribute cocaine bound for the United States. In a superseding indictment the next year, prosecutors said the two men controlled or were involved in the shipment of thousands of kilograms of cocaine that left northern Colombia on “  boats,” rigged with extra motors and fuel. In 2006, Mr. Giraldo and over a thousand of his fighters laid down their arms  —   597 of them along with 73, 400 rounds of ammunition  —   in the paramilitary peace process. The next year, Mr. Giraldo’s lawyer provided coordinates that ultimately led the authorities to Mr. Henríquez’s decomposed body in a clandestine grave. Nadiezhda Henríquez attended the exhumation with her mother. It was a chilling coda to years of hoping against hope. “I never thought we would find him as we found him: in a mountain tomb, so very green, beneath a tree, near streams that turn into rivers, with moss and stone of the Sierra Nevada,’’ Ms. Henríquez said in a statement filed with the court on Thursday. “With his two hands tied behind his back and two coups de grâce shots to the head, in clothing that was not his, missing a shoe, missing a foot, missing part of his mouth. Only bones. ” Mr. Henríquez’s family distrusted the Justice and Peace process, and pushed for Mr. Giraldo to be tried in an ordinary criminal court for the forced disappearance. In 2009, after his extradition, he was convicted in absentia, and sentenced to 38½ years in prison and reparations of 1, 000 grams of gold, about $43, 000. By that point, though, he was beyond the reach of Colombian justice. So the Henríquezes took their fight to America. A few months after Mr. Giraldo arrived in the United States, he was transferred to Northern Neck, whose inmate population was a combustible mix of Mexican drug traffickers, Central American gang leaders, “jihadi terrorists,” and Colombian combatants from both sides who got along fine, Mr. Hull, the superintendent, said. “To be honest with you  —   I don’t want to sound like I’m pandering or excusing terrorism  —   but both the FARC and the AUC, they were model inmates,” he said. “I got the vibe: ‘I’m busted, and I’m out.’ Every one of them was cooperating” with prosecutors. None of the paramilitary defendants went to trial. Almost all had private lawyers. Mr. Giraldo said that his family was poor, and that “a friend” was underwriting his American legal costs. Fees could be substantial: A document in Mr.  ’s case reveals that he paid his lawyer $390, 000. “The only people who ever win in the great extradition game are the lawyers,” said Mr. Feitel, Mr. Giraldo’s lawyer. In the men’s defense, their American lawyers highlighted the political backdrop of their crimes, presenting them as freedom fighters whose movement became corrupted by drugs. One defense lawyer, referring to American support for the Colombian military, went so far as to tell a judge that a notorious paramilitary leader named Carlos Jiménez Naranjo “was initially, and we can put it right on the record, financed by our own government. ” The authorities, in some instances, did seem to view the men as “substantively different” from purely   drug lords, as Judge Reggie B. Walton of the United States District Court in Washington put it when he sentenced Mr.   to 16½ years. “He was engaged in trying to fight an enemy that I think, probably, had that enemy won, it would not have enhanced the quality of life for people in Colombia,” the judge said. “So, I mean, he was engaged in some activity that had some positive perspectives. ” Robert Spelke, a retired federal narcotics prosecutor and the one who called Mr. Mancuso a gentleman, said, “Some of these guys were real thugs, but not that many. ” He continued: “It’s hard sometimes to believe they did what they did. Clearly, they did some nasty things. But, you know, it was a civil war down there. I always wanted to believe that if I was put in the same situation, I would have done things differently. But I don’t know. ” Ms. Altholz, who represents the Henríquezes, said she saw an irony: “Because these individuals took some kind of role in fighting ‘the evils of Communism’ embodied in the FARC,” their identity as warlords had become a mitigating rather than aggravating factor in their cases. A Colombian law enforcement official said he had hoped for far stiffer penalties as a   for losing the men to the American justice system. “We all made many sacrifices to pursue them,” he said. “They threatened me. They displaced some of my colleagues. They killed several of my friends. We believed that they were going to get punishment more in line with the damage they did  —   at the least sentences greater than 20 years. ” In those cases examined by The Times, the sentences that could be determined  —   some remain sealed  —   ranged from probation to just over 30 years. Because “time served” was easier to ascertain, and because many sentences were reduced to “time served,” The Times used that as a metric. In exchange for their cooperation, most of the men got sentence reductions  —   sometimes before, sometimes after and sometimes both before and after sentencing. There was one notable exception, as far as The Times could determine. Federal prosecutors in New York declined to allow Diego Murillo Bejarano  —   alias Don Berna  —   to exchange information for benefits. He got 31 years. The one other paramilitary leader who received a sentence over 30 years expects it to be cut by 35 percent to 50 percent because of his cooperation, his lawyers said. In one instance, a senior federal judge in Ocala, Fla. balked at the idea of a second sentence reduction for a paramilitary chief. There reaches a point, said Judge William Terrell Hodges, when any further reduction “tends to denigrate the seriousness of the subject defendant’s criminal behavior and threatens to invite public disrespect for the administration of criminal justice. ” When Hebert Veloza Garcia, known as H. H. was sentenced this spring in Manhattan federal court, a prosecutor pronounced him an “extraordinary defendant”  —   “in terms of his very serious criminal conduct, but also in terms of his extraordinary cooperation. ” In his case, as in most, it is not possible to ascertain precisely how his cooperation helped the American government because specific information is redacted. But Mr. Veloza, according to Ruben Oliva, his lawyer, gave “a   confession” that laid the groundwork for his own indictment, and “his assistance served to deal severe blows to major drug trafficking organizations as well as the violent and corrupt organizations that exist to both serve and prey upon them. ” The American government found Mr. Veloza responsible for trafficking more than 450 kilograms of cocaine. Sentenced to 11½ years, he will be released this fall after seven and a half years behind bars in the United States. Then, despite “all of the horrendous things you’ve done in the course of your life,” Judge William H. Pauley III told him, he will “get the chance to hit the restart button. ” He hopes to stay in the United States, Mr. Oliva said  —   though he has a Justice and Peace sentence awaiting him in Colombia for 85 crimes including torture and homicide. So far, two paramilitary associates have won haven in the United States on their release from prison: Juan Carlos Sierra, known as El Tuso, who spent five years in American prisons, and Carlos Mario Aguilar, alias Rogelio, who spent about seven. Both men have pending arrest warrants in Colombia, Mr. Sierra’s in connection with a murder, according to the Colombian attorney general’s office. Their families have received political asylum, as has the family of a third paramilitary associate, Mauricio López Cardona, known as Yiyo, who has also applied to stay. So, too, has Guillermo Pérez Alzate, a paramilitary leader extradited with Mr. Giraldo and released in June, having served less than half his original sentence. As convicted drug traffickers, these men do not qualify for asylum. Instead, they request a rare form of protection against expulsion under the Convention Against Torture, arguing that they would probably be tortured by their government, now led by President Juan Manuel Santos, a centrist. “I’m not suggesting President Santos would be personally lying in wait,” Mr. Oliva said. “But these guys wouldn’t make it out of the airport. Literally, they’d whack them in the airport. ” Mr. Samper, the former justice official, whose father was president of Colombia in the 1990s, called this argument “unbelievable. ” “We have the world’s finest individual protection program, as recognized by the   Human Rights Commission,” he said. As a warlord and a drug lord, Salvatore Mancuso was a bigger player than Mr. Giraldo. He was also, unlike Mr. Giraldo, verbosely apologetic. Once he entered the Colombian transitional justice process, he talked and talked. He even sobbed as he asked forgiveness of his victims. Then he was extradited, and after almost a year went by, he felt compelled to take action “to prevent the stagnation and virtual death” of Justice and Peace. Or so he said in a florid letter to an unlikely pen pal  —   Piedad Córdoba, then a Liberal Party senator and a victim of a paramilitary kidnapping. “Respected Senator,” he wrote. “The situation that arose from our extradition has generated a state of helplessness, both for the victims and for us. ” In a kind of private truth and reconciliation effort, Ms. Córdoba, along with victims’ advocates including Mr. Cepeda, traveled to the United States for jailhouse meetings with Mr. Mancuso  —   prison officials declined to let him be interviewed by The Times  —   and other warlords. Mr. Cepeda said he asked one of them point blank if he knew who had killed his father, a leftist senator murdered in 1994. The paramilitary leader, Don Berna, not only threw out some names but agreed to reveal them to Colombian prosecutors, he said. It took six months to arrange a meeting. “Finally, the stars aligned and we went with a Colombian prosecutor, and somebody from the Department of Justice, and succeeded in obtaining his testimony,” Mr. Cepeda said. “But that was me. A campesino from Córdoba or Antioquia, where there are thousands of victims, would never have been able to go through this exercise. ” Colombia’s attorney general and justices joined advocates in complaining to the Obama administration, which had inherited the cases, that their pursuit of justice was being thwarted. As a result, in 2010, the Justice Department created an “access plan,” promising to make about a dozen key paramilitaries available for   or video interviews  —   if the men were willing. Mr. Carr, spokesman for the Justice Department, said that more than 2, 000 video depositions and interviews with paramilitary leaders had taken place, and that some had been televised to centers in Colombia from which victims could ask questions. Still, even in the cases of those leaders like Mr. Mancuso who participated most actively, these sessions were insufficient, according to a Colombian prosecutor who testified last year in his case. “In total, we progressed maybe 8 percent of what we have to progress,” said the prosecutor, Giovanni Álvarez Santoyo. He noted that Mr. Mancuso had been charged in 4, 800 “matters,” from “murder to forced disappearances, through forced removals, recruiting of minors, sexual violence, sexual slavery, and related crimes such as kidnapping, terrorism, theft and destruction of protected property. ” It is impossible to know how things would have been different if the leaders had not been extradited  —   whether more truth would have been divulged, whether greater or quicker justice would have been done, and whether the paramilitary groups would have been more successfully, or less successfully, dismantled. Iván Velásquez, who led the Supreme Court’s paramilitary corruption investigation, said at a forum in Bogotá a few years ago that the   by paramilitary leaders was not impressive before or after the extraditions. “Many of them reduced a good part of their ‘collaboration,’ as we call their obligation to tell the truth, to relating in a decontextualized manner the murders committed  —   justifying them by portraying their victims as guerrillas dressed in civilian clothing  —   and revealing the locations of graves,” he said. Guaranteeing “nonrepetition” of their atrocities would have required far more  —   “revelations about the sponsors, financiers, promoters, beneficiaries or owners of those criminal structures, which in many cases remain intact,” he said. Over the past decade, 128   members have been sentenced in the Justice and Peace process, out of more than 1, 000 detained, according to the Colombian government. But even as the country prepares to set up another transitional justice system for the FARC, Justice and Peace keeps inching forward. As do the   inquiries: In February, Mr. Uribe’s younger brother, Santiago, was arrested for supposed ties to a death squad, the Twelve Apostles. The former president himself was investigated last year for alleged paramilitary ties, but not charged. Now a senator, he considers investigations of him and his family to be politically motivated. Mr. Uribe is the most virulent critic of his successor’s peace deal with the guerrillas he accuses Mr. Santos of what he himself was accused of in relation to the militias: offering impunity to war criminals. President Santos has said he hopes that one dividend of the peace accord will be a reduction in the drug trafficking that financed the internal armed conflict. Coca cultivation has been soaring in Colombia, with a significant increase over the last couple of years in acreage dedicated to drug crops. Extradition as a panacea has fallen out of favor. Colombia extraditions to the United States were half as frequent in 2015  —   109  —   as the year the paramilitary leaders were sent away. And the new accord, if approved by voters, would guarantee the guerrilla leaders protection against extradition for their drug smuggling  —   with the blessing of the Americans. “If you want to see that as the U. S.’s contribution to the peace process, you’re welcome to do so,” Kevin Whitaker, the American ambassador to Colombia, told Radio Caracol. This year, two young women cautiously approached the authorities in Santa Marta. They had decided to reveal that they had been victims of Mr. Giraldo’s sexual violence even after he surrendered and pledged to stop committing crimes. When they were under 14, they said, they were taken to Mr. Giraldo for conjugal visits, both in a special detention zone for paramilitary members and later in a jail. So potentially damaging are their allegations that the young women are now in protective custody. “This year, it fell to me, initially, to protect the two girls who made the denunciations, and we got them out of the area because Giraldo’s sons were going to kill them,” said Ms. Zúñiga, the Santa Marta security chief. Mr. Giraldo called the allegations “lies. ” “Lots of victims are popping up in Colombia because they give them money,” he said, referring to reparations, which relatively few victims have obtained. If proved, the allegations would be grounds to deny Mr. Giraldo the   alternative sentence he would get under Justice and Peace. He would face spending the rest of his life in a Colombian prison  —   if the United States sent him back. This is an eventuality that the Henríquezes do not think they can bank on. It took almost eight years for the United States to recognize them as victims of standing in Mr. Giraldo’s American case. Their lawyers took a novel approach in arguing that the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2004 applied to them. They argued that even though Mr. Henríquez was a foreign victim of a foreign crime, his murder was a consequence of the drug conspiracy to which Mr. Giraldo pleaded guilty. The Justice Department did not agree, and for years did not confer with the Henriquezes about major case decisions or keep them apprised of proceedings. And the Henríquezes were in the complete dark because the Justice Department had gotten the judge to seal key events and records in the case  —   as well as to seal its motion requesting the sealing. It was not until the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press filed suit last year that the docket for the case was made public. Although Judge Walton initially denied the Henríquezes status as victims, he changed his mind after the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia urged him to reconsider. “I think the movants have established their burden of showing that but for the defendant’s involvement in the conspiracy the decedent would not have been killed,” he said at a hearing in March. Mr. Feitel, who considers the Henríquezes “pesky, phony victims barking at my client’s heels,” was disappointed. From a broader perspective, Paul G. Cassell, a former federal judge and an expert on victims’ rights, said international drug smuggling cases were generally treated like victimless crimes. “This is truly ” he said. It could have implications for violent drug lords like Joaquín Guzmán  —   El Chapo  —   whose extradition has been approved by Mexico. After the March hearing, Ms. Altholz called Mr. Henríquez’s daughters from outside the federal courthouse. “Ganamos!” she said. “We won!” The Henríquez sisters do not like to talk to each other about developments in the case because it dredges up their grief. “We’re like those little rubber dolls where you push a button and they fall apart,” Bela Henríquez said. “But I was happy. ” Nadiezhda Henríquez was more guarded. “These rights are merely procedural,” she said. “This has meaning, but it’s pretty limited in terms of what is internationally recognized as victims’ rights: truth, justice and reparation. ” In its prosecutions of the Colombian warlords, she said, the American government engaged in “negotiations over justice, and that is not justice. ” It focused on the harm done to the United States, and not on “what they did to us. ” The Henríquezes are asking for the maximum penalty for Mr. Giraldo  —   just short of life in prison. At the least, Ms. Henríquez said, “we want sufficient time so that this can be dismantled, so that in my land there can be peace. ” Whether the paramilitary forces were ever truly dismantled, and what role the extraditions played, have been matters of debate in Colombia. But the illegal armed groups  —   called bacrims, short for criminal bands in Spanish  —   that surged after the militias disbanded are formally considered their successors in the peace accord. In the Santa Marta region, the most recent   of   violence occurred in late 2013. Hundreds of civilians were forced to flee their mountain villages during a bloody confrontation between the Giraldo Clan and a rival group that lasted four months and left hundreds dead. Since then, his relatives have mainly fought one another. “If Giraldo were here in jail rather than in Virginia, we wouldn’t see the territorial disputes,” Ms. Zúñiga said. Still, she added, “I don’t think Santa Marta is ready for him to return. ” Bela Henríquez, though her American visa is pending, said she looked forward to confronting in a Washington courtroom the man convicted in absentia for her father’s disappearance. “I don’t know what Hernán Giraldo will be thinking, but at least he will have to see that the crimes he committed in Colombia have not been forgotten,” she said. “He will have to recognize that his ‘business’ cost lives, and not just the lives of one leader or one community. It will affect the families who had to bear the brunt of the violence, yes. But it will also influence the history of our whole country for generations to come. ”",0
9853,NBC Will Bring Back ‘Will &amp Grace’ - The New York Times,"In an era of revivals and reboots, this may have been inevitable. NBC announced on Wednesday that it was bringing back its celebrated comedy “Will  Grace” for 10 episodes during the   TV season. The show’s original cast  —   Eric McCormack, Debra Messing, Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally  —   will all return, as will the show’s director, James Burrows, and the show’s creators, Max Mutchnick and David Kohan. TV is going through a 1990s and early 2000s nostalgia craze, and “Will  Grace” is far from the first show to make a comeback. Netflix’s “Full House” revival, “Fuller House,” has already had two seasons. The streaming service also brought back “Gilmore Girls” in November. Fox brought back “The  ” with its original cast, and it was a ratings hit for the network last year. “Twin Peaks” will return in May, with many of the original cast members. “Will  Grace,” which ran from 1998 to 2006, was a hit and a critical darling  —   each of the lead cast members won an Emmy for their roles, and the show won the best comedy Emmy in its second season. NBC is having the strongest year among the big four networks in the most important audience to advertisers: adults under 50. But it is still in the midst of retooling its comedy slate, and “Will  Grace” could give it a shot in the arm whenever the show winds up running in the next season. Robert Greenblatt, chairman of NBC Entertainment, said in a statement, “This groundbreaking series for everything from gay rights to social and political commentary  —   all disguised as a   train of witty pop culture  —   is coming back where it belongs. ”",0

9855,UNsilenced: Whistleblower Exposes UN Culture of Corruption,"Email 
When she stumbled across massive corruption and made-up statistics in her job at the United Nations, Rasna Warah knew she needed to act. But when she tried to blow the whistle, she was viciously attacked, publicly humiliated, threatened, intimidated, and more. Unfortunately, though, as Warah explains in her new book UNsilenced: UNmasking the United Nations' Culture of Cover-ups, Corruption and Impunity , her case is far from unique. 
In fact, the corruption and lawlessness across the UN appears to be systemic. Some of the cases described in the book and the pages of The New American magazine make the scandals she exposed and the retaliation she suffered seem mild by comparison. Indeed, in her book, she actually spends very little time dwelling on her own case, but delves instead into some of the many other known and unknown scandals to rock the global organization. 
Perhaps the most grotesque whistleblower-related story in recent memory surrounds the now-infamous case of Anders Kompass, the UN human-rights official who exposed child-rape by “peacekeeping” troops in Africa after the UN refused to act on it. But the book is filled with startling examples of corruption, mismanagement, and more, ranging from brazen theft of taxpayer money to the sexual abuse and exploitation of children by UN “peace” troops. Just the quotes from the UN whistleblowers exposing the putrid UN culture of impunity make the book worth reading. Apparently the UN did not want a “culture of snitches,” as one whistleblower put it. 
It got so bad that in 2015, as Warah explains, a coalition of nine UN whistleblowers got together to raise the matter with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon. “Each of us has blown the whistle on serious wrongdoing, gross misconduct, and even criminal acts at the United Nations,” the group wrote in the letter, which is quoted in the book. “Our collective experience of reporting misconduct in the UN covers sexual exploitation, abuse of power, corruption, and other criminals activity over a period of more than a decade and a half.” 
Instead of the UN scrambling to make things right, though, it responded in every case by attacking the whistleblower instead of the crimes, abuse, and the people behind the problems. “Each of us has faced retaliation for reporting the wrongdoing,” the whistleblowers continued. “Our cases are well-known, and sadly, deter others from reporting wrongdoing. This must change.” Unfortunately for humanity, despite threats from Congress to cut funding, and increasingly widespread media attention, nothing has changed, as the book documents extensively. 
Warah's realization that something was very wrong at the UN began while she was serving at UN-Habitat as an editor of various publications, including the important “State of the World's Cities” report. Her troubles began in 2009, when she traveled to Bahrain with Anna Tibaijuka, the executive director of the UN-Habitat agency that focuses on promoting “sustainable” cities. During the visit, Warah explained, some Bahrain officials asked how their money was being used. 
“The executive director did not provide an adequate response, and thinking that perhaps she had not been briefed about it, I made my own inquiries when I returned to Nairobi,” explained Warah, a Kenyan of Indian heritage. “I discovered that at least $350,000 of the $1 million donation Bahrain had made to UN-Habitat could not be accounted for. When I asked my supervisors if they knew where the money went, they descended on me like a tonne of bricks, even threatening to not talk to me any more.” 
At that time, Warah realized that “the money had probably been used on personal projects or maybe even diverted to individuals within the organization.” In an interesting turn of events, Warah later concluded that the monarchy in Bahrain did not even really care if its money has been used properly. Instead, it seems that the regime was involved in a sort of tit-for-tat agreement. 
“In 2007, the Prime Minister of Bahrain, Shaikh Khalifa, had been awarded the UN-Habitat Scroll on Honour award for ´his outstanding efforts in raising the living standards of Bahrainis,´” Warah added in an e-mail about her experiences. “This was just before Bahrain experienced its own Arab spring, when the monarchy's legitimacy was being questioned. The huge donation to UN-Habitat was probably how Bahrain's monarchy 'bought' international legitimacy through the UN.” 
Around that same time, Warah had already started to question how some of the alleged statistics used in the State of the World's Cities reports were actually being computed. “Many UN agencies deliberately exaggerate the scale of a problem or disseminate statistics that are not based on any scientific survey or research,” she wrote in the book. Many also “manufacture data,” she added, “because that is how they remain relevant, how they push their agenda on the international stage, and how they attract donor [taxpayer] funding.” 
Sometimes UN officials and other international bureaucracies make up numbers and lie to coerce governments into changing policies, she explained. The book cites a number of examples of cooked up numbers to justify bigger budgets, more power and prestige, and various policy prescriptions. Some of the alleged “famines” in Somalia, for example, appear to have been concocted by UN bureaucrats by simply inventing or massaging statistics. Clueless journalists then parrot the invented UN numbers as part of a process that Warah referred to as the “CNN effect.” 
Warah considers it a crime akin to plagiarism that should be severely punished. “When a UN agency publishes inaccurate, misleading, or unscientific statistics, it is even more unforgivable because the world's governments (i.e. member states of the UN) rely on those statistics to determine their national policies, priorities, and programs,” she continued, adding that “millions of people's lives can be affected by a single misleading or erroneous statistic.” 
In particular, during her stint editing the UN world cities report, she was concerned about the “Gini coefficient” numbers used for cities, which seek to measure income inequality. She tried to figure out how these were being arrived at. Unsurprisingly, her superiors at the UN office were not pleased with the curiosity and additional scrutiny, Warah explained. 
“My questioning resulted in several acts of retaliation, including public humiliation at office meetings, threats of non-renewal of contract, intimidating questioning during an interview for a post I had applied for and petty revenges, like forcing me to share my office with visiting consultants, even though I had made it clear that as editor of this important report I needed privacy and silence to carry out my work,” she explained in an e-mail. “I left the organization soon after due to frustration and a sense that my supervisors were hell-bent on making my life miserable.” 
In response to the retaliation, Warah filed an official complaint at the UN “Ethics Office,” which is supposed to investigate claims and provide relief to whistleblowers. The office claimed that, “while there probably was evidence of wrongdoing at UN-Habitat, they could not establish whether I had experienced any retaliation,” Warah said, adding that determining whether retaliation took place is key to getting justice from the UN's internal systems. 
The book also contains a very informative introduction by Beatrice Edwards, the international program director at the whistleblower advocacy group Government Accountability Project. Despite her general acceptance of the UN line regarding why it was founded and its alleged humanitarian purposes, Edwards highlights a number of extremely serious issues. Among those is the fact that UN personnel enjoy immunity from national and local laws, leading to a total lack of accountability that produces lawlessness and impunity. She also blasts the UN's supposed “internal system of justice” as subject to manipulation, calling its set-up “increasingly opaque and arbitrary.” 
And indeed, as the book shows, the UN's pseudo-justice system is almost tragically discredited, and totally undeserving of the term “justice.” According to the book, only between three percent and four percent of whistleblowers who sought assistance from the UN “Ethics Office” had the retaliation against them substantiated by the “Ethics” people. That means a stunning 96 percent or more of whistleblowers who reported being persecuted for blowing the whistle at the UN received no relief. 
Imagine being a UN worker who has observed criminality, and thinking about those odds. Of course, most people would simply choose to stay silent rather than jeopardize their career and livelihood for such meager odds. And so, with potential whistleblowers terrorized into submission, the widespread corruption, criminality and other horrors that plague the UN go unreported. The UN knows that, too, as it acknowledges in its reports about the drastic under-reporting of sexual exploitation and abuse of women and children by its scandal-plagued “peace” troops. 
When Warah tried to blow the whistle and seek relief, she witnessed the failures firsthand. “Since the Ethics Office could not determine retaliation, I could not take my case forward,” she explained. “Later I realized that the Ethics Office fails to prove retaliation in about 98 per cent of the whistleblower cases it receives, which suggests that it protects senior UN management rather than UN whistleblowers.” Numerous UN whistleblowers who have spoken to this magazine in recent years have made the exact same charge, and the UN has done little to dispel that notion. 
“The UN's culture of impunity ensures that those who do not rock the boat with uncomfortable truths get promoted while those who dare to speak out are castigated, ignored, demoted or fired,” wrote Warah in the book. “This is especially true in cases where the perpetrators of crimes are from powerful or influential countries that exert political pressure to ensure that their nationals' cases are not brought forward or are buried.” Think about the implications of that. 
In the case of Danish UN diplomat Paul Bang-Jensen, who blew the whistle on the deliberate sabotage of a UN probe into Soviet atrocities in Hungary, and tried to protect the identity of witnesses to protect them and their families from torture and murder, the saga ended with his suspicious “suicide.” His death came after he had told his wife and others not to believe any claims that he would commit suicide. The New American magazine will publish an in-depth story on Bang-Jensen in the coming weeks. 
There is so much more to learn from the UNsilenced book. For instance, Warah describes how international “aid” outfits bring in huge quantities of tax-funded food supplies right around harvest time, flooding the market with basically “free” food in huge quantities. This crushes prices, thereby destroying the incentive for locals to farm while perpetuating dependence on corrupt agencies funded by Western taxpayers, in addition to ensuring budget increases for global bureaucrats. 
Another interesting fact brought out in the book: The British government's tax-funded propaganda arm, the BBC, has an unwritten policy that prevents the “news” agency from “coming down too hard” on the UN or its senior bureaucrats. The reason, according to an unnamed BBC journalist cited by Warah, is that exposing UN wrongdoing and crime might be perceived as “anti-development.” Other self-styled media organs refuse to expose UN wrongdoing because the left-wing journalists fear being associated with right-of-center individuals who want to shut down the UN, Warah, herself a left-winger, acknowledges in UNsilenced . 
Some of the ideas proposed in the book to remedy the many problems include reforming the UN's internal justice system, setting up outside independent mechanisms, ensuring protection of whistleblowers, and more. Unfortunately, though, none of those recommendations get to the heart of the problem, which is that the dictator-dominated UN was flawed from the start and cannot be “reformed” enough to make it worth keeping. Surely protection for whistleblowers is needed — if only to ferret out criminals and bring them to justice, and to protect their victims, often children. But it will not solve the broader UN problem. 
If there is anything to quibble about with the book, it is that it accepts as true many of the fundamental (and false) premises upon which the UN was established — the idea that “world peace” was the goal of leading UN founders such as butcher Joseph Stalin of Moscow and Soviet spy Alger Hiss of the United States, for instance. The book also occasionally treats leftist ideological claims — the idea that governments are responsible for feeding people, as just one example — as if they were facts. The ideological lens through which Warah reports, though, is easy to discern, and does not interfere with, or take away from, the excellent and brave work she has done exposing this cesspool of corruption and crime. 
The book is well worth reading for anybody seeking information on UN corruption or the persecution of UN whistleblowers who try to do the right thing. For the sake of humanity and liberty, it needs to stop. Photos: Rasna Warah and her book UNsilenced

9857,Lionel Shriver’s Address on Cultural Appropriation Roils a Writers Festival - The New York Times,"BRISBANE, Australia  —   Officials in charge of an Australian writers festival were so upset with the address by their keynote speaker, the American novelist Lionel Shriver, that they publicly disavowed her remarks. Links to her appearance were also temporarily unavailable on the festival website, leading supporters of Ms. Shriver to complain of censorship, but festival officials said it was only a technical malfunction on their website, which was repaired later. The event, the Brisbane Writers Festival, which ended Sunday, also hurriedly organized counterprogramming, billed as a “right of reply” for critics of Ms. Shriver, whose speech belittled the movement against cultural appropriation. They scheduled the rebuttal opposite a session Saturday afternoon in which Ms. Shriver was promoting her new novel, “The Mandibles. ” Ms. Shriver had been billed as speaking on “community and belonging” but focused on her views about cultural appropriation, a term that refers to the objections by members of minority groups to the use of their customs or culture (or even characters of their ethnicity) by artists or others who do not belong to those groups. Ms. Shriver criticized as runaway political correctness efforts to ban references to ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation from Halloween celebrations, or to prevent artists from drawing on ethnic sources for their work. Ms. Shriver, the author of 13 novels, who is best known for her 2003 book, “We Need to Talk About Kevin,” was especially critical of efforts to stop novelists from cultural appropriation. She deplored critics of authors like Chris Cleave, an Englishman, for presuming to write from the point of view of a Nigerian girl in his   book “Little Bee. ” Ms. Shriver noted that she had been criticized for using in “The Mandibles” the character of a black woman with Alzheimer’s disease, who is kept on a leash by her homeless white husband. And she defended her right to depict members of minority groups in any situation, if it served her artistic purposes. “Otherwise, all I could write about would be          white women from North Carolina,” she said. Ms. Shriver donned a sombrero for much of her speech  —   an allusion to a case in the United States in which articles of impeachment were drawn up (and later rescinded) against   student government members for doing the same during a   tequila party at Bowdoin College. To frequent laughter from the audience, Ms. Shriver warned that the    movement that began in America had already reached Britain  —   where she lives most of the year  —   and might be headed to Australia. Actually, it seems to have already arrived. In the middle of Ms. Shriver’s speech on Thursday night, an Australian writer of Sudanese and Egyptian origin, Yassmin   got up and walked out, making live posts on Twitter about her dismay at what she described as “a poisoned package wrapped up in arrogance and delivered with condescension. ” “I have never walked out of a speech,” Ms.   wrote in a post published on Medium. com and Guardian. com. But Ms. Shriver’s, she added, “became a celebration of the unfettered exploitation of the experiences of others, under the guise of fiction. ” The movement against cultural appropriation has grown in recent years, targeting singers like Miley Cyrus, who “twerk” onstage, and white men who wear  dreadlocks. After her Brisbane speech, Ms. Shriver was accosted by a festival participant in the hallway of the State Library of Queensland, who shouted, “How dare you come to my country and offend our minorities?” The author said that the woman had clearly not actually heard her speech, which made no mention of Australian minorities. The festival’s director, the poet Julie Beveridge, responded to the outrage by organizing the “right of reply” session, inviting as speakers Ms.   as well as the   author Suki Kim, whose   book “Without You, There Is No Us,” was based on her six months working undercover as an English teacher in North Korea. Ms. Kim complained that books by white male writers on North Korea were better received in some quarters than books like her own. Adam Johnson’s “The Orphan Master’s Son” won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 2013, though Mr. Johnson did not speak Korean and had spent only three days in North Korea, Ms. Kim said. She attributed that acclaim at least partly to racism from institutions dominated by white men. “The reality is that those from marginalized groups, even today, do not get the luxury of defining their own place in a norm that is profoundly white, straight and, often, patriarchal,” Ms.   said in her criticism of Ms. Shriver. Ms. Beveridge wrote on the festival’s website, after links to Ms. Shriver’s speech were taken down, “As a festival of writers and thinkers, we take seriously the role we play in providing a platform for meaningful exchange and debate. ” She could not be reached on Monday to ask why links to Ms. Shriver’s speech were removed from the festival website. Links to the rebuttal remained active. Ms. Beveridge has said that the festival’s keynote speech was intended to set the tone for the festival, which drew scores of authors to this eastern Australian city. “Lionel Shriver, by her own admission, did not speak to her brief,” Ms. Beveridge said. “The views expressed during her address were hers alone. ” Ms. Shriver described the festival’s response as “not very professional,” and, at a later appearance at the festival, said she was disturbed by how many of those on the political left had become what she described as censorious and totalitarian in their treatment of artists with whom they disagreed.",0

From ABC News : At least 17 people were killed and over 40 injured in Chicago’s street violence over the weekend. 
Two Chicago newspapers that analyzed police data from Friday afternoon to early Monday called it 2016’s deadliest weekend . Chicago police couldn’t immediately confirm that, though a spokesman said their weekend homicide count from Friday midnight through Sunday was 18. 
Either way, the toll surpassed the Chicago Tribune and Sun-Times’ analysis of holiday weekends when violence typically spikes. The Tribune reports six people were fatally shot over Memorial Day weekend, five over Fourth of July, and 13 over Labor Day . 
The October weekend deaths included seven people under 20 years old. Seventeen-year-old twin brothers were killed in a Sunday drive-by.

9859,"If Trump Gets His Way, Real Estate Will Get Even More Tax Breaks - The New York Times","It’s hard to imagine a tax code more favorable to real estate developers than the one we already have. Donald Trump has come up with one. Thanks to some major loopholes in the existing tax code that treat real estate developers as a special privileged class, it’s entirely possible (even likely) that Mr. Trump pays little or no federal income tax. But Mr. Trump’s new tax proposal doesn’t just preserve those breaks, it piles on new ones for real estate developers like Mr. Trump himself  —   at an estimated cost of more than $1 trillion in tax revenue over a decade. Moreover, this doesn’t count Mr. Trump’s more general tax cuts, which deliver the biggest windfalls to the highest earners. Many real estate developers would reap further gains from those provisions if they became law. Even conservative Republican tax experts have denounced the specific real estate measures Mr. Trump has outlined. “If you want to create a recipe for an abusive tax shelter, take those elements and bake for 15 minutes,” said Douglas   an economist who served as director of the Congressional Budget Office and is now president of the American Action Forum, a conservative   advocacy group. He was also an economic policy adviser to former Republican presidential candidate John McCain. “It’s a phenomenal benefit for housing and commercial real estate interests. ” Let’s start with carried interest, a   tax loophole that allows private equity operators, hedge fund managers and real estate partners to convert ordinary income into capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate. Wealthy hedge fund managers and private equity partners like the former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney have attracted much of the criticism for exploiting the loophole, but the concept originated with real estate developers long before hedge funds were commonplace. Instead of taking a fee for their management services (which would be taxed as ordinary income) people who earn carried interest take a percentage of assets under management and a percentage of the eventual profits, a formula often described as “two and twenty. ” The percentage of profits is taxed at the lower capital gains rate. In what at first might seem a laudable effort to put the public interest ahead of his own financial gain, Mr. Trump called for abolishing the loophole. “We will eliminate the carried interest deduction and other special interest loopholes that have been so good for Wall Street investors, and people like me, but unfair to American workers,” Mr. Trump said in Detroit on Aug. 7. But his fellow real estate investors and the Wall Street interests he lambastes needn’t worry. He’s offering them an even better tax break that renders carried interest irrelevant. Mr. Trump has proposed a new rate  —   15 percent on all corporate and business income  —   that is lower than the current capital gains rate of 20 percent on profits from the sale of assets, which is already well below the top tax rate on ordinary income of around 40 percent. The new lower rate would apply to “  entities,” according to Mr. Trump’s plan, “Tax Reform That Will Make America Great Again. ”   entities pay no tax at the business level as the name suggests, income is taxed at individual rates when it is distributed to the owners. Such entities include limited liability companies, or L. L. C. s, and sole proprietorships, S Corporations, and many partnerships. The   Tax Foundation estimates that they account for 60 percent of all business income in the United States. While they can be found in all sectors of the economy (including private equity and hedge funds) they are especially prevalent in real estate. Mr. Trump identified 564 separate business entities in his financial disclosure forms, most of them L. L. C.s and partnerships. That amounts to a huge tax cut even for people who had been paying taxes on carried interest at the preferential rate, “since most carried interest is generated by a business entity,” said Alan Cole, an economist at the Tax Foundation’s Center for Federal Tax Policy. The center warned last year, before Mr. Trump’s latest revisions, that his overall plan could cost over $10 trillion in reduced tax revenues over 10 years, depending on how it is calculated. “The rich who already benefit from carried interest will get a big tax cut,” Mr.   agreed. The   Tax Policy Center estimated that lowering the rate on business income from   entities to 15 percent would cost $1 trillion over 10 years. Mr. Trump already benefits from enormous depreciation benefits, which allow active real estate developers like him to use paper losses to offset other earned income. Mr. Trump’s proposals go even further, allowing for immediate   rather than spreading them over several years. “We will allow businesses to immediately expense new business investments,” he said in Detroit. The idea of immediately expensing capital investments rather than writing them off over time has many supporters among tax experts, including the Tax Foundation and Mr.  . Among other things, it simplifies the calculations and in theory would promote capital spending at a time it’s been lagging. But few, if any, support expensing capital investments while also allowing an interest expense deduction. That’s because the combined deductions provide a reason to borrow even when it doesn’t make economic sense. As a simple example, consider a landlord’s $1, 000 investment in a new garage door for a rental property. Someone who borrows $900 at 5 percent would spend just $100 out of pocket, but could deduct $900 plus interest, or $945, generating a large tax loss. Even assuming Mr. Trump’s favorable business tax rate of 15 percent goes into effect, the tax benefit ($142) is greater than the cash spent, creating a purely tax incentive. Here’s what the 2005 President’s Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform under President George W. Bush concluded: “Allowing both expensing of new investments and an interest deduction would result in a net tax subsidy to new investment,” the report found. “Projects that would not be economical in a   world might become viable just because of the tax subsidy. This would result in economic distortions and adversely impact economic activity. ” Steven M. Rosenthal, a veteran tax lawyer and senior fellow at the   Tax Policy Center, put it in   terms Mr. Trump might use: “Coupling an interest deduction with expensing is ridiculous. ” Every other proposal to expense business investments, including the House Republican plan, limits interest deductions. Eliminating the interest deduction “will generate an enormous amount of kvetching out of highly leveraged investors, real estate developers among them,” said Mr.  . “I have no sympathy for that. If your business model depends on interest deductibility, that’s not a business, it’s a tax shelter. ” Mr. Trump hasn’t explicitly addressed whether interest payments should remain deductible, as they are now, but various advisers have said he supports maintaining the deduction. (The Trump campaign didn’t respond to my requests for comment.) That shouldn’t be all that surprising, given how much debt Mr. Trump’s empire carries. The Times recently estimated his companies have at least $650 million in debt. “Trump is a debt king,” said Mr. Rosenthal. “He’s made a living from deducting interest. He’s never going to give that up. ” The changes and inconsistencies in Mr. Trump’s tax reform proposals have left many experts scratching their heads. “Trump has no overarching principle that I can identify,” said Mr.  . “I want a tax code to express values. It should be about something,” That leaves it open to speculation that Mr. Trump’s plan is mostly about himself and other wealthy real estate developers. It’s hard to tell for sure, since he hasn’t released his tax returns. If, as I’ve suggested, he pays little or no tax because he can use the existing tax code to reduce his taxable income to near zero, or even a loss, his proposals that extend even more breaks to developers might have relatively little impact on his own tax obligations. Still, to the degree they would reduce his tax rate to 15 percent and accelerate depreciation while maintaining the interest deduction, they would ensure that Mr. Trump  —   and most of his friends on Wall Street who would be well positioned to exploit his new loophole  —   would never pay anything close to the 33 percent top rate he’s now proposing for his fellow Americans.",0
9860,Hillary Clinton’s Lead Has Shrunk: How to Assess the Polls - The New York Times,"The presidential race has become a lot less clear over the last few weeks. Back in   Hillary Clinton held a large lead over Donald J. Trump. Since then, her lead has slipped  —   but how far isn’t so obvious. The various forecasting models and polling averages have split about as much as they have all year. What’s going on? In   Mrs. Clinton led by around eight percentage points in national polling. Since then, there hasn’t been much evidence to confirm that large margin. Yes, there have been a few polls showing her leading by a big amount. Monmouth, Quinnipiac and USA   polls all showed her up by at least seven points nationwide. But note that over the last two weeks there really hasn’t been any indication that Mrs. Clinton was up by, say, double digits. If she were still up by eight points, we would expect at least some data showing her posting huge margins. In contrast, plenty of recent polls show a much tighter race. Many are less reputable, including online and automated polls of dubious methodological quality or with limited or no track records. But there have been   polls with a smaller lead for Mrs. Clinton, and even the   poll this week that showed her down by two points among likely voters. A few weeks ago, there weren’t many polls of any kind showing her in that weak a position. Gallup’s daily tracking poll  —   another   measure  —   also showed Mrs. Clinton’s favorability ratings slipping over the second half of August, which has tended to track with changes in her overall standing in national polls. The battleground state polling  —   even the   polls  —   also shows a tighter race. Recent Marquette, Monmouth and Suffolk polls in Wisconsin and Michigan showed Mrs. Clinton with a modest lead, not the   edge she had a month ago. All considered, the balance of evidence plainly indicates that Mrs. Clinton has lost ground since  . Whether she’s up by two or five points is another question. But it’s definitely not seven or eight anymore. Exactly where you peg her lead  —   two points or six points or somewhere else  —   is a lot hazier than usual. The differences are reflected in the big splits between the various polling averages and models, like at The Huffington Post or FiveThirtyEight. Part of the issue is that there haven’t been many   polls recently, and most (though not all) of the   surveys have shown Mrs. Clinton with a comfortable lead, as FiveThirtyEight’s Harry Enten pointed out last week. On the other hand, the online and automated polls have shown a much more significant tightening of the race. The always noisy Reuters poll has shown a big decline in Mrs. Clinton’s support, and many of its new state polls have shown the same thing. So has Morning Consult, a new online pollster. A wave of polls from Emerson College, which does not contact cellphones, showed Mrs. Clinton with only a nominal edge in the battleground states. The Los Angeles  . S. C. panel, which differs in a number of respects from other surveys, gives Mr. Trump a lead. Whether a polling average or model includes all of this data or some of it, or has the means to correct for including polls that systematically favor one candidate or another, might be a bigger issue now than it was a month ago. Another issue is that the   polls have given readers the opportunity to choose their own adventure, depending on what type of question they look at. A recent Fox poll, for instance, showed Mrs. Clinton ahead by just two points. But it showed her ahead by six points in the    matchup, without Jill Stein or Gary Johnson listed as candidates. The   poll showed Mrs. Clinton trailing among likely voters but ahead among registered voters. These big gaps between registered and likely voters, and the   and   ballots, haven’t been the norm so far this year. There’s no “right” answer about which is more reliable. I happen to prefer to look at samples of registered voters  —   a larger sample, and I can mentally apply a slight and consistent   penalty to the Democrats  —   but I know that generally the   numbers are more accurate. I’m agnostic about whether the   or   polls are better in this particular election, since Mr. Johnson and Ms. Stein blur the line between candidates who deserve inclusion and those who do not. Most of the forecasting models and polling averages use the   race and   polls. Right now, those may offer a particularly pessimistic picture for Mrs. Clinton. Late August is not a great time of year for polling, and Labor Day weekend is probably the worst of all. The news can slow down in August, and so can public interest in the race. People go on vacation. News media organizations that spent tens of thousands of dollars polling around the period of the conventions take some time off and wait to   the fray in September. Over the next few weeks, a lot of these questions are going to sort themselves out. There will be a new wave of   polls. Many will add   screens for the first time. And not only will we have more new polls, but we’ll also be even closer to the election  —   and entering a period when the polls tend to be quite predictive of the eventual outcome.",0
9861,Clinton’s Policy On Syria Will Lead To WW3 Says Trump,"Clinton’s Policy On Syria Will Lead To WW3 Says Trump by IWB · October 26, 2016 
by Carol Adl 
Donald Trump has warned that Hillary Clinton’s policy towards Syria would lead to World War III , arguing that the Democratic nominee would drag the US into a confrontation with nuclear armed Russia. 
Trump said “You’re going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton” adding that “What we should do is focus on ISIS We should not be focusing on Syria” 
The US Republican presidential nominee made the remarks on Tuesday during a Reuters interview in response to Clinton’s proposal for the establishment of a no-fly zone and “safe zones” in Syria. 
Press TV reports: 
On October 7, the Democratic nominee said a no-fly zone was required inside the war-ravaged country to stabilize fighting, a move that was opposed in Congress due to the risk of entering into conflict with Russia, since a US-enforced no-fly zone would mean the US could shoot down Russian fighter jets should they enter Syrian airspace. 

Clinton also described the situation in Syria as “incredibly complex” since the intervention of Russia. 
“You’re not fighting Syria anymore; you’re fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk,” Trump said. 
The Republican nominee also referred to the removal of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power as a second-level priority to defeating Daesh. 
“Assad is secondary, to me, to ISIL,” Trump said. 
Russia might down US planes 
Meanwhile, US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper also warned about the consequences of Clinton’s push for a no-fly zone in Syria that could spark a conflict with Russia. 
Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations, Clapper said Clinton’s proposal for the establishment of a no-fly zone in Syria could lead to Russia shooting down American planes there. 
“I wouldn’t put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft if they — if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground,” he said. 
“I take stock in the nature of the weaponry that they deploy and why they — why they did that,” Clapper said of Russian weapons recently deployed to Syria. “The system they have there is a very advanced air-defense system. It’s very capable. And I don’t think they’d do it and deploy it unless they had some intent to use it.” 
During the third and final presidential debate last week, Clinton reiterated her remarks on a no-fly zone that could save lives and hasten the end of the conflict in Syria. 
A foreign-backed militancy has been going on in Syria since March 2011, with a plethora of armed groups — each supported by one foreign country or another — fighting the Assad government. 
Since 2014, the United States, along with a number of its allies, has been leading a so-called anti-terror campaign in Syria and neighboring Iraq. 
Instead of helping to rein in the Takfiri terrorists, the air raids have killed many civilians, and caused extensive damage to the country’s infrastructure.",0

9863,Freedom Rider: Dump the Democrats for Good,"2016 presidential campaign by BAR editor and senior columnist Margaret Kimberley 
Donald Trump, the white nationalist that claimed to oppose the corporate establishment, appears to have won the U.S. presidency. But, “even the victory of the openly bigoted Trump poses an opportunity to right our political ship.” The Democrats were not “our” party, but the party that thought they owned us. Their “rejection must be complete and blame must be laid squarely at their feet” for raising those chickens that have come home to roost. Freedom Rider: Dump the Democrats for Good by BAR editor and senior columnist Margaret Kimberley 
“The Democrats were so entrenched in their corruption and self-dealing that they didn’t see the Bernie Sanders campaign for modest reform as the savior it might have been.” 
This columnist did not see a Donald Trump victory coming. The degree of disgust directed at an awful candidate was more than I had predicted. Neither the corporate media, nor Wall Street nor the pundits nor the pollsters saw this coming either. Their defeat and proof of their uselessness is total. Those of us who rejected the elite consensus and didn’t support Hillary Clinton should be proud. 
Black people are now in fear and in shock when we ought to be spoiling for a fight. All is not lost. Even the victory of the openly bigoted Trump poses an opportunity to right our political ship. Not the electoral ship, the political one. For decades black Americans have been voting for people who have done them wrong. Bill Clinton got rid of public assistance as a right, and undid regulations that kept Wall Street in check. He put black people in jail and yet black people didn’t turn on him until he and his wife tried to defeat Obama. But Obama gave us more of the same. Bailouts of Wall Street, interventions and death for people all over the world, and a beat down of black people who still loved him. Despite the fear of Republican victory we end up losing whenever a Democratic presidential candidate wins. 
“Obama bailed out banks, insurance companies, Big Pharma and even Ukraine.” 
Victory is ours if we dump the Democrat Party and their black misleaders. The Democrats were so entrenched in their corruption and self-dealing that they didn’t see the Bernie Sanders campaign for modest reform as the savior it might have been. Instead they marched in lock step with a woman who was heartily disliked. Sanders went along as the sheep dog who led his flock straight over the cliff. The Democrats inadvertently galvanized people who had stopped participating in the system and who want change from top to bottom. 
One of our biggest problems lies not in facts but in perceptions. What did Democrats do for black people? The Democrats ship living wage jobs off shore in corrupt trade deals like NAFTA and TTP. They don’t prosecute killer cops or raise the minimum wage. Trump will be hard pressed to deport more people than Obama did. The list of treachery is very long. 
When Donald Trump asked black people, “What have you got to lose?” his words were met with derision. But in reality he posed a good question. What do we have to show for years of Democratic votes? Obama bailed out banks, insurance companies, Big Pharma and even Ukraine. But he didn’t rebuild Detroit or New Orleans. The water in Flint, Michigan is still poisoned and the prisons are still full. 
“There may be opportunity in this crisis if we dare to seize it.” 
The outpouring of love for Barack Obama was purely symbolic. In state after state, black people who gave him victory in 2008 and 2012 stayed home. They loved seeing him and his wife dressed up at state dinners but they were never fully engaged in politics because that is not what Democrats want. The love was phony and void of any political intent. Donald Trump will be president because of that veneer of political activism. 
As for white people who voted for Trump, of course many of them are racists. However they are not without valid complaints. They don’t want neoliberalism but black people don’t either. They don’t want wars around the world and neither do black people. We corrupt our own heritage of radicalism in favor of shallow symbolism. While we slept walk in foolish nostalgia for Obama and cried at the thought of him leaving office, white people kept their hatred of Hillary to themselves or lied to pollsters. They want America to be great again, great for them. White nostalgic yearnings are dangerous for black people, and we must be vigilant. But there may be opportunity in this crisis if we dare to seize it. 
Republicans have been the white people’s party for nearly 50 years. Trump just made it more obvious. He didn’t tell us anything we didn’t already know. We don’t have to be the losers in this election. Let us remember what we have achieved in our history. Half of black Americans didn’t even have the right to vote in the 1960s yet made earth shattering progress in a short time. But we must understand the source of that progress. It came from struggle and daring to create the crises that always bring about change. 
“The dread of redneck celebration should not be our primary motivation right now.” 
Yes white people will strut for president Trump but that doesn’t mean we must submit as if we are in the Jim Crow days of old. We have ourselves to rely on and we can reclaim our history of fighting for self-determination. The dread of redneck celebration should not be our primary motivation right now. Before we quake in fear at white America we must send the scoundrels packing. 
The black politicians and the Democratic National Committee and the civil rights organizations that don’t help the masses must all be kicked to the proverbial curb. The rejection must be complete and blame must be laid squarely at their feet. 
Those of us who voted for the green party ticket of Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka must stand firmly and proudly for our choice. We must strategize on building a progressive party to replace the Democrats who never help us. We must applaud Julian Assange and Wikileaks for exposing their corruption. There should be no back tracking on the fight to build left wing political power. 
“We must strategize on building a progressive party to replace the Democrats who never help us.” 
The black people who didn’t return to the polls shouldn’t be blamed either. Those individuals must have personal introspection that is meaningful and political. Their lack of enthusiasm speaks to Democratic Party and black misleadership incompetence. We should refrain from personal blame and help one another in this process as we fight for justice and peace. 
The end of the duopoly is the first step in liberation. Staying with a party that literally did nothing was a slow and agonizing death. Sometimes shock therapy is needed to improve one’s condition. If we don’t take the necessary steps to free ourselves this election outcome will be a disaster. Instead, why not bring the disaster to the people who made it happen? The destruction of the Democratic Party and creation of a truly progressive political movement is the only hope for black America.

9865,Spanish Archive Raises Franco-Era Ghosts and Shadows of a New Chasm - The New York Times,"SANT CUGAT DEL VALLÈS, Spain  —   Monday marks 80 years since the uprising led by Gen. Francisco Franco plunged Spain into civil war. But Pere Bartolomé, 93, says he can still remember the day Franco’s soldiers ransacked his village, confiscating family booklets and photos. Some of those documents were returned to him only this month, after being kept hidden for decades as part of an enormous police archive that Franco used to incriminate his opponents. “This is just a very unexpected and happy moment,” Mr. Bartolomé said, shuffling on a cane and holding back the tears, after the ceremony at the Catalan national archive in which documents were returned to him and other Catalan families. Mr. Bartolomé was among the very few at the ceremony who had actually lived through the horrors of the civil war. Most of those who collected the gray boxes containing seized documents did so on behalf of deceased grandparents and other missing relatives. Some hoisted the boxes above their heads as if they were trophies. The divisions caused by the Spanish Civil War, and the decades of dictatorship it ushered in, ending only with Franco’s death in November 1975, continue to ripple through Spain. The ceremony here took place only after a unique and controversial push by Catalan lawmakers, many of whom now want to secede from Spain. The rest of the archive, which some compare to Communist East Germany’s Stasi files, remains in state hands. The Spanish archive was created by a special unit designated to seize documents that could eventually help identify and punish Franco’s enemies as his troops started to push back their Republican opponents. The unit stored any confiscated material in a building in Salamanca, a university town that Franco turned into his military headquarters and for which the files are named. Several of those who got documents back expressed disbelief at finally retrieving family belongings, as well as sadness and frustration that it had taken so long. “It is shameful that personal belongings were taken away by Franco as if they were part of a war booty  —   and it is just as shameful that we’re still struggling to recover such belongings, four decades after Spain returned to democracy,” Isabel Casanovas Calvet said. She received 17 books that belonged to her grandfather Joan Casanovas, who was the president of the Parliament of Catalonia when the civil war broke out. He died in exile in France in 1942, three years after Franco’s victory. Like several other aspects of the civil war and the resulting Franco dictatorship, the Salamanca Papers remain a subject of intense controversy rather than reconciliation. Since Spain’s Parliament agreed to return the documents to Catalonia in 2005, the process has been mired in legal and technical difficulties. The issue has recently resonated even more in Catalonia, where the regional Parliament is now controlled by lawmakers seeking to break from Spain. During the ceremony at the Catalan archives here, Santi Vila, a member of Catalonia’s regional government, started his speech by condemning Franco’s repression. But he went on to note ugly echoes of the past, attacking Jorge Fernández Díaz, the interior minister of Spain’s current conservative government, who was recently heard in a leaked recording of a private conversation trying to dig up dirt to incriminate Catalan political opponents. Joan B. Culla, a leading Catalan historian, was among the first academics to gain access to the documents, when he visited Salamanca in 1975 just as Franco died. Drawing his own comparison, Mr. Culla suggested that returning documents stolen from Republican families was like restituting paintings seized from Jews by the Nazis. “The fact that we’re still having such a debate shows that, even 40 years later, there is no sense of shame felt in defending the Franco period,” he said. “Could a town in Germany now be saying that something shouldn’t leave because Hitler had put it there?” Policarpo Sánchez, a lawyer and historian, heads an association created in 2014 to maintain Salamanca as a state archive. He charged that Catalan politicians wanted to dismantle the Salamanca archive, driven by “ideological hatred” rather than sympathy for the victims of Franco. With the exception of members of the Basque Nationalist Party, he noted, no other regional politicians in Spain had demanded the return of such documents. Catalonia’s politicians, however, “want to declare independence and therefore need to erase the collective and historical memory of Spain,” he said. Mr. Sánchez acknowledged that Franco had created in Salamanca something akin to the files used in other authoritarian regimes. But after Spain’s return to democracy, he said, the archive had been overseen by Spain’s Ministry of Culture and provided a treasure trove for historians. Mr. Sánchez recently unveiled some of his own discoveries in Salamanca, including the press accreditation of Antoine de   the author of “The Little Prince,” who covered the civil war for French newspapers. “Documents can be found in Salamanca that the Library of Congress or any other archive would kill to have,” Mr. Sánchez said. “Can you imagine breaking up the Prado Museum, leaving perhaps only copies in Madrid and taking back each painting to its place of origin?” Mr. Sánchez is awaiting a court ruling after suing the Catalan authorities, accusing them of mishandling documents. One of his claims is that Catalonia illegally took documents from Salamanca that originally came from other regions of Spain. Few of the documents returned this month appeared to hold historic value. One exception was the boardroom minutes book of the association created in 1926 by Pablo Casals, a   cellist, to give concerts for factory workers and their families. The document is “very significant” and could help others understand that Casals “wasn’t just happy with his own success, but also wanted to allow workers to listen to quality music in the same places as the bourgeoisie,” said Jordi Pardo, the director general of the Casals Foundation. In any case, with most of the original document owners long dead, many relatives said they might never work out exactly what they had gotten back. María Isabel Salazar Bertran, for one, could not decipher the dedication written in a political book that had been seized from her grandfather Joan Bertran i Llopart, a former Republican town mayor, and returned to her. As to the emotional value of the restitution, however, Ms. Salazar Bertran said it was made more poignant because she had coincidentally been told about the book on the day her mother died. “For me, this book is in itself a symbol of the history and the dignity of my family, which, like so many others, didn’t deserve to be persecuted for holding a different ideology,” she said.",0

The Los Angeles Times reports that the suit is the first in a “series” that the NRA plans to file, now that Gorsuch is on the bench. President Trump campaigned on using SCOTUS to save the Second Amendment.

When asked by Breitbart News why Perdue’s agency is taking the lead on implementing Trump’s order, the Secretary said the president knows that rural Americans aren’t enjoying the same economic uptick that the rest of Americans are enjoying and that rural communities are represented in every state. “I think [Trump] saw the USDA and the Secretary of Agriculture as the one to bring these   together,” Perdue told Breitbart News. “The other thing is, I guess with all those members of Congress, they all have a certain degree of agriculture in their district and they understand the needs of [those communities]. ” Perdue said. “It’s the one common denominator I think that unites us in many, many ways across America. ” In April 2017, Trump issued an executive order establishing the task force “to ensure the informed exercise of regulatory authority that impacts agriculture and rural communities. ” Regulations, in fact, were routinely mentioned as something detrimental to rural prosperity, including rules and regulations put into place by the EPA that create obstacles for farming and ranching. The White House laid out the plan this way: While much of the country has recovered from the recent recession, large areas of rural America have not fared as well.  Nationally, 85 percent of persistently impoverished counties are in rural areas, and one in four rural children is growing up in poverty.  The employment numbers continue to lag, and without connectivity and improved infrastructure widely available, the population in rural America is at its lowest point since 2010. The Task Force is working to improve quality of life for people living in rural areas, develop a reliable workforce, spur innovation and technology development, and roll back regulations to allow communities to grow and thrive. By directly engaging stakeholders to develop an action plan for legislative reforms and regulatory relief, the Task Force is expected to accomplish a great deal for rural Americans. President Trump has asked for a report with concrete recommendations within 180 days of the Task Force’s creation. “Promoting agriculture and rural prosperity is something that is very important to me since I know   how vital energy and electricity are to our rural areas,” Perry said of his agency’s role in the task force. “At the Department of Energy, we are ready to do our part to bring prosperity to our small towns and rural communities. “Our Bioenergies Technology Office facilitates private and public partnerships to develop new technologies that make biofuels   and our national labs are hard at work developing new ways to use our crops for energy,” Perry said. “If you’re going to address the needs of rural America, you can’t do it one agency at a time,” Mulvaney said at the event. Tate Bennett, who represented the EPA at the meeting, said reviewing and reworking the “Waters of the United States” rule as it relates to the Clean Water Act is a priority for EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. “He wants to hear from the people who are directly impacted by WOTUS, and that’s rural America,” Bennett said.",0
9868,Gabby Williams Soars as UConn Rolls On in N.C.A.A. Tournament - The New York Times,"STORRS, Conn.  —   Before she began vaulting for rebounds and blocked shots at Connecticut, Gabby Williams finished fifth in the high jump at the 2012 Olympic track and field trials. Her performance was a personal best of 6 feet 2¼ inches. At the time, she was 15, having just completed her sophomore year at Reed High School in Sparks, Nev. “There was a youthful elasticity about her,” said Amy Acuff, a   Olympian who finished third at those trials. “You could see a bounce and a spring in her movements. She was such a fresh, bright spirit. It can be difficult to have your best performance in a big meet like that, but she definitely rose to the occasion. ” For the    Williams, now 20, a   career ended prematurely with a severe knee injury sustained months later while playing basketball. But she remains a soaring presence around the basket and, after a tentative start at UConn, she has become as dependable in the biggest moments on the court as she once was on the track infield. On Monday, Williams, a junior, collected 23 points, 6 rebounds and 5 assists as UConn ( ) defeated Syracuse   in the second round of the N. C. A. A. tournament. It was a rematch of the 2016 national championship game, won easily by the Huskies for their fourth consecutive title. That UConn team featured Breanna Stewart, Moriah Jefferson and Morgan Tuck, the top three players chosen in the 2016 W. N. B. A. draft. For the first time, Williams and her current teammates are being asked to deliver crucial plays at decisive moments in the postseason. “This entire team is really anxious about that,” Williams said. “Last year, we had guys, they knew how to win a national championship and they had done it before. We know how, but we’ve never had to do it ourselves. ” She does not appear overwhelmed by the responsibility. In Saturday’s tournament opener, Williams delivered 20 points, 10 rebounds, 6 assists, 5 steals and a blocked shot as UConn overwhelmed Albany,  . Such resourceful performances validate what Jay Bilas, the ESPN announcer, said of Williams: She is the most complete college basketball player in the country, male or female. Her   and   skills need refining, but there is a calm, floating assurance about Williams. The elegant way she imposes herself on a game with her vision, positioning and anticipation. Her ability not only to jump high, but also to quickly jump a second time, a third time. Her graceful, bounding glide, always on the balls of her feet, as if there is an unseen   bar to clear. Standing about eight feet from the basket against Albany, Williams rose over the back of a player three and a half inches taller and snatched a rebound. Another time, she hovered in the lane, legs scissored, cradling a rebound in one arm. “Williams has to be maybe one of the most athletic players ever,” said Joanna   the Albany coach. “Some of those rebounds she grabs are very phenomenal. Her legs are like springs. ” As Williams’s basketball skills have expanded in college, so has her social awareness. In an interview in December with The New Haven Register, Williams said she wanted to become a community organizer. “I am going to be a black female after basketball,” she told the newspaper. “I want to make sure every day that I am trying to make a difference. ” Speaking to The New York Times as the N. C. A. A. tournament opened, Williams said that while basketball consumed much of her time during the season, she tried to attend meetings at UConn’s African American Cultural Center whenever possible. The election of President Trump has prompted anxious discussions about treatment of women, minorities and immigrants, and she has eagerly taken part in them. “I’m glad these issues are finally being talked about,” Williams said. “It’s cool to see people who are more motivated, like, ‘What can I do now? ’” If things had gone as planned in high school, Williams would have returned to UConn’s basketball team this season after taking a year away from the game to try to qualify for the high jump at the Rio Olympics. “Now I realize just how almost impossible that was, to think it was going to be so easy just to take a year off,” Williams said, laughing. That is what    are supposed to think, that life is infinite possibility. But her plans were circumscribed when Williams’s right knee crumpled with a torn anterior cruciate ligament midway through her junior season in high school. She injured the knee again as a senior. A second operation followed. When she was cleared to resume athletic activities, she said, “I kind of had a realization that I wanted to do basketball more than I wanted to do track. ” But Williams arrived at UConn in the fall of 2014 neither fully fit nor confident. “I just wasn’t ready for that level of competition,” she said. “I kind of got down on myself all the time. ” On Nov. 17, 2014, UConn played what would become a signpost game at Stanford. The Huskies lost,   in overtime, ending a   winning streak. They had not lost in 109 games played since. But Williams also remembers that game for a different reason. She did not play a single minute. Coach Geno Auriemma did not yet trust her. Her teammates did not yet trust her. She did not trust herself. After Williams missed large stretches of her final two seasons in high school, Auriemma said, she was asking herself, “Can I do this or not?” Doubt, he said, consumed her. After the Stanford game, Williams said, “I never wanted to feel that way again. ” She told herself: “I need to find a role on this team. I need to find a way that I can help. ” This season she became a   starter. While she remains a work in progress, Williams played some of her most thorough games during the regular season against teams that are now fellow No. 1 seeds in the N. C. A. A. tournament: 19 points, 12 rebounds, 6 assists and 5 steals against Notre Dame. A   26 points, along with 14 rebounds, 4 assists and 4 steals, against South Carolina. She was named defensive player of the year in the American Athletic Conference and became only the fifth UConn player to collect a   with 16 points, 16 rebounds and 10 assists against East Carolina. “It’s easy to underappreciate her,” Maya Moore, a former UConn star, said of Williams. “But if you watch the game and understand all the ways she’s impacting it, it’s   to see that night after night. She’s grown into that, to be able to be counted on in so many areas of the game. ” Doubts still affect Williams “once in a while,” Auriemma said, “but fortunately for us, every big game we played on national television, those doubts didn’t come to the arena. ” “Somehow or another,” he added, “they got lost on the way over. ”",0
9869,Donations to A.C.L.U. and Other Organizations Surge After Trump’s Order - The New York Times,"President Trump’s executive order barring millions of refugees and citizens of seven   countries from the United States has spurred a surge in donations to humanitarian and rights groups like the American Civil Liberties Union. The A. C. L. U. has raised more than $24 million in online donations since Saturday, the first full day of the immigration ban, said Stephen Smith, a spokesman for the group. That is nearly seven times as much raised online in 2015, roughly $3. 5 million, he added. Those donations came from at least 356, 306 individual donors, and about   of those who gave money were believed to be   donors, said its executive director, Anthony D. Romero. “The response from the public has been remarkable,” Mr. Romero said. “It clearly shows that people are exercised over the proposed policies of Donald Trump. ” The A. C. L. U. also gained 150, 000 to 200, 000 new members. It had 400, 000 when Mr. Trump was elected in November, he said. “Clearly, this executive order has hit a live nerve with the American people,” Mr. Romero said. Thousands of protesters flooded airports across the country and took to the streets as word spread that immigrants and refugees were being blocked from entering the country, detained for hours by customs officials or taken off planes during the weekend, after Mr. Trump signed the executive order at 4:42 p. m. on Friday. The order, coming off a campaign promise, suspends the entry of all refugees for 120 days, bars Syrian refugees indefinitely, and prevents citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the United States for 90 days. Critics noted that the order for “extreme vetting” was in effect a ban on Muslims, and did not target countries in which Mr. Trump has had business interests. The move stunned the global community, drawing criticism from business leaders, European heads of state and Christian leaders, though many Trump fans were unfazed. Besides the A. C. L. U. other groups have seen a rise in donations. The National Immigration Law Center, which joined the A. C. L. U. in a suit on behalf of two Iraqi refugees detained on Saturday, has raised $269, 000 since the Trump order was signed, its executive director, Marielena Hincapie, said. Ms. Hincapie said donations had increased “across the board” and were now larger, more frequent and coming from more individual donors than her group had ever seen. A surge of individual donations after the election in November also boosted the law center’s annual budget to $7. 5 million from $5. 5 million, she added.   for her organization was usually “slow and tedious work,” but not anymore, she said. “Trump’s election completely changed that and set us on a new path and has allowed us to be a stronger and more nimble organization,” Ms. Hincapie said. Humanitarian groups have seen a boost in donations, as well. Kal Penn, an actor and a former official in the White House Office of Public Engagement under President Barack Obama, started an online   appeal for the International Rescue Committee, which works in conflict and disaster zones around the world. Mr. Penn said the   had been inspired by an internet “troll” who told him he didn’t belong in the United States. “To the dude who said I don’t belong in America, I started a   page for Syrian refugees in your name,” Mr. Penn wrote on Twitter. That tweet was shared more than 35, 000 times, and by Sunday, the site had raised over $390, 000. The I. R. C. began its own   effort on Sunday with the goal of bringing in $5 million to help the organization respond to the needs of refugees in the United States. The group said it was the first time it had launched an appeal for people in the United States. The   efforts were promoted by at least one actress during the Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday night, Sarah Paulson, who urged people to donate to the A. C. L. U. “to protect the rights and liberties of people across this country. ” Many of the winners, including Julia   of TV’s “Veep” and Mahershala Ali of the film “Moonlight,” used their acceptance speeches to denounce  the policies of Mr. Trump. The A. C. L. U. sees itself as a leader in the opposition to Mr. Trump’s agenda. It lead the charge on Saturday with the lawsuit in New York that resulted in an emergency ruling by a federal judge blocking the deportation of detainees who had already landed here. The court order was the second legal action filed by the group against the Trump administration, which is little more than one week old. Even before Mr. Trump’s executive order on immigration, the A. C. L. U. had received more than $47 million from 400, 000 donors, Mr. Romero said. The organization used the money  —   the largest surge in donations in its 97 year history, he said  —   to hire 200 staff members, primarily lawyers. “That is the Trump Effect,” Mr. Romero said. “Those 400, 000 people, who donated to us, I did not go after them they came to us. In fact, our website crashed we had so many donations, we could not handle it. ”",0
9870,Poll: Public Opposes Progressives’ Federal Transgender Rule by 2 to 1 - Breitbart,"Only 28 percent of Americans support former President Barack Obama’s   claim that the federal government should decide bathroom policies in elementary and secondary schools, says a new poll by Rasmussen Reports. [In contrast, 36 percent said local governments should set “bathroom policies” governing youths who say they want to live as members of the opposite sex. Another 28 percent of respondents said state government should set the rules for transgender disputes, according to the poll.  That adds up to 64 percent opposition and only 28 percent support for federal rule. The    opposition is bad news for progressives, who are currently campaigning for federal politicians and federal judges to impose a national policy that would allow people to change their legal sex by simply declaring they have the “gender identity” of an   person. This week, President Donald Trump announced he is discarding Obama’s May 2016 national     policy and is delegating the issue to state and local governments. However, his administration has not announced whether it opposes the gay groups’ demand that “gender identity” should determine a person’s legal sex. The new Rasmussen poll also shows that only 38 percent of respondents favor “allowing transgender students to use the bathrooms of the opposite biological sex. ” That policy was opposed by 49 percent of Americans, including 64 percent of Republicans, 36 percent of Democrats and 49 percent of adults who say they are neither Democratic nor Republican. The Feb. 22 to 23 poll included 1, 000 adults. The public opposition to the transgender    ideology increases when the questions are asked about younger schoolkids. For example, an April poll by Civitas showed that only 7 percent of 600 North Carolinians strongly supported a judge’s demand “ordering girls and boys in public middle schools to share locker rooms, bathroom, and shower facilities. ” The demand was strongly opposed by 72 percent of respondents. The new poll by Rasmussen only asked about bathrooms, and so doesn’t reveal political support for the underlying political demand by gay groups that a person’s “gender identity,” not their biological sex, should determine whether they are male or female. In March, the Supreme Cour this expected to hear a case in which gay advocates want the judges to redefine the meaning of “sex” in a 1972 sexual discrimination law from biological sex to “gender identity. ” That’s a revolutionary demand, because if individuals can freely flip their sex from male to female or vice versa, then the nation’s many   institutions will face enormous legal pressure to admit people of the opposite biological sex. For example, shelters for battered women may be forced to open their doors to men who claim battery, women’s sports leagues will be forced to admit bigger and stronger men who claim to be women, and schoolbooks and parenting guides used by government grantees would be forced to define “women” merely as people who say they are women, effectively discarding the nation’s cultural history of women, girls and feminists. Already, the Boy Scouts of America have decided to admit girls who want to live as boys, and have also begun changing their language to downplay their prior focus on the needs of young boys. Similarly, sports leagues for women have been forced to admit biological males and also to admit girls who are taking   male testosterone hormones. Also, the progressive trend is forcing progressives to rebuke ordinary Americans who don’t want men walking into the public bathrooms used by their young children. That politically questionable stance was highlighted by CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, who entangled himself in a Twitter fight when he suggested that a father was being intolerant for saying he doesn’t want his 12    to share a public toilet with men who are trying to live as women. Cuomo retreated from the fight by claiming that a court would decide if the    law would create safety problem by allowing sexual predators into bathrooms. But he ignored the larger issue that women’s bathrooms —   and locker rooms and sports leagues  —   would also become open to men who say they are women if fixed biology is deemed less important than changeable “gender identity. ”  A recent poll by a   group at UCLA showed that only 23 percent of Americans think people should be allowed to switch their legal sex without any tests or approval by government agencies. Update: A February poll of 2, 000 registered voters by Politico and Morning Consult showed that the transgender agenda is strongly supported by just 23 percent of respondents, strongly opposed by 33 percent and somewhat opposed by 13 percent.",0
9871,"USA Today’s Kelly Lawler Falsely Brands MILO as ’White Nationalist,’ ’Racist,’ and ’Alt Right’ - Breitbart","USA Today’s Kelly Lawler falsely branded Breitbart Senior Editor MILO as a “white nationalist” and “racist,” while also claiming that he is a part of the “ ” movement, a claim MILO has repeatedly rebutted over the past few months. [In her article “Leslie Jones speaks out after harasser Yiannopoulos lands book deal,” Lawler branded MILO with numerous false labels, while also claiming that MILO sent “racist” abuse to actress Leslie Jones despite a complete lack of evidence to support these claims.  “After white nationalist and   poster boy Milo Yiannopoulos landed a massive book deal with a reported $250, 000 advance, publisher Simon  Schuster has come under harsh criticism from those concerned that a book will elevate the voice of the notorious Breitbart editor,” wrote Lawler. “Yiannopoulos made headlines earlier this year when he was permanently banned from Twitter for organizing a targeted racist and sexist harassment campaign against Ghostbusters [2016] and Saturday Night Live star Leslie Jones. ” Lawler, who previously worked for NPR and interned with Democratic congressman Patrick Murphy, is not the only journalist to have made false and unjust claims against MILO, with the New Yorker also falsely claiming that MILO led a “racist online harassment campaign against the comedian Leslie Jones. ” As previously reported by Breitbart News, Jones had already been engaging with Twitter trolls for hours before ever interacting with MILO. “If at first you don’t succeed (because you’re work is terrible) play the victim,” said MILO in reference to Jones on Twitter. “Everyone gets hate mail FFS. ” Breitbart’s Allum Bokhari also wrote on the issue, adding, “In other words, MILO has been permanently banned for little more than criticism, mild insults, and mockery. Meanwhile, [Breitbart’s] Jerome Hudson’s abuser, who repeatedly called the black reporter a ‘coon,‘ is still on the platform. ” MILO has also sparred with various white nationalist and fringe sections of the right, so much so that white supremacist site The Daily Stormer waged a “war” against him.   icon Richard Spencer has also dispelled claims that MILO is a part of the   stating simply that “Milo is not a part of the ” during a debate. Many white nationalists have also branded MILO a “  kike faggot,” declaring their distaste for him. Popular   outlet “The Right Stuff” also bluntly declared in an article that “Milo isn’t one of us,” while   “leading thought leader of ” Paul Town also rejected claims that MILO is anything close to a white nationalist or in a member of the   movement, branding him a “cultural libertarian. ” During numerous interviews, MILO has declared that he is not a member of the   nor a white nationalist —   a label, which he adds, many white nationalists are proud to associate with, however the media has frequently attempted to pin him to the movement.  Numerous celebrities and media figures have thrown public tantrums over MILO’s upcoming book release Dangerous, including Sarah Silverman, Judd Apatow, and Perez Hilton. Despite threats from the left to boycott publisher Simon and Schuster, the   version of Dangerous by MILO became the number one bestselling book on Amazon just a day after being announced and over two months before being released.

9872,Trump Vowed to Protect the Safety Net. What if His Appointees Disagree? - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Two days before Election Day, Donald J. Trump traveled to Sioux City, Iowa, and proclaimed that he was the protector of federal programs aimed at helping elderly and   Americans. It was Hillary Clinton, he said, who was an untrustworthy steward of the working class and who would slash vital benefits. “I am going to protect and save your Social Security and your Medicare,” Mr. Trump said. “You made a deal a long time ago, a long time ago. ” The pledge followed earlier promises to enact a new    benefit and not to make cuts to Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor. When President Trump addresses Congress this Tuesday and follows the speech with a budget blueprint for the fiscal year that begins in October, his White House will finally address in concrete numbers one of his central contradictions: He campaigned as the populist protector of programs for the working class, yet he has pledged to control the budget deficit, cut spending and cut taxes. Moreover, Mr. Trump has surrounded himself with traditional   conservatives bent on cutting back or eliminating many of the programs he has championed. Many of his aides and cabinet members have expressed views that are fundamentally opposed to those he campaigned on. Former Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, for example, the new White House budget director, has called Social Security a “Ponzi scheme” and helped engineer a government shutdown to cut spending. As House Budget Committee chairman, Tom Price, the new secretary of health and human services, supported converting Medicaid to strictly capped block grants to the states and turning Medicare into a voucherlike program for future recipients. Ben Carson, the president’s nominee to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has repeatedly said government programs to help the poor lead to dependency. The disparity between Mr. Trump’s rhetoric and his appointments has cheered many Republicans and left Democrats fearing that he will not only renege on his promises to protect the government’s largest entitlement programs but that he will also slash programs he did not mention on the campaign trail that offer food, housing and child care support for the poor. “The appointments that he’s made are troublesome and very, very scary,” Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, said. “He made a pledge and sort of delineated himself from the rest of the Republican field by saying these things. Everything he’s done since he’s been elected is very worrisome. ” Already, Mr. Trump’s budget office has hinted at cuts to come in a memo that singled out the Legal Services Corporation, which helps the poor manage legal issues, and the Appalachian Regional Commission, which targets economic development in some of the poorest parts of the country. The memo also said that AmeriCorps, a program that puts volunteers into poor communities, would be zeroed out, and that the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, a nonprofit organization focused on urban development, would see its budget cut substantially. On Capitol Hill, some Republicans are hoping Mr. Mulvaney and others will change the president’s mind on far bigger targets and convince him that structural changes to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid  —   the biggest drivers of deficits that are projected to rise over the next decade  —   are needed to control the national debt and to preserve the programs without substantial tax increases. Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid consumed nearly $1. 9 trillion of the government’s $3. 9 trillion in spending in 2016, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and with the number of people 65 and over projected to rise by a third over the next decade, Social Security and Medicare spending is projected to increase from a third of all spending in 2017 to 42 percent by 2027. Including Medicaid and military and federal civilian retirement benefits, federal spending on older adults will rise from 37 percent of outlays in 2017 to 45 percent in 2027 if nothing is done to change the programs. Even some liberal economists say that will amount to a transfer of funds from poor children and families toward   older Americans, because the budget office projects that discretionary spending  —   where most programs for poor families come from  —   will be squeezed from 6. 3 percent of the economy now to 5. 3 percent in 2027, the smallest level since 1962. With those numbers on their side, Republicans are most likely to use their power in both the executive and legislative branches to push through large cuts to federal programs for poor and   Americans, say Democrats and liberal policy analysts  —   if Mr. Trump eases up on his promises. “This is the greatest threat to   people in my lifetime,” said Olivia Golden, executive director of the Center for Law and Social Policy, a nonprofit organization focused on   Americans. House Republican allies see no real contradiction in Mr. Trump’s campaign promises and what they say he must now do. Since President George W. Bush’s failed 2005 effort to partially privatize Social Security, Republicans have assured retirees and those nearing retirement that any changes or cuts to entitlement programs for older adults would not affect them. Now, Republicans are retroactively applying those caveats to Mr. Trump’s promises, saying the president understands that programs like Social Security and Medicare must be maintained for Americans who are currently receiving benefits but must be changed for younger Americans who may have to work longer before retiring and getting benefits. “It was really about making sure that those people who are getting benefits or about to get benefits are protected,” said Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and a leader of the   conservative House Freedom Caucus. “If we do nothing, he will not save Medicare and Social Security. ” Representative Jeff Duncan, Republican of South Carolina, said he would be closely watching his former Freedom Caucus colleague, Mr. Mulvaney, as he settles in to work at the Office of Management and Budget. “I’m curious to see how Mick Mulvaney approaches this from O. M. B. because he is very   with us here,” Mr. Duncan said. In fact, on the campaign trail and in interviews before the election, Mr. Trump did not suggest that he would maintain the programs in their current form only for older Americans. His rallies were attended by a   of ages, who cheered his broad promises. And last March, Mr. Trump said during a debate among Republican presidential candidates that he planned to make no changes. “I will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is,” Mr. Trump said. “I want to leave Social Security as is, I want to make our country rich again so we can afford it. ” The pressure to break that promise will come not only from congressional Republicans but also from his own campaign pledges to build a wall along the Mexican border, increase spending on defense, border security and infrastructure, cut taxes “big league” and control the deficit. “The last time we saw this kind of budgetary logic was at the beginning of the Reagan administration when he came into office, pledged to beef up defense spending and cut taxes,” said William A. Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former aide to President Bill Clinton. “They tried to keep the spending increases down and the deficit increases down by whacking away at social safety net programs, many of which were cut during that period. ” Even if Mr. Trump keeps his promise not to touch Social Security and Medicare, other programs like housing subsidies, child care assistance, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, could be cut, social welfare and budget analysts say. And those cuts would not just affect poor minority voters, who tend to support Democratic candidates. A study released this month by the   Center on Budget and Policy Priorities research group shows that white   adults without a college degree, a critical voting block for Republicans, benefit the most from social safety net programs and   benefits. “My fear is that we are going to see the biggest cuts that any president has ever proposed in programs for   and   families,” said Bob Greenstein, the center’s president. “It could be the biggest Robin Hood in reverse a president has ever offered. ”",0
9873,Exclusive—Immigration Expert Urges Congress to Declare ’National Border Control Day’ - Breitbart,"The executive director of the   Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) Mark Krikorian, urged Congress to declare March 31, the birthday of the founder of United Farm Workers union Cesar Chavez, “National Border Control Day” to celebrate immigration enforcement’s positive effects on workers. [“Congress or the president should honor the memory of Cesar Chavez by declaring his birthday National Border Control Day,” Krikorian told Breitbart News.  Chavez, whom NBC News calls a “civil rights hero,” fiercely opposed illegal immigration and saw that relentless waves of migrant labor would make achieving raised wages and benefits for workers impossible. “Whatever he turned into later, in his prime he was a champion of strict control of the borders, to ensure that American workers and American employers would have to duke it out on an even playing field,” Krikorian wrote in National Review Online on Friday. “If he’d succeeded,   Americans would be better off, instead of seeing their real wages drop 21 percent since 1979. ” The   Economic Policy Institute (EPI) published an article on Friday revealing the raw deal that   guest workers receive: On César Chávez Day, lost in all the news about the Trump administration’s criminalization and scapegoating of immigrants and attempts to withhold federal funds from cities with policies that protect immigrants, are the 450, 000    migrant workers employed in the United States through the     and   visa temporary foreign worker programs. Many of the workers in these temporary visa programs are in a precarious situation and vulnerable to abuse and retaliation at the hands of employers and their agents. These “ ” often arrive in the United States in debt, and are tied to and controlled by their employers. Research shows   are often paid lower wages than similarly situated U. S. workers, and earn wages similar to those of undocumented immigrant workers. This is reminiscent of the Bracero Program —  a large guestworker program in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s that admitted hundreds of thousands of Mexican workers to work temporarily on U. S. farms and in other   occupations —  and which César Chávez fought against. While the Bracero Program was shut down in 1964, employers still turn to the handful of   labor programs to provide workers, once illegals are deported, in their ongoing search for cheaper and cheaper labor. Current immigration policies transfer roughly $500 billion from workers to major employers, according to a study by a Harvard professor. “Is one million   exploitable, indentured workers —  who have no path to lawful permanent residence and citizenship —  what the U. S. economy needs? César Chávez would say, ‘No! ’” the EPI article’s author writes, going on to say   migrants should have a chance to “become American. ” Uncontrolled illegal immigration makes it impossible for workers to improve their lives and climb out of poverty, Krikorian told Breitbart News, which Chavez understood. “At the core of his   activism was support for strong borders and opposition to   programs. Chavez understood that America’s poor could not better themselves if the government allowed in an endless supply of   workers from abroad to compete with them,” he said.

9874,United States Criticizes Israel Over West Bank Settlement Plan - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The Obama administration on Wednesday castigated the Israeli government for approving plans to create a new Jewish settlement on the West Bank, three weeks after it signed a lucrative military aid package with the United States and just as President Obama was traveling to Jerusalem for the funeral of Shimon Peres. In an uncommonly harsh statement, the State Department “strongly condemned” the move, asserting that it violated Israel’s pledge not to construct new settlements and ran counter to the   security interests Israel was seeking to protect with the military deal, which provides $38 billion in assistance over the next decade. The new settlement, one of a string of housing complexes that threaten to bisect the West Bank, is designed to house settlers from a nearby illegal outpost, Amona, which an Israeli court has ordered demolished. The timing of the approval especially infuriated the White House, American officials said, because it came after Mr. Obama met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the United Nations. Mr. Netanyahu, they said, gave the president no advance warning, even though Mr. Obama expressed deep concerns about Israel’s continuing settlement construction. The officials declined to speak for attribution owing to the sensitivity of the issue. “It is disheartening that while Israel and the world mourned the passing of President Shimon Peres, and leaders from the U. S. and other nations prepared to honor one of the great champions of peace, plans were advanced that would seriously undermine the prospects for a   solution that he so passionately supported,” the State Department’s deputy spokesman, Mark Toner, said in the   statement. The harsh words also rekindled speculation that Mr. Obama might lay down guidelines for a proposed peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians before he leaves office, either in a speech or, less likely, by backing a resolution at the United Nations Security Council. “The administration has been escalating its rhetoric in opposition to West Bank settlement activity for more than a year,” said Martin S. Indyk, who served as Mr. Obama’s special envoy for   negotiations. “The government of Israel doesn’t seem to be listening. ” “At a certain point,” said Mr. Indyk, who is now the executive vice president of the Brookings Institution, “the administration may well decide that there needs to be consequences for what it now sees as an effort to close off the   solution. ” Mr. Obama, officials said, has kept his own counsel about whether to thrust himself back into the peace process. After two failed attempts to broker an agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians, the president is leery of getting involved in another hopeless effort, aides say. He would also likely consult with Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, were she to win to make sure his move did not complicate her plans. The plan for a new settlement grows out of a bitter impasse between the Israeli authorities and settlers in Amona, which sits on a hilltop near the Palestinian administrative capital, Ramallah. Israel’s High Court of Justice has ordered the residents of Amona, which is built on private,   land, to leave by Dec. 25. The government’s plan is to move them to the newly approved settlement, built on public land, which would initially have 98 houses and eventually could accommodate up to 300 houses. The settlers have so far refused, creating an acute political crisis for Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition government. The Israeli authorities have dealt with other such standoffs by seeking to retroactively legalize the settlements. But because Amona is built on private Palestinian land, it cannot solve the problem with legal machinations. Israeli authorities view the settlement as a “satellite” of another settlement, Shvut Rachel, which itself was retroactively legalized and lies within the redrawn boundaries of an established settlement, Shilo. “The 98 housing units approved in Shilo do not constitute a ‘new settlement,’ ” Israel’s ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement issued on Wednesday. “Israel,” the ministry added, “remains committed to a solution of two states for two peoples, in which a demilitarized Palestinian state recognizes the Jewish state of Israel. ” For American officials, the problem is that Israel is establishing a string of settlements, which the administration’s statement said “effectively divide the West Bank and make the possibility of a viable Palestinian state more remote. ” The latest settlement, the State Department said, was “deep in the West Bank, far closer to Jordan than to Israel. ” No matter how strongly worded its condemnations, some former diplomats said, it would do little to change Israel’s behavior. They urged Mr. Obama to lay down his version of a road map to a peace deal. “Of course he should,” said Daniel C. Kurtzer, a former American ambassador to Israel and Egypt. “These statements are meaningless if there is no action. The U. S. should expect Israel not to do these things, especially as ‘compensation’ for removal of an illegal outpost. ” Israel has a long history of   announcements on settlements. In 2010, four months after Mr. Netanyahu had agreed to a moratorium on the construction of settlements in the West Bank, municipal authorities in Jerusalem approved 1, 600 new housing units in Ramat Shlomo, a Jewish housing development in East Jerusalem that had been excluded from the agreement. The announcement came as Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was visiting Israel, and was viewed in Washington as a slap in the face. At Mr. Obama’s behest, Mrs. Clinton, then secretary of state, delivered a   lecture to Mr. Netanyahu over the phone. Officials said the episode angered the president more than Mr. Biden himself. Settlements have poisoned the relationship between Mr. Obama and Mr. Netanyahu from the earliest days of the administration. Mr. Obama demanded that Israel halt construction as a gesture to draw the Palestinians back to the bargaining table. Mr. Netanyahu complained that the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, frittered away most of the   moratorium before sitting down to talk. The timing of this approval, administration officials said, was particularly galling: Israeli authorities approved the settlement on the day that Mr. Peres, one of Israel’s founding fathers, died  —   and two days before Mr. Obama arrived in Jerusalem. That raised the possibility that the news could have leaked out while the president was at the funeral, which officials said would have dwarfed the diplomatic uproar during Mr. Biden’s visit. For Mr. Obama and Mr. Netanyahu, it is a bitter coda to a relationship that seemed to end on an uncharacteristically gracious note in New York, when the two men smiled for the cameras, and the prime minister invited the president to Israel to play golf at a course next to his house. Privately, the president raised concerns with Mr. Netanyahu about settlement construction and what Mr. Obama regards as its corrosive effect on the peace process. On Wednesday, Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman, said the administration felt misled yet again by the Israelis. “We did receive public assurances from the Israeli government that contradict this announcement,” Mr. Earnest said. “I guess when we’re talking about how good friends treat one another, that’s a source of serious concern as well. ”",0
