It seems Kate McKinnons heart warming redention of Cohens anthem for sanity Hallelujah is the last straw for the Emperor. He has ordered a full congressional investigation into SNL and their libelous so called humour. 
Alec Baldwin seems to be the main target, but all Trumphole impersonators are included in the arraignment deposition. He has already sent confederate KKK vigilante force to arrest him but it appears as though he has already fled the country with the Clintons as part of the massive Canadian migration . 
Kate McKinnon recently named Americas latest national treasure has already made a deal to move to a much more civilised country with her agents are in discussions with Kim Jong-ill to move to North Korea. 
Satire writers everywhere are bracing for the worst with an underground resistance movement located in secret nuclear bunkers being mooted as their 'last stand'. Make Jung in the Jungle's day - give this story five thumbs-up (there's no need to register , the thumbs are just down there!)",0

Your old Uncle Bob is mixing things up here—and I think you will see where I’m going with this new angle of mine pretty quickly. I have selected three SJW films to review: one from the 1960s, one from the 1980s, and one of much more recent vintage, from 2015. And what might all three of these insidious Hollywood movies have in common? Why, they outwardly or subliminally program viewers to blindly adopt blue-pill beliefs and behaviors, that’s what… 
I feel unsettlingly dirty just writing about these films, but somebody’s gotta do it. So let’s get busy here and expose these three, flat-out, unintentional farces for what they really are. Seize the day. Onward and upward. (Or is that downward…in this case, in terms of these three horrendously blatant SJW films, most definitely downward.) 1. To Kill A Mockingbird (1962 – Gregory Peck, Robert Duvall, Brock Peters, Mary Badham) 
This multiple-Oscar-winning film is based on the Pulitzer-Prize-winning novel of the same name, which was written by Harper Lee and published in 1960—and it is that Pulitzer Prize, and those multiple Oscars, that should be your first major clues that the Hollywood elitists were up to no good while crafting this brilliantly clever piece of SJW brainwashing. 
This wickedly hypnotic movie cleverly reinforces the statistically bankrupt notion that most white males in the American Deep South are vicious, stupid, ignorantly racist crackers who spend most of their time ruining the lives of innocent blacks—that is, when they aren’t shooting them down like dogs or lynching them outright. The plot centers around a hard-working, stand-up, straight-arrow black man, Tom Robinson (Brock Peters), who is falsely accused of rape by a conniving, white-trash slut named Mayella Ewell (Collin Wilcox), whose alcoholic father, Bob Ewell (James Anderson), is a racist pig of unfathomably low character. 
The town’s SJW lawyer, Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck), plays white knight and comes rushing to Tom Robinson’s defense—much to the dismay of the local good ole boys—but despite his best efforts to free the poor, wrongly accused black man, Finch cannot hold back the powerful tide of racist anger, which ultimately results in the backwater town’s killer cops shooting poor Tom down in cold blood (a familiar theme, which can be abundantly found in today’s world of dindu-nothin’ black folk, who are perennially and viciously gunned down by racist white cops, on an ever-increasing and frightening basis…yawn, “Gee, never heard this one before.”). 
I’m not even going to get into the rest of this mind-numbing film’s plot and story line, because it’s a waste of both my time and yours. But I will mention a few correlative facts here, which you might find just a little bit interesting… The SJW-controlled civil rights movement exploded with a vengeance not long after this film was released. And here’s the red-pill truth of the matter: according to the 1994 annual report on murder by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, most interracial murders in the USA involved black assailants and white victims, with blacks murdering whites at 18 times the rate that whites murder blacks. 
These stunning disparities began to emerge in the mid-1960s, when there was a sharp increase in black crime against white people, an upsurge which, not so coincidentally enough, corresponds exactly with the beginning of the modern SJW-crafted civil rights movement. Blacks thus committed 7.5 times more violent interracial crimes than whites, even though the black population was only one-seventh the size of the white population at the time. This is according to the survey, Highlights from 20 Years of Surveying Crime Victims , published in 1993. You’ll have to buy the book if you want to find out the real truth. 
These days, Washington’s SJW data-gatherers no longer keep track of such “ bigoted ” statistics…probably because they care about our safety so very, very deeply. Over the years, the cumulative effects have been staggering. Justice Department and FBI statistics indicate that between 1964 and 1994 more than 25 million violent interracial crimes were committed in the USA, overwhelmingly involving black offenders and white victims, and more than 45,000 people were killed in interracial murders—the vast majority of them being black-on-white killings. By comparison, 58,000 Americans died in the Vietnam War, and 34,000 were killed in the Korean War. 
I wonder how many additional people have been killed in America, during the escalation of these deliberately inflamed race wars, since 1995? Unfortunately, we can’t get a look at those statistics, as previously mentioned, because the Puppet Masters no longer keep such records, so far as I can tell—and if they do, they definitely don’t want us to see them. 
Be that as it may, the notions set forth in To Kill A Mockingbird are repulsively twisted, morally insidious and patently false. And if that offends anybody out there who might be reading this review, that makes my entire freaking day. Because in the end, all that should matter to any critically thinking person is the truth. And what Hollywood dishes out on a regular basis, is anything but… 2. Gandhi (1982 – Sir Ben Kingsley, Martin Sheen, Candice Bergen, Sir John Gielgud) 
Supposedly, as the crafters of history have quite ingeniously led us to believe, Mohandas K. Gandhi (played by Sir Ben Kingsley, in this multiple-Oscar-winning film) utilized the greatest weapon of all in his epic fight against British tyranny on behalf of the Indian people—the incredibly effective method of non-violent resistance. 
And in the movie, Gandhi , there is a sequence in the film featuring a large group of non-compliant protesters, as it faces down a group of security forces armed with sticks, outside of a salt factory, the end result being that the protesters get the holy crap beaten out of them. 
In reality, that was basically all that happened. There was a public dog-and-pony show, shortly after this supposedly real-life event, which was choreographed by the elitist-owned media. And indeed, in this cleverly constructed movie, actor Martin Sheen can be seen describing the bloody mayhem at the factory over the telephone to his cohorts back in the USA (Sheen plays American Journalist Vince Walker in the film). 
And what Sheen’s character witnessed, and put into words, and then passed along to his editor over the phone, was summarily put into print in vast numbers of elitist-owned newspapers, as well as on film, in elitist-owned news reels, and marketed all over the world…which resulted in bringing worldwide focus on the “terrorist acts” of the security workers at the salt factory. This entire episode was allegedly a key element of India’s signature accomplishment of gaining her independence from the British. 
Despite the fact that every single major worldwide event that finds its way into the mainstream media’s propaganda conduits, is either a completely staged event (like the Indian protesters getting beaten outside the salt mine, IMHO), or something that meshes well with the elite’s overall master plan, or they will not even put it into print or on film to begin with (90% of the world’s major media companies are owned by just six major players), we are supposed to believe that the elitist-produced film, Gandhi , depicts real-life events that occurred as the direct result of one brave man in a loincloth, who stood up to the ferocious might of the British Empire and brought the entire house down, single-handedly? 
Please. You’d have a better chance of talking me into using Tinder. 
There is another infamous sequence in the film, wherein a group of Hindi demonstrators is peacefully assembling in protest, within an enclosed, park-like area of the Indian city of Amritsar. The demonstrators are consequently assaulted by British soldiers, who open fire, brutally and randomly, on the assembled sitting ducks, and proceed to gun down hundreds of protesters (this incident allegedly occurred on April 13, 1919, and some estimates put the actual number of demonstrators killed at well over 1000). 
And in this single, crucial, very revealing sequence of the film, the sobering truth is once again put on display for all to see—assembling peacefully, going against the grain of the established order, by utilizing peaceful protest and non-compliance within a group setting, is exactly what the elite want the people to do. Because it makes it a whole lot easier to identify them and kill them. 
In the film, after the mass slaughter, the soldiers’ commander is dressed down by his higher-ups for taking the law into his own hands, and gunning down the peaceful demonstrators. But that was all done strictly for show. And this is most obviously a case of cinematic cover here, as anyone who can think for themselves can easily infer (who do you think produced Gandhi …uh, that would be an elitist-owned film company, Columbia Pictures—do you really think the elite are going to pass along the bona fide solution to wiping them out…uh, no way; last time I checked, rattlesnakes don’t commit suicide). 
The British Empire has a long and bloody history of usurping lands. And the notion that the string-pullers at the very top of the greasy flagpole would be aghast at the actions of the British commander who ordered the slaughter at Amritsar, is comical at best. 
What the slaughter at Amritsar actually accomplished (in addition to the mass-murder of a huge swath of ardent protesters) was the following: 
With the complicit assistance of the elitist-owned press, the British commander’s actions that day reinforced the suicidal notion that peaceful protest and non-violent resistance were the keys to bringing about significant social change. And throughout history, other choreographed events like the slaughter at Amritsar and the subsequent explosion of moral outrage, fueled by the reports in the elite-owned media, have continued to give rise to the suicidal notion that non-violent resistance actually works. 
Which of course it does, but only in isolated, high-profile, choreographed incidents, where the outcome has already been decided beforehand, whenever the Puppet Masters want it to appear that way to the sleeping sheep…the rest of the time, it only results in mass-incarceration, physical assault, political harassment or murder. On a more subtle note, you might have noticed that two of the leading actors in this Oscar-winning film were eventually knighted by the British Empire—namely, Sir Ben Kingsley (knighted in 2001) and Sir John Gielgud (knighted in 1953)…to which I can only say, “I rest my case, Your Honor.” 3) The Gift (2015 – Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall, Joel Edgerton, Allison Tolman) 
I don’t typically watch modern Hollywood films these days. Mostly because I know what Hollywood is up to, so I normally avoid them in the exact same way that I avoid single mothers with tramp stamps, or chicks with green hair. But I went ahead and checked out this absolute mindfuck of a movie on Showtime the other night, knowing it would probably throw me a wicked, SJW curveball—and sure enough, it didn’t disappoint. 
As an aside, I threw this film into the mix, juxtaposed with the previous two Oscar-winners, partly to demonstrate how far the bar has fallen in the Hollywood filmmaking industry, in terms of the standard of quality. They don’t even try to hide the SJW brainwashing madness in their films any longer. At least back in the day, they could mindfuck the sheep in an entertaining and captivating way, while keeping their overall intentions under the radar…but today, as this next film proves? Not so much. 
Simon Callem (Jason Bateman) has a “horrifying” secret buried in his “twisted” past, and his wife, Robyn (Rebecca Hall), is clueless about the whole thing (innocent white female vs. evil white male, the usual bullshit here). The couple relocates from Chicago to a suburb of Los Angeles, where they run into Gordon “Gordo” Moseley (Joel Edgerton), a creepy, awkward, socially inept former high school classmate of Simon’s. Gordo starts dropping by the couple’s new house, uninvited and unannounced, and he does so on far too many occasions. Simon thinks Gordon’s behavior is weird (which it is), but his SJW wife thinks Gordo is sweet, shy, and simply misunderstood. 
Gordo’s weirdness escalates in typical bore-me-to-death fashion (Hollywood is really great at this audience-wowing technique lately), until Robyn finally discovers her husband’s long-held secret: he bullied poor Gordo back in high school, by inventing a story about him, which centered around a homosexual relationship that Gordo never had. The horrendously unfair story got back to Gordo’s father, and Gordo’s father nearly killed him! 
Of course, Simon’s liberal, SJW, brainwashed wife eventually wants her bully-boy husband out of her life forever, shortly after discovering this unforgivable transgression (even though she’s pregnant with their first child, and they were very much in love up to this point; yeah, like that would ever happen in real life). 
The SJW bullshit meter spikes so hard in this film, that you’ll be left slack-jawed, stunned and eye-rollingly incredulous, and if you are unfortunate enough to have to sit through this absolutely putrid piece of garbage, be sure to keep a barf-bucket handy (especially for the ending)—because you are definitely going to need it. 
Hopefully, it’s getting a whole lot easier for you to spot the bullshit that is being sold, not only in today’s SJW Hollywood films, but in Hollywood films of days gone by (most especially Oscar winners). 
The elite are always using the magic of Hollywood for nefarious purposes—namely, to “magically” instill behaviors in its audience members that will get them into trouble, or instill beliefs in them that are totally divorced from reality. 
Doing this makes it much easier to divide the movie-going sheep, and thereby conquer them, typically by race, or by historical beliefs, or by sociopolitical beliefs. 
So do yourself, and the world, a huge favor, and avoid SJW Hollywood films wherever and whenever you can. The rule is simple: if it’s being made in Hollywood today, it’s a BPO film (blue pill only). And unfortunately, as it pertains to movies that were made all the way back in the early 1960s (if not even further), well, as we have just seen, the same rule applies, in many cases. 
By boycotting Hollywood films, you are lessening the degree of brainwashing to which you subject yourself, simply by being alive in the world at the present time. And in this particular case, less is most definitely more .",0

7812,Comment on Wikileaks Reveal Clinton Ties To Rothschilds And Occult Cabal by Time to hail Hillary Clinton – and face down the testosterone left | Van Badham – News,"By wmw_admin on July 27, 2016 Baxter Dmitry — Your News Wire.com July 25, 2016 From left to right: Hillary Clinton and Evelyn de Rothschild, Bill Clinton and Lynn Forester de Rothschild. Click to enlarge 
The Wikileaks classified email dumps have exposed Hillary Clinton for what she really is – a member of the infamous Rothschild family’s inner sanctum, with occultist beliefs. 
Lending further credibility to the idea that Presidents are not elected but are selected by a global shadow government, the Wikileaks email dumps expose Hillary Clinton’s close relationship with the infamous Rothschild banking family and hints for a potential Rockefeller-State partnership. 
The fact the mainstream media have been exposed colluding with the Clinton campaign cannot come as a surprise, considering she is the Rothschild’s selected candidate. 
Lynn Forester de Rothschild wrote an email on April 18, 2010, in which she tells Hillary she would “ love to catch up ” — and “ I remain your loyal adoring pal .” Clinton responds “ let’s make that happen ,” and signs her response, “ Much love, H .” 
On September 23, 2010, Clinton emailed Lynn Forester de Rothschild saying, “ I was trying to reach you to tell you and Teddy that I asked Tony Blair to go to Israel as part of our full court press on keeping the Middle East negotiations going … ” 
Rothschild responds, thanking Clinton for “ personally reaching out to us ,” and adds, “ You are the best, and we remain your biggest fans .” 
A January 9, 2012, email discusses a meeting set to take place at Jacob Rothschild’s “ historic estate, Waddesdon .” OCCULTIST TIES Bohemian Grove gathering. Click to enlarge 
Hillary Clinton is so deeply entrenched in the elite New World Order establishment that she even bows down to Moloch, the same occultist god they perform human sacrifice rituals for at the annual Bohemian Grove meetings. 
In an email from August 29 2008, a senior government staffer writes to Hillary Clinton, “ With fingers crossed, the old rabbit’s foot out of the box in the attic, I will be sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch . . . ” 
Thanks to the Wikileaks Hillary Clinton Email Archive (containing 30,022 emails, free to search), we now have more concrete proof that Hillary Clinton and other globalist elites have occult ties. Nobody randomly uses Moloch in a conversation. Most people don’t even know what Moloch is. Clinton email. Click to enlarge 
But Bohemian Grove, the playground of the world’s most wealthy and powerful men, has been performing sacrifice rituals to Moloch since the 1800s, offering charred human flesh according to some reports. 
Given the reputation Bohemian Grove has for deciding the next President of the United States in the year before the election (see former Presidents Eisenhower, Nixon and Reagan, the Bush dynasty, as well as Hillary’s husband Bill Clinton), it should come as no surprise that Hillary is wriggling her way into their dark, secretive world 
The Bohemian Grove club might be infamously male only, but temporary exceptions have been made for women before, and as it is apparent the New World Order has decided it is in their interest to ordain Hillary as the next President then they will bend their rules to let her in. 
This explains why the mainstream media – and social media platforms – are working overtime to get Clinton elected. The global elites have spoken and the mainstream media has begun marching to the beat of their drum – supporting their selected candidate, and destroying the chances of anyone they see as a threat to their corrupt, elite club.",0
7813,"Love and Black Lives, in Pictures Found on a Brooklyn Street - The New York Times","One night six years ago, on a quiet side street in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, I came across a photo album that had been put out with the trash. I lived around the corner, and I was walking home when I saw it sitting beneath a streetlamp on Lincoln Place. It looked handmade, with a wooden cover bound with a shoelace. But it had been tied up with twine, like a bunch of old newspapers, and left atop a pile of recycling. After hesitating a moment, I picked it up and took it home. The pages were fragile, and they cracked when I turned them, as if the album hadn’t been opened in a long time, but the photos were perfectly preserved. They seemed to chronicle the life of a black couple at midcentury: a beautiful woman with a big smile and a man who looked serious, or was maybe just   and had served in World War II. As I turned the pages, the scenery changed from country picnics to city streets and crowded dance halls in what appeared to be Harlem, and the couple went from youth to middle age. Looking at the album, I was struck by how joyful the photos were  —   and by the fact that as fabled as this era was, I had never seen a black family’s own account of that time. I wondered who these neighbors were, and who had thrown the album out. For decades, this part of Crown Heights had been mostly black. When I arrived in the neighborhood, several years before, I was one of the few nonblack residents on the block. The neighborhood was changing, though newcomers were arriving and longtime residents were moving out. I went back to Lincoln Place, hoping to find the album’s owner it had surely been thrown out by mistake. Lincoln Place was the very image of old Brooklyn promoted by real estate agents. On other blocks, the houses were carved up or crumbling. Or they had been torn down and replaced by big buildings with spotlights and   signs. But on Lincoln Place, the stately rowhouses were still intact and well loved. The block was preserved in amber. I knocked on doors and left my number, but I never heard from anyone. So I put the album on my bookshelf. A few years later, my landlords got an offer they couldn’t refuse, and my short time in Crown Heights was up. I stumbled upon the album while packing and pulled it off the shelf. Now I really had to reckon with it. Gentrification was transforming the neighborhood  —   soon there might be no one left who recognized the world in these pictures. And the album was literally falling apart in my hands. If I was ever going to try to get to the bottom of it, this was the time. I decided to uncover its story. I thought it would be simple. But chasing the album would become something of a journey, one that would take me far from   Brooklyn to the Jim Crow South, from a remote island in the Pacific to the packed tenements of Harlem, before returning me to Lincoln Place at another moment of great change. Last spring, I began the search. The photos were arranged on black   pages with little mounting corners and Scotch tape that had turned yellow with age. There were 167 pictures, and they covered both sides of the pages, as if to save space. But the photos stopped about halfway through the album. The rest of it was blank. I looked behind every photo, but there were only a few clues, handwritten notes like “From your old pal Duke,” “Myself and Sylvia” or “Love to Etta Mae, From Dorothy. ” The name Etta Mae was written on three or four photos, and I began to suspect she was the woman who appeared throughout the album. She had a full figure and elegant hands. She smoked. But I always spotted her by her smile. She was often with the same man. They were embracing, or they were in separate photos on the same page. I guessed that he was her husband on one photo, someone had written, “To my best friend’s hubby. ” Carrying photocopies of a few pictures, I went back to Crown Heights. I had been gone less than two years, but there were all sorts of changes. On Nostrand Avenue, a West Indian market that had carried buckets of salt cod had closed. Where once the only coffee had come in yellow cans of Bustelo, cafes served locally roasted espresso. There was a retro cocktail bar. On Lincoln Place, a   sign hung outside one house, and another was under renovation. There was a Pilates studio. There were more young families now, and when I asked them about the album as they swept the sidewalk or sat on their stoops, they apologized: They were new to the block and couldn’t help. One evening, I was close to giving up when a young man in a garden apartment told me to talk to Jimmy, the oldest guy on the block. He pointed to a red house a few doors down. An old man answered the door. Yes, he said, he was Jimmy  —   James Burton. I showed him the photocopied pictures, and he squinted. “That’s Mrs. Taylor,” he said. “Etta Mae. ” The man in the pictures was her husband, Isaiah Taylor. Everyone called him Ike, Mr. Burton said. The Taylors had lived on Lincoln Place forever. He pointed next door, at a white house with classical molding. When I returned to Lincoln Place a few days later with the whole album, Mr. Burton and his wife, Lenore, were doing a puzzle at a card table. “You say you just found this album on the street?” she asked, laughing. “I wouldn’t touch it. I’m amazed you would touch it. ” “Would you pick it up?” she asked her husband. “Maybe,” he said. They were in their late 80s. Ms. Burton had worked as a bookkeeper, and Mr. Burton had been a chauffeur and a shipping clerk. They had lived on Lincoln Place since the early 1950s, and raised their two daughters there. The Taylors had been their neighbors and close friends, almost like family. “In those days, we knew most everybody, and then they started disappearing and dying and moving away,” Mr. Burton said. “Now I’m lucky if I know 10 people. ” We sat on the couch and opened the album. Pages had torn loose from the binding, and as we passed them between us, black flakes fluttered to the floor. “No, no,” Mr. Burton said, peering at the faces to see if he recognized anyone. “Etta and Ike. That’s all I know is them two. ” Halfway through, we came to a page crowded with small pictures. Mr. Burton paused. “That looks like me,” he said, his voice a little louder. “Your mother, Uncle Fernando  —   that’s my wedding. ” I was hooked. Now that I had names, I enlisted a researcher at The New York Times, Susan C. Beachy, and she pulled documents for Etta Mae Taylor: census records birth, death and marriage certificates old phone books newspaper clippings. Etta Mae didn’t have children. Her siblings had all died. But she had relatives scattered across the country. The Burtons remembered a niece from North Carolina, and the researcher found someone in Raleigh named Joann Barnes. She was now in her 70s. For months, the only other thing I knew about her was that she didn’t pick up her phone. I didn’t blame her. “Hello,” I would say when I left voice mail messages, “I’m calling about a photo album that may have belonged to your family. ” Even as I said it, I knew it sounded like a scam. I tried her relatives, calling, sending emails and friendly Facebook messages, but always with the same result: silence. The documents, at least, gave me the beginnings of Etta Mae’s story. Etta Mae Barnes was born on July 28, 1918, in Wilson, N. C. which once called itself the world’s greatest   tobacco market. When Ms. Taylor was young, it was a boomtown. Thousands of   families had migrated to Wilson from the countryside to pick tobacco on farms and hang it in big warehouses downtown. The first pages in the album seemed to be of Wilson several photos had stamps from photographers’ studios there. There were portraits of women in flouncy dresses, babies, a boy with a dog, a group in straw hats in a field. In two portraits placed side by side, a   couple posed by a flowering bush, in front of a clapboard house. I wondered if they were Etta Mae’s parents. Etta Mae’s mother, Anna Bell Green Barnes, was born in Virginia and worked as a hanger at a tobacco company, the documents revealed. Her father, James Frank Barnes, was a grocery store clerk. His family went back generations in Wilson County. Etta Mae was one of six. When she was still a child, her oldest brother, Charles, boarded the train that passed through Wilson and became part of what we now call the Great Migration, the exodus of millions of black Southerners from the Jim Crow South. Judging from the album, many of Etta Mae’s relatives had gone north I could tell them apart from their country kin by their suits and furs. Etta Mae left school after seventh grade and went to work as a housekeeper in a private home, according to the 1940 census. That year, 10 other people were living at the Barneses’ including an aunt an adopted daughter Etta Mae’s sister Mildred Mildred’s husband, Jack Artis and their baby, Charles. In 1940, Etta Mae left her crowded home. But she didn’t go north just yet. She went to Suffolk, Va. where, according to her marriage license, she wed Isaiah Taylor on the day after her 22nd birthday. Ike Taylor was three years younger than Etta Mae, and when they married, he had recently graduated from high school and was working as a deliveryman. His father was a cook. His mother worked at a peanut processing plant. Suffolk, like Wilson, was segregated, unofficially divided by the railroad tracks. On one side, a sizable black community had grown, drawn by jobs in the factories of peanut producers like Planters. The Taylors’ wedding announcement in a local paper said, “The couple will reside here. ” But in 1941, the United States entered World War II, and farm work had grown scarce amid an agriculture crisis. Hundreds of thousands of black Southerners rushed to enlist, and Ike was one of them. There were about a dozen photographs from the war in the album, loose snapshots tucked in the back. They showed black soldiers amid spindly trees and what looked like Japanese shrines. Ike was an army truck commander in the 510th Port Battalion and rose to the rank of master sergeant, according to his military records. His unit was stationed on Tinian, an island in the Pacific that the United States captured from the Japanese, where the armed forces built a huge air base. (It was from Tinian that the Enola Gay took off for Hiroshima.) Today, most of the men in Ike’s unit would be approaching 100, if they were alive at all, and I had given up on getting a firsthand account, when I found a videotaped interview with a member of the 510th in the Library of Congress. James W. Taylor (no relation to Ike) died in 2014. In the video, he described their time in the army. The armed forces were still segregated, and there were almost no black combat units until troops thinned at the end of the war black soldiers were instead relegated to labor and service units. Their battalion unloaded ammunition from ships and provided transport. On Tinian, they lived apart from the white soldiers. They slept in tents in a separate camp, ate separately and drank from water tanks that they filled, separately, from a mountain spring. These men may have enlisted in the army to escape Jim Crow, but instead they found themselves on a tropical island in the Pacific that had become a replica of the segregated South. This was where records trailed off. To go any further, I needed a guide. One night in the fall, I found one. I got a Facebook message from someone in Wilson named Craig Barnes Jr. whom I had written to months before. “Sorry, I’m just seeing this now,” he said. “Do you still have that photo?” I replied immediately with a smiley face. “I have the entire album!” Over the phone, Mr. Barnes, 25, said that he was related to Etta Mae, but that he didn’t know much about her the person to talk to was his grandmother, Joann Barnes  —   the woman in Raleigh who hadn’t taken my calls. He promised to set up a conversation, but weeks went by. When we finally spoke, he had bad news: She wasn’t answering the phone. But that was all I had. So a week later, I boarded a flight for Raleigh, the album in my bag. I met up with a photographer and we drove to the last listed address for Ms. Barnes: a retirement complex in a   apartment building surrounded by trees. I was unsure if she even lived there, much less how she would feel about my visit, and as we approached, I felt nervous for the first time. I had come all this way, and though I thought the album was important, maybe I was just intruding. I pressed the buzzer and identified myself over the intercom as a reporter from New York. After a long moment, a woman’s voice crackled through the speaker. “All right,” she said. “I’ll buzz you in, dear. ” As we walked down the hall toward her apartment, Ms. Barnes stepped out from her door, as if she planned to give us only a minute. She had short gray hair and wore a   blouse. “Are you a relative of Etta Mae Taylor?” I asked. “Yes, I was her niece,” she said. I explained, quickly, how I had met the Burtons, that they had told me Etta Mae’s name and that I should look for her niece. “O. K.,” she said. “And, well,” I said, “basically, I found this on the street. ” I held out the album. She gave a surprised laugh. I laughed too, with relief. “You know, it kind of makes you leery,” Ms. Barnes said. She had gotten my messages, and her grandson’s, but she was skeptical because she had never seen her aunt’s photo album. She invited us in. Her apartment was small and neat. She had been cleaning, and after she washed her hands, we sat down. She was from Wilson, she said, but she left when she was young and spent nearly 30 years in New York, where she was a visiting nurse. She opened the album. “Oh, my goodness,” she said. “These are from way back. ” She spotted her grandparents  —   Etta Mae’s parents  —   in front of the clapboard house in Wilson where she, too, had grown up. There, in the yard, they played horseshoes and caught pigeons. She named her aunts and uncles and cousins. “And that’s me,” she said, touching a photo of a little girl. “I always liked this picture. I believe my father made this skirt. He used to make clothes for me when I was small. And I always had those big bows. ” She shook her head and smiled. “Little knock knees,” she said. Wilson was about an hour’s drive east. The downtown was deserted, the brick warehouses the only remnant of the tobacco era. Across the tracks, the house where Etta Mae grew up had been torn down. In the empty lot where it once stood, there was no trace of the family that had become so real to me. A pickup was parked in the overgrown grass. Most of Etta Mae’s family had left Wilson and scattered, but Craig Barnes Jr. was still there. We met up at an Applebee’s off the highway. I thanked him for writing to me and handed him the album. As he turned the pages, I said I had never seen a black family’s photos from this era. He said he hadn’t either. “The lifestyle they’re living looks amazing,” he said. In Etta Mae’s day, the magic of Harlem reached the South through newspapers, relatives’ letters and the radio, and in the 1940s, another wave of Southern migrants moved to New York, drawn by Cab Calloway and Duke Ellington as much as by the promise of factory jobs. “New York was the place to be,” Ms. Barnes said. While Ike was in the Pacific, Etta Mae joined her sister Mildred and her husband, along with her brother Charles, in Harlem, and the sisters found jobs pressing drapes at a factory in the garment district. “They were pressers,” Ms. Barnes said. “That was kind of the going job at the time. ” When the war was over, Ike and Etta Mae were reunited in New York. On weekends, they would go dancing  —   at small clubs and at the blocklong Savoy Ballroom on Lenox Avenue, where thousands of couples did the jitterbug. From the time she was little, Ms. Barnes would take the train every year to visit the Taylors. “I was a Southern girl I used to go every summer with my grandmother,” she said. “When I would see them dressed up, it was exciting. Like these were some movie stars or something. ” Of her two aunts, Ms. Barnes said, Etta Mae was the serious one. “Mae thought she was the boss. She always thought she was smarter than everybody else. She was always saying, ‘Sister, you shouldn’t do that Sister, you should. ’” But she loved to dance, Ms. Barnes said. “And she could sing, too. ” The photos speak to the glamour of life in Harlem, but they barely hint at its struggles. Housing discrimination largely confined black people to Harlem, and in the 1940s, as more Southern migrants surged into the city, its blocks became some of the most densely populated in the world. Landlords charged high rents and let their buildings fall into ruin. They knew their tenants had nowhere else to go. After riots broke out in 1943, Langston Hughes wrote of Harlemites’ poverty and frustration: “Some of them don’t try anymore.   I reckon. ” Etta Mae and her sister lived in a packed tenement on West 116th Street. Their brother Charles, who in the album looks dashing in a dark suit with a pocket square, worked as a deliveryman for a florist, and shared his apartment on 131st Street with his wife and seven lodgers from the South. In the middle of the album was a series of oversize portraits of couples gathered around   tables in night clubs. I couldn’t figure out where they were taken until a clue cropped up in an old newspaper: Ike was listed among the members of the Eight Chaps Social Club, a men’s club composed of Suffolkians that was hosting a dance in Harlem. Seven of the Chaps were dead now, but the eighth picked up the phone. “Isaiah Taylor?” Walter Howell, 95, said. Of course he remembered him. “Good buddy of mine. ” He told me the photos were, indeed, from the club’s dances. They look glamorous, but all of the Chaps, Mr. Howell said, had   jobs. He had worked in a   plant preparing minks and sables. Then he answered a question that hadn’t occurred to me, which was why the Taylors had such a dazzling record of their social life. The reason was that one member of the club, Jesse Williams, was a professional photographer. Craig Steven Wilder, a historian at M. I. T. told me that for Southern migrants far from home, men’s clubs like the Eight Chaps “become their new kinship networks. ” “That informal network is how you access news about where you can move,” Professor Wilder said, “where black people are moving and welcome. ” In 1950, the population of Central Harlem reached its peak, and   began to inch their way into other boroughs. The Eight Chaps scattered. Etta Mae and Ike, of course, went to Brooklyn. Crown Heights was predominantly white at the time. And when Etta Mae and Ike moved to Lincoln Place around 1950, renting a room from a black hairdresser named Lucille Stewart, they became some of the first black residents on the block. The Burtons, the neighbors whose wedding photos were in the album, came soon after. “We were about the second blacks on the block,” Lenore Burton said. Ms. Burton’s parents, Clara and Cannon Harper, moved into the white house with the classical molding, with their daughter Jackie. After they got married, the Burtons bought the red house next door. Etta Mae and Ike soon moved into the third floor of the Harpers’ white house, and the two households became like one. Etta Mae’s album captures their communal life: They shared meals, gave each other haircuts, gathered in the kitchen in their bathrobes. Ms. Burton’s sister, Jackie Jones, still lives in the white house that she grew up in and eventually inherited from her parents. On one of my visits to the Burtons’ she appeared, magically, in their living room: Back in the 1950s, they had installed a door between their homes. “All the families were intertwined more or less, though they weren’t blood relations,” Ms. Jones, 89, said. The picture the Burtons painted of the 1950s was a happy one. And it took me a moment to step back and see the obvious: During this time, as black people arrived on Lincoln Place, white families were leaving. Isabel Wilkerson, the author of “The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America’s Great Migration,” said the timing was not a coincidence. “Fear led many white residents to flee,” she said. “Neighborhoods began to open up because white people were so fearful that they would sell at a loss. ” It was a sign of what was coming. In the next decades, hundreds of thousands of white families would leave the city, and black families would move into their homes, a phenomenon that came to be known as white flight. In 1950, the Taylors’ census tract was 95 percent white. By 1970, it was 87 percent black. White flight is often associated with the poverty and crime that plagued New York City in the later decades of the 20th century, and conjures images of muggings, abandoned buildings and urban blight. But these photos too were images of the   era: People posing beside a 1950s television console, a man at a piano, a sunny picnic. In 1956, the new homeowners formed the Lincoln Civic Block Association, which still exists. “There was a Pokeno circle, a poker circle,” Mr. Burton said. “You’d go from house to house. Nobody had a lock on the door. Our house was never locked. You’d look up, and there’d be cousin   . ” The Burtons pointed out a few houses on Lincoln Place where   still lived. A neighbor, Marilyn LeGall, 72, grew up visiting her aunt and uncle on Lincoln Place. “You played stickball, you jumped rope,” she said. “Everyone looked after the other. ” That was life on Lincoln Place, said Arthur Bates Jr. 56, who grew up on the block. “It was a real neighborhood, and a black experience no one talks about, because it wasn’t filled with drugs and it wasn’t filled with poverty,” Mr. Bates said. “It was public schools, it was playing ball, it was playing music. ” Now, he added, everyone was discovering brownstone Brooklyn. “It’s been sitting here, like so many aspects of our lives. People say, ‘It’s dripping with original details.’ Who do you think maintained it? Where were you?” Etta Mae and Ike settled down on Lincoln Place after a decade of war and uncertainty and living in cramped quarters in Harlem. Etta Mae kept working in the garment district. She went bargain hunting on Flatbush Avenue for outfits and nice furniture for their apartment. She joined a book club. Ike got dogs  —   and cars. “A blue Chevy,” Mr. Burton recalled. On the weekends, they would go to their dances, and Mildred came over. They drank cocktails and listened to records. “They were   folks,” Ms. Jones said. “You could come and sit and drink and smoke and laugh. They loved to laugh. ” They traveled, driving south to see one of Ike’s sisters in Washington, and to their hometowns. In the 1960s, they went on cruises. New York gave them a good life. And if it was lived in the shadow of white flight, it was a life they never could have had in the South. Ike’s niece, Brenda Oliver, 67, remembered her aunt arriving in Virginia wearing pretty clothes, smelling good. Ms. Oliver’s mother was a maid. “My mom lived in a house with a coal stove. She was so impressed that her siblings had gotten out of the South and made a life for themselves. ” In their later years, Ike and Etta Mae look content. In one photo, they stand beside each other, she in a dress, he in a suit. She is giving him a knowing little smile. His arm is around her shoulder. It is the last photo of the two of them together. On Aug. 5, 1971, Ike died of cancer. He was 50. After he died, Etta Mae stopped keeping the album. That was why half of the pages were blank. Etta Mae stayed on Lincoln Place. She took care of children for working couples, recalled the Burtons’ daughter, Carol Burton, 58. Etta Mae got books in the mail, never putting them on the shelf until they were read. She went to church every Sunday, at Berean Baptist nearby. She took in relatives once or twice, for brief spells, but otherwise lived alone. I found former residents of Lincoln Place. They remembered Etta Mae, but not as the young woman in the album. “She was always an old lady,” Sherrie Tanner Hammonds, 47, said. She grew up on the block with her grandmother, Ms. Stewart, the hairdresser, and now lives in Rochester. “She always had a small dog. She had a little set schedule. She would walk morning and night. ” “Rain or shine,” said Constance P. Jermin, 83, who left Lincoln Place for Georgia in 2002. “She was very deliberate and devoted. And she always greeted everyone. Always with a big smile. ” For a few years, Etta Mae and I shared the block. Our bedroom windows looked out on the same backyards, and every day, she must have walked past my house, though I can’t recall if I ever actually saw her. When she could no longer get around, Ms. Jones, her landlady, took care of her. “She was feisty,” said Ms. Jones, who said she never raised her rent from $200. “She was good until the end. ” The end was swift. In 2010, Etta Mae fell and went to the hospital, and from there, to a nursing home in East New York, Brooklyn. She died there, five long miles from Lincoln Place, on June 4, 2011. She was 92. She is buried next to her husband at Long Island National Cemetery, a veterans’ graveyard in Farmingdale, N. Y. They share a single headstone, their names on either side. Etta Mae’s funeral program ends, “Etta lived a full life. ” It was all in the album: the Great Migration, Harlem at its most chaotic and crowded, the transformation of Brooklyn. For her neighbors on Lincoln Place, Etta Mae’s album brought back happy memories of their first years on the block, but it did not stop the clock from ticking. In October, Lenore Burton died. Her widower, James Burton, plans to stay in their home on Lincoln Place. For Etta Mae’s family, the album helped fill the void left by relatives who moved to the North. They let me hold onto the album until the publication of this article. I had one last question: How did the album end up on the curb? After her aunt died, Joann Barnes came from Raleigh to arrange the funeral in Brooklyn. She hadn’t been to Lincoln Place in years and was surprised by how little her aunt’s home had changed. She had moved into the back rooms and left the rest untouched. Everything was from the 1950s  —   the kitchen sink and cabinets, the furniture in the living room, which was covered in plastic. In Ike’s old office, there was a record player, hundreds of records, and a shelf with glasses and little stirrers, the remnants of his bar. The closets were stuffed with linens and old clothes. When she went to dry her hands after washing them in the bathroom, the hand towel was so old it split in two. She was tired from the funeral, and overwhelmed. She just wanted to get home. She packed up some wedding dishes for her sister, a few pots and pans. For herself, she took some change from a drawer. “A silver dollar, some old coins,” she said. “That’s just me. I have my memory of her and our trips and what we did together. I’m not a keeper. ” As she got ready to go, Ms. Jones came in. “She asked me if I was coming back,” Ms. Barnes said, “and I said no. ‘Open the doors and let the neighbors come and take what they want. Just open it up. ’” In the weeks afterward, Ms. Jones worked her way through the apartment. She bagged up the clothes. She pulled the records off the shelf. She boxed up Etta Mae’s books. When she found the album, she tied it up with twine. And one evening, before the trucks came to pick up the recycling, she carried it outside with a few boxes and left it on the curb. A few minutes, or a few hours, passed. Then, just as Etta Mae had walked past my house so many times before, I walked by hers, picked up her album and carried it home.",0
7815,Mont Blanc Cable Car Passengers Are Stranded Aloft Overnight in French Alps - The New York Times,"PARIS  —     passengers were stranded overnight on Thursday in   cable cars in the French Alps after helicopters were used to rescue 65 others who had been trapped, officials said. The daring rescue was unfolding at an altitude of nearly 12, 500 feet in the Mont Blanc massif near Chamonix after the cars came to a halt around 2 p. m. between the Aiguille du Midi in France and Pointe Helbronner in Italy. A    boy was among those stranded, according to   Leclerc, the prefect of   who spoke at a news conference. “We had to stop the rescuing operations when the night came because the helicopters can’t do the rescuing operation when it is dark,” Floriane Macian, a spokeswoman for the prefecture, said in a telephone interview. A dozen passengers were evacuated by an Italian rescue team. That part of the operation was not done by helicopter because the cable car was close enough to the ground, according to Mathieu Dechavanne, the chief executive of the company that manages the cable cars. The rescue effort resumed Friday morning. The cars stopped because supporting cables and towing cables crossed in several places. “We managed to uncross the cables in two places by pulling them, but we did not manage to uncross them in the third one,” Mr. Dechavanne said in a phone interview. Mr. Dechavanne said he had called the rescue services at 5 p. m. to start evacuating the passengers. “We had to do it by helicopter and not vertically like we can do it in other places, because the ground underneath is of a glacial type so there is a risk of crevasses and it could lead to accidents,” he said. The Daily Express, a British newspaper, reported that rescuers had harnessed themselves to the cables and climbed along to the cars and dropping down through hatches. Five rescue workers were remaining with some of the passengers, and the temperature was expected to drop to 32 degrees overnight. The passengers were given food and blankets. “They have a survival kit in each of the cable cars with cereals bars, water and survival blankets, and we contacted them by phone to explain everything,” Mr. Dechavanne said. “Only two of the cable cars don’t have rescue workers with them, they have the survival kit. ” The cable cars can usually carry up to 140 people, who often come to enjoy the view on the mountains at this time of the year in Chamonix. The ride takes 30 minutes. A passenger who was evacuated told The Express that he and his family had been trapped for hours. “It was me, my daughter and my son,” Frédéric Maurer, 49, said. “We were two and a half hours in the cab locked under the sun. ” The cable car company said its Aiguille du Midi cable car holds the world record for the highest vertical ascent: 2, 807 meters, or 9, 209 feet.",0
7816,Comey’s October Surprise,"After some considerable anticipation, it seemed that the much awaited October Surprise had arrived with the revelation that John Podesta, HRC’s right hand man, had a bona fide email addiction after having been publicly identified by Wikileaks as the author of a massive quantity of damaging emails.
As scandal-weary voters are threatened with serious cerebral overload, the continuing array of titillating revelations spanned from naming the MSM names in collusion with the Democrats to an otherwise obscure reporter suggesting that Podesta link Russia to Trump to a multitude of documents identifying the Clinton Foundation as a vehicle for nefarious dealings – and a host of unethical examples of how to steal democracy, the rank-and-file continues to look the other way, clinging to the illusion that Democrats are the good guys, the white hats for social change.
Beginning with the DNC scandal in July which revealed a host of pre-meditated efforts to undermine the Bernie Sanders campaign and steal the nomination, the question remains whether a candidate nominated as a result of a flawed, if not legally flawed, Democratic primary process could be considered a politically legitimate candidate for the general election and the office of US President. The Clinton campaign apparently never felt the need to resolve that question.
Since the Wikileaks emails were not a total surprise, it would now appear that the real October Surprise is FBI Director James B. Comey’s dramatic turn-around announcement on October 28th that the Clinton email investigation was being re-opened due to new information as a result of its investigation into Carlos Danger.
Comey, who reportedly had been privately criticized by disgruntled agents in his department for the dismissal of felony charges against Clinton, informed pertinent Congressional Committee Chairs and ranking Democrats of the renewed investigation in an unusual letter on Friday. Acknowledging that the agency had previously “completed its investigation,” Comey said that “due to recent developments” the FBI had “learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.” Comey continued that after having been briefed by the FBI’s investigative team, he “agreed that the FBI should take proper investigative steps” to “determine whether they (the emails) contain classified information .”
To put the current crisis in context, several days after the FBI’s original announcement in July, Rep. Curt Gowdy’s (R-SC) conducted a vigorous cross examination of Comey that was devastating to the FBI’s “no charge” determination and its no proof of intent determination that was, in turn, irreparably damaging to Secretary Clinton’s credibility. In other words, backed into a corner by Gowdy, Comey confirmed that Clinton had misrepresented the facts. Comey’s responses should have been front page headlines but received barely a ripple from the MSM which Wikileaks confirmed takes its marching orders from the DNC.
In response to the newest FBI investigation that surfaced on Friday, Secretary Clinton has demanded , contrary to standard procedure, that the FBI “release all of the information that it has” and “needs to share whatever facts they have with the American people” and “it is deeply troubling because voters deserve to get full and complete facts” without any recognition of the irony.
Secretary Clinton is, of course, a subject of interest of the renewed investigation and understands that the purpose of a reopened investigation is to ferret out the facts. Rather than shoot from the hip to conform with candidate Clinton’s demands, Comey has the responsibility to conduct a thorough investigation free from political intimidation as should have occurred in July. While the public can only speculate on the real backstory, if there is one, prompting the FBI to initiate this current investigation, surely Comey understands what is on the line here. For the FBI to come back at some future time with another ‘no charges’ determination, everyone go home folks, there’s nothing more to see, would irredeemably and irretrievably doom the FBI, which is already on thin ice, and further drive a once-Constitutional democracy into the ditch.
As the Democrats continue to circle the wagons, counting on some mindless Democrat to continue its nonsensical anti-Russian agenda, Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Oh) stepped forward to link the FBI with Putin as the true source of the new stash of emails which were found on the home computer of former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-NY), estranged husband of HRC’s long-time confidante Huma Abedin. FBI officials first estimated ‘ tens of thousands of emails’ belonging to Ms. Abedin but have since revised its estimate to 650,000 emails which may include some of the missing 33,000 emails previously erased and may have been sent to and from Secretary Clinton’s private email server.
Following the thread, if we assume that a percentage of Ms. Abedin’s emails were ‘classified’ or ‘top secret’ (which is a reasonable assumption) and that her husband, who has repeatedly exhibited gross lapses of judgment, had free and open access to his own computer, the question that terrifies the Democrats is not knowing the content of Abedin emails contained in Weiner’s laptop.
As if to throw oil on a bonfire, it was reported over the weekend that Comey’s decision to reopen the Clinton investigation was done against Attorney General Loretta Lynch’s recommendation. You may recall in July, Lynch participated in a highly controversial tarmac meeting with former President Bill Clinton – just days prior to Comey’s announcement that there would be no criminal charges against Hilary Clinton.
Looking back on the July announcement may factor into Comey’s role in the current controversy. It is, of course, FBI Director’s job to conduct an investigation and it is the Attorney General’s decision whether or not to pursue prosecution. Given that the Lynch – Clinton tarmac meeting was widely publicized, a good guess is that the political players decided it more appropriate for Comey to do the ‘no charges’ announcement rather than Lynch – who was already being publicly castigated for favoring Clinton by meeting with Big Bill. Lynch took the easy way with Comey being sent to face the public ire and take the heat.
According to Jane Mayer of The New Yorker , Lynch was opposed to Comey’s letter to Congress and opposed to not following DOJ practice of no comment or involvement regarding any political campaign as it could be interpreted as attempting to ‘influence’ a campaign – which has become a frequent refrain this season as the Clinton campaign continues to flail with a frantic desperation, a willingness to discredit anyone whose presence threatens their path to the White House – Russian President Vladimir Putin, Republican candidate Donald Trump, Wikileaks’ Julian Assange and now FBI Director James Comey.
Against that background, on Friday Comey was in the position of sitting on potentially explosive new information and taking the risk he would be publicly slammed for favoring Clinton and attempting to influence the election. According to Mayer’s sources, Comey felt ‘compelled’ to go forward with the letter and reopen the Clinton case against the DOJ recommendation.
The Democratic Coalition Against Trump (DCAT) has filed a formal Complaint with the Department of Justice, Office of Professional Responsibility against Comey for ‘interfering in the Presidential election” citing the Hatch Act which prohibits federal employees from participating in politically partisan acts.
In an imprudent display of anguish from the Clinton campaign, Scott Dworkin, senior advisor to the DCAT, said “it is absolutely absurd that FBI Director Comey would support Trump like this with only eleven days to go before the election.” And as if anticipating special entitlement for his candidate, Dworkin continued that “Comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting America, not investigating our soon to be President Elect Hillary Clinton.”
Immediately after the July announcement when Clinton drew the Home Free card, Comey was the object of much Democratic adulation and praise for his exemplary record and trustworthiness. However, over the weekend, the Clinton campaign launched a ferocious attack giving its media benefactors and Democratic bigwigs the green light to dump on Comey with an arsenal of steamrollers. In keeping with the Democratic strategy of irrational verbal assaults, Senator Harry Reid (D-Nv) wrote asserting Comey’s violation of the Hatch Act which “bars FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election” while former DNC Chair Howard Dean declared that “Comey put himself on the same side as Putin.”
While US law bans foreign government interference in our elections, where is the outrage for Israel’s heavy hand manipulation of American electoral and policy decisions over the last twenty years?
Inexplicably there has been no hint by Democrats that Anthony Weiner may be responsible for providing the FBI with the latest batch of emails, late breaking news is that Weiner, who is looking at a possible fifteen years in the slammer, is ‘cooperating’ with the FBI and might have traded his wife’s emails for a deal.

7818,"A Toilet, but No Proper Plumbing: A Reality in 500,000 U.S. Homes - The New York Times","TYLER, Ala.  —   The hard clay soil in this rural Southern county has twice cursed Dorothy Rudolph. It is good for growing cotton and cucumbers, the crops she worked as a child and hated. And it is bad for burying things  —   in particular, septic tanks. So Ms. Rudolph, 64, did what many people around here do. She ran a plastic pipe from her toilet under her yard and into the woods behind her house. Paying to put in a septic tank would cost around $6, 000  —   a little more than half of her family’s annual income. “It was a whole lot of money,” she said. “It still is. ” Here in Lowndes County, part of a strip of mostly poor,   counties that cuts through the rural center of Alabama, less than half of the population is on a municipal sewer line. While that is not a hardship for more affluent communities  —   about one in five American homes are not on city sewer lines  —   the legacy of rural poverty has left its imprint here: Many people have failing septic tanks and are too poor to fix them. Others, like Ms. Rudolph, have nothing at all. That is not so uncommon. Nearly half a million households in the United States lack the basic dignity of hot and cold running water, a bathtub or shower, or a working flush toilet, according to the Census Bureau. The absence has implications for public health in the very population that is the most vulnerable. Crumbling infrastructure has been a theme of this country’s reinvigorated public conversation about race  —   for instance, a botched fix for old pipes in Flint, Mich. that contaminated the city’s drinking water with lead. But in poor, rural places like Lowndes County, there has never been much infrastructure to begin with. “We didn’t have anything  —   no running water, no inside bathrooms,” said John Jackson, a former mayor of White Hall, a town of about 800 in Lowndes that is more than 90 percent black and did not have running water until the early 1980s. “Those were things we were struggling for. ” There is no formal count of residents without proper plumbing in Lowndes, but Kevin White, an environmental engineering professor at the University of South Alabama, said that a survey that he did in a neighboring county years ago found that about 35 percent of homes had septic systems that were failing, with raw sewage on the ground. Another 15 percent had nothing. “The bottom line is, I can’t afford a septic system,” said Cheryl Ball, a former cook who had a heart attack several years ago and receives disability payments. She lives in a grassy field on which only three of seven homes have septic tanks. Most banks now require proof that a home has proper sewage disposal before lending, but Ms. Ball paid cash for her mobile home  —   $4, 000. This area, known as the Black Belt (so called more for its soil, than its demographics) is haunted by its history of white violence toward   and a deep, biting poverty. Lowndes is one of the poorest counties in the country, and its rural population, whose trailers and small houses dot the lush green landscape, often cannot afford the thousands of dollars it costs to put in a tank. Municipalities, with low tax bases, cannot afford extensive sewer lines. Ms. Rudolph, a retired seamstress, and her husband, a carpenter, live in a tiny, white clapboard house that he built after he, his parents and his siblings fled their home on land owned by a white man who forbade the family to vote. She remembers, as a young girl in the 1950s, not having electricity. They obtained running water in the early 1990s, she said, and used an outhouse until the  . So their white toilet with a fuzzy green cover was a marker of progress. A plastic pipe carries its contents outside and empties into a wooded area not far from the house. There is no visible pooling of sewage, but there are other problems. “The smell gets so bad,” said Ms. Rudolph, sitting on her porch guarding her chicken coop against a marauding fox. When it rains, she wages war with her toilet. One recent downpour brought its contents gurgling up to the rim. “I was sitting there looking at it and got me a plunger,” she said. “It took me some plunging to get it clear. I was scared it was going to come back and go on the floor. Horrible. ” She added, “There’s nothing we can do. ” The problem is prickly for the state. Parrish Pugh, an official with the Alabama Department of Public Health, agrees that money plays a part. “That’s where the rubber hits the road,” he said. But Alabama law forbids the use of “insanitary sewage collection,” and the responsibility for that rests squarely with the homeowner,” Mr. Pugh said. Resisting is not only illegal, but could have health consequences: Raw sewage can taint drinking water and cause health problems. “‘My parents had a pipe that ran into the woods, and that’s good enough for me,’” Mr. Pugh said, explaining a common argument. “But we didn’t know as much about disease back then. People are more educated nowadays. They are more concerned. ” The state health department begs, cajoles, and eventually cites people who have problems and do not fix them. In the early 2000s, the authorities even tried arresting people. That prompted a public outcry and the practice soon stopped, but one person spent a weekend in jail and others were left with criminal records. The department cited about 700 people in the 12 months that ended in March, often because someone complained. The clay soil makes the problem worse. “Rural wastewater is usually managed with a septic tank and a drain field, which slowly infiltrates the wastewater into the ground,” Professor White said. “Well, it won’t go into the ground here. Period. ” He added: “There are some options that may be available, but it’s going to cost thousands of dollars, and most people here can’t afford it. The answer, quite frankly, is not out there yet. ” Experts and advocates have tried to find one. Grants from the state and federal governments to study the problem have come and gone, as have academics wielding surveys. There was even talk of   toilets. “It’s like we’re going in circles,” said Perman Hardy, a cook in Tyler who even did a urinalysis for a study of health effects. For years, her sewage backed up every time it rained. In December, she spent all the money she had saved for Christmas presents on a new septic tank. Some change is happening. The town of White Hall recently received funding to connect about 50 homes to sewer lines, the first in its history. Town officials are thrilled: City sewer lines are critical to attract businesses that would bring jobs. But the pace is glacial. Eli Seaborn, 73, a White Hall councilman, said progress would be slow, like the pace of civil rights gains, where legal discrimination is gone but lingers in other forms. Similar patience is required for sewage, he added. “Time is going to be the only thing that solves this problem,” he said. “It took more than 50 years for it to happen. But hopefully, it won’t take more than 50 years to fix it. ”",0
7819,Chicago Tribune Issues Correction After Smearing MILO as a ’White Nationalist’ - Breitbart,"The Chicago Tribune has issued a correction to an article by columnist Heidi Stevens in which she falsely described MILO as a “white nationalist” without providing any evidence to back up her smear. [Stevens, whose article lavished praise on feminist author Roxanne Gay, after Gay decided to pull her book deal from Simon  Schuster in protest at the publisher awarding MILO with a $250, 000 book deal for his upcoming book ‘Dangerous.  Having described Gay as “feminist champion” who deserves a “standing ovation,” Stevens went on to say that “Gay pulled her upcoming book from Simon  Schuster this week because the publisher signed a book deal with Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos, the white nationalist who was banned from Twitter for his targeted harassment of actress Leslie Jones. ” However, an editors note at the bottom of the article now states that the “article has been corrected to delete a reference to Yiannopoulos as a white nationalist. ” During his talk at the University of Colorado Springs, MILO outlined why any form of ‘white identity’ is not the answer to the problems of identity politics. “The reality is, if you force everyone to play identity politics, if you insist in pitting whites against blacks, women against men, straights against gays, the reality is you guys are gonna win and the left isn’t going to like it very much. But there’s a better way. Don’t fight identity politics with identity politics,” he said. “White pride, white nationalism, white supremacy isn’t the way to go. The way to go is reminding them and yourselves that you should be aspiring to values and to ideas,” he continued.  Other news organisations forced to issue corrections for falsely using the term ‘white nationalist’ include the LA Times, NBC News and USA Today.

Wikileaks is the gift that keeps on giving… 

While not quite on the Bombshell level, we thought this email from Clinton Campaign Manager John Podesta himself in March of last year deserved its very own thread… 

Text of the Podesta email: 
People tell me that Hillary is acting ‘like a retard’ since her head injury. Frankly, considering her normal behavior, I’m surprised anyone noticed! (this is a joke!) Have someone talk to her doctor and see if there’s anything he can give her. 
Also, I’ve noticed she’s had an ‘odor’ lately. It reminds me of a combination of boiled cabbage, urine and farts. I’m guessing it’s either connected to her fall or simply the fact that she rarely bathes. Outside of encouraging her to take a shower once in a while, I don’t know what to do about this. — any suggestions would be appreciated.

7822,Report: Trump Denounces Nuclear Arms Control Treaty to Putin - Breitbart,"President Donald Trump in his first phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin denounced a treaty that caps U. S. and Russian deployment of nuclear warheads, according to a report. [Trump told Putin that the treaty, known as New START, was one of several bad deals negotiated by the Obama administration, according to a report by Reuters.  Unnamed sources said that Trump did not know what the treaty was, and had paused to ask his aides in an aside what it was, according to the report. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters on Thursday that Trump understood the topic, but had wanted an opinion from an aide. “It wasn’t like he didn’t know what was being said. He wanted an opinion on something,” Spicer said. The treaty requires Russia and the United States to lower the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads to 1, 550 or less by 2018. It also limits deployed   and   missiles, and   bombers. In the phone call, Putin suggested extending New START, which is set to expire in 2021, the sources told Reuters. Trump had criticized the treaty during a 2016 presidential debate, saying Russia had “outsmarted” the U. S. with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Critics view the agreement as   requiring deep cuts in the U. S. nuclear arsenal and abandoning missile defense in Europe. Trump had also tweeted, as   “The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes. ” Supporters of the treaty argue that the end of the treaty could lead to a new arms race. “New START has unquestionably made our country safer, an opinion widely shared by national security experts on both sides of the aisle,” Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (NH) said in a statement. A mutual agreement can extend the treaty’s provisions for another five years. The original agreement, known as START, was renewed in 2010 by   Obama, and went into effect in 2011, according to CNN. It aims to cut the number of nuclear weapons that the U. S. and Russia could deploy by about  . It would limit a maximum of 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarines and bombers, and a total of 1, 500 warheads.",0

7824,"San Bernardino School Shooting Leaves 3 Dead, Including Student - The New York Times","SAN BERNARDINO, Calif.  —   Gunfire erupted inside an elementary school classroom in San Bernardino, Calif. on Monday, leaving two adults and one student dead in what the authorities said was an apparent  . The shooter, whom the police identified as Cedric Anderson, 53, walked into the classroom and without speaking opened fire on his wife, Karen Elaine Smith. Ms. Smith, 53, was the lead teacher in the class of 15 students with special needs, who ranged from first to fourth graders. Two students were standing behind Ms. Smith, though the police did not say whether they had been directly hit by gunfire or wounded with shrapnel. An    student, Jonathan Martinez, was airlifted by helicopter from the school, North Park Elementary, to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead shortly after he arrived. A    student was also wounded and was in stable condition Monday afternoon. The shooter entered the school through the front office and was checked for his identification, following routine procedures, the police said. There was no sign Mr. Anderson was carrying a weapon. Mr. Anderson and Ms. Smith had been married for several months and had been separated for the last month, the San Bernardino police chief, Jarron Burguan, said in an afternoon news conference. There was no indication of an earlier threat at the school, which does not have metal detectors. While the couple had been estranged, friends and family had not told the police about any previous violence between the couple, Chief Burguan said. Mr. Anderson did have a criminal record, including domestic violence, weapons possession and possibly drug possession, he said. At least six shots were fired from a . 357 caliber revolver, the chief said. “Tragedy again has befallen our city,” said Lt. Mike Madden, a spokesman for the Police Department who was one of the first officers to respond to the terrorist attack in San Bernardino in 2015. The school will be closed for at least two days, said Dale Marsden, the superintendent of the school district. Several counselors were sent to talk with students, he said, including those who were also questioned by investigators about the shooting. Counselors will continue to be available, Mr. Marsden said, urging parents to talk with their children and contact officials if they need help. “Be willing to listen to their story and be willing to listen to their story multiple times,” he said. “Reassure them that the danger that they faced has passed. ” Capt. Ron Maass said officers arrived at the school seven minutes after they received the first call about the shooting, just before 10:30 a. m. Other students at North Park were taken to California State University, San Bernardino for safety. All students had been released to their families by 4:30 p. m. Several parents who went to the high school complained about the confusion over where to reunite with their children and said they had only heard about the shooting from friends who live in the area. One man said he had received a call from his daughter, a sixth grader, before the school notified him. “She was just in a panic, but what kid wouldn’t be in a situation like that?” he said. Arnetta Carpenter, 70, the grandmother of two children at the school  —   ages 7 and 9  —   was in a meeting at the nearby New Hope Missionary Baptist Church, where she is the minister, when a staff member walked in to tell her about the shooting. She ran to the phone to call her son. “He said ‘Mama, I’m here,’” she recalled, relieved. “Children should never have to witness something like this,” she said. “It hasn’t been that long since the other shooting happened in San Bernardino. It really shows how we need to be close to the Lord. ” Lydia Beltran, 56, went to pick up her two grandchildren who attend North Park. Though they appeared to be unharmed, she was worried about the other effects of the shooting. “Mentally, we’ll have to wait and see,” she said. “Hopefully, it didn’t happen in their classroom. We don’t even know. What have we come to?” A Police Department spokeswoman posted a picture on Twitter from the inside of the gymnasium where the students were waiting, saying that they were being taken care of and entertained with glow sticks, checkers and a Disney movie while they waited for their parents. Mayor R. Carey Davis of San Bernardino said he had received a call from the White House and that President Trump offered to help “in any way possible. ” Betsy DeVos, the secretary of education who has supported Mr. Trump’s promise to ban   zones around schools, wrote on Twitter asking “everyone to join me in keeping the victims and all those impacted by today’s senseless violence in your prayers. ” North Park Elementary is about 10 miles from the site of the 2015 attack. The city, which is predominantly   has seen a significant increase in violent crime in the last year. There were 62 murders in the city in 2016, compared with 44 in 2015, including the 14 victims of the attack. Roughly 500 students, who are predominantly Latino, attend North Park Elementary.",0
7825,Will Barack Obama delay or suspend the election if Hillary is forced out by the new FBI email investigation?,"VIDEOS Will Barack Obama delay or suspend the election if Hillary is forced out by the new FBI email investigation? An A.I. system that correctly predicted the last three U.S. presidential elections puts Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of #Hillary By Michael Snyder - November 3, 2016 
Just when it looked like Hillary Clinton was poised to win the 2016 election , the FBI has thrown a gamechanger into the mix. On Friday, FBI Director James Comey announced that his agency has discovered new emails related to Hillary Clinton’s mishandling of classified information that they had not previously seen. According to the Associated Press , the newly discovered emails “did not come from her private server”, but instead were found when the FBI started going through electronic devices that belonged to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner. The FBI has been looking into messages of a sexual nature that Weiner had exchanged with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, and that is why they originally seized those electronic devices. According to the Washington Post , the “emails were found on a computer used jointly by both Weiner and his wife, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry”, and according to some reports there may be “potentially thousands” of emails on the computer that the FBI did not have access to previously. Even though there are less than two weeks to go until election day, this scandal has the potential to possibly force Clinton out of the race, and if that happens could Barack Obama delay or suspend the election until a replacement candidate can be found? 
Let’s take this one step at a time. On Friday, financial markets tanked when reports of these new Clinton emails hit the wires. The following comes from CNN … After recommending earlier this year that the Department of Justice not press charges against the former secretary of state, Comey said in a letter to eight congressional committee chairmen that investigators are examining newly discovered emails that “appear to be pertinent” to the email probe. “In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation,” Comey wrote the chairmen. “I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.” 
At this point, we do not know what is contained in these emails. But without a doubt Huma Abedin is Hillary Clinton’s closest confidant, and I have always felt that she was Clinton’s Achilles heel. Journalist Carl Bernstein (of Watergate fame) is fully convinced that the FBI would have never made this move unless something significant had already been discovered … We don’t know what this means yet except that it’s a real bombshell. And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation. So that’s where we are… Is it a certainty that we won’t learn before the election? I’m not sure it’s a certainty we won’t learn before the election. One thing is, it’s possible that Hillary Clinton might want to on her own initiative talk to the FBI and find out what she can, and if she chooses to let the American people know what she thinks or knows is going on. People need to hear from her… 
If the FBI has indeed found something explosive, would they actually charge her with a crime right before the election? 
It is possible, but we also have to remember that government agencies (including the FBI) tend to move very, very slowly. If there are thousands of emails, it is going to take quite a while to sift through them all. And of course Barack Obama has lots of ways that he could influence, delay or even shut down the investigation. 
So those that are counting on this to be the miracle that Donald Trump needs should not count their chickens before they hatch. 
But if Hillary Clinton were to be forced out of the race by this FBI investigation, the Democrats would have to decide on a new candidate, and that would take time. The following is from a U.S. News & World Report article that examined what would happen if one of the candidates was forced out of the race for some reason… If Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year’s primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. DNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members – a number that changes over time and is guided by the group’s bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. But the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. 
It would be extremely challenging to get a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee together on such short notice. If Clinton were to drop out next week, it would be almost impossible for this to happen before election day. 
In such a scenario, Barack Obama may attempt to invoke his emergency powers . Since the election would not be “fair” until the Democrats have a new candidate, he could try to delay or suspend the election. There would be a lot of controversy as to whether this is legal or not, but Barack Obama has not let the U.S. Constitution stop him in the past. 
Meanwhile, new poll numbers show that the Trump campaign was already gaining momentum even before this story about the new emails broke. According to a brand new ABC News/Washington Post survey, Donald Trump is now only trailing Hillary Clinton by 4 points after trailing her by as much as 12 points last weekend. 
And CNBC is reporting on a highly advanced artificial intelligence system that accurately predicted the outcomes of the presidential primaries and which is now indicating that Trump will be the winner in November… An artificial intelligence system that correctly predicted the last three U.S. presidential elections puts Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of Democrat rival Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House. MogIA was developed by Sanjiv Rai, founder of Indian start-up Genic.ai. It takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. and then analyzes the information to create predictions. The AI system was created in 2004, so it has been getting smarter all the time. It had already correctly predicted the results of the Democratic and Republican Primaries. 
Without Hillary at the top of the ticket, the odds of a Trump victory would go way, way up. 
So if Hillary is forced out of the race by this investigation, Barack Obama and the Democrats will want to delay or suspend the election for as long as possible if they can. 
At this point there is probably not a high probability that such a scenario will play out, but in this crazy election year we have already seen that just about anything can happen.",0
7826,Iran’s President Says Donald Trump Can’t Tear Up Nuclear Pact - The New York Times,"TEHRAN  —   Iran’s president said on Tuesday that he simply would not allow   Donald J. Trump to tear up last year’s nuclear agreement and warned of unspecified consequences if he did. “He wants to do many things,” Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, said of Mr. Trump in a speech. During the campaign, Mr. Trump called the nuclear agreement “a bad deal” that he promised to “tear up. ” “He wants to undermine the J. C. P. O. A. ,” Mr. Rouhani said, referring to the agreement, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. “He wants to tear up the J. C. P. O. A. Will we or our nation allow this?” As Mr. Rouhani posed the question, the audience began chanting, “Death to America. ” In the speech, which was delivered at Tehran University and televised nationally, Mr. Rouhani maintained that “America cannot influence our determination, this nation’s resistance and its struggle. ” He continued: “America is our enemy we have no doubt about this. The Americans want to put as much pressure on us as they can. ” The change in tone by the Iranian president comes as he faces increasing pressure from   who argue that the United States is not to be trusted to keep its end of the deal. They say that a recent congressional vote to extend unilateral American sanctions against Iran confirmed their warnings and that the nuclear deal is a failure. For Mr. Rouhani, who until recently seemed set to be elected for a second term in May, the change in fortune is a threat to his political career, analysts say. “Trump is far worse than his predecessor,” said Hamidreza Taraghi, a   political analyst. “Rouhani has proven that trusting America is useless and a waste of time, energy and money. He should not be  . ” Mr. Rouhani had promised an economic renaissance after the 2015 deal, which led to the lifting of most of the sanctions that had been crippling the Iranian economy in exchange for the mothballing of Iran’s nuclear program. But that has not materialized, thanks to remaining sanctions over Iran’s ballistic missile program and terrorism, as well as lingering fears among Western companies about incurring American penalties for doing business with Iran. During his speech on Tuesday, Mr. Rouhani, apparently trying to fend off the attacks, emphasized that ultimately it was the nation’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who had led the negotiations and signed off on the deal. “We took no step in the issue of the nuclear agreement without consulting the supreme leader,” he said. Ayatollah Khamenei has often criticized the deal publicly, but analysts agree that without his specific consent, a compromise with the United States and other global powers would never have been reached. Mr. Trump’s ascent to power has been met by Mr. Rouhani and other Iranian leaders with familiar slogans like “America can’t do a damn thing. ” But the vote last week in Washington to extend sanctions for another decade, which they say violated the nuclear agreement, seemed to strike a nerve. “If the Iran Sanctions Act is carried out, it will be a clear and obvious violation of the agreement and will be met with a very harsh response from us,” Mr. Rouhani said, joining dozens of other clerics, politicians and generals who have made similar threats. He told Iranians not to be “concerned,” saying that a government committee would meet on Wednesday to determine Iran’s reaction to the extension of sanctions, which the Obama administration said did not violate the nuclear agreement. Iranian lawmakers have proposed a boycott of American products, but very few are being sold in the country. Some have even suggested restarting nuclear activities and the enrichment of uranium, though they have little or no say over such matters. Pulling out of the deal is not an option for Iran, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Monday. “Iran will not be the first to break the agreement,” Bahram Ghasemi, the spokesman, said. “We will never, and in no way will be the first to make the first step forward. ”",0
7827,Trump teaches his supporters how to vote correctly,"Trump teaches his supporters how to vote correctly 01.11.2016 The US presidential nominee from the Republican Party Donald Trump called on his supporters to combat possible frauds the day elections take place the following way - to vote twice in case there are doubts that your ballot has been counted. 'You can go to University Center and they'll give you a ballot, a new ballot. They'll void your old ballot and give you a new ballot.

They also have right to demand a new one or vote in person at a polling station in case their previous ballot was not counted.

The Common Sense Show issued an alert yesterday with regard to the likelihood of widespread violence, regardless of who wins the election. The violence may not be dramatic on November, but I believe that a crescendo will be reached by the holidays. There are literally dozens of troop movements and a number of martial law events taking place as I write these words. The bottom line is, half of the country hates the other half of the country and pressure valve is ready to blow. And if Trump wins, the violence factor will escalate exponentially as evidenced by the firebombed GOP building in North Carolina.
When these events come to fruition, it could potentially paralyze this nation and bring the economy to a standstill. Subsequently, the grocery store shelves could be empty within two days and food riots would likely commence by sundown of the second day. All Americans would instantly be in danger. Local law enforcement would be overwhelmed. What would be your chances of survival? Yesterday, I wrote about the fact that FEMA has conducted research studies on America’s level of preparedness and the news is not good. FEMA concluded that 72% of all Americans are not prepared to survive what is coming In other words, when society begins to fragment, you and your fellow preppers are outnumbered by a 3 to 1 margin.
Are you prepared for 3 out of 4 of your neighbors climbing through your windows in search of life-saving supplies?
The FEMA Preparedness Reports In response to concerns about strengthening the nation’s ability to protect its population and way of life (i.e., security) and ability to adapt and recover from emergencies (i.e., resilience), the President of the United States issued Presidential Policy Directive 8: National Preparedness (PPD-8).
PPD-8 is a directive for the Department of Homeland Security to coordinate a comprehensive campaign to encourage Americans to practice national preparedness. Despite efforts by FEMA and other organizations to educate American citizens on becoming prepared, growth in specific preparedness behaviors has been limited. Government programs to this end are nearly nonexistent.
I have spent the past week illustrating how a coming economic collapse is unavoidable and how the elite have conspired to steal as many of your assets as possible prior to the collapse. This article presents some common sense things one can do which could increase the chances of surviving a major societal meltdown resulting from an economic collapse. If you have any doubts as to what is coming, I strongly encourage you to read what I have written about on this topic over the past several months. Even Ray Charles could see that our economy will not be around much longer in its present form.
It is always best to prepare for the worst and hope for the best. For the purposes of this article, it is possible that society will not totally collapse even if the dollar does. However, large segments of societies always collapse when an economic collapse happens. Surviving the worst case scenario is the purpose behind what will be covered here.
We have about 14 days to do the following 14 things: 1. The Creation of a Pseudo-Identity It may be necessary to become invisible in the event you think you believe that your name could be on a (Red) list because roundups will usually occur in dire situations. Therefore, the creation of a pseudo-identity could become very important.
2. It Takes Money to Prepare If you have read the articles at the above links, you should have concluded that it is the height of stupidity to leave your life savings in an institution that is planning to steal from you. You need to divert your cash, other than the ability to pay basic bills, in preparation for what is coming.
Getting your money out of the bank has become an art form and you need to be careful. There is a barrier to your ability to procure some of these life-saving and life-extending supplies. Right now, you do not have full access to your money.
As you move to withdraw the bulk of your money, there are three federal banking laws that you should be cognizant of, namely, Cash Transaction Report (CTR), a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) and structuring.
Cash Transaction Reports Federal law requires that the bank file a report based upon any withdrawal or deposit of $10,000 or more on any single given day.The law was designed to put a damper on money laundering, sophisticated counterfeiting and other federal crimes.
To remain in compliance with the law, financial institutions must obtain personal identification, information about the transaction and the social security number of the person conducting the transaction.
Before proceeding with the planned withdrawal of your money, I would strongly suggest that you read the following federal guidelines as it relates to CTR’s as produced by the The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). All the federal regulations contained in this article are elucidated in this series of federal reports.
Structuring and SAR There will undoubtedly be some geniuses whose math ability will tell them that all they have to do is to withdraw $9,999.99 and the bank and its protector, the federal government will be none the wiser. It is not quite that simple. The bank is required to file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) which serves to notify the federal government of an individual’s attempt to structure deposits or withdrawals by circumventing the $10,000 reporting requirement.
Structuring transactions to prevent a CTR from being reported can result in imprisonment for not more than five years and/or a fine of up to $250,000. If structuring involves more than $100,000 in a twelve month period or is performed while violating another law of the federal government, the penalty is doubled. 
Enforcement Much like the enforcement of our tax laws, the federal government’s enforcement of its banking laws as it relates to CTR’s, SAR’s and subsequent structuring is quite draconian. Civilian asset forfeiture laws come into play. The government can seize your bank accounts while it determines if a crime has been committed. The government can literally seize your assets in perpetuity without an order of the court. Of course, you could try and sue but you will be up against the deep pockets of the federal government and the case could take years. By the time your case is decided, the financial banking crisis that you are so desperately trying to avoid by withdrawing your money, could be over. So, proceed with caution.
Withdrawing Your Money From the Bank The best way to avoid getting your money caught in the bank in the midst of a bank run would be to not let the lion’s share of your money ever cross the bank. The simplest way to accomplish this is to prevent any form of deposit from going automatically into your account, as much as it is possible.
Secondly, you need to begin to pay cash for everything. Let’s say that every 30 days, Bob cashes his check at the bank from his work worth $5,000 net pay. Bob leaves just enough in the bank to be able to conduct normal banking business. Bob walks out of the bank every month with the majority of the cash from his check. Bob should begin to pay cash for as much as he can, such as eating out, paying the electric bill (pay the bill in person), buying groceries, etc. When it becomes necessary to make a “big ticket” purchase, Bob could temporarily leave more in the bank to cover the writing of a check.
You would also be wise to open multiple banking accounts ranging from the big five megabanks to your local credit unions. You could withdraw much smaller amounts until the sum total of your accounts is greatly diminished and is in your possession. To open the accounts, simply write a personal check from your home bank. Of course, in these cases, the bank could hold the check for 15-30 days.
I cannot promise you that if you become the target of federal investigators, that you will not have your every financial move scrutinized and the feds will eventually discover the aggregate patterns of withdrawal. People who I interviewed told me that they believe that the federal government is in the process of getting the banking computers to “talk” to each other in a way that would reveal structuring, but that technology is not yet online.
If you ever become the target of a federal investigation, do not, under any circumstances, allow yourself to be interviewed by federal officials without an attorney present. In many cases, people go to jail and pay huge fines, not because they have committed a federal crime, but because federal officials state that they have lied or misled them. And if you do not have an attorney present, it is your word versus the federal government. There are other sources besides banks that you can tap into for money which can be used to prepare for what is coming.
4o1K’s, IRA, et al If you were 100% convinced of an imminent crash, you would be foolish not to take your money out. However, the prepayment penalty of 50% is steep if you withdraw your funds before you are 59.5 years old.
If you are retiring soon, take the lump sum option and convert all of these retirement monies to survival supplies and gold which you will need as the world emerges from the crash.
The moral of the story is to become as liquid as possible, from a cash perspective. Getting access to your money is only the first part of being prepared to survive an economic crash.
3. Make a List Buy a good prepper book. Holly Deyo is an excellent source for this information (www.standdeyo.com). In the interim, procure your food, water, guns, ammo and home security adjustments. If you do not have a big dog, consider obtaining a pair. These animals will be your companion, home security system and ally if someone attempts to breach your home with bad intent. Of course, you will have to store dog food as well.
Sit down and construct a list of what you will need after reading a good prepper book.
Make all of you purchases in cash! You do not want to let the wrong people know what you are up to.
 
4. Rural Vs. Urban We have to live our lives for today and it may not be possible to move to a rural area because of your job. However, one survivalist that I was speaking with estimates that the rate of survival for a country in economic chaos would be 10 times higher for rural residents as opposed to urban residents. Consider buying a place in an isolated area and commuting to work in the interim.
5. Pay Off Your Mortgage and Car Loans If you have a CD, a 401k or any other long-term investment, you might want to consider taking the penalty and executing a withdrawal and apply what’s left of the principal, usually about 50% of the original value, and paying down your major debts.
After an economic collapse, you most likely will not have a job and your retirement and savings will likely be wiped out and confiscated. That is why it would be wise to pay down your debt while you can afford to do so because after the collapse, there will still be foreclosures and repossessions and if you and your family survive, you could be on the street if you cannot pay your bills.
 
6. Buy Gold and Silver While You Can Afford It Goldman Sachs has been shorting gold. The elite have been hording gold as have the BRICS. These entities are telling you, by action, what medium of exchange is going to be of value following the collapse that is coming.
Storing gold and silver is an economic survival strategy which will pay dividends after the smoke begins to clear in the post-collapse era.

 
7. Practice Austerity Before Austerity Is Imposed On You It is critical to immediately eliminate all unnecessary expenses. Give yourself some operating capital. You may be able to purchase a bug-out residence in a rural area. You will certainly be able to afford more survival gear.
In order to increase your immediate cash flow, start an at-home business. Start a business which has virtually no upfront and startup costs. Even if you are not able to generate much income, you will create a legal tax evasion strategy in which you can legally deduct many of your present activities and expenses (e.g. mileage, the purchase of any office supply, etc.) including survival gear.
 
8. Create and Store Your Own Food With regard to storing food, you need to do so immediately. I recommend storing two years worth of food. However, you need to master the art of growing food inside your home. There are plenty of resources which can teach you how to do that. However, you would be wise if you would create a hiding place in which you can store food and water safely in a hidden location . If you are ever robbed, you will not have exhausted your food supplies. You are most likely to be robbed by FEMA or one of their mercenary groups (e.g. Academia) during the beginning of the crisis because food and water will be used as weapons to control you. I am personally aware of FEMA going to selected homeowners to catalogue their reserve food and water supplies. Remember, water is sunlight and temperature sensitive. There are plenty of prepper manuals that you can consult for instructions on how to meet these needs. The time to do these things is yesterday.
The biggest threat to survival is death due to dehydration and starving to death. Contaminated water will also pose a threat. There are plenty of places to purchase large drums and obtain water tablets for water purification purposes. Obtain a pair of water filters in case you have to go mobile to survive.
Finally, learn to grow your own food within your residence. Your garden will likely be raided by humans and hungry animals alike. There are plenty of prepper manuals which can teach you how to accomplish this task.
9. Personal Supplies Of course you will need toothpaste, toiletries, eating utensils, feminine hygiene supplies, etc. For a complete list of personal items see Steve Quayles list on his website .
 
10. Horde Medicines and Medical Supplies If you or your family has a chronic health condition, it is critical that you have 6 months to a year in medicine. Also, you should research natural alternatives to treatment for health conditions in case you are not able to meet this goal due to the inability to obtain prescriptions. Don’t forget to obtain some pain medication and antibiotics in case of unforeseen emergencies. Make a trip to Mexico and sneak across medication in old pill bottles in order to escape detection by the Border Patrol who will ask you if you obtained medication in Mexico when you come back across the border.
If you can safely ration your existing medication doses, do so and store the excesses. Make sure you also have a first aid kit. Take a First Aid class including CPR at your local fire station.
Some are thinking that this is a lot of work. My response would be, how bad do you want you and your family to survive?
11. Guns and Ammunition Regardless of your moral convictions, ask yourself if you want your family to survive.
Buy your guns off the books from private parties and at gun shows. “Keep guns for show and guns for go”. In other words, have a safe location that you can bury guns so that when gun confiscation begins, you will not be left totally defenseless.
America needs to not only create safe and secure homes, but to create as many Warsaw ghettos as possible (look it up). We need to make ourselves a hard country to conquer and occupy. We cannot stop a treasonous leader from handing off the country to some foreign entity (e.g. the UN). However, occupation of America should be problematic for the blue-helmet wearing Russians, Chinese and other proxy forces training on our soil to occupy us.
It is recommended that you have 3 types of weapons: (1) pistols for close in fighting; (2) shotguns for defense of the entrance to your home; and, (3) a rifle with a scope in order to fight back against long-range snipers that do not want to storm your home because you appear to be prepared. Immediately, obtain weapons instruction for you and your family, firearms training and then practice! Conduct mock raids on your residence so that you can see your vulnerabilities. An armed populace makes a people more feared by an abusive government.
Do not forget about gas masks for each member of your family and make sure to store extras. If you have the means to obtain body armor, do so now, because Congress is preparing to outlaw the private use of body armor.
 
12. Prepare to Survive in the Raw Elements and Build a Way of Life 
It is possible that you can learn to survive in the raw elements without heating and central air conditioning. You may not have lights. Obtain flashlights, many batteries and a hand crank radio.
Make sure you have clothes befitting all weather that you may encounter because a crisis that begins in January, may not be over by August.
Take a weekend and pretend the grid is down. This will allow you to see firsthand what supplies you will need. When should you perform this drill? There is no time like the present.
To people with generators, congratulations on your foresight. However, if you are the only house on the block with lights, how long do you think it will be until you have unwanted visitors with bad intent?
Get in shape, begin to walk, jog or run. The better shape you are in, the better.
Don’t forget about procuring non-electronic forms of entertainment. This should include board games and educational materials for your children. You will want to establish some normalcy for the sake of your children. You are preparing to adopt a new way of life. Make the new life worth living.
I would also recommend that every personal library contain The Constitution of the United States. After the chaos subsides, we will need to rebuild. You will not want to live in a “might makes right” society.
13. For Goodness Sake, Do Not Tell Anyone If your four adjacent neighbors broach the topic of preparedness, gauge the situation and then make an informed decision. If your neighbors are on board with preparing, that will help you form a defensive perimeter and a mutual alliance pact. Otherwise, tell nobody of your preparation plans. Do not tell your friends, family members, and co-workers. Make your preparations in cash or cashier’s checks as much as possible. Limit the paper trail to you. You do not want the government to know that you are prepared because you could be the first one on your block that is visited at 3AM. You and your mate should prepare in stealth. Kids talk and so do their friends.
14. PRAY! Survival is never guaranteed, salvation is! And do not forget one of your most important resources, your Bible. In a post-collapse America, it is likely that a religion will be forced upon the survivors and that religion will not be Christianity.
Conclusion In an upside-down world in which the banks legally own your money, getting your money away from these criminal banks has become an art form. I cannot promise you that you will be able to retrieve all of your assets. However, I can promise you that if you do not act, you will lose everything and you will lack needed supplies to weather what is coming.
I would strongly suggest that you keep your gas tank filled and you have plenty of cash, food and ammunition on hand. It is better to be safe than sorry.
 
Breaking News: FBI Investigation Reopens The elite may be pulling their support for Hillary. She is, again, under investigation by the FBI. IF her plug is pulled, the violence may come sooner than we anticipated- Get to work America, we do not have long.
DONATE TO THE COMMON SENSE SHOW Don’t wait for the collapse of the dollar because it will be too late.

Two time Academy Award winning actor Denzel Washington has been at the top of Hollywood’s A list since his breakthrough role in the stirring Civil War film Glory . 
He’s the type of actor who you can imagine as being down to earth off screen, as he abides by his deep Christian faith and is never caught doing trashy behavior like so many others in liberal Hollywood. 
It shouldn’t be a huge surprise to us, then, that Denzel would turn against braindead liberals in Hollywood and support our President-Elect Donald Trump . 
Washington praised Trump at the expense of job-destroyer Barack Obama recently, saying, “We need more and more jobs. He’s hired more employees, more people, than anyone I know in the world.” 
Washington has stated that he feels a “personal face along with God,” and he is thrilled that the Republican party with its strong Christian values has returned to power in our country. Do you agree with Denzel Washington? ",0
7830,Why So-Called Intellectuals Do More Harm Than Good To Society,"  Why So-Called Intellectuals Do More Harm Than Good To Society Why So-Called Intellectuals Do More Harm Than Good To Society 
André is a young European who left his decaying country in 2012 for greener pastures. He enjoys exploring subterranean places, reading about a host of interconnected topics, and yearns for Tradition. November 11, 2016 Culture 
The existence of intellectuals is more ubiquitous today than ever. Many are those who contend for public attention, credibility, and money as a reward for their wits, not to mention the very status of intellectual. Yet the existence of such people is far from self-evident. For centuries, traditional societies barely had anything or anybody that looked like modern intellectuals, and this did not prevent them from lasting hundreds or even thousands of years. 
So, as we elaborate projects and ideas for reforming the depraved societies of the Empire of Nothing—a necessary step if we want a lasting victory—an important question must be confronted: do we need at all what has been called “intellectuals” during last centuries? And if we do not, what should we have instead? The origin of modern intellectuals 
At the heart of modernity lies a deep crisis. Before it, Western Europe was united by the same Christian faith and a basic agreement on the place of economy—subordinated to guilds and the rights of the average producer. 
When modernity reared its philosophical head through René Descartes, a prominent thinker of the seventeenth century, the Old Continent was in a much more problematic state: Christianity had splintered into various opposing faiths whose intellectual opposition was shaking everything to the core. We have been told that the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were a glorious new flourishing of intelligence. But, in fact, thinkers who actually lived at this time had quite a different impression. 
The Irish bishop George Berkeley (1685-1753) criticized how the practice of philosophy had become, on his age, synonymous with getting embroiled into “thousand scruples… prejudices and errors of sense,” a situation he attributed to “the wrong use we make of our faculties.” Likewise, the Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711-1776) scolded his contemporaries for being too eager to criticize the “systems” of others for the sake of pushing their own on the scene, that is, a mutual hypercriticism that led to a general lack of certitude about everything: 
There is nothing which is not the subject of debate, and in which men of learning are not of contrary opinions. The most trivial question escapes not our controversy, and in the most momentous we are not able to give any certain decision. Disputes are multiplied, as if everything was uncertain; and these disputes are managed with the greatest warmth, as if everything was certain. Amidst all this bustle it is not reason, which carries the prize, but eloquence… From hence in my opinion arises that common prejudice against metaphysical reasonings of all kinds. 
The first precursors were honest in their endeavour to solve the crisis. Descartes, Berkeley, Hume and many others genuinely sought a grand encompassing theory that could resume with all controversies. But soon the very controversy became an institution. A whole market of ideas was growing, in which more and more lettrés started to see an opportunity to make a name, thus earning fame, social standing and sometimes money. Hume could not help himself: soon after criticizing those who fed the crisis by attacking the others’ “systems” while promoting their own, he was doing the same. 
Such was the so-called Enlightenment: the further undermining of any spiritual, philosophical or cultural unity by ambitious individuals ready to hustle for notoriety. They would be experts at flattering the powerful, mocking the Catholic church, fiddle fashionable themes and “witty” prose, and more than everything else rationalizing their activity as a “progress.” The very expression “Enlightenment” stems from their willingness to market themselves to the posterity. The intellectuals’ bread and butter 
It can be noted that, from the amateur gentlemen of the eighteenth century, generations of scientists have sprang up. Some of these characters were mathematicians, engineers, doctors, or dedicated observers of nature, and they all contributed to improving general human power over matter . But make no mistake: even science needs problems and unknown stuff to justify careers and research, thus following a headlong rush dynamic. At its side, the literary intellectuals need more problems so they can have the opportunity to sell themselves through claiming they want to solve them. 
The momentous crisis turned into a crisis structure and the structure turned into a mark of the modern West. Where God ceased to speak, the modern talking head took more and more territory and wrote dozens of books trying to prove he was the embodiment of progress. It doesn’t matter if problems are genuine or artificial. Intellectuals need them like a blacksmith needs iron. 
Two typical intellectual characters are Voltaire and Émile Zola. Both were gifted writers, both were charming and witty, both managed to write about matters that were actually relevant to their times, and both have used a trial with political overtones to make a show of themselves. (Not so incidentally, both were French and participated to the furthering of a twisted literary chauvinism.) 
Voltaire took advantage of various trials to claim that the defendants were accused because they were Protestants inside a Catholic country. The infamous affaire Calas , from the name of a father who was accused of having murdered his own son, was used by the shrewd philosophe to sending pathetic letters to the upper crust of the society, stirring the public opinion, pressuring magistrates, until the father—who had been convicted and executed after a thorough investigation—was rehabilitated. Two centuries and a half later, young Frenchmen are still taught Voltaire was a champion of truth, justice, and reason, whereas he was more like a playwright who peddled influence. 
Zola, more than a century later, did the same. A Jewish-French captain, Alfred Dreyfus , was convicted for high treason after he allegedly communicated secret documents to Prussia. Years later, some new evidence seemed to indicate that Dreyfus was innocent and that another officer had leaked the documents: at this very moment, Zola published an incendiary article, J’accuse , where he spat on the judges and cried about the injustice of the affaire . Eventually, Dreyfus was rehabilitated—and the army, the patriots and the Catholics were shamed through a never-ending media discourse that casted them as villains of the whole story. 
Voltaire and Zola played the same role in a narrative of the exact same kind. We are taught about a situation of injustice, where the majority of the population is oppressing an innocent group through an innocent individual and crooked institutions. Fortunately, a heroic talking head rises, miraculously converts the opinion to recognize the poor innocent victim as such, the talking head is crowned as an awesome thinker beyond boundaries whereas some are fairly vilified as “oppressors,” and the poor victim’s rehabilitation is also the victory of reason, justice, and progress. 
Thus, the intellectuel in the most typical sense is a highly paradoxical creature who becomes taught in classes after having seemingly rebelled against dominant institutions. Teenagers are led to think that heroic and highly intelligent individuals can turn the tide of unfavourable opinion… provided they follow a mysterious sense of history. There have been a lot more intellectuals than the mere classics, and often those rejected by the official narrative are more interesting than those inside. Who’s gonna pay? 
Even if you are gifted with words and language, being a talking head does not pay much. Would anyone be ready to pay you for giving an opinion, no matter how elaborate, on anything? The problem of money is a good starting point to connect the dots: Voltaire was close from wealthy Protestants bankers, one of whom even helped him to obtain a house in Geneva, and Zola was a Rotschild protégé . Both of them contributed to tarnish Catholicism and most of their own people. In other words, they served interests that could pay them—they were sellouts. 
Today, some bloggers happen to earn money as independents, especially when they found themselves a niche. Yet independence is scarce. Way too many people would like to live from their wits, and, even more, obtain recognition as intellectuals. More than often, intellectual types turn into teachers, journalists, or even marketers—thus depending upon an institution that pays them. 
In North America, the war against whites and masculinity is massively subsidized , whether in the academic or in the media. You won’t easily find a job there if you take a critical stance on cultural Marxism. And in case you wouldn’t be self-hating enough, they are already replacing you with “minority” individuals who are rewarded for spewing wordy venom daily. 
Old Marxism was well-aligned with the interests of intellectuals as a class, not as individuals. It handed them an official status and flattered their ego by casting them as the vanguard of “progress.” Keynesianism triumphed for the exact same reason as it justified the creation of a bloated State where model-obsessed nerds enjoy a tremendous power over those who produce actual wealth. Intellectual types historically joined the left because it gave them a status, money, and moral recognition. 
But the whole Marxist vocabulary of “progress” and “emancipation” dissimulated what seems glaring today. Namely, that intellectuals were recognized and paid, not because they were enlightened or bright, but because they were an efficient tool of destruction. 
The conservative right has often lacked a milieu for intellectual types. The average conservative was reluctant to pay someone he saw as a parasite. Such a lack pushed a number of high IQs to the arms of the left, who made an establishment out of them and paid them to enforce globalism, anti-whiteness, anti-masculinity, pathological altruism, transgender madness, “politically correct” repression and so on. Intellectuals were never paid to say the truth: they were paid as tools who performed a primarily destructive social function. 
If we happen to beat cultural Marxism, what shall we do with intellectual types? If we are to dismantle globalism and build healthier societies, we have to think about what we will replace the bobo -leftist establishment. The intellectual mediocrity and spinelessness of the average conservative is no solution. A truly traditional society would likely have initiates, something akin to high priests and knights, in lieu of vacuous and coward talkers. How exactly we go there or how exactly this could look today is another question. Conclusion 
The French essayist Alain Soral once famously said, “a journalist is either a whore or without a job.” This is even truer for most intellectuals, sold as they are to a destructive left or (more seldomly) to the inefficient right. 
Culture is overrated. What the mainstream refers to under that name is a giant matrix, full of lies, taboos, and the snobbery of talking heads who end up lying to everyone or believing into their own bullshit. No wonder why the shrewd Robert Greene advised to be an “intense realist”: one must cultivate inner intuition and situational awareness not to fall prey to some of the claptrap that constitutes at least eighty per cent of current mainstream “culture.” 
The previous generations could join the cultural Marxist establishment and pretend their destructive, ego-laden works were progress. To our generation, this is impossible. Either we stand up for our very existence, even if we must go against more than two centuries of manipulations and lies, or we resign ourselves to an ignominious death. Before we take the power back, a shared awareness must be stimulated, and this is where we enter in direct conflict with the well-funded anti-white, anti-masculine establishment types, whom we must beat on their own field once and for all. Bonus: 6 quotes about the intellectuels 
Some of the problems that modern philosophical thinking puts forward appear void of any importance and meaning. [Modern philosophy] features a range of issues that merely stem from an equivocal stance and the confusion of different viewpoints. These issues only exist because they are poorly framed. They have no fundamental reason to exist. In many cases, defining their statements more precisely may be enough to make them disappear, plain and simple, if [modern] philosophy did not strive to maintain them, because it makes a living out of ambiguity. — René Guénon, Introduction to the study of the Hindu doctrines , chap.8. René Guénon (young) 
Philosophers care much more about putting forth problems, no matter how artificial and illusory, than about solving them… They also strive to link their name to a ‘system,’ that is, to a strictly bounded set of theories they would own and consider as their nothing more than their own work. Hence the desire to be original at any price, even if the truth must be sacrificed on the altar of said originality. A philosopher who cares about his repute does better by making up a new mistake than by repeating some truth that has already been expressed by others. —René Guénon, The Crisis of the Modern World , chap.5. René Guénon (older) 
The most evident feature of [modern] critique is the lack of principles and of authenticity. Its greater preoccupation consists in being brilliant, in appearing original… From the point of view of those who embody this ‘intellectuality,’ the catchy line, the dialectical or polemical posturing well noticed by others, have a much greater value than truth. Ideas, when they use them, are nothing but a pretext. What matters is to look intelligent—just as, to the mainstream politician, the ideology of a party is essentially a means for career. The ‘vanity fair,’ the most deleterious subjectivism, often verging on pure and unmitigated narcissism, are essential components of this phenomenon… The ‘critique’ is a scourge of modern culture, an epidemic that was born out of bourgeois society concomitantly with the commodification of culture… In normal, traditional civilizations, one could find creators, artists, and those who would judge the works without intermediaries: the sovereigns, the patrons, and the people. Our times have witnessed the appearance, between the public and the creators, that cultural pimp, that cheeky and presumptuous parasite we call a ‘critique.’ — Julius Evola, The Bow and the Club Baron Giulio Cesare Evola 
Show me more venal, more insensitive, more corrupt minds than those of the literate caste! How many of them do you know whose virtue would still be uncorrupted? Who, but them, for over thirty years, kept flooding us with a loosened morale, a disdain for work, a disgust of duty, a disrespect for family, who but the literary? Who dipped into secret funds more shamelessly than they did? Who seduced women, softened the young, excited the nation to more debauchery than they did? Who did abandon cowardly the princes after begging for their favours…? So-called men of letters, always! They run like harlots between the legitimate government and usurpers, between monarchy and republic, between politics and socialism, between atheism and religion. Everything is good to them as long as they can make a profit and be fashionable out of it. — Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (quoted by the following one) Pierre-Joseph Proudon 
Compare, for example, seventeenth century writers with those of the eighteenth. What a difference in tone and gait! The former, under a veneer of servility, have the most noble and proud stance… They do not pretend to reign. They merely stand at their place, recognize the place of a superior power beyond, give themselves completely to their writing task, dismiss the temptation of advertising and demonstrate their professional dedication. On the other hand, look at the Voltaire, Diderot and the like: they open well the era of intellectuals, writing stooges as they are, courtiers of princes they flatter and despise at the same time—something they are forced to do as they want to usurp their power… Their courtier nature reveals in everything they do… The whole eighteenth century, both spiritual and plain on a scoundrel background, is libertine, and already pornographic: such is the start of literary mercantilism; people of letters make money out of their writings, pretend to financial independence, and they write garbage to flatter the opinion of their public. — Édouard Berth, Les méfaits des intellectuels (“the misdeeds of the intellectuals”), Introduction Édouard Berth (disciple of Proudhon) 
I have had the same experience with journalists citing each other about my books without the smallest effort to go to my writings—my experience is that most journalists, professional academics, and other in similar phony professions don’t read original sources, but each other, largely because they need to figure out the consensus before making a pronouncement. — Nassim Taleb, Antifragile , chap.23.",0
7832,141 Arrested At Protest Of The Dakota Access Pipeline,"141 Arrested At Protest Of The Dakota Access Pipeline 2 shares by Ike Mclean / October 28, 2016 / SOCIETY / 
By late Thursday and early Friday morning police dressed in riot gear with armored vehicles were forced to intervene with activists protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline pipeline would run within a half-mile of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. 
By midnight authorities arrested 141 protesters during a standoff that lasted more than six-hours on property that sits in the pipeline’s path. 
Protesters blockaded roads and bridges by setting fire to bales of hay and construction equipment. Police also said some protesters threw rocks and fire bombs, and one women even fired three shots from at police, but nobody was hit. 
More than 200 police officers were called in to stop the protests and were forced to use pepper spray and bean bag guns. Humvees, two helicopters and an airplane were also called in to assist law enforcement. 
Authorities said the protesters left the officers with no choice but to intervene. 
“We’re trying to avoid confrontation. But they drew the line in the sand today,” Cass County Sheriff Paul D. Laney told reporters Thursday. 
The protesters were a group of Native Americans and environmental activists who have camped on the property since Sunday oppose the $3.8 billion pipeline because they say it could adversely impact drinking water and would disturb sacred burial sites. 
Pictures from the protest can be seen below:

7833,UK Conservatives Hire Senior Obama Aide to Help Election Campaign,"Britain’s governing Conservative Party has hired Barack Obama’s former Deputy Chief of Staff to help run its election campaign. [Bloomberg reports that Jim Messina arrived in London on Monday to join the campaign to return Prime Minister Theresa May to power and secure the Conservatives a bigger majority.  Mr. Messina was campaign manager for President Obama in 2012, and then served as   of Hillary Clinton’s presidential   Priorities USA Action. He famously told Democrats in 2009 to “punch back twice as hard” at town hall meetings on Obamacare, and in 2015 was revealed to be earning “tens of millions” as “Silicon Valley’s   government fixer” in Washington, D. C. Over in Britain, he also served as an ad hoc advisor for the   Britain Stronger In Europe group during last year’s referendum campaign, and before then was a major player on David Cameron’s 2015 General Election team. During the 2015 battle, he was credited with helping the Conservatives target voters who could be persuaded to switch from the   Liberal Democrats. In the event, the Liberal Democrats lost 27 of their 57 seats to the Conservatives. In the   to the Brexit referendum, he wrote: “Given these challenging economic times, the very last thing we should do is risk the UK and EU economies with this risky [Brexit] move. ” Mr. Messina will   many other key figures from the Conservative Party’s 2015 campaign, including political strategist Lynton Crosby, pollster Mark Textor, and digital media specialists Craig Elder and Tom Edmonds.",0

7836,CBO: Full Repeal of Obamacare Insures More Americans than Ryan’s Obamacare-lite Plan - Breitbart,"According to Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projections, a full repeal of Obamacare would insure more Americans than Speaker Paul Ryan’s   reforms. [The CBO’s analysis on the Republican leadership’s plan to repeal Obamacare predicts it would drop insurance for 14 million people in 2018, while 24 million would lose insurance by 2026. Compared to these figures, the CBO’s research on the 2015 full repeal bill indicated it would insure more Americans than the Ryan plan.  Phillip Klein, managing editor of the Washington Examiner, stated that despite the Ryan plan doling out billions of dollars in tax credits, the plan also retains the Obamacare regulations, which might stall any more progress. Klein said:  The reason is that the Republican replacement preserves many of Obamacare’s regulations that drive up the cost of insurance. So, in essence, the GOP alternative would be asking people to purchase expensive Obamacare plans, with less financial assistance. In contrast, while full repeal would offer no assistance, because it would get rid of Obamacare’s regulations, it would make insurance cheaper. Based on the relatively similar effects of full repeal and partial repeal under the Ryan plan, Klein argues, “If Republicans are going to get hammered on coverage numbers, they may as well do it for the type of plan that is philosophically coherent and consistent with conservative principles a plan that would actually usher in the kind of choice and competition that Republicans are always claiming they want that could actually have a big upside surprise on coverage if individuals benefit from free market innovation that the CBO cannot model for. ”",0

7839,Bill Maher Apologizes for Using Racial Slur on ’Real Time’,"Real Time host Bill Maher has issued an apology after using a racial slur during a segment of his HBO program Friday night. [“Friday nights are always my worst night of sleep because I’m up reflecting on the things I should or shouldn’t have said on my live show,” Maher said in a statement Saturday. “Last night was a particularly long night as I regret the word I used in the banter of a live moment. The word was offensive and I regret saying it and am very sorry. ”  Maher was speaking to Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse on Real Time Friday night about the senator’s new book, The Vanishing American Adult, when the topic of how adults dress up for Halloween came up. Sasse told Maher that in Nebraska, adults don’t often dress up for Halloween. “I’ve got to get to Nebraska more,” Maher joked. “You’re welcome,” Sasse replied. “We’d love to have you work in the fields with us. ” “Work in the fields? Senator, I’m a house n***er,” Maher replied, before quickly adding that the comment was a joke. The remark drew gasps and some laughter from the audience. HBO issued a statement Saturday saying the comment would be removed from future broadcasts of the show. “Bill Maher’s comment last night was completely inexcusable and tasteless. We are removing his deeply offensive comment from any subsequent airings of the show,” the premium cable channel said. Maher’s comment sparked outrage across social media Friday night, with some prominent commentators, including Black Lives Matter activist Deray McKesson, calling for his firing from HBO.

In May, Late Show host Stephen Colbert issued an   apology after he said Trump’s mouth was only good for being Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “c*ck holster. ” The FCC looked into the comments but decided no action was warranted.

7841,EXCLUSIVE: Inside Venezuela: Starved Families Scavenge for Food in Garbage-Covered Streets - Breitbart,"CARACAS, Venezuela  —   Driving through the streets of Caracas, it is impossible not to notice the ubiquitous government propaganda on the sides of buildings and scores of armed police. [Even harder to avoid, however, is the garbage.  On almost every street corner, stacks of waste can be seen piled up, some of it in black bags, but other items in limbo such as water bottles, diapers and occasionally food waste. Around almost every pile of garbage, a crowd had formed, rifling through it for scraps to eat. From schoolchildren to the elderly, even to those in work uniform, many Venezuelans are resorting to scavaging just to survive. A recent report found that over 15 percent of people scavenge as a means of survival. Those who eat what they find have developed the skill of finding edible bits of food where they can. In an interview with Colombia’s El Tiempo, for example, one woman noted that some neighborhoods are known for having the “good” garbage  —   the kind with food in it that can be recooked and consumed, as opposed to   waste.  A woman and her teenage daughter, who can be seen wearing a school backpack, search for food in garbage bags.   Huge amounts of waste are routinely dumped on roadsides. A     scolds me for taking the photo. Anything showing Venezuela’s extreme poverty is considered a crime against the state.    men ruffle through bin bags. Drainage systems are also inundated with waste, increasing the risk of flooding.  A roadside is covered in waste within a busy market.  Stray dogs can be seen scavenging through garbage. Some Venezuelans have now resorted to eating dogs just to survive.    protesters regularly place bin bags in the middle of the road to prevent vehicles from accessing marches.  “I AM HUNGRY” The country’s problems with managing landfill are well documented. Venezuela’s waste management system has been largely   for much of the Chavista era. In 2007, a Lonely Planet travel guide to Venezuela warned foreign visitors that waste management was “far and away the most obvious environmental problem in Venezuela,” with “no recycling policy and dumping of garbage in cities, along roads and natural areas is common practice. ” In some neighborhoods, garbage trucks simply fail to come around for over a week, resulting in large heaps of garbage on the streets. “The fundamental problem has been planning, which has stagnated the solid wage management systems [in Venezuela] for 20 years, because in the past two decades, the exact same thing has been done despite the evolution of technology as well as recycling measures that have evolved,” Universidad Central de Venezuela (UCV) professor Juan Carlos Sánchez explained at a 2016 presentation. There is little evidence that Maduro has implemented reforms to change the waste management system, despite his claims of environmentalism. Venezuela remains a signatory of the Paris Climate Agreement and under former president, Hugo Chávez’s leadership launched a number of environmental initiatives such as “Mission Tree” that promoted conservation and sustainable development. However, such initiatives appear to have been sidelined under the Maduro regime, and it is unclear how, if at all, Venezuela is working to meet the commitments in the Paris agreement. This did not stop Maduro from criticizing President Donald Trump’s withdrawal announcement from the Paris Agreement, accusing Trump of “turning his back on the world. ” Maduro has blamed corruption, private enterprise, and the United States generally for the country’s current state of emergency. In addition to the unsightly nature of the problem and environmental dangers, the waste is also likely to present a serious health hazard, particular given the South American nation’s status as one of the countries most affected by the Zika virus. Stagnant pools of water, easily created by standing waste after rainfall, breed mosquitos that spread the disease. The government has refused to disclose numbers of Zika victims or other key details to keeping the public safe, and the Colombian Health Minister last year accusing Venezuelan health officials of “an epidemiological silence” on the problem. Even if Venezuelan government officials sought to solve the problem now, they would have to improvise on what to use to solve it. Venezuela is lacking hygienic products to tackle the mess, with chronic shortages of products such as detergent, disinfectants, and general cleaning materials.

7842,‘The Girl on the Train’ Takes the Fast Track From Book to Screen - The New York Times,"Back in March 2014, when Jared LeBoff, a producer at Marc Platt Productions, first read the thriller “The Girl on the Train,” it wasn’t yet a sensation, one that to date has sold more than six million copies in the United States alone. Sent to him in digital form by an agent of an unknown author, Paula  Hawkins, it was a     novel with three untrustworthy female narrators  —   one of them an unhappy, alcoholic divorcée named Rachel Watson who believes she has witnessed something key to a woman’s disappearance. “It was eerie, creepy and enticing,” Mr. LeBoff said about the twisty, Hitchcockian tone of Ms. Hawkins’s book. “It just added up to a juicy piece of material. ” Mr. Platt and DreamWorks Pictures apparently agreed, and without the headache of a bidding war, they soon optioned the rights. In fact, it wasn’t until the following year, around the time the screenwriter Erin Cressida Wilson (“Secretary”) was turning in her first draft of an adaptation, and Ms. Hawkins’s American publisher, Riverhead Books, was releasing her novel here, that those associated with the screen version of “The Girl on the Train” realized this was more than just an ordinary    project. Their source material seemed to be everywhere. “I kept seeing girls on the subway reading the book,” said Ms. Wilson, who made a pastime of surreptitiously photographing people with noses buried in “The Girl on the Train. ” “I sort of started a catalog of girls reading the book, on the subway, in cafes I saw a man reading it in a diner. It sort of confirmed the zeitgeist of something that Paula had captured. ” Within two weeks of hitting shelves and   “The Girl on the Train” shot to the top of the New York Times   list. In reviews, it was often compared with “Gone Girl,” Gillian Flynn’s suspense phenomenon of 2012, which resulted in a   film adaptation grossing roughly $369 million worldwide and earning Rosamund Pike an Oscar nod. While Mr. Platt and DreamWorks didn’t have the same luxury of time as the “Gone Girl” production  —   an almost      journey from print to screen  —   they had Ms. Wilson’s adaptation as interest in Ms. Hawkins’s book exploded. Tate Taylor, who directed another     adaptation, “The Help,” was brought in. By then, everyone was in   mode, Mr. Taylor said. “They were like: ‘We’ve got to get this thing made. We’ve got lightning in a bottle here. We’ve got to get it out for fall of 2016.’ So we just amped it up. ” On a trip to London to meet with Emily Blunt, who would be cast as the     Rachel, Mr. Taylor also met Ms. Hawkins for what he called “a   business talk. She said, ‘What are your intentions?’ and I said, ‘This needs to be really dark and sexy, and it needs to be truthful.’ And she said: ‘I love it! Let’s get a gin and tonic.’ That was the entire thing. ” Another consequence of the book’s meteoric rise was that they now had a   audience to worry about. “In the movie world, everyone is looking to break through all the noise with a brand, and a   book is such a thing,” Mr. Platt said. “But all of the sudden, you have expectations. What starts to creep into the conversation is how much you veer from the source material and how much you don’t. You ask yourself, ‘How can we make something that really works as a film, but yet still satisfy a very large fan base? ’” No one needs to remind him that when the film opens on Oct. 7, roughly 21 months after its original January 2015 book publication date, it will have to satisfy a fan base that has only continued growing. Having now spent more than 80 weeks and counting on the   list, “The Girl on the Train” has hit No. 1 in hardcover and   trade paperback and   paperback. Riverhead has printed close to 1. 4 million copies of a special movie   edition. Given the ubiquity of “The Girl on the Train” billboards, bus shelter posters and book displays in supermarkets, bookstores and airports nationwide, even publishing insiders have trouble pinpointing the exact cause of the exponential increase in sales. That said, every time Universal runs the film’s moody trailer  —   as it did on Aug. 9, right before Michael Phelps won his 20th Olympic gold medal  —   Riverhead sees a buying surge. Ms. Hawkins, speaking by phone from London, said she had watched the finished version of the film and spoke about what it was like to see characters she created walking, talking and moving around. “It’s a shocking film in parts, really frightening,” she said. “It’s an odd thing, because I actually know what’s happening, but it felt really fresh to me. ” Her positive response puts her in the position of addressing some readers’ irritation about changes made for the screen. To appeal to the larger American audience, the action, which originally had Rachel peering woozily into other people’s backyards from a commuter train running through suburban London, now puts her on the   rail line riding from Westchester County to Manhattan. “What I say to everyone is, ‘There’s no such thing as a 100 percent faithful adaptation of a book to screen,’” Ms. Hawkins said, adding that early on, when it came to selling the film rights, agents asked her, “‘Would you have a massive problem if the location was moved?’ I said, No, because what’s important really is the train, not what exists on the outside. ” Audiences should also not expect to catch a glimpse of the   Ms. Hawkins, even though, at one point, she had a cameo in the film. “I was on the set, and Tate persuaded me to be on the train as one of the other passengers,” Ms. Hawkins said with a laugh. “To be very honest with you, I was cut. ”",0
7843,"Hate Group Numbers in U.S. Rose for 2nd Year in a Row, Report Says - The New York Times","The number of extremist groups active in the United States rose for the second year in a row last year, propelled in part by the mainstreaming of   rhetoric by the Trump campaign, particularly on topics like immigration and Islam, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremism in the United States. The number of   groups grew the most, almost tripling to 101 in 2016 from 34 in 2015, in part because of President Trump’s 2015 proposal to bar Muslims from entering the United States in response to the Syrian refugee crisis and terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, Calif. and Orlando, Fla. There were a total of 917 hate groups operating in the United States in 2016, an increase from 892 in 2015 and 784 in 2014, the center said in its annual report. The number of organized   groups, like armed militias, dropped by almost 40 percent, however, to 623 in 2016 from 998 in 2015. That decline was a consequence of the increasingly mainstream presence of policy ideas and conspiracy theories about Islam and immigrants that originated on the political fringe, researchers said. Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the center, said Mr. Trump’s election had been “absolutely electrifying to the radical right. ” “Trump has   many of the issues of the radical right, and that has prevented or at least slowed the growth of these groups,” Mr. Potok said. He added, “The Trump phenomenon has really unleashed   hate in this country in a way that is difficult to remember. ” Mr. Trump began his presidential campaign with a series of divisive claims, including a June 2015 speech that referred to Mexican immigrants as “rapists” and “criminals. ” That December, he proposed fighting terrorism with a Muslim ban, a sharp departure from past presidents, including George W. Bush and Barack Obama, who said jihadist groups did not represent all Muslims. Both as a candidate and as president, Mr. Trump has used Twitter and speeches to attack an   list of targets that number in the hundreds. He has sometimes posted images and messages of support on Twitter that appeared to be   or the work of white nationalists, as have his advisers. Nevertheless, Mr. Trump has consistently rejected the notion that his rhetoric or policy proposals have been divisive or extreme. He has often pointed out that his daughter Ivanka and    Jared Kushner, are Orthodox Jews, and when asked about his support among white nationalist groups in an interview with The New York Times last November, he said, “I disavow and condemn” them. The Southern Poverty Law Center said its report tracked only groups that engage in activities in the real world, like passing out leaflets, holding rallies or distributing membership cards. But it warned that such an approach could play down the true reach of extremism because many extremists operate primarily on social media and other online forums. “We make a mighty effort to separate out what is really just some guy with a web page or a web forum or tweeting,” Mr. Potok said in an interview. “They have to do something that happens in the real world as opposed to online. ” He said the drop in   groups might also reflect that they have less to offer members in an age when similar rhetoric can be heard at a political rally. “They can find just as much   vitriol expressed at a Trump rally and be part of a bigger, more exciting movement,” he said. The rise in the number of   groups mirrored the 67 percent surge in   hate crimes reported by the F. B. I. in 2015, the last year for which the agency has statistics. There were 257   episodes reported to the police that year, the highest number since 2001, when more than 480 hate crimes were reported in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. In the first 10 days after Mr. Trump’s election, the center said, it documented 867 bias incidents, including more than 300 that targeted immigrants or Muslims. Hate crimes across the board appear to have become more common in recent years: In 2015, the F. B. I. said, there were 5, 818 reported bias incidents against racial and religious minorities, gays and transgender people, and others, an increase of 6 percent from the year before.",0
7844,Voting Problems Prompt Comptroller to Vow Audit of New York City’s Elections Board - The New York Times,"Citing concerns about potential voting irregularities during the most consequential presidential primary in years, the New York City comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, said on Tuesday that his office would audit the city’s Board of Elections in part to determine if tens of thousands of Democratic voters were improperly removed from voter rolls. Mr. Stringer said in a statement that the Board of Elections had confirmed that more than 125, 000 Democratic voters in Brooklyn were dropped between November 2015 and this month. He said the decline occurred “without any adequate explanation furnished by the Board of Elections. ” “There is nothing more sacred in our nation than the right to vote, yet election after election, reports come in of people who were inexplicably purged from the polls, told to vote at the wrong location or unable to get in to their polling site,” Mr. Stringer, a Democrat, said. On Tuesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio, also a Democrat, echoed Mr. Stringer, noting that voters and voting rights monitors had reported the “purging of entire buildings and blocks of voters from the voting lists. ” “The perception that numerous voters may have been disenfranchised undermines the integrity of the entire electoral process and must be fixed,” the mayor said in a statement. Michael J. Ryan, the executive director of the elections board, said that while approximately 125, 000 were removed from voter rolls in Brooklyn since the fall, some 63, 000 people were added. He said the decline did not “shock my conscience” because there were 800, 000 registered Democrats in Brooklyn, and thousands of people were added and removed from the list every year. There was a “report a couple years ago that said there were people on the lists who didn’t belong there,” Mr. Ryan said on Tuesday. “Now we take people off the list who don’t belong there,” he continued, “and there’s some blowback, criticism that we’ve done it inaccurately. ” The drop in registered Democrats was first reported by WNYC. Other issues also surfaced that blocked New Yorkers from voting. When Karishma Desai, a graduate student, arrived at her polling place around 7:30 a. m. she found it closed, an hour and a half after the polls were scheduled to open. “I was already late to work,” she said, so she left without casting a ballot. Mr. Ryan said the polling site coordinator failed to show up at Ms. Desai’s polling place, the Atlantic Terminal Senior Citizens Center in Brooklyn. Additional staff members were called in, he said, and it was open and functioning smoothly by midmorning. He also said “an army of technicians” was dispatched around the city to address technical problems with some voting machines. He said that the issues on Tuesday were typical for an Election Day, but that the importance of this primary made the spotlight more intense. “We’re not seeing anything that is so wildly out of the ordinary as to cause me to be tremendously concerned that there are widespread problems, because there certainly are not,” Mr. Ryan said. “We understand that the eyes and ears of the world are truly on New York City today, and it’s understandable. ” Ms. Desai, a Democrat, returned to her polling place on Tuesday afternoon and was able to vote. She said she voted for Senator Bernie Sanders.",0

Some are waking up.”   A protesters is arrested by police near the Dakota Access pipeline at a construction site in North Dakota, Oct. 22, 2016. (Photo: YouTube) 
North Dakota water protector Redhawk reported today at Standing Rock that two police officers just turned in their badges to show their support for the water protectors. 
“There have been at least 2 reports of police officers turning in their badges acknowledging that this battle is not what they signed up for,” Redhawk writes. 
“You can see it in some of them, that they do not support the police actions,” he continues. 
“We must keep reminding them they are welcome to put down their weapons and badge and take a stand against this pipeline as well. Some are waking up.” 
While most of the police officers at the scene of the DAPL protests have been brutal, violent, and unconstitutionally-militarized, it is clear from this recent act of solidarity that some of their hearts can be turned to the cause of justice. 
This recent incident is reminiscent of what happened in Frankfurt , Germany in May of 2012, when police removed their helmets and began marching with the people protesting big banks.

7846,Katinka Hosszu and Her Husband Raise Eyebrows at the Pool - The New York Times,"In the fall of 2012, Shane Tusup was asked to become more involved in Katinka Hosszu’s swimming career. That request came from his girlfriend, Katinka Hosszu, who suggested that he coach her. Deep down, he said, he knew it could work, but he also knew that someday they might come to regret it. With no blueprint to follow, they married and forged a professional coupling that has produced six world championship medals, including four golds two female swimmer of the year awards and a world record. Along the way, their relationship has become a cause célèbre on the pool deck. Many sports, most prominently tennis, have featured contentious relationships between coaches and athletes. Those typically involved fathers overseeing the careers of their children. Less often is the volatile coach the athlete’s husband. Jessica Hardy, an Olympic medalist who used to train with Hosszu in Los Angeles and wrote about being subjected to verbal and emotional abuse as a child, said, “I’ve seen a lot of inappropriate and  . K. behavior in Shane. ” She added: “I’ve seen coaches exhibit that kind of behavior in training, but this is another level. It’s scary. ” Hosszu and Tusup acknowledge that their arrangement is complicated but insist it is not unhealthy. They say they are able to separate their relationship as athlete and coach from that of wife and husband. Hosszu, 27, is scheduled to race in five individual events at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, more than Michael Phelps. She is competing in her fourth Olympics, the same as Ryan Lochte. She is ranked No. 1 this year in two Olympic events, as many as Katie Ledecky. Unlike Phelps, Lochte or Ledecky, Hosszu has never won an Olympic medal. Four years ago, the pressure to produce her first podium finish for her native Hungary, whose obsession with water crests every Olympic summer, crushed Hosszu. She finished fourth in the   individual medley, the event she had expected to win, as well as eighth in the   individual medley and ninth in the   butterfly. “In London, I was so scared of what’s going to happen if I lose,” Hosszu said. “It was awful, really. I just felt like: ‘This is my time I need to show it. It’s now or never.’ I put this pressure on myself. ” After the London Games, she retreated to Hungary before returning briefly to the University of Southern California, where she had trained in the leadup to the Olympics. Over the next several months, she buried her old self and hatched the competitor who became known as the Iron Lady. With input from the United   Tusup, Hosszu increased the degree of difficulty of her competitive programs. Her reasoning was that the more events she swam in a day, the less pressure she would put on herself to be the best in any of them. Tusup’s logic was that Hosszu, a newly minted professional, could double or triple her earning power by stacking her competitive program. His idea, which defied convention, was to train less and race more. Three months after the London Olympics, Hosszu unveiled her   program at a   World Cup meet, held in a   course in Beijing. She entered the     and   individual medleys the 200 backstroke the 200 butterfly and the 200, 400 and 800 freestyles. She graced the podium five times, prompting members of the Chinese news media to ask her if she were made of iron. “The Iron Lady” became a headline, Hosszu’s nickname and, in time, her alter ego. When the diffident Hosszu dons her swimsuit and stuffs her schoolteacher’s hair bun into a latex racing cap, she turns into a superhero with reserves of stamina and confidence. The swimmer who felt overwhelmed by the pressure to succeed in London has since become the first athlete to surpass $1 million in World Cup series prize money for individual races and overall finishes and averaged more than 100 races a year. She has accomplished all of this with her husband overseeing all the aspects of her preparation, to the unease of some in the tightknit swimming community. Tusup is more temperamental than Hosszu, and his eruptions on the pool deck have elicited stares, complaints and calls for his removal. “I always say if you find a coach who can make you a step or two better, or if what we’re doing is not working and you think there’s something you need to change, you need to tell me because then I’ll step back, that coach will step in, and we’ll be happy,” Tusup said, adding, “She has that offer to this day. ” A   swimmer going into the Olympics with a spouse as a coach is rare. At the 1996 Atlanta Games, Michelle Smith of Ireland won three gold medals while coached by her husband, a former discus thrower. But she had ascended to the top of international competition at a relatively late age and after a mediocre career. Two years later, she was barred from swimming when it was determined she had manipulated a drug test by spiking her urine sample with alcohol. Hosszu was already a world champion when Tusup, a   backstroker at his peak, took over her training. Under his tutelage she has become, in her words, “a   athlete. ” Tusup and Hosszu are like pool water and chlorine: You are not likely to find one without the other. Over a   period in late November in Budapest, the only time they were apart was to change clothes or use the bathroom. They never exchanged a cross word, and they never appeared to wilt, perhaps because of the four espresso shots over ice that serve as their daily   . Hosszu described the   act as “definitely difficult” but also rewarding. “He’s pretty hard as a coach,” she said, “but at home he’s supersweet and loving and really funny. So we can laugh a lot. ” They met as freshmen at U. S. C. where Tusup majored in human performance and competed for the men’s swim team. Hosszu was a psychology major who struggled with English when she arrived but had been a women’s swim team captain by the time she left, degree in hand. Asked what attracted them to each other, Hosszu said with a laugh: “We’re weird we’re different we’re not normal. We’re ourselves. ” Tusup, 28, has a weekend bodybuilder’s physique and several tattoos, including one of his wife’s   time. His manner can be brusque. His emotions are on a tripwire, causing some people to keep their distance. Hosszu described him as impatient and said that when he made refinements in her strokes, especially her backstroke, “he expects me to get it perfect right away. ” She added, “That’s why I’ve improved so much. ” Adopting a faster stroke tempo, Hosszu has dropped her backstroke times significantly. In 2012, she was not among the   swimmers in the 100 or the 200. Four years later, she is an Olympic medal contender in both events. “Shane helped me find my technique,” Hosszu said, adding: “He told me I’m really so good at backstroke. At the time I didn’t think it. ” Until recently, her   lagged behind her talent. She has a   nature and a personality wired to connect with others. Her long day in November ended with a book signing in a Budapest mall that ran well over schedule because she spent three, four and, in a few cases, five minutes in conversation with the people in line, some of whom had waited two hours to meet her. When Hosszu and Tusup married in 2013, it was as if their strengths became one. Hosszu had a herculean work ethic but no grandiose goals. Tusup is a big thinker who has schooled Hosszu in the A B C’s of the American dream: Ambition, Branding, Confidence. “Since I started working with Shane, I have a lot more confidence,” Hosszu said. “It’s crazy to think I still need Shane telling me: ‘Yes, you are great. Yes, you can do that. ’” Hosszu is trying to pass on what she has learned from Tusup to her fellow Hungarians. During that November visit, Hosszu competed in every women’s event at the Hungarian nationals. Behind the scenes, she was pushing for improved training conditions, traveling opportunities and support staff for other national team members in a sport that has supplied Hungary with 66 Olympic medals, its   total, behind fencing and canoeing. The disagreement bubbled to the surface, making headlines in Hungary three months later when Hosszu rejected the federation’s training stipend, which amounted to roughly $40, 000. Hosszu said she did not need the money and would rather see it funneled to her compatriots struggling to cover their costs. The fraying of Hosszu’s bonds with her national federation strengthened her alliance with Tusup, who has passed his tendency for   on to his wife. Dorina Szekeres, a 2012 Hungarian Olympian who is employed by the couple’s management agency, sat in the bleachers watching Hosszu train in Budapest as Tusup paced up and down the pool deck, observing her strokes and offering refinements in her technique. Szekeres, who swam at Indiana University, said swimmers from the United States had a different   from the Hungarians: The Americans are encouraged to chase rainbows while in Hungary, where expectations are carefully managed, dreams are contained to black and white. “We have the drive, but we didn’t have the confidence,” Szekeres said. “That’s what we learned in the U. S. that anything is possible. If you’re not in an environment telling you you’re good, how will you know how good you can be? Katinka never saw the potential she has. My old coach is asking me how she is training, what she’s doing in the weight room. It’s no magic. She’s getting the work done. She’s pushing herself every day. ” Tending tidy gardens of pruned dreams was a lament of Hosszu’s father, Istvan, a professional basketball player who said he had earned the nickname Sniper because of his   shooting prowess. In a conversation over coffee during his daughter’s book signing, he said he realized toward the end of his career that he could have achieved more if he had set loftier goals. “The dream was not big enough,” he said in Hungarian, with Szekeres translating. Hosszu often posts photos of herself posing with weights to her social media accounts, including one shot of her kneeling on one leg on the bottom of a pool while executing a biceps curl with a dumbbell. Sometimes she will drive home her point by including her mantra, “Hard work always pays off. ” She credits her embrace of weight training, coupled with the elimination of fast food and sugary products from her diet, for her leaner, more sculpted physique in the years since London. “Each time I’m pushing myself more and more and pushing the limits,” Hosszu said. Dave Salo, who coached Hosszu at U. S. C. until shortly after the 2012 Olympics, said she was one of the hardest workers he had ever seen. The exception was in the weight room, where he described her as soft. Since she started working with her husband, that has changed. On the Monday after the Hungarian nationals, Hosszu spent nearly 90 minutes at a health club going through her paces in a circuit workout alongside mothers and retirees toiling on treadmills, elliptical machines and stationary bikes. Tusup and Szekeres were also there, engrossed in their own workouts. Wearing an   device that resembled a gas mask, Hosszu completed multiple sets of a variety of exercises, including jumping rope, abdominal crunches while holding aloft a weight, leg and arm presses, and  . Hardy, a 2012 United States Olympian who trained with Hosszu at U. S. C. in the leadup to the London Games, marveled at her transformation. “The first practice after the London Olympics, less than three weeks after the Olympics, she came back, and she had been training with Shane already, and I saw a different Katinka,” Hardy said. “More fit and more in shape. ” Hardy added, “She worked hard before, but she wasn’t as motivated as she is now. ” Tusup was the catalyst. He saw Hosszu as the Iron Lady before she did. “She was insecure about the nickname,” Tusup said. “She was saying: ‘Am I really the Iron Lady? Am I really going to be able to live up to that image? ’” If Hosszu entertained doubt, Tusup envisioned dollar signs. There is money to be made for professional swimmers in the World Cup series of meets in Europe and Asia and the Grand Prix series in the United States. The events offer cash prizes for the top three finishers in each event and bonuses, totaling more than $100, 000, to the top finishers over all. Tusup saw an opportunity for them to travel the world, as they desired, while maximizing Hosszu’s earning potential. She has demonstrated that it is possible to race one’s way to fitness rather than train months on end between meets. Salo said he was happy to see “a leaner and meaner” Hosszu swimming “the way people always thought she was capable. ” Still, he worries. “I think the biggest issue with her is her husband,” he said. “I think you have to look at her motivation. Is it fear or confidence that is driving her?” At December’s Duel in the Pool, a   meet in Indianapolis between swimmers from the United States and Europe, the American Josh Prenot posted to his Twitter account an   video of Tusup throwing an object to the ground and kicking the banner board that ran the length of the pool after Hosszu’s loss to Missy Franklin in the 200 freestyle. In Arizona in April, at a Grand Prix meet held by her swimwear sponsor, Arena, Hosszu had a rare bad day at the office, finishing fifth in the 200 individual medley and the 200 backstroke (both won by the American Maya DiRado, whom she will face in Rio). After the backstroke, Hosszu avoided making eye contact with Tusup, who upbraided her while swimmers from other teams stared. Tusup continued his critique in the   area, where two people said they overheard him suggesting to Hosszu that she stay in the water and drown. The night ended with Tusup kissing Hosszu on the forehead and pulling her close in a long embrace on the deck. Hardy, who also raced in Arizona, said she had not talked with Hosszu since a 2013 meet at which Tusup told Hardy not to speak to Hosszu. “He said I was distracting her,” Hardy, who was once a close friend of Hosszu’s, said, adding: “She seems happy with the dynamic. I have empathy, but I don’t think she needs or wants anybody’s assistance. ” Hosszu described her relationship with Tusup as “pretty complicated. ” “I’m definitely more the one who’s ” she said. “Because he’s so emotional and he really wants us to get the goals we set for ourselves, that’s probably why he’s able to be that way. ” Hosszu added: “We always try to push each other, I think, and we really try to  —   I’m trying to think how to say this  —   ignore everything else for the goals. So if we get in a fight, we know why or try to figure out why, so if he says something during practice and I know he’s speaking as a coach, I won’t be offended. I probably would be offended if he would talk to me like that as a husband. ” Tusup defended his behavior, saying he was not a bully. “That’s what it appears a lot of times,” he said. “I get a bad rep in the U. S. because these parents in the stands, they’re going, ‘He’s such a jerk he yells at her when she doesn’t swim fast.’ No, the hard part of swimming is that there’s a lot of times you just settle for O. K. and we agreed that the goal was never to settle for O. K. that we’re going to keep pushing, even if we don’t get it, to be great, to be amazing, to be legendary. ” Yes, Tusup is tough, Hosszu’s father said, but so was her first coach, her grandfather, under whom she swam until she was 13. He once hurled one of his sandals in his granddaughter’s direction during a workout, Istvan Hosszu said. He added that he would speed through the streets to deliver her to practice on time if they were running late so as not to become the target of her coach’s wrath. “She was his only athlete,” he said, adding, “He was the grandparent, but not at the pool. ” So it is with Tusup. He is the husband, but not at the pool. “They’re in love it’s working why not?” her father said. As in 2012, Hosszu arrives at the Games expecting to win a gold medal. If that does not happen, she will be fine, she insists. “Shane is always reminding me, ‘You lost the one that you thought you could not survive without, and you’re thriving,’” Hosszu said, referring to the 400 individual medley in London. “Why would you ever worry about anything?”",0

On Sunday evening, side-by-side images of Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta and his brother Tony next to police sketches of potential suspects in a 2007 kidnapping of a three-year-old girl took over the internet. I'm not a huge conspiracy theorist…

Madeleine Beth McCann should have celebrated her 13th birthday with her family in England this year, but she vanished from her bed during a family vacation to Portugal in 2003. The case gripped the entire world, becoming one of the most high profile missing persons cases in history. Coverage of her kidnapping was comparable to the press interest in the death of Princess Diana. 
The circumstantial evidence goes far beyond the striking resemblance. 
John Podesta’s first email on Wikileaks is dated May 4th 2007. 
Per Wikipedia Madeline disappeared May 3rd 2007. 
Did John Podesta WIPE HIS EMAILS the day after Madeline disappeared to destroy evidence? 
The abduction occurred in Portugal, where Wikileaks emails show was a destination Podesta traveled to. 
In addition, extensive evidence points to the Podesta Brothers having close connections to those involved with potential crimes or at least bizarre rituals involving underaged children. 
Watch this video: 
The Clinton foundation has long standing ties to convicted Haiti Child Trafficker Laura Silsby. 
We also know for a fact John Podesta, Hillary’s Campaign Chair, has close family ties to convicted serial child molester Denny Hastert . 
In the email below, Podesta’s brother mentions Denny, saying he’s remained “CLOSE” to him. 
Denny Hastert was a wrestling coach who was referred to by his sentencing judge as a “serial child molester.” 
These are the people who the Hillary campaign, and their family members call friends and keep in “close touch with.” 
It’s disgusting. 
Recently former Navy Seal Erik Prince told Breitbart News that according to one of his “well-placed sources” in the New York Police Department, “The NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making” in the Anthony Weiner investigation, but received “huge pushback” from the Justice Department. 
Prince claimed he had insider knowledge of the investigation that could help explain why FBI Director James Comey had to announce he was reopening the investigation into Clinton’s email server last week. 
“Because of Weinergate and the sexting scandal, the NYPD started investigating it. Through a subpoena, through a warrant, they searched his laptop, and sure enough, found those 650,000 emails. They found way more stuff than just more information pertaining to the inappropriate sexting the guy was doing,” Prince claimed. 
“They found State Department emails. They found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money laundering, including the fact that Hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times. Hillary Clinton went there at least six times,” he said. 
“The amount of garbage that they found in these emails, of criminal activity by Hillary, by her immediate circle, and even by other Democratic members of Congress was so disgusting they gave it to the FBI, and they said, ‘We’re going to go public with this if you don’t reopen the investigation and you don’t do the right thing with timely indictments,’” Prince explained. 
“I believe – I know, and this is from a very well-placed source of mine at 1PP, One Police Plaza in New York – the NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making in this investigation, and they’ve gotten huge pushback, to the point of coercion, from the Justice Department, with the Justice Department threatening to charge someone that had been unrelated in the accidental heart attack death of Eric Garner almost two years ago. That’s the level of pushback the Obama Justice Department is doing against actually seeking justice in the email and other related criminal matters,” Prince said. 
Erik’s claim parallels what Steve Pieczenik states about the Clinton Pedophilia Connection. 
Were the Podestas involved with the abduction of Madeline Mccann? We do not know for sure yet. 
One thing is for certain. The mainstream media will try to hide this bombshell information and do everything they can to protect their Globalist puppet Hillary Clinton. 
They will also likely call this a “vast right wing conspiracy.” 
But just remember, this started as a “vast right wing conspiracy” as well.

7848,"After Victory in California, Hillary Clinton Turns Toward Donald Trump - The New York Times","Hillary Clinton claimed the Democratic presidential nomination on Tuesday night after decisive victories in the California, New Jersey and New Mexico primaries, and she quickly appealed to supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to unite with her against Donald J. Trump. The Associated Press reported early Wednesday that Mrs. Clinton had won California, but Mr. Sanders gave no indication that he would yield, insisting earlier that he would continue his campaign and barely acknowledging her achievement. With the   Democratic race nearing a close, Mrs. Clinton savored the biggest night of her extraordinary journey from lawyer, wife and first lady to senator, secretary of state and, now, the first woman to win a major party’s nomination. At a rally in Brooklyn, she took the stage with her hands clasped over her heart in gratitude, then threw open her arms in joy and savored a long moment as a jubilant crowd waved American flags and chanted “Hillary. ” Reaching for history, Mrs. Clinton pledged to build on the achievements of pioneers like the   leaders at Seneca Falls, N. Y. who began the fight for women’s rights in America. “Tonight caps an amazing journey  —   a long, long journey,” she said, nearly a century after women won the right to vote nationwide. “We all owe so much to those who came before, and tonight belongs to all of you. ” As six states voted on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders’s political lifeline frayed with each loss. He was left hoping for a   victory in the California primary, to justify staying in the race and lobbying Democratic officials to support him in a contested convention next month. In a speech in Santa Monica, Calif. late Tuesday night that felt much like a valedictory, Mr. Sanders told supporters he was determined to stop Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, from winning the presidency. Yet he spoke of their cause as much larger than his candidacy. “You all know that it is more than Bernie  —   it is all of us together,” he said. He vowed to “fight hard to win” the final primary, in the District of Columbia next week, and to continue “our fight for social, economic, racial and environmental justice” at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia. But he also recognized cold political reality. “I am pretty good in arithmetic, and I know that the fight in front of us is a very, very steep fight,” he said. “But we will continue to fight for every vote and every delegate we can get. ” While Mr. Sanders noticeably ignored Mrs. Clinton’s triumph, only crediting “her victories tonight,” she lavished praise on him earlier at her Brooklyn rally. She said their “vigorous debate” had been “very good for the Democratic Party and America. ” Mr. Sanders won the North Dakota caucuses and the Montana primary, while Mrs. Clinton won the South Dakota primary. Republicans also voted in several states. Though Mr. Sanders made plans to lay off much of his campaign staff, he appeared reluctant to let go completely after months of political warfare against a Clinton machine that he holds in thinly veiled contempt. President Obama plans to meet with Mr. Sanders at the White House on Thursday at the candidate’s request, an administration spokesman said, adding that Mr. Obama had called both Democratic candidates Tuesday night to congratulate them on “running inspiring campaigns. ” As Mrs. Clinton sought to turn her attention to the general election, Mr. Trump, who had a weekslong head start, was busy reckoning with problems of his own making. His criticism of a federal judge, Gonzalo P. Curiel, for the judge’s Mexican heritage continued to inflict damage on his campaign, as the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, called Mr. Trump’s remarks racist and other Republicans piled on. One Republican senator rescinded his support. Mr. Trump, speaking in Briarcliff Manor, N. Y. pledged to make Republicans “proud of our party and our movement,” though he did not try to defuse the controversy. Instead, reading carefully from a teleprompter, he mounted a lengthy attack on Mrs. Clinton’s record, saying she had “turned the State Department into her private hedge fund. ” And he teased a speech, “on probably Monday of next week,” that he said would delve into “all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons. ” Mr. Trump explicitly reached out to Sanders supporters, who he said had been “left out in the cold by a rigged system. ” “We can’t solve our problems by counting on the politicians who created our problems,” he said. “The Clintons have turned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves. ” Mrs. Clinton returned fire at Mr. Trump in her remarks, charging that he “wants to win by stoking fear and rubbing salt into wounds. ” Yet she avoided the sort of slashing attacks and ridicule that she used to great effect in her indictment of Mr. Trump and his temperament last week. Scarcely raising her voice on Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton again looked to the example of an influential woman, this time tenderly invoking her mother. “She told me to never back down from a bully, which it turns out was pretty good advice,” she said. Although Tuesday had promised to be a watershed moment in the nation’s political history, it proved anticlimactic after The A. P. reported Monday night that Mrs. Clinton had secured enough delegates to clinch the party’s nomination. But she stuck to her plan to use her rally, at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, to celebrate her achievement with some of the same New York Democrats who helped her win a Senate seat in 2000, beginning her career in elected office. The unexpected news on Monday set off conversations within the two campaigns, with Clinton representatives preparing to make overtures to the Sanders camp as early as Wednesday. Sanders advisers were on edge over the declaration that Mrs. Clinton had locked up the nomination, worried that it would depress voter turnout in California. And Mr. Sanders told NBC on Tuesday evening that he was “upset” and “disappointed” that The A. P. had made its call based on a survey of superdelegates, party officials who can shift their allegiances as late as the convention. Mr. Sanders said that his aides were “on the phone right now” with superdelegates, including those supporting Mrs. Clinton. “Defying history is what this campaign has been about,” he said of his bid, which was initially seen as a long shot. “I am going to be meeting with our supporters to figure out the best way forward so that we have a government which represents all of us, and not just the 1 percent. ” His campaign also emailed supporters late Tuesday asking them to commit to vote for him in the final Democratic primary, in the District of Columbia next Tuesday, suggesting that Mr. Sanders was not calling it quits just yet. Still, he planned to let go a large number of workers on Wednesday, according to current and former aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Part of Mr. Sanders’s challenge is that his justifications for continuing his campaign are increasingly thin. Mrs. Clinton has now won a majority of the 4, 051 pledged delegates at stake in the Democratic primaries and caucuses, crossing what Mr. Sanders had long held up as a critical threshold. She also has support from 571 superdelegates to Mr. Sanders’s 48 only about 100 uncommitted superdelegates remain. The campaign managers for Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton have been speaking recently, including early on Tuesday, about the future of the race and about policy priorities for the party’s convention platform in July, according to two Democrats close to the candidates. So far, the discussions have not included the possibility that Mr. Sanders will concede to Mrs. Clinton or endorse her, the Democrats said, but the groundwork has been laid for an eventual conversation or meeting. Several advisers to Mr. Sanders said Tuesday that he had not been inviting opinions or holding meetings about whether to withdraw from the race, nor had he sketched out a speech announcing the suspension of his campaign. They said he had been wholly focused on winning the California primary in hopes that a victory in such a politically important state would help him lobby superdelegates to shift their support. “Moving a lot of superdelegates into our column will require a big campaign of persuasion, a nationwide logistical effort, but we believe we have a strong case to make to them  —   especially if we do very well in Tuesday’s primaries,” said Tad Devine, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders. Other campaign advisers said they expected Mr. Sanders to consider his options during his flight from California to Vermont on Wednesday. One recalled that Mrs. Clinton did much the same when she found herself in a similar situation eight years ago. The day after Barack Obama clinched the Democratic nomination in June 2008, Mrs. Clinton huddled with her advisers and debated whether to hold on to her delegates and try to force a contested convention. She decided to endorse Mr. Obama instead. The two had a tense but productive meeting that Thursday night, and two days later she delivered a speech thanking her supporters and urging them to unite around the party’s presumptive nominee. The resistance of many of Mr. Sanders’s supporters to Mrs. Clinton is likely to soften once Mr. Sanders leaves the race, and especially if he endorses her. But Clinton advisers and allies say they will need his help to bring around the many younger voters and liberals who prefer him. If Mrs. Clinton is beginning the general election with many Sanders supporters incensed at her, Mr. Trump is in the midst of his own   crisis. He is forcing Republicans to confront a painful choice: Embrace his brand of racial politics, one that could taint the party’s image well beyond this election, or abandon their presumptive nominee and hand the White House to the Democrats for another four years. But Mrs. Clinton’s supporters, pointing both to the threat from Mr. Trump and to her chance at making history, predicted that she would have an easier time bringing her party together than Mr. Trump would his. “I think that will sink in over the next few weeks and months and will go a long way to helping unite the party,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York said. “I was on the bike this morning and saw on TV that Monday night, Hillary had won the nomination, and I got  . From a   perspective, it’s an amazing accomplishment. ”",0

Cumhuriyetçi Partiyi –ki partinin başlıca liderleri adaylarından desteklerini çektiler- sabrını çatlatan ve siyasetin satranç tahtasını yeniden şekillendiren siyasi sorunlar değil, çok eski bir uygarlık bölünmesini hortlatan bu söylemdir. Bayan Clinton bir yandan siyaseten doğru olma çabası içerisindeyken, diğeri, yani « Donald » eski « First Lady »nin ikiyüzlülüğünü ortaya seriyor.
Hillary Clinton, kocasıyla yattıklarını itiraf eden kadınları hedef almaktan ve lekelemekten çekinmemesine rağmen, bir yandan kadın-erkek eşitliğini savunurken, kendini kişisel nitelikleriyle değil ama eski bir Başkanın eşi olarak sunarken, kadın cinsiyetine karşı duygularını gizlemediği için Donald Trump’u kadın düşmanlığıyla suçluyor. Diğer yandan Donald Trump Devletin özelleştirilmesi sürecini ve Dışişleri Bakanlığından randevu elde edebilmeleri için Clinton Vakfı aracılığıyla yabancı şahsiyetlerden para sızdırılmasını; ObamaCare’in kuruluşunun yurttaşların değil ama sağlık sigortalarının yararına hizmet ettiğini teşhir ediyor ve işi seçim sisteminin doğruluğunu tartışmaya kadar götürüyor.
Donald Trump’un kendini ifade etme tarzının ırkçılığı yüreklendirdiğinin tamamen farkındayım ama Clinton yanlısı medyaların çıkarttığı patırtıya rağmen bunun seçim tartışmasının merkezinde olduğunu hiçbir şekilde düşünmüyorum.
Lewinsky olayı sırasında, Başkan Bill Clinton’un ulustan özür dilemesi ve selameti için rahipleri bir araya getirmesi önemlidir. Oysa bir ses kaydı aracılığıyla benzer olgularla suçlanan Donald Trump, din adamları sınıfından yardım dilenmeden sadece hedef aldığı kişilerden özür dilemekle yetinmiştir.
Bugünkü bölünme, ABD’de Presbiteryenler, Vaftizciler ve Metodistler tarafından temsil edilen Kalvinistlere karşı Katolik, Ortodoks ve Luther’cilerin değerlerinin isyanını yeniden gündeme getirmektedir.
Her ne kadar iki aday da püriten gelenek içerisinde eğitilmiş olsalar da (Clinton Metodist ve Trump Presbiteryen), Bayan Clinton Babasının ölümüyle birlikte dinine geri döndü ve bugün silahlı kuvvetler genelkurmayının The Family adı verilen ayin gruplarına katılıyor. Trump’a gelince daha içsel bir tinsellik uyguluyor ve o kadar sık tapınaklara gitmiyor.
Tabi ki, kimse yetiştirildiği şemalar içerisinde kapalı kalmıyor. Ama düşünmeden hareket ettiğimizde, haberimiz olmadan bunları üretiveriyoruz. Herkesin dini çevresi sorunu dolayısıyla önemli olabilir.
Neler olduğunu daha iyi anlayabilmemiz için XVIInci yüzyıl İngiltere’sine geri dönmemiz gerekiyor. Oliver Cromwell, yaptığı askeri darbe ile Kral I.Charles’ı devirir. Bir Cumhuriyet kuracağı, ülkenin ruhunu arındıracağı iddiasında bulundu ve eski hükümdarın kellesini uçurdu. Kalvin’in düşüncelerinden esinlenen sekter bir rejim kurdu, Papa’ya bağlı İrlandalıları kitlesel olarak katletti ve püriten yaşam tarzını dayattı. Aynı zamanda Siyonizm’i de tasarladı: Yahudileri İngiltere’ye geri çağırdı ve Filistin’de bir Yahudi Devletinin kurulmasını talep eden dünyanın ilk Devlet başkanı oldu. Bu kanlı serüven, « Britanya’nın ilk iç savaşı » adıyla anılıyor.
Monarşinin yeniden kurulmasından sonra, Cromwell’in Püritenleri İngiltere’den kaçarlar. Hollanda’ya yerleşirler ve aralarından bazıları Mayflower gemisiyle Amerika’ya giderken (« Pilgrimler »), bazıları güney Afrika’da Afrikaneer topluluğunu kurarlar. XVIIInci yüzyıldaki ABD Bağımsızlık Savaşı sırasında, Kalvinistlerin Britanya monarşisine karşı mücadelesine yeniden tanık oluruz. Bu mücadele, Britanya tarihi güncel el yazmalarında « İkinci İç Savaş » olarak tanımlanır.
XIXncu yüzyıldaki İç Savaş, Güney Devletleriyle (genelde Katolik kolonların yaşadığı) Kuzeydekileri (daha çok Protestan kolonların yaşadığı) karşı karşıya geldi. Galip gelenlerin yazdığı tarih bu çatışmayı köleliğe karşı özgürlük kavgası olarak sunuyor ki bu propagandadan başka bir şey değildir (Güney Devletleri, Britanya monarşisiyle bir ittifak anlaşmasına vardıklarında köleliği kaldırmışlardır). Dolayısıyla da, Püritenlerle İngiliz tahtının çatışması yeniden karşımıza çıkar ki bazı tarihçiler bu yüzden burada bir « Üçüncü Britanya İç Savaşından » söz ederler.
XXinci yüzyıl sırasında, Başbakan David Llyod George’un « konformist olmayan Hıristiyanlarıyla » Birleşik Krallıkta yeniden ortaya çıkmasını saymazsak, Britanya uygarlığının bu iç çatışması bitmiş gibidir. Bunlar İrlanda’yı bölerler ve Filistin’de « Yahudi ulusal yurdunu » yaratmaya girişirler.
Ne olursa olsun, Richard Nixon’un danışmanlarından biri olan Kevin Philips, bu iç savaşlarla ilgili geniş kapsamlı bir tez hazırlar, sorunların hiçbirinin çözülmediği tespitinde bulunur ve bir dördüncü çatışmanın duyurusunu yapar [ 1 ].
40 yıldan beri kitlesel olarak Cumhuriyetçilere oy veren Kalvinist Kilisesinin müritleri, artık Demokratları destekliyor.
Bayan Clinton’un ABD’nin yeni Başkanı olacağından ya da Bay Trump seçildiğinde, hızlı bir şekilde ortadan kaldırılacağından şüphe etmiyorum. Ama birkaç ay içerisinde, geridöndürülemez bir demografik gelişim temelinde seçmenler topluluğunun yeniden şekillenişine tanık oluyoruz. Halkın dörtte birinden fazlasını bir araya getiren Püriten kökenli Kiliseler, Demokratların kampına doğru kayıyor. Modelleri tarihsel bir kaza gibi görünüyor. Güney Afrika’da ortadan kalktı ve ne ABD’de, ne de İsrail’de daha çok hayatta kalması mümkün değil.
Başkanlık seçiminin ötesinde, ABD toplumu hızla gelişmek ya da yeniden parçalanmak durumundadır. Gençliğin Püriten vaizlerin nüfuzunu kitlesel olarak reddettiği bir ülkede, eşitlik sorununu başka yöne kaydırmak artık mümkün değildir. Püritenler tüm insanların eşit olduğu ama eşdeğer olmadığı bir toplum öngörüyorlar. Lord Cromwell İngilizler için bir cumhuriyet istiyordu, ama ancak Papa yanlısı İrlandalıları katlettikten sonra. Böylece bugün ABD’de bütün yurttaşlar kanun önünde eşittir, ama aynı yasal metinlerden hareketle, mahkemeler aynı cinayet ya da suçlarla ilgili beyazlar için hafifletici nedenler bulurken sistematik olarak siyahları mahkum etmektedir. Ve eyaletlerin çoğunda, hız ihlali için dahi olsa ceza alınması durumunda, oy kullanma hakkı kaldırılıyor. Bunun sonucunda, beyaz ve siyahlar eşittirler, ama bazı eyaletlerde, siyahi insanların birçoğunun aynı şekilde oy kullanma hakkı elinden alınmıştır. Bu düşüncenin paradigması, dış politikada, Filistin’de « iki Devletli çözümdür »; eşit, ama özellikle eşdeğer olmayan.
Rahip Carter, Reagan, Bush (Sr. ve Jr.’in her ikisi de Pilgrimlerin torunlarıdırlar), Clinton ve Obama yönetimlerini, kendi ülkelerinin ideallerine aykırı bir biçimde Vahhabiliği ve bugün de IŞİD’i desteklemeye Püriten düşüncesi itmiştir.
Geçmişte Pilgrimler, Plymouth ve Boston’de ABD’nin ortak hafızasında idealleştirilen topluluklar oluşturdular. Oysa tarihçiler biçimseldirler, « Yeni İsrail »’i oluşturduklarını söylüyorlardı ve « Musa’nın Yasasını » seçerler. Tapınaklarına Haç değil ama Yasanın Masalarını yerleştirirler. Zaten Hıristiyan olmalarına rağmen, Yahudi yazmalarına İncil’den daha çok önem veriyorlardı. Kadınlarını başlarını örtmeye zorladılar ve bedensel cezaları yeniden gündeme getirdiler.

7850,Trump Budget Nominee Did Not Pay Taxes for Employee - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —     Donald J. Trump’s choice for White House budget director failed to pay more than $15, 000 in payroll taxes for a household employee, he admitted in a statement to the Senate Budget Committee, the sort of tax compliance issue that has derailed cabinet nominees in the past. In a questionnaire provided to the committee, Representative Mick Mulvaney, a conservative from South Carolina and vocal proponent of fiscal restraint noted, “I have come to learn during the confirmation review process that I failed to pay FICA and federal and state unemployment taxes on a household employee for the years  . ” Mr. Mulvaney said he had subsequently paid more than $15, 000 in taxes and awaits the state tax bill, as well as penalties and interests. His confirmation hearing before the committee is scheduled for Jan. 24. The employee was a babysitter hired when Mr. Mulvaney and his wife had triplets in 2000. Attempts to reach Mr. Mulvaney’s office for comment were not successful. A spokesman for the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, said he would have no immediate comment. Mr. Mulvaney will almost certainly be asked about the issue at his hearing, and Republicans on the committee are most likely aware of its existence. The situation is similar to that of former Senator Tom Daschle, who in 2009 was forced to withdraw his nomination as President Obama’s choice to lead the Health and Human Services Department. During Mr. Daschle’s confirmation process, it was revealed that he had paid roughly $140, 000 in back taxes related to a car and driver provided to him by a former employer, and to some consulting income. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, who is now the   Republican in the Senate, said at the time that he would not support Mr. Daschle’s nomination, calling his tax issue “a little too much to swallow. ” Mr. Daschle’s withdrawal came two weeks after Timothy F. Geithner, Mr. Obama’s first Treasury secretary, was nearly knocked out with his announcement that he had failed to pay $25, 000 in payroll taxes while working at the International Monetary Fund. In a statement, John Czwartacki, a spokesman for the Trump transition team, said: “Nobody is more qualified and more prepared to rein in Washington spending and fight for taxpayers than Mick Mulvaney. Congressman Mulvaney raised the issue surrounding the care of his premature triplets immediately upon being tapped for this position, and has taken the appropriate   measures. The administration fully stands behind Representative Mulvaney. ” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a statement: “Senator Tom Daschle did the same thing and Republicans insisted that that disqualified him from becoming H. H. S. secretary. We say to our colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle, What’s good for the goose is good for the gander. If Tom Daschle couldn’t become a cabinet member for not paying taxes for a household employee, the same standard ought to apply to Mick Mulvaney. ” Two potential attorneys general under President Bill Clinton  —   Zoe E. Baird and Kimba Wood  —   lost their chances to become the first women to hold that office their nominations were pulled after revelations of   nanny issues. The revelation of Mr. Mulvaney’s tax issue will test the Senate, which has greeted tax issues of past nominees with bipartisan denunciations. The process of confirming Mr. Trump’s nominees has quickly been somewhat stymied because of a slow vetting process. Several hearings were delayed because the nominees had not been cleared by the agency charged with unraveling potential conflicts of interest. Nominees undergo a rigorous screening by the F. B. I. and must clear the Office of Government Ethics to unravel any potential conflicts of interest that could present future legal problems. What is more, many committees have their own screening process.",0
7851,"50 Years After Apollo Disaster, Memorial for 3 Men, and for Era - The New York Times","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.  —   Back in his days as a test pilot at   Air Force Base in Ohio, Gus Grissom had a message for his wife, Betty. “If I die, have a party,” he said. Betty Grissom never did have that party. But on Friday, as for the past 25 years, there was a solemn observance at the   memorial for her husband and two crewmates who were killed in the Apollo 1 disaster. Mr. Grissom, Roger Chaffee and Ed White died in a flash fire that engulfed their capsule atop a Saturn 1B rocket during a routine training operation on Jan. 27, 1967. Mr. Grissom was 40. Ms. Grissom, 89, was at the memorial again on Friday, wearing a denim jacket with a large Apollo 1 patch in patriotic colors. She joined old friends, family members, and NASA officials and veterans, among them Charlie Duke, who took part in the Apollo 16 moon landing. With the recent deaths of the astronauts John Glenn and Eugene A. Cernan and the sea changes in Washington, the gathering felt like a memorial for an era as well as for three men. At the ceremony, candles were lit for the dead astronauts by members of their families, including Cody Grissom, 22, a pilot, who is completing his last year at his grandfather’s alma mater, Purdue University. Representatives from the Navy, the Air Force and NASA spoke, and a Navy bugler performed taps after the sun went down. “It is important that Challenger and Columbia are remembered, and that Apollo 1 is remembered,” said the Kennedy Space Center director, Robert D. Cabana. “And that we take those steps that create an environment where everyone has a voice, that we really work to ensure the success and the safety of the crew as we continue to explore and move beyond our planet. ” Ms. Grissom said this year’s ceremony was probably her last. It coincided with a NASA tribute exhibit about Apollo 1 at the Kennedy Space Center, which she, like many, thought was long overdue. “I thought this is probably a good time to call it quits with them finally getting a memorial of some kind,” she said. This year’s event drew around 150 people, one of the largest crowds ever for a memorial that few people knew of unless they were related to an astronaut or were a   space fan. “We need heroes today, and these were heroes,” said one such fan, Robert Pearlman, an American space historian. People from all over the world traveled to the memorial, among them Masato Maruyama, 65, who has come for the past 10 years from Tokyo. He brought a big bottle of sake to share with the family and friends. Mr. Maruyama said Mr. Grissom reminded him of his father, who was in the Japanese Navy. He remembers just where he was when the fire occurred. “It’s not the distance  —   it’s in here,” he said, pointing to his heart. “I’m just one of hundreds of thousands. Apollo counted a lot not just for Americans, but human beings. ” Although the launch platform is crumbling like a concrete Greek ruin, and stenciled with an eerie “Abandon in Place,” the site was decorated with three     floral wreaths brought by the Grissom family. A bagpiper stood ready and Ms. Grissom sat front and center. She was treated as the event’s grande dame as people lined up to speak with her. “I want you to know it is such an honor,” said Shirley Brown, whose shop provided the wreaths. “The first time you walked in my shop and said, ‘I’m Betty Grissom,’ I thought Queen Elizabeth had walked in. You never went down, you fought all the way. ” “I never quit,” Ms. Grissom agreed, in the kind of taciturn response her astronaut husband might have offered. Many years after the accident, two space buffs, Bob Castro and Mark Pinchell, started going out to the site of the fire, which is on Air Force property, in their own private tribute. One year, they bumped into each other, and came up with the idea of doing something bigger. “Just two space geeks who were going to Pad 34 and doing their own separate ceremonies,” said Mark Grissom, 63, who was 13 when his father died. “They met at the pad and decided to invite the families. ” The Grissoms were the first astronaut family to become involved. Early on, car headlights provided the only illumination. While other astronauts and families have been absent over the years, this year Roger Chaffee’s wife, Martha, and her daughter, Sheryl, attended, along with Ed White’s daughter Bonnie. “This is the families’ memorial,” said Sonny Witt, the 45th Space Wing director of operations for Division 1 at Patrick Air Force Base, who helps provide the access. “Not the Air Force and not NASA. They are the ones that lost the husbands and brothers and fathers. Mistakes were made, and they paid the price. ” When the three Apollo 1 astronauts were trapped in their burning capsule on Pad 34, a cry for help, believed to be from Mr. Chaffee, a rookie astronaut, came over the communications system: “Hey, we’re burning up. ” Mr. White tried opening the hatch, but caught within the highly combustible pure oxygen atmosphere, the crew suffocated. “I don’t want any of this forgotten,” Ms. Grissom said. “Gus Grissom was a human being. ” Mr. Grissom, often seen as an underdog, was a favorite astronaut of many Americans. He infamously “screwed the pooch”  —   as Tom Wolfe put it in “The Right Stuff”  —   when the hatch blew on his Mercury capsule, causing it to sink it in the Atlantic upon splashdown. Mr. Grissom was initially blamed, and the sunken capsule cost the astronaut couple a visit to the Kennedy White House. In the end, he was cleared of responsibility. Ms. Grissom, who lives in Houston by herself, and Mr. Grissom were high school sweethearts in Mitchell, Ind. Her life always revolved around him. She worked as a   telephone operator for Indiana Bell, putting her husband through college at Purdue, where he studied mechanical engineering on the G. I. Bill. He was selected as an astronaut after flying an   Sabre on over a hundred combat missions in Korea. Death was always on the horizon for the wives. The program lost seven astronauts on the path to the moon, largely as a result of crashes of the   the supersonic jet trainer airplanes the astronauts flew back and forth from where they lived in Houston and Cape Canaveral. When the news of the Apollo 1 accident came to her, delivered by a NASA doctor when she was at a friend’s home for a weekly poker night, Ms. Grissom told her friend that she had “already died 100, 000 deaths” living with her husband. Martha Chaffee, the youngest space widow, slept with the flag that hung over her husband’s coffin at Arlington. Pat White killed herself years later, a weekend before she and some of the other wives had a reunion planned, her friends said. The space widows felt rejected after their husbands died, while still living in the closely knit community of astronaut families in the “space burbs” by the Manned Spacecraft Center (later the Johnson Space Center) in Houston, nicknamed “Togethersville” because of its exclusivity. In the late ’60s, Ms. Grissom became a black sheep among the astronaut community. She was the first of the widows to sue NASA’s largest contractor, North American Rockwell, over the construction of the capsule, and she inspired Ms. Chaffee and Ms. White to do the same. Ms. Grissom eventually settled for $350, 000. On Friday, as Ms. Grissom was helped off the old launching pad, professional and amateur stargazers pointed out the International Space Station passing in the sky above, along with Venus and a shooting star. Back in the car and about to be driven to a celebratory dinner for friends and family at a hotel in nearby Cocoa Beach, she turned to her son and said, “The stars are out tonight. ” Earlier, she spoke of how her husband’s sacrifice helped pave the way for the missions to come like the Apollo 11 moonwalk her husband never got to see. Still, she said, “I’m pretty sure he got to the moon before they did. ” She added: “Of course he didn’t make it, but in spirit I think he was already there. ”",0
7852,Don’t Let Them Tell You You’re Not at the Center of the Universe - The New York Times,"Actually: The Big Bang didn’t happen at a place it happened at a time. “Where did the Big Bang happen?” I am often asked, as if the expansion of the universe was like a hand grenade going off and the solar system and our Milky Way galaxy were shards sent flying. The universe didn’t start at a place, it started at a time, namely 13. 8 billion years ago, according to the best cosmological data. It’s been expanding ever since  —   not into space because the universe by definition fills all space already, so much as into time, which as far as we know is  . It is true that everything we can see now, out to 13. 8 billion years of   time, was once the size of a grapefruit, buzzing with hideous energies, but that grapefruit was already part of an infinite ensemble with no edge, except one made up of time. When we look out, we look into the past, the farther we look, the more deeply into the past we see. At the center is the present. Alas there is no direction in which we can look to see the future  —   except perhaps into our own hearts and dreams. All we know is right now. So where is the center of the universe? Right here. Yes, you are the center of the universe. When Albert Einstein married space and time in his theory of relativity back in 1905, he taught us that our eyes are time machines. Nothing can go faster than the speed of light, the cosmic speed limit, and so all information comes to us, to the present, from the past. And so Einstein’s relativity teaches us that the center of the universe is everywhere and nowhere. It is the present, surrounded by concentric shells of the past. History racing at you at 186, 282 miles per second, the speed of light, the speed of all information. Your eyes are the cockpit of a time machine, filmy wet orbs looking in the only direction any of us can ever look: backward. Everything we see or feel or hear  —   now that gravitational waves have been discovered  —   took some time to get here, and so comes to our senses from the past. The moon, hovering over the horizon, is an image of light that left its cratered surface traveling at the speed of light a second and a half ago. The sun that burns your skin is eight minutes and nineteen seconds in the past. The Jupiter we see, glowering orange at the zenith these nights, is about 414 million miles out there as of this writing, or 37 minutes away in the past. The light from the center of the Milky Way, hiding behind the thick star clouds and dust lanes of Sagittarius, takes 26, 000 years to get here. While it was on the way the first primitive ice age villages grew into skyscrapered metropolises. Your lover, brushing your lashes with his or her breath, is a nanosecond gone. This is more than poetry. Mathematically, in Einsteinian terms, all the information and history available at any one place in the universe is known as a light cone. Everybody has one and everybody’s is slightly different, which means in effect that everyone’s universe is a little different. There will always be some piece of information that has reached your lover but not yet you, let alone E. T. over in the next galaxy. It gives a new definition to being alone with your thoughts. As T. S. Eliot put it: As a result every spot in the universe is unique. There will always be a piece of it you haven’t seen yet and a piece that you have seen but that nobody else has. There is no place to stand if you want to claim universal knowledge. We all need each other in order to overlap our knowledge. We don’t have to stay in our prisons. Working together and sharing, we can know everything. Or as Bob Dylan once put it, “I’ll let you be in my dreams, if I can be in yours. ”",0
7853,VE Day: 72 Years Since 1945 Allied Victory over Germany in Europe,"The 72nd anniversary of the end of the European War  —   well known as ‘VE Day’ in Britain and the United States  —    passed mostly unnoticed today, but saw solemn commemorations in France where   Macron joined outgoing premier Hollande in a wreath laying ceremony. [The official end of fighting in Europe brought to an end one of the major theatres of combat in the Second World War, and was followed by a cessation of hostilities in the Pacific with VJ day some three months later. One of the most monumentally destructive wars in human history, the Second World War was born out of an unbalanced   War settlement which left Europe vulnerable to disruption.  In the wake of the war, the nations of Western Europe united with the United States and others to form the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, NATO, which faced off against former   ally Soviet Russia in the Cold War, and brought a generation of stability, peace, and growth to Europe.

7854,DOJ Budget Ramps Up Funding for Eminent Domain ’Land Acquisition’ in Potential Effort to Clear Way for Border Wall - Breitbart,"Tuesday’s Department of Justice budget proposal asks Congress for $1. 8 million to “meet litigation, acquisition, and appraisal demands during the construction along the border between Mexico and the United States. ”[The money will be used to devote 20 new staff members, including 12 attorneys, to the Environmental and Natural Resources Division’s Land Acquisition Section (LAS). This small section of the DOJ handles litigation that arises when the federal government uses its “eminent domain” power to seize land for public projects.  The new money and staff is be devoted to the southern border, where according to an overview released by the Department, just two LAS attorneys are currently working with a budget of only $329, 000. The proposal represents a   increase in attorneys and a   increase in funding for LAS assistance with construction along the border. No “wall” is mentioned in the budget proposal, and DOJ officials were reluctant to confirm that the massive scaling up at LAS was specifically linked to the wall. “We do not have border wall money in the Department of Justice budget,” Assistant Attorney General Lee Lofthus, head of DOJ’s Justice Management Division, assured reporters at a press conference announcing the proposal. Wall construction and the decision to purchase of the land necessary for it is not typically seen as a part of the DOJ’s mission. Tuesday’s budget proposals for border security and the Department of Homeland Security do, in fact, ask Congress for billions of dollars in funding increases. Up to $1. 6 billion is claimed to be devoted to “a physical wall” along the southern border. A Department of Justice press official confirmed that decisions as to which land to acquire for border security purposes would most likely be made at DHS. Defense of federal land acquisition, on the other hand, is squarely the Department of Justice’s responsibility. The LAS handles the wide variety of lawsuits and legal complications that can arise when the government purchases and condemns land for any major federal project. By all estimations, any border wall would have significant land use implications. Asked by Breitbart News if there was any specific issue compelling the department to request the addition of ten new LAS lawyers on the southern border, Assistant Attorney General Lofthus said that there was not, and made clear it was a precautionary measure based on the possibility of any number of challenges  —   eminent domain, environmental, etc.  —   that could have been made to the administration’s efforts on border security. Other   immigration enforcement requests for DOJ included $75 million to fund the 75 new immigration judges and their nearly 400 staff attorneys and support staff previously announced to deal with the massive backlog of pending removal cases. This will represent a nearly 25% increasing in federal immigration judges at the Executive Office for Immigration Review. The first of this new wave of immigration judges was sworn in earlier this month. For the nation’s criminal courts, the DOJ is asking for $7. 2 to deploy 70 new assistant United States attorneys to handle exclusively immigration cases. New guidelines issued by Attorney General Jeff Sessions mandate far lower thresholds for referral for felony prosecution for illegal   and harboring of illegal aliens than under previous administrations. Along with the rest of the Trump administration’s budget proposal, it now lies in the hands of Congress to approve the Department of Justice’s requests for immigration enforcement. The current continuing funding resolution expires in September.",0

7856,"Trump Tells G.O.P. It’s Now or Never, Demanding House Vote on Health Bill - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   President Trump issued an ultimatum on Thursday to recalcitrant Republicans to fall in line behind a broad health insurance overhaul or see their opportunity to repeal the Affordable Care Act vanish, demanding a Friday vote on a bill that appeared to lack a majority to pass. The demand, issued by his budget director, Mick Mulvaney, in an evening meeting with House Republicans, came after a marathon day of negotiating at the White House and in the Capitol in which Mr. Trump  —   who has boasted of his   prowess  —   fell short of selling members of his own party on the health plan. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan emerged from the session and announced curtly that Mr. Trump would get his wish for a vote on Friday. Mr. Ryan refused to answer reporters’ questions about whether he expected the measure to pass. Although the House Republicans’   meeting became a cheerleading session for the bill, their leaders braced for a showdown on the floor, knowing they were likely to be at least a handful of votes short of a majority for the health insurance bill and would need to muscle their colleagues to the last to prevail. Some conservatives were still concerned that the bill was too costly and did not do enough to roll back federal health insurance mandates. Moderates and others, meanwhile, were grappling with worries of their states’ governors and fretted that the loss of benefits would be too much for their constituents to bear. Mr. Ryan had earlier postponed the initial House vote that was scheduled for Thursday to coincide with the seventh anniversary of the Affordable Care Act’s signing. Mr. Trump confronted the possibility of a humiliating loss on the first significant legislative push of his presidency. At a White House meeting with members of the   Freedom Caucus earlier on Thursday, Mr. Trump had agreed to the conservatives’ demands to strip federal health insurance requirements for basic benefits such as maternity care, emergency services, mental health and wellness visits from the bill. But that was not enough to placate the faction, part of the reason that Thursday’s vote was placed on hold. As House leaders struggled to negotiate with holdouts in the hopes of rescheduling the vote, Mr. Trump sent senior officials to the Capitol with a blunt message: He would agree to no additional changes, and Republicans must either support the bill or resign themselves to leaving President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement in place. “We have a great bill, and I think we have a good chance, but it’s only politics,” Mr. Trump said earlier Thursday, as it was becoming clear that his negotiating efforts had failed to persuade enough members of his party to back the plan  —   which was years in the making  —   to repeal and replace the health law. Privately, White House officials conceded that competing Republican factions were each demanding changes that could doom the effort, placing the measure in peril and Mr. Trump’s chances of succeeding at a   legislative deal in jeopardy. With some of its demands in place, the Freedom Caucus ratcheted up its requests, insisting on a repeal of all regulatory mandates in the Affordable Care Act, including the prohibition on excluding coverage for   medical conditions and lifetime coverage caps. Mr. Trump, who has touted his negotiating skills and invited the label “the closer” as the vote approached, was receiving a painful reality check about the difficulty of governing, even with his own party in power on Capitol Hill. “Guys, we’ve got one shot here,” he told members of the Freedom Caucus at a meeting in the Cabinet Room, according to a person present in the room who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the meeting was private. “This is it  —   we’re voting now. ” “The choice is yes or no,” Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas and a member of the Freedom Caucus, said on Thursday night. “I’m not going to vote no to keep Obamacare. That’d be a stupid damn vote. ” Others were unconvinced. Having secured Mr. Trump’s acquiescence to eliminate the requirement that insurers offer “essential health benefits,” members of the Freedom Caucus pressed their advantage. While they did not specify precisely which regulations they wanted to eliminate, the section they wanted to gut requires coverage for   health conditions, allows individuals to remain on their parents’ health care plans up to age 26, bars insurers from setting different rates for men and women, prohibits annual or lifetime limits on benefits, and requires insurers to spend at least 80 percent of premium revenue on medical care. “We’re committed to stay here until we get it done,” said Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the Freedom Caucus. “So whether the vote is tonight, tomorrow or five days from here, the president will get a victory. ” He said 30 to 40 Republicans planned to vote “no” House leaders can afford to lose only 22 in order to pass the bill. But for every concession Mr. Trump made to appease critics on the right, he lost potential    supporters in the middle, including members of the centrist Tuesday Group who had balked at the bill’s Medicaid cuts and slashed insurance benefits. Moderate Republicans in that group went to the White House on Thursday but emerged unmoved in their opposition. “There’s a little bit of a balancing act,” conceded Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. Representative Leonard Lance, Republican of New Jersey, said he still opposed the bill because he did not believe it would give people “complete and affordable access” to health insurance. At the same time, a new estimate of the bill’s cost and its impact on health coverage further soured the picture for wavering lawmakers. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on Thursday issued a report on the revised version of the health care bill showing that it would cost more than the original version but would not cover more people. The report said the bill, like the original version, would result in 24 million fewer Americans having health insurance in 2026 than under current law. But recent changes to the bill, made through a series of amendments introduced on Monday, would cut its deficit savings in half. Instead of reducing the deficit by $337 billion, the new version of the bill would save only $150 billion over the decade. The budget office did not consider the effects of various additional changes that remain under negotiation, including eliminating benefit requirements and other health insurance regulations. A Quinnipiac University national poll found that voters disapproved of the Republican plan by lopsided margins, with 56 percent opposed, 17 percent supportive and 26 percent undecided. The measure did not even draw support among a majority of Republicans 41 percent approved, while 24 percent were opposed. President Trump appealed to supporters to weigh in, assuring them in a video on Twitter, “Go with our plan. It’s going to be terrific. ” The chaotic process that unfolded on Thursday exposed Republicans to criticism that they were moving recklessly in a desperate bid to get their plan passed. Representative Raúl Labrador, Republican of Idaho and a Freedom Caucus member, said the party’s leaders had tried to ram through the measure over their members’ objections. He panned what he described as a “brute force” strategy that resembled the approach of former Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio. “It’s better to get it right than to get it fast,” Mr. Labrador said. It was not clear that the changes that Mr. Trump has agreed to and those being demanded could survive. Under the strict budget rules being used to advance the bill, changes to the Affordable Care Act must affect federal spending or revenues. Regulatory measures that affect private health policies, not government programs like Medicaid, are highly likely to be challenged by Senate Democrats. If the Senate parliamentarian rules in the Democrats’ favor, those changes in the House would be stripped from the bill. The emerging power of the Freedom Caucus, a group that has been historically marginalized in policy making but a thorn in the side of leadership, is one of the surprises of the rushed health care debate. The group has been empowered by the addition of Mr. Mulvaney to the senior White House staff, and Mr. Trump’s disengagement from policy details, coupled with his intense desire to score a win after a rocky start to his presidency. Mr. Obama stepped into the fray on Thursday with a lengthy defense of his law on the seventh anniversary of its signing, and a call for bipartisan improvements. “I’ve always said we should build on this law, just as Americans of both parties worked to improve Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid over the years,” he wrote in a mass email to followers. “So if Republicans are serious about lowering costs while expanding coverage to those who need it, and if they’re prepared to work with Democrats and objective evaluators in finding solutions that accomplish those goals  —   that’s something we all should welcome. ” The Affordable Care Act requires insurers to provide “essential health benefits” in 10 broad categories, including maternity care, mental health care, addiction treatment, preventive services, emergency services and rehabilitative services. Mr. Spicer defended the removal of the “essential health benefits” regulations, saying that it would accomplish Mr. Trump’s stated goal of reducing health care costs. “Part of the reason that premiums have spiked out of control is because under Obamacare there were these mandated services that had to be included,” Mr. Spicer said. Family planning groups and advocates for women’s rights criticized Republican plans to roll back these requirements. “Paul Ryan and his House members are willing to sell out the moms of America to pass this bill,” said Dawn Laguens, an executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Conservatives say the mandates, as interpreted in rules issued by the Obama administration, add to the costs of health insurance and make it difficult for insurers to offer   options to meet consumers’ needs. Democrats say that the purpose of insurance is to share risk, and that without federal requirements, insurers would once again offer   policies. Before the Affordable Care Act took effect, maternity coverage was frequently offered as an optional benefit, or rider, for a hefty additional premium.",0
7857,Even Massive Influx in Immigrants Can’t Offset Exodus from Blue Cities - Breitbart,"Major   cities need to import yet more immigrant residents to replace the Americans fleeing from those cities’ crowded,   and expensive districts, according to a Bloomberg article. [The government imports 1 million new legal immigrants per year, even as 4 million young Americans turn 18, but according to Bloomberg:  Immigration to the U. S. has failed to make up for the number of residents leaving New York, Los Angeles and Chicago  —   the nation’s top three metropolitan areas. Chicago  —   beset by crime, economic and budgetary woes and high taxes  —   is the net exodus leader among 100 metro areas tracked by Bloomberg using Census Bureau data for the year through July 1, 2016. An average 245 local residents left the Windy City each day compared with the arrival of 71 foreigners. Census doesn’t inquire about a person’s citizenship status  …     For the nation’s third   metropolitan area, foreign immigration “is the only offset we’ve got and it would be tragic to lose,” said Diane Swonk, chief executive and founder of DS Economics in Chicago.  Rising government taxes, rental and housing prices in the   cities help push ambitious young Americans towards southern cities, such as Dallas, Austin, Tampa, Orlando, Atlanta, and Charlotte.  Some other coastal cities are also gaining population from arriving Americans, principally Seattle and Portland. But immigration is so high in Miami that it is pushing out Americans, just like in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago.  Young people are leaving the crowded cities, in part, because elite jobs and large immigrant populations combine to push up property prices and taxes, while also holding down the salaries and wages needed to start families. “In the New York metropolitan area,   Manhattan prospers while old factory towns such as Paterson, New Jersey, and Waterbury, Connecticut, languish   …     While Los Angeles gained more than 54, 000 international migrants, it lost more than 87, 000 people due to domestic migration,” said Bloomberg. That is bad news for conservatives in those states because GOP candidates tend to sweep districts with where   voters can afford to set up homes. Those trends were reflected in the 2016 election, where Trump won 26 of 27    states. As more Americans migrate southwards, they are likely to bring more   voters to their new districts, which help offset the huge immigrant inflow of   residents. Read the article here.

7858,A Republican Wins in Kansas. It’s Still a Loss for the G.O.P. - The New York Times,"This season’s special congressional elections are being heralded as a test of whether newly energized Democrats will fare better with an unpopular Republican president. So far, the Democrats are passing the test. On Tuesday, Republicans won an unexpectedly close race in Kansas’ Fourth Congressional District. The Republican Ron Estes won by seven points over James Thompson, even though President Trump won the district by 27 points in November. No Democrat holds a House seat as Republican as this one, so it’s startling that the seat was even competitive. In general, it’s a mistake to read too much into a single special election. They are more prone to odd results. That’s because there’s less time for recruitment,   or even opposition research. There isn’t a national campaign going on at the same time. The turnout is often low and variable. But the Kansas result is not a great sign for the Republicans, and it’s hard to dismiss. Ultimately, special elections are still elections. They reflect the national political environment in nearly the same way as regularly scheduled contests. There just happen to be a few more outlying results. In theory, if you had enough special elections you could make a pretty good inference about the national political environment. There aren’t usually enough of them in a cycle to make such a conclusion, though. Instead, every special election provides a small and imperfect bit of information about the overall national picture. The small and imperfect lesson of Tuesday’s special election in Kansas is that the Republicans might be in quite a bit of trouble. Mr. Estes’s   victory is extremely poor for this district, whether under politically neutral circumstances or an environment deeply unfavorable to the president’s party. Even with Mr. Trump’s approval rating around 40 percent, Mr. Estes should still have been considered a    favorite in the district. There are extenuating circumstances, as there often are. The Kansas Republican Party is deeply unpopular under the leadership of the governor, Sam Brownback, and Mr. Estes is the state treasurer in Mr. Brownback’s administration. Details like this always make it hard to pinpoint expectations for a single congressional election  —   especially in races without an incumbent. Nonetheless, it is a stretch to argue that the entirety of the difference between Mr. Estes’s result and what you would expect under politically neutral circumstances can be attributed to his connection to Mr. Brownback. The case to dismiss the Kansas result will be better if Republicans fare well in coming special elections. But Democrats have already been doing well in state legislative special elections, in part because of strong turnout. The Democrats also look to be competitive in a May congressional election in Montana, and will most likely outperform Hillary Clinton’s share of the vote there. Win or lose, the Democrats are competitive in the special election in Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District (the election is next Tuesday, with a possible runoff in June). Republican struggles are to be expected the party has full control of government and its president is unpopular. These are the circumstances that often end in a   wave election, like the ones that swept Democrats into power in 2006 and out of the House in 2010. We might well be heading for another. At a minimum, the Kansas result is fully consistent with that possibility.",0
7859,Politicisation of Terrorism at the BRICS Summit | New Eastern Outlook,"Region: Southern Asia The fight against terrorism is increasingly a key issue for all countries, and it is quite natural that it has drawn the attention of the participants of the 8th BRICS summit. However, India has a particular interest in focusing attention on it after terrorists from the radical group “Jaish-e-Mohammed” (“Army of Mohammed”) committed attacks on the Indian infantry battalion garrison near the town of Uri, 10 km from the Line of Control in Kashmir on September 18th. India held Pakistan responsible for the deaths of 18 Indian soldiers, and claimed that it supports these terrorists. On Twitter, Rajnath Singh, the Home Minister, described the attack as a cross-border invasion of militants trained and armed by Pakistan, and called it a “terrorist state.” Speaking at the 71st session of the UN General Assembly, the representative of India raised the issue of Pakistan’s support for cross-border terrorism, which has both a regional and global impact. India responded to the terrorist attack with surgical strikes on their bases in the Pakistan-controlled part of Kashmir, which destroyed seven militant hideouts and killed more than 35 extremists. Despite protests from Pakistan, the world community has not condemned India’s actions. Relations between the two countries have entered a new round of confrontation that has also involved the BRICS countries. The problem of terrorism brought up by Narendra Modi at the summit (which was condemned by Pakistan) turned out not to have such a simple solution as it affects the interests of other members of the organization, especially Russia and China. At the opening of the meeting, N. Modi said: “In our region, terrorism poses a grave threat to peace, security and development. Tragically the mothership of terrorism is a country in India’s neighbourhood. Terror modules around the world are linked to this mothership. BRICS must speak in one voice against this threat.” Earlier at the G20 meeting on September 5th, N. Modi called for the isolation and punishment of those who sponsor or support terrorism. Thus, when discussing the issue of terrorism, the BRICS countries de facto had to answer the question of who they support more: ­India or Pakistan in their struggle for leadership in South Asia. In spite of the Russia-Pakistan joint military exercises carried out shortly before the summit, N. Modi decided not only not to focus attention on this issue but put every effort into winning the support of Russia, which he called “old friend” (in Russian), and expressed his appreciation for the unequivocal condemnation of the terrorist attack on an army garrison in Uri. In the Joint Statement issued following the visit of Russian President Vladimir Putin to the Republic of India on October 15, 2016, the parties stressed the need to avoid the emergence of ‘safe havens’ for terrorists. Although the wording is rather vague and does not point directly to Pakistan as a ‘safe haven’ for terrorists, India was satisfied with it. While answering the journalists’ questions about military ties between Russia and Pakistan, the Deputy Foreign Minister of India Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said that Russia would not do anything that could harm India’s interests. There is full understanding between Russia and India. At the summit, this was actually proved by the strengthening of the military-technical and economic cooperation between the two countries. As for China, its position regarding the involvement of Pakistan in the terrorist attack to India, was announced even earlier, when it blocked the Indian proposal to include Masood Azhar, the leader of the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad, into the list of international terrorists, declared illegal by the UN. India considers him responsible for a series of terrorist attacks in the country including the attack of December 13, 2001 on the Parliament and of January 2, 2016 on the Pathankot Air Force Station. The issue, of course, is not about Masood Azhar. As it was officially announced, “China opposes all forms of terrorism. Double standards in combating terrorism should be abandoned. However, it is also unacceptable to use the fight against terrorism as a pretext for political purposes.” China is governed by purely pragmatic economic and political considerations underlying its rapprochement with Pakistan. Politically, China wants to use Pakistan as a geopolitical player, able to resist the growing influence of India in South Asia, and as a link with the Islamic world. Expansion of military cooperation between India and the United States also causes concern among the Chinese leadership as it could adversely affect China’s plans in the Indian Ocean. In addition to the geopolitical rivalry between China and India, the fact that India provides protection to the Dalai Lama is a further irritant to their relations. Pakistan is also of economic interest to China in terms of the realisation of its ambitious initiative, “One Belt, One Road”. Although N. Modi tried to persuade Xi Jinping that India and China, as ‘victims of terrorism’, should not conduct different approaches to counter it; the Chinese leader acknowledged the growing threat of terrorism and condemned all its forms in his 10-minute speech at the summit, however he limited himself to stating the need to strengthen dialogue on security and partnership in the region. China’s position on Masood Azhar remained unchanged. India’s attempts to politicise the issue of terrorism at the BRICS summit in order to isolate Pakistan politically as a country “which provides havens for terrorists and arms them” failed. The leaders of the five countries reasonably remained neutral and demonstrated political foresight, in order not to aggravate the situation in South Asia which may be used by the terrorists to enhance their activities.

В докладе, опубликованном в журнале Science Advances, ученые рассказали о создании трехмерного чипа, в котором для хранения памяти используются азото-замещенные вакансии — один из дефектов кристаллической решетки, возникающий при удалении атома углерода и его замене на атом азота. 
Именно это открывает широкие возможности для манипулирования спинами атомов азота, что учеными использовалось для записи информации при помощи лазера. Таким образом удалось обойти затруднение, связанное с ограничением плотности записываемой информации, налагаемым объемом дисковых носителей формата DVD и Blu-Ray. 
По словам американских физиков, плотность размещаемой информации на прототипе оказалась в сотни тысяч раз выше, чем на Blu-Ray. Также данные на чипе, как утверждают ученые, можно перезаписывать неограниченное число раз. 
Ранее Pravda. Ru писала, что Министерство обороны РФ и инновационный центр ""Сколково"" проявили интерес к проекту аспиранта Ижевского госуниверситета Михаила Шаронова. Молодой ученый представил проект создания инновационного носителя информации на основе нейронных сетей, который он назвал "" нейро-флешкой"" . 
Носитель можно использовать как традиционную карту памяти, которая имеет при этом расширенные возможности. Предполагается, что изделие может быть использовано как носитель информации устройств с искусственным интеллектом. 
На созданием ""Нейро-флешки"" помимо Шаронова работает команда из восьми разработчиков на базе кафедры вычислительной техники Ижевского госуниверситета имени Калашникова. 
26-летнему аспиранту было предложено стать резидентом инновационной территории. В свою очередь Минобороны РФ также проявило интерес к новой разработке, предложив Шаронову разработать техзадание с параметрами и местами возможного использования ""нейро-флешки"".

7861,"The Massacre That Wasn’t, and a Turning Point for ‘Fake News’ - The New York Times","There were so many instant internet spoofs making fun of Kellyanne Conway’s   “Bowling Green Massacre” that it’s hard to pick a favorite. Gun to my head, I’d say mine was the Twitter meme that showed a brass plaque dedicated to the names of the poor souls left for dead on Bowling Green’s grassy killing field. It was blank. That’s because there was no massacre there. No one died. No one even stubbed a toe. But there’s a good chance you know that by now: that the supposed terrorist attack in Bowling Green, Ky. that Ms. Conway, a top presidential adviser, invoked on MSNBC last week to justify President Trump’s contentious travel ban never happened. (And, no, the reason you had never heard of it was not because the Dishonest Media ignored the alleged carnage at the time of its   as Ms. Conway alleged.) The very fact that you probably know all this means that the “Bowling Green Massacre” may go down in the record of the Trump presidency as the first break in the “fake news” clouds that have cast such gloom over our fair and once (relatively) true republic. The same internet that enabled false stories to run unchecked through news feeds during the election year dispatched new white blood cells that attacked Ms. Conway’s “alternate facts” with “true facts” (a redundant term that I guess we’re stuck with for now). Their most effective attack was traditional reporting, in many cases from news organizations that have doubled down on   joined by newfangled memes that accentuate the truth. The Massacre That Wasn’t showed that while Facebook, Google and Twitter take steps to combat nefarious hoaxes, they are already playing host to an organic correction movement led by ordinary users who are crowdsourcing reality. It’s early. Vigilance, and continuing improvements throughout the news business, remain necessary. But the tale of the “massacre” could be the start of something new. Ms. Conway’s mention of the supposed attack  —   she was trying to justify Mr. Trump’s order that closed the border to citizens from seven predominately Muslim countries  —   slipped past the MSNBC host interviewing her, Chris Matthews. The corrective story broke the way stories have broken since God invented newspapers: A guy walked into a bar. In this case, the guy was Joe Sonka, a staff writer for the Insider Louisville website. He was having a beer at a bar called the Backdoor when “someone texted me that Conway said something insane,” Mr. Sonka told me. As a reporter  —   and onetime liberal blogger  —   in Kentucky for several years, Mr. Sonka knew what Ms. Conway seemed to be referring to when he went home to check it out. In 2011, the federal authorities arrested two Iraqi refugees who were later given prison sentences  —   one for life and one for 40 years  —   for plotting to send money and weapons to Al Qaeda in Iraq from their new homes in Bowling Green. The episode led to a slowdown in Iraqi immigration as the Obama administration reworked vetting procedures. The authorities never charged the men  —   one of whose fingerprints turned up on a roadside bomb in Iraq  —   with planning an attack on American soil. So at 9:34 p. m. on Thursday, Mr. Sonka wrote on Twitter: “@KellyannePolls says that 2 Iraqi refugees ‘were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre.’ (There was no such massacre. )” It made like a Trump tweet and roared through the broader news media sphere. “That tweet got 2. 4 million impressions,” Mr. Sonka said. “Pretty crazy. ” There was fast   by Vox, The Washington Post, CNN and Fox News (among many others) on conservative websites including Newsmax and Breitbart and, finally, in multiple references on “Saturday Night Live”  —   the ultimate sign that something has truly broken through. In the end, social media and journalistic scrutiny aligned with comedy to right a wrong pretty definitively. That it happened so organically showed that false “facts” might not always be the stubborn things so many people fear they are becoming. To understand how deep those fears go, just look at how “1984,” by George Orwell, has climbed up the   lists nearly 70 years after its debut. A “1984” stage adaptation is even heading to Broadway. (How about a Hamiltonesque musical: “2 and 2 make 5? Don’t give me that jive! ”) As the New York Times book critic Michiko Kakutani put it recently, Orwell’s classic seems “all too familiar,” capturing “a world in which the government insists that reality is not ‘something objective, external, existing in its own right. ’” Mr. Trump renews those fears every time he taps out social media messages like one he posted on Facebook on Thursday complimenting an article about a “ ” travel ban Kuwait was imposing on five nearby countries. As it happens, this was untrue, as even Sputnik International, the Russian   news service that  helped promote the story, acknowledged. Then there are the regular Trump Tweets calling CNN or The Times “fake news. ” The Bowling Green episode made such a splash because it played directly into concerns that the Trump administration would use untrue assertions to rally support for its agenda while denigrating as “dishonest” all the valid reporting pointing out the falsehoods. But even before the Bowling Green story fell apart so spectacularly, there were signs that what had worked well during the presidential campaign last year might not succeed when it comes to the   work of government. All the accusations of “fake news” and “dishonest media” couldn’t erase images of crying relatives stranded at airports  —   or the reporting on the legal questions surrounding Mr. Trump’s immigration order that led a judge to temporarily suspend it. No one in the administration could disappear the readouts from the president’s tense call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia leaked to The Washington Post. Nor could they reverse the effects of the reporting, some of it in The Times, about the potential business conflicts of his Army secretary nominee, Vincent Viola, who withdrew his name Friday night because of them. Ditto for the blowback over the whole Bowling Green yarn. Ms. Conway went on to admit her error, first on Twitter (where else?) and later in an interview with Howard Kurtz of Fox News, saying it was overblown because “I misspoke one word. ” (By that, she meant, apparently, that she should have said “Bowling Green terrorists” rather than “Bowling Green massacre. ”) And Ms. Conway was right when she wrote that “honest mistakes abound. ” After all, The Washington Post admitted over the weekend that several details in a column about internal White House strife over the president’s executive order on immigration were in dispute. A few days before that,   of Detroit walked back a report about a woman who died in Iraq supposedly after Mr. Trump’s new policy blocked her entry to the United States. Yet by the end of the weekend, it was Ms. Conway’s credibility that was receiving the most scrutiny (which she described as unfair and coming from “a lot of the haters” in her interview with Mr. Kurtz). Some, like the New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen, were calling upon the television networks to stop booking her. And CNN declined to have her as a guest on Sunday  —   in part because the Trump administration offered her in lieu of Vice President Mike Pence, but also because of what the network told me were “serious questions about her credibility. ” It would be a positive development if Ms. Conway embraced the idea that the term “honest mistakes” can apply to reporters, too, as it would be if everybody  —   including journalists  —   doubly committed to getting the facts right, without hysteria or misfires. Too optimistic? Well, if you had asked me a few days ago what I was planning to write about, I wouldn’t have said it would involve praising Twitter for keeping the national debate    —   and fun. Eventually, the Bowling Green memes led to mock street memorials with signs like “Never Remember. ” They had made it IRL, or “In Real Life,” which, the new administration is learning, has a way of sneaking up on you.",0
7862,Why Time Magazine’s Joe Klein Is So Wrong About Hillary Clinton,"Why Time Magazine’s Joe Klein Is So Wrong About Hillary Clinton Rebutting the absurd claims of my namesake. November 4, 2016 Joseph Klein 
Time Magazine’s Joe Klein has just penned an article entitled “Why Hillary Clinton Is the Only Choice to Keep America Great.” I feel duty bound to respond to at least the most absurd of the comments made by namesake and author of Primary Colors, the novel based on about Bill Clinton's first presidential campaign in 1992. 
The other Joe Klein laments that Hillary has been so “severely damaged in the course of the 30-year battering she’s received at the hands of extremists and the media.” Sorry, but Hillary’s wounds are self-inflicted. Her lies, greed and corruption go back decades and have now reached a crescendo with the dual scandals of her use of a private server for State Department business while she was Secretary of State and of the pay-for-play Clinton Foundation. 
“There is one part of Trump that is indisputably real: his ego,” the other Joe Klein wrote, as if Hillary were the epitome of humility and grace. 
“Those who would put Clinton’s failings in the same league as Trump’s depravities are delusional,” declared Klein. I agree with his statement, but for precisely the opposite reason that he advances. Trump did not abuse a public office for personal gain. He did not “hand pick” (Hillary’s word) an ambassador to serve in one of the most dangerous countries in the world and then never respond to his multiple requests for enhanced security, let alone pick up the phone and contact Ambassador Chris Stevens directly. ""The government was not able to save four lives, to keep four lives safe. How can you keep a country safe?"" asked Stevens’ former fiancé in a rhetorical question that Hillary would be unable to answer. Trump did not lie to the families of those slain in Benghazi, as Hillary did. Trump did not put national security at risk by using a private server for government e-mails in order to evade the Freedom of Information Act, as Hillary did. 
In short, anyone who thinks that Hillary’s proven record of recklessness, mendacity, and indifference is not more troubling by several orders of magnitude than Trump’s “depravities” is “delusional.” 
The other Joe Klein complains that Trump deals in “stereotypes” - “the blacks,” “the Hispanics,” “the Muslims,” “the women” and, yes, even “the veterans.” Yet much of Hillary’s pitch is gender-based. Elect her because she is a woman. And she attacks millions of people who support her opponent with vile epithets – “deplorable,” “racist,” “sexist,” “homophobic,” “xenophobic,” “Islamaphobic,” and – for good measure - “irredeemable.” 
The other Joe Klein charges that Trump is “about all that has gone wrong in our society, and nothing of what has gone right.” To paraphrase Bill Clinton, that would depend on what your definitions of “wrong” and “right” are. Is Hillary Clinton really right when she parrots Black Lives Matter’s stereotypical attacks on what she herself has characterized as white “privilege” and “systemic racism” in this country? Is she right when she leaps to conclusions about police “brutality” aimed against African-Americans before the evidence in specific cases is carefully examined? I don’t think so. 
Hillary also represents the political correctness and anti-religious bigotry of the secular left elite that many Americans believe are what truly have gone wrong in our society. At the Women in the World Summit last year, for example, Hillary said that in order to fully secure the reproductive rights of women, “deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed.” Hillary demeaned the sincerely held religious belief in the sanctity of life held by millions of Americans, reminiscent of President Obama’s contemptuous ‘clinging to religion’ quote back in 2008. 
Hillary’s key supporters and top aides have targeted the Catholic Church in particular for their notion of progressive reform. “There needs to be a Catholic Spring, in which Catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages dictatorship and the beginning of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the Catholic Church,” wrote Sandy Newman, president of Voices for Progress, in an e-mail to Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta. In response, Podesta picked up on the “spring” theme. He wrote, “We created Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good to organize for a moment like this. But I think it lacks the leadership to do so now. Likewise Catholics United. Like most Spring movements, I think this one will have to be bottom up.” 
When Time Magazine’s Joe Klein talks about what is right or wrong in American society, he should get out of his Washington D.C. bubble more often and actually speak with the American people about their day-to-day concerns. Even if Hillary Clinton ends up winning the election, the country will remain divided and she will have no mandate whatsoever to advance her progressive agenda.",0

7864,It’s Happening: They Are Shutting Down “Fake News” Websites to Punish Alt Media Hillary Opponents,"
This election proved the power of the Internet, and of the people who used their voices to the fullest.
But now, they will pay for it.
Will it mean the end of free speech?
Clearly, the deep state was not defeated overnight, but a loose network of hackers, researchers, alternative media outlets and long-term constituents of the “vast rightwing conspiracy” did manage to overpower the establishment’s choice of Hillary for president – and managed to embarrass the mainstream media while they were at it.
Even if they won’t get everything they wanted under President-elect Trump, they proved that a number of leading websites, and quite a few underground blogs, aren’t just promoting fringe views, but have become influential and often damning, even to the most high profile players. The Internet, and in particular, the alternative media, counterbalanced the mainstream effectively in 2016, and defeated their narrative.
And now, those who control the corporate-dominated flow of information want to end that competition.
As SHTF just reported :
What this year’s Presidential election has proven is that alternative media is a force to be reckoned with, and the establishment is scared shitless. 
But they won’t let it happen again.
[…] Today’s actions by Google and Facebook provide further evidence that the establishment media and Deep State politicians are preparing a digital lock down on any and all information that has not been approved by an as of yet unknown Truth Panel. 
A Facebook spokesman said it will explicitly ban sites that traffic in fake news from using the Facebook Audience Network… Google said it plans to prevent Google ads from being placed “on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information [as well as] sites that distribute false news.”
Though this effort may be subtle, there is every reason to think it will be brutal for free speech. It could prove to be the last laugh for Hillary Clinton, who blames her media opponents, Wikileaks hackers and even the failure of her own friends and presstitutes in the media for destroying her campaign with piles of Clinton family dirt.
Major outlets are now circulating a list of websites that have been deemed to be “fake news” and worthy of censorship that was compiled by… you guessed it… a random community college assistant professor trolling websites they’d like to have removed because they disagree with it.
As The Daily Sheeple reported , these sites comprise of many of the biggest alternative news sites on the Internet:
Like clockwork, floating around on the Internet now is a list of these “fake” sites authored by Melissa Zimdars, assistant professor of Media and Communications at Merrimack College.
She has deemed all of these sites as “false, misleading, clickbait-y, and/or satirical ‘news’ sources”.
Just to name a few examples, The Daily Sheeple, The Free Thought Project, Infowars, Breitbart, Lew Rockwell, Before Its News , Intellihub and even CoastToCoastAM.com were flagged as “fake news” sites that should be blocked, removed and/or censored.




As many online account holders know, there are many subtle ways of suppressing or blocking accounts, including demonitization that takes away an author’s incentive. That is what Google is attempting right now by denying ad sense revenue to sites they disapprove of, while they are still the masters of quietly de-listing sites in the algorithm so that fewer people will find their links – and those being targeted may never know what happened.
Meanwhile, the State Department just refused to recognized reporters from RT at a press conference. Spokesman John Kirby got testy over a question about Syria hospital bombings and retorted: “I’m not going to put Russia Today on the same level with the rest of you who are representing independent media outlets.” 
A major blowback is underway by the corporate, establishment media in retribution for their embarrassing failure in stage-managing a cakewalk election for Hillary Clinton. CNN’s parent company Time Warner (recently bought out by AT&T) was in the top ten of Hillary’s donor list , along with most of the largest Wall Street banks, Google’s parent company Alphabet, Inc. and Microsoft. It is no surprise to see many of these players acting in accordance to de-list dissenters.
Considering that Donald Trump has also teamed up with Facebook board member Peter Thiel to sue critical journalists , and have proposed new legislation to make defamation laws stronger, his administration may not prove much better, despite the strong backing for his campaign by the “alt right.”
Will these next few years be the most difficult yet for online free speech? There certainly seems to be a lot of pressure coming down from above.

7867,Mayans admit to four-year margin of error | NewsThump,"Friday 11 November 2016 by Tom Moore Mayans admit to four-year margin of error 
A Mayan spokesperson has this morning confirmed that their calendar has been subject to a small margin of error for the last several thousand years. 
The Mayan calendar was thought to conclude on 31st December 2012 leaving many to fear a global cataclysmic event had been predicted. 
But a spokesperson has confirmed this morning that Mayans have been aware of their miscalculation for centuries. 
They told us, “We all got together a few hundred years ago when we realised our mistake. We decided it was best not to say anything as we’d already had loads printed and they seemed to be selling quite well. The logistics would have been a nightmare”. 
The Mayans claim they had known about the impending apocalypse since the end of the 17th Century but didn’t know exactly what form it would take. 
They added, “We had our eye on Nigel Farage for a number of months but it looks like we were looking in the wrong place.” Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE! There are currently",0
7868,"Wikileaks Exposes Clinton Satanic Ritual, FBI Calls Hillary the Antichrist","
Hillary Clinton’s ties to satanic rituals and the occult have been well-documented for decades.
Clinton insider Larry Nichols told Infowars that Hillary Clinton used to attend a “ witch’s church ” in Los Angeles during Bill’s presidency.
The currently serving FBI agent said Clinton is : “the antichrist personified to a large swath of FBI personnel,” and that “the reason why they’re leaking is they’re pro-Trump.”
Also, DC insider Doug Hagmann broke the news that the NYPD found a blackmail sex network on Anthony Weiner’s computer.
Furthermore, the latest bombshell to come from WikiLeaks connects Clinton campaign head John Podesta to top occultist Marina Abramovic .
Marina Abramovic is a Crypto . She does not publicly admit her putrid roots but her name gives her up. Oligarch Roman Abramovich who managed to escape justice in Russia and fled to the UK is also Jewish but he is public about it.
Abramovic is a common name among Jewish people living in Slavic countries, because they like to brag that they are the descendants of Abraham. Abramovic is a derivation of Abraham. In the Holy Bible, John 8:39-44 there is actually a very revealing conversation about this specific issue:
“ Abraham is our father ,” they (Jews) answered. “ If you were Abraham’s children ,” said Jesus, “ then you would do what Abraham did. 
As it is, you are looking for a way to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things.
You are doing the works of your own father.” “We are not illegitimate children,” they protested. “The only Father we have is God himself.”
Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on my own; God sent me.
Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say.
You belong to your father, the devil , and you want to carry out your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.
This email comes shortly after we previously had another email where Jennifer Palmieri, Campaign Chairman John Podesta and John Halpin discuss about how much they HATE Christians, especially Catholics and Evangelicals .
Infowars reporter Paul Joseph Watson breaks down the “spirit cooking” ritual:

The Clinton Satanic network has now been exposed on a national level thanks to WikiLeaks.

Abramovic in particular invited Podesta to a “spirit cooking” dinner, an occult ritual started by infamous Satanist Aleister Crowley, which involves eating semen, blood and breast milk.

Here are some examples of what a “spirit cooking” dinner with Marina Abramovic looks like:

Another email from WikiLeaks even shows Abramovic being invited to Hillary Clinton’s campaign launch party.

The internet exploded this morning after the news broke.

During the RNC in Cleveland, Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson called out Clinton on her Luciferian ties.

Similarly, an article from CNN in 1996 discusses Hillary’s affiliation with dark magic.

Bill Clinton’s book My Life: The Early Years describes their trips to Haiti where they participated in “voodoo rituals.”
So far, all these revelations has hurt the Clinton campaign and Hillary is already losing voters.

7870,Settlement Debate Flares Again in Israel’s Quarrel With Rights Group - The New York Times,"JERUSALEM  —   Israel’s   debate over Jewish settlement in the West Bank reignited on Sunday with a fierce exchange between the government and a human rights organization that touched on broader arguments over definitions of patriotism and the very character of the country. The latest   of accusations began after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced late Saturday that he would push for legislation to bar Israelis from volunteering for national service with B’Tselem, an organization that focuses on allegations of human rights violations against Palestinians in   territories. On Friday, Hagai   the executive director of B’Tselem, addressed a special meeting of the United Nations Security Council devoted to a discussion titled “The Settlements as the Obstacle to Peace and the   Solution,” referring to the internationally endorsed goal of establishing a Palestinian state alongside Israel. The session was initiated by the Palestinians and requested by five countries, including Egypt, a regional ally with which Israel signed a peace treaty in the late 1970s. Most of the world considers Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, territories that were conquered from Jordan in the 1967 war, to be a violation of international law. The Palestinians demand those areas as the heart of a future independent state, and continued Israeli building there has been a constant source of tension between Israel and the United States. Mr. Netanyahu’s pronouncement was largely symbolic: Only three volunteers from a program for    exempted from compulsory military service on ideological, religious, health or other grounds have applied to perform national service at B’Tselem in the last seven years. Amit Gilutz, a spokesman for B’Tselem, said no other volunteers were in the pipeline. He described Mr. Netanyahu’s ban as “spin” and “a distraction from the actual issues. ” Yet it underscores the rawness of the political divide in Israel over the fate of the territories it seized nearly 50 years ago, the work of nongovernmental organizations that oppose the occupation, and the wedge that Jewish settlement there drives between Israel and the rest of the world. “Anything short of decisive international action will achieve nothing but ushering in the second half of the first century of the occupation,” Mr.   told the Security Council. Living under Israeli military rule in the West Bank, he said, “mostly means invisible, bureaucratic, daily violence. ” Israel officially considers the West Bank disputed, not occupied, and it annexed East Jerusalem in a move that was never internationally recognized. Mr. Netanyahu denounced B’Tselem and Americans for Peace Now, a sister organization of the leftist Israeli Peace Now group, on Facebook. He said they had “joined the chorus of besmirching Israel” and had repeated “the mendacious claim that ‘the occupation and settlements’ are the cause” of the   conflict. He added, “The truth is that the Palestinians have been attacking Israel for 50 years, since before a single settlement existed. ” He described B’Tselem and similar organizations as “ephemeral and delusional. ”   Jerbi, the director of Israel’s National Civilian Service authority, told Israel Radio that B’Tselem had “crossed a red line” by addressing the Security Council meeting and had carried out “an act of betrayal. ” Zehava Galon, a former executive director of B’Tselem who now leads the   Meretz party, which sits in opposition to Israel’s   government, wrote on Twitter on Sunday that Israel “has needed to have the discussion about the settlements and the occupation for a very long time, because of the price the Palestinians pay but also because of the price paid by Israelis. ” Responding to what it called Mr. Netanyahu’s “slander,” B’Tselem said in a statement, “We insist on saying loud and clear: The occupation is not Israel, and resisting it is not  . ” Mr. Gilutz, B’Tselem’s spokesman, said that just as his organization did not take a position on the nature of the solution of the conflict, it was also not specifying what kind of international action should be taken. Saeb Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said in a recent statement that “the international community, including the United States, must completely and unequivocally boycott Israeli settlements. ” The Israeli government has long questioned the patriotism of   groups that oppose its policies in the West Bank, and in July, the Knesset approved legislation requiring nongovernmental organizations that receive more than half of their financing from foreign governments to disclose that information in their publications, advertising and meetings with public officials. The   NGO law, which supporters said was intended to increase transparency, applies mainly to leftist groups critical of Israel’s policy toward the Palestinians, since rightist groups mostly receive private funding from abroad. The latest quarrel over B’Tselem arose after the Obama administration condemned the Israeli government in uncommonly harsh terms for approving plans to create a new Jewish settlement, three weeks after Israel signed a lucrative military aid package with the United States. The new housing was meant to accommodate settlers who are supposed to be evacuated against their will from the illegal settlement outpost of Amona by Dec. 25, by an order of Israel’s Supreme Court. After years of delays and legal wrangling, the pending struggle over Amona has put Mr. Netanyahu’s government in a bind, and it has decided to petition the Supreme Court to put off the evacuation for an additional six months.",0

‘The 30th Infantry Division –“Old Hickory” as this combat infantry division was affectionately called by military people both in and out of it. This National Guard Division is shown in North Carolina and Tennessee, and in combat. It rightfully earned its name as “the Work Horse of the Western Front.” Colonel Quinn appears and explains the clothing, equipment and food available to the combat infantryman.’

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30th_In… ) 
The 30th Infantry Division was a unit of the Army National Guard in World War I and World War II. It was nicknamed the “Old Hickory” division, in honor of President Andrew Jackson. The Germans nicknamed this division “Roosevelt’s SS.”. The 30th Infantry Division was regarded by SLA Marshall as the number one infantry division in the European Theater of Operations (ETO), involved in 282 days of intense combat over a period from June 1944 through April 1945… 
The 30th Infantry Division arrived in England, 22 February 1944, and trained until June. It landed at Omaha Beach, Normandy, 11 June 1944, secured the Vire-et-Taute Canal, crossed the Vire River, 7 July, and, beginning on 25 July spearheaded the Saint-Lô break-through of Operation Cobra. 
During Operation Cobra, on both 24 and 25 July, the 30th encountered a devastating friendly fire incident. As part of the effort to break out of the Normandy hedgerows, U.S. Army Air Force bombers from England were sent to carpet bomb a one by three mile corridor of the German defenses opposite the American line. However, Air Force planners, in complete disregard or lack of understanding of their role in supporting the ground attack, loaded the heavy B-24 Liberator and B-17 Flying Fortress bombers with 500-pound bombs, destroying roads and bridges and complicating movement through the corridor, instead of lighter 100-pound bombs intended as antipersonnel devices against German defenders. Air planners switched the approach of attack by 90 degrees without informing ground commanders, thus a landmark road to guide the bombers to the bombing zone was miscommunicated as the point to begin the bombing run. Start point confusion was further compounded by red smoke signals that suddenly blew in the wrong direction, and bombs began falling on the heads of the U.S. soldiers. There were over 100 friendly fire casualties over the two days, including Lieutenant General Lesley J. McNair, commander of Army Ground Forces. 
The 30th relieved the 1st Infantry Division near Mortain on 6 August. The German drive to Avranches began shortly after. The 30th clashed with the elite 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler, and fierce fighting in place with all available personnel broke out. The 30th frustrated enemy plans and broke the spearhead of the enemy assault in a violent struggle from 7–12 August. After the liberation of Paris, the division drove east through Belgium, crossing the Meuse River at Visé and Liège on 10 September. Elements of the division entered the Netherlands on 12 September, and Maastricht fell the next day. Moving into Germany and taking up positions along the Wurm River, the 30th launched its attack on the heavily defended city of Aachen on 2 October 1944, and succeeded in contacting the 1st Division on 16 October, resulting in the encirclement and takeover of Aachen… 
After a rest period, the 30th eliminated an enemy salient northeast of Aachen on 16 November, pushed through Alsdorf to the Inde River on 28 November, and then moved to rest areas. On 17 December the division rushed south to the Malmedy-Stavelot area to help block the powerful enemy drive in the Battle of the Bulge… Share this:",0
7872,"In-Person Coaching at University versus Technology: Proactive, Constant Contact Matters","by Lambert Strether 
Lambert here: Apparently, then, Neoliberal U plans to build “trust-based relations” and offer “personalised attention” by gutting tenured faculty, shifting the teaching load to contingent faculty, redistributing salaries to administrators, and socking money into fancy facilities. Let me know how that works out. 
By Philip Oreopoulos, Professor of Economics and Public Policy, University of Toronto, and Uros Petronijevic, Assistant Professor, Department of Economics, York University. Originally published at VoxEU . 
Questions over the value of a university education are underscored by negative student experiences. Personalised coaching is a promising, but costly, tool to improve student experiences and performance. This column presents the results from an experiment comparing coaching with lower cost ‘nudge’ interventions. While coaching led to a significant increase in average course grades, online and text message interventions had no effect. The benefits of coaching appear to derive from the trust-based nature of relationships and personalised attention. 
Policymakers and academics share growing concerns about stagnating college completion rates and negative student experiences. Recent figures suggest that only 56% of students who pursue a bachelors’ degree complete it within six years (Symonds et al. 2011), and it is increasingly unclear whether students who attain degrees acquire meaningful new skills along the way (Arum and Roska 2011). Students enter college underprepared, with those who procrastinate, do not study enough, or have superficial attitudes about success performing particularly poorly (Beattie et al 2016). 
Personalised Coaching to Improve Outcomes 
A promising tool for improving students’ college outcomes and experiences is personalised coaching. At both the high school and college levels, an emerging recent literature demonstrates the benefits of helping students foster motivation, effort, good study habits, and time-management skills through structured tutoring and coaching. Cook et al. (2014) find that cognitive behavioural therapy and tutoring generate large improvements in maths scores and high school graduation rates for troubled youth in Chicago, while Oreopoulos et al. (forthcoming) show that coaching, tutoring, and group activities lead to large increases in high school graduation and college enrolment among youth in a Toronto public housing project. At the college level, Scrivener and Weiss (2013) find that the Accelerated Study in Associates Program – a bundle of coaching, tutoring, and student success workshops – in CUNY community colleges nearly doubled graduation rates and Bettinger and Baker (2014) show that telephone coaching by Inside Track professionals boosts two-year college retention by 15% across several higher-education institutions. 
While structured, one-on-one support can have large effects on student outcomes, it is often costly to implement and difficult to scale up to the student population at large (Bloom 1984). Noting this challenge, we set out to build on recent advances in social-psychology and behavioural economics, investigating whether technology – specifically, online exercises, and text and email messaging – can be used to generate comparable benefits to one-on-one coaching interventions but at lower costs among first-year university students (Oreopoulos and Petronijevic 2016). 
Several recent studies in social-psychology find that short, appropriately timed interventions can have lasting effects on student outcomes (Yeager and Walton 2011, Cohen and Garcia 2014, Walton 2014). Relatively large improvements on academic performance have been documented from interventions that help students define their long-run goals or purpose for learning (Morisano et al. 2010, Yeager et al. 2014), teach the ‘growth mindset’ idea that intelligence is malleable (Yeager et al. 2016), and help students keep negative events in perspective by self-affirming their values (Cohen and Sherman 2014). In contrast to these one-time interventions, other studies in education and behavioural economics attempt to maintain constant, low-touch contact with students or their parents at a low cost by using technology to provide consistent reminders aimed at improving outcomes. Providing text, email, and phone call updates to parents about their students’ progress in school has been shown to boost both parental engagement and student performance (Kraft and Dougherty 2013, Bergman 2016, Kraft and Rogers 2014, Mayer et al. 2015), while direct text-message communication with college and university students has been used in attempts to increase financial aid renewal (Castleman and Page 2014) and improve academic outcomes (Castleman and Meyer 2016). 
Can Lower-Cost Alternatives to One-On-One Coaching Be Effective? 
We examine whether benefits comparable to those obtained from one-on-one coaching can be achieved at lower cost by either of two specific interventions (Oreopoulos and Petronijevic 2016). We examine a one-time online intervention designed to affirm students’ goals and purpose for attending university, and a full-year text and email messaging campaign that provides weekly reminders of academic advice and motivation to students. We work with a sample of more than 4,000 undergraduate students who are enrolled in introductory economics courses at a large representative college in Canada, randomly assigning students to one of three treatment groups or a control group. The treatment groups consist of: A one-time, online exercise completed during the first two weeks of class in the autumn; The online intervention plus text and email messaging throughout the full academic year; and The online intervention plus one-on-one coaching in which students are assigned to upper-year undergraduate students who act as coaches. 
Students in the control group are given a personality test measuring the Big Five personality traits. 
Figure 1 summarises our main results on course grades. Overall, we find large positive effects from the coaching programme, amounting to approximately a 4.92 percentage-point increase in average course grades; we also find that coached students experience a 0.35 standard-deviation increase in GPA. In contrast, we find no effects on academic outcomes from either the online exercise or the text messaging campaign, even after investigating potentially heterogeneous treatment effects across several student characteristics, including gender, age, incoming high school average, international-student status, and whether students live on residence. 
Figure 1 . Main effects of interventions 
Our results suggest that the benefits of personal coaching are not easily replicated by low-cost interventions using technology. Many successful coaching programmes involve regular student-coach interaction facilitated either by mandatory meetings between coaches and students or proactive coaches regularly initiating contact (Scrivener and Weiss 2013, Bettinger and Baker 2014, Cook et al. 2014, Oreopoulos et al. forthcoming). Our coaches initiated contact and built trust with students over time, in person and through text messaging. Through a series of gentle, open-ended questions, the coaches could understand the problems students were facing and provide clear advice, ending most conversations with students being able to take at least one specific action to help solve their current problems. 
Our text messaging campaign offered weekly academic advice, resource information, and motivation, but did not initiate communication with individual students about specific issues (e.g. help with writing or an upcoming mid-term). The text-messaging team often invited students to reply to messages and share their concerns but was unable to do this with the same efficacy as a coach, nor were we able to establish the same rapport with students. Our inability to reach out to all students and softly guide the conversation likely prevented us from learning the important details of their specific problems. Although we provided answers and advice to the questions we received, we did not have as much information on the students’ backgrounds as our coaches did, and thus could not tailor our responses to each student’s specific circumstances. 
Our coaches were also able to build trust with students by fulfilling a support role. Figure 2 provides an example of how the coaching service was more effective than the text messaging campaign in this respect. The text messages attempted to nudge students in the right direction, rather than provide tailored support. The left panel of Figure 2 shows three consecutive text messages, in which we provide a tip on stress management, an inspirational quote, and a time-management tip around the exam period. As in this example, it was often the case that students would not respond to such messages. In contrast, the student-coach interaction in the right panel shows our coaches offering more of a supportive role rather than trying to simply nudge the student in a specific direction. The coach starts by asking an open-ended question, to which the student responds, and the coach then guides the conversation forward. In this example, the coach assures the student that they will be available to help with a pending deadline and shows a genuine interest in the events in the student’s life. 
Figure 2 . Distinguishing the text-messaging campaign and the coaching programme 
Coaches also kept records of their evolving conversations with students and could check in to ask how previously discussed issues were being resolved. Although we kept a record of all text message conversations, a lack of resources prevented us from conducting regular check-ups to see how previous events had unfolded, which likely kept us from helping students effectively with their problem and from establishing the trust required for students to share additional problems. 
Concluding Remarks 
In sum, the two key features that distinguish the coaching service from the texting campaign are that coaches proactively initiated discussion with students about their problems and could establish relationships based on trust in which students felt comfortable to openly discuss their issues. Future work attempting to improve academic outcomes in higher education by using technology to maintain constant contact with students may need to acknowledge that simply nudging students in the right direction is not enough. A more personalised approach is likely required, in which coaches or mentors initially guide students through a series of gentle conversations and subsequently show a proactive interest in students’ lives. These conversations need not necessarily occur during face-to-face meetings, but the available evidence suggests that they should occur frequently and be initiated by the coaches. While such an intervention is likely to be costlier than the text messaging campaign in our study, it is also likely to be more effective but still less costly than the personalised coaching treatment.",0
7873,Hospital Confirms Eric Trump Helped Raise $16.3 Million for It - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Eric Trump has helped raise $16. 3 million for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital of Tennessee over the past decade, a hospital official said in a letter sent to a charity run by Mr. Trump, the  ’s son. The letter comes as Mr. Trump is preparing to remove his name from the charity to avoid conflicts of interest that could emerge from future  . The letter confirms an account Mr. Trump gave to reporters that his organization has raised more than $15 million for the hospital, despite available tax records showing that the Eric Trump Foundation raised less than half that amount. Mr. Trump’s announcement that he will remove his name from the organization is one of a series of steps that members of the Trump family are taking to address potential conflicts before the inauguration. Other steps include terminating planned Trump Organization projects in countries like Azerbaijan, Brazil, Colombia and Georgia. In addition to removing his name from his charitable foundation, Mr. Trump will no longer personally solicit funds for it, he said in several interviews with The New York Times. To further avoid conflicts, Mr. Trump said in an email this week, his    and a Trump Organization executive will step down from the foundation’s executive committee. The Trump Organization will continue to raise money for St. Jude from patrons at its hotels and golf courses, Mr. Trump said. But it will ask them to make contributions directly to the hospital, he said, instead of first sending the money to the Trump Organization. The St. Jude letter said that since its establishment, the Eric Trump Foundation had raised  —   or helped raise through affiliated groups  —   $16. 3 million for the hospital, which offers free care to needy children. Tax documents filed by nonprofit foundations are often delayed by two years, so there is no public accounting of these totals yet available. The letter said that some of the money was raised via related efforts, such as an Eric Trump   team that participates in the New York City Marathon. “I am amazed by the many ways that you have personally embraced our cause and cared for our children and families,” Richard C. Shadyac Jr. president of the hospital’s   organization, wrote in the Dec. 30 letter, which Mr. Trump provided to The Times. “As you are aware, we are expanding our lifesaving work and are working to push cure rates even higher in this country and around the world, while improving the lives of survivors by developing and advancing treatments that reduce side effects. We are only able to do this because of the support provided by donors and supporters like you. ” In his email this week, Mr. Trump said he would “continue to be a vocal advocate for pediatric cancer and St. Jude’s mission. ”   Donald J. Trump has announced that he is shutting down his own personal foundation, although it is currently the target of an investigation by the New York State attorney general over accusations that it did not have the proper permit to solicit contributions, and that it may have used money to benefit Mr. Trump’s own interests. No such accusations have been made about Eric Trump’s foundation.",0

Asked Thursday about President-elect Donald Trump’s threats to tear up the Iran nuclear deal once in office, the European Union official tasked to oversee its implementation said it was not a bilateral agreement but a multilateral one, enshrined in a U.N. Security Council resolution. 
E.U. foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini’s words reinforced those of Iranian President Hasan Rouhani, who said on Iranian television Wednesday that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was “not concluded with one country or government but was approved by a resolution of the U.N.

7875,Trump’s Tough Trade Talk Could Damage American Factories - The New York Times,"HOLLAND, Mich.  —   While much of the American political class has been consumed with recriminations over the wrenching loss of manufacturing jobs, Chuck Reid has been quietly adding them. His company, First Class Seating, makes recliner seats for movie theaters here at a factory on the shores of Lake Michigan. Since he bought the business three years ago, its work force has grown to 40 from 15. But those jobs will be in jeopardy if   Donald J. Trump follows through on his combative promises to punish countries he deems guilty of unfair trade. Mr. Trump secured the White House in part by vowing to bring manufacturing jobs back to American shores. The   has fixed on China as a symbol of nefarious trade practices while threatening to slap 45 percent punitive tariffs on Chinese imports. But many existing American manufacturing jobs depend heavily on access to a broad array of goods drawn from a global supply chain  —   fabrics, chemicals, electronics and other parts. Many of them come from China. At Mr. Reid’s factory, imports account for roughly   of the cost of making a recliner chair. In short, Mr. Trump’s signature trade promise, one ostensibly aimed at protecting American jobs, may well deliver the reverse: It risks making successful American manufacturers more vulnerable by raising their costs. It would unleash havoc on the global supply chain, prompting some multinationals to leave the United States and shift manufacturing to countries where they can be assured of buying components at the lowest prices. “If you do this tomorrow, you would have a lot of disruption,” said Susan Helper, an economist at the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. “The stuff that China now makes and the way they make it, it’s not trivial to replicate that. ” Mr. Reid takes pride in using American products. His designers here in Michigan dreamed up his sleek recliner. Local hands construct the frames using   steel, then affix molded foam from a factory in nearby Grand Rapids. They staple upholstery to hunks of wood harvested by timber operations in Wisconsin. They do all this inside a former heating and cooling equipment factory that shut down a decade ago when the work shifted to Mexico. But the fabric for Mr. Reid’s seats arrives from China. So do the electronics in the “magic box” that enables moviegoers to control the recliner. Ditto, the plastic cup holders and the bolts and screws that hold the parts together. The motor is the work of a German company that makes it in Hungary, almost certainly using electronics from China. Mr. Reid estimates that a 45 percent tariff on Chinese wares would raise the costs of making a recliner here by 20 percent. Tariffs would give his factory an edge against American competitors that import even more from China. But his company would be vulnerable to competitors in Mexico, Colombia and Australia. They would be free to draw on China’s supply chain and sell their wares into the American market unhindered. “Our chair would be priced out of the market,” Mr. Reid said. “If it impacts our sales, that puts jobs at risk. ” Trade experts dismiss Mr. Trump’s threat of tariffs as campaign bluster that will soon give way to pragmatic concerns about growth and employment. Between 1998 and 2006, the imported share of components folded into American manufacturing rose to 34 percent from 24 percent, according to one widely cited study. International law also limits the scope of what the Trump administration can do. Under the rules of the World Trade Organization, the United States cannot   apply tariffs. It must develop cases industry by industry, proving that China is damaging American rivals through unfair practices. Talk of    tariffs is “pure theater,” said Marc L. Busch, an expert on international trade policy at Georgetown University in Washington. “It’s impossible to do. It violates the rule of law. ” But Mr. Trump has suggested taking the extraordinary step of abandoning the W. T. O. to gain authority to dictate terms. His successful   of Carrier, the   company, which agreed to keep 1, 000 jobs at a plant in Indiana rather than move them to Mexico, attests to his priorities in delivering on his trade promises. The people advising Mr. Trump on trade have records of advocating a pugnacious response to what they portray as Chinese predations. There is Dan DiMicco, the former chief executive of the American steel giant Nucor, who has long advocated punitive tariffs on Chinese goods. There is Peter Navarro, a senior policy adviser and   of a book titled “Death by China: Confronting the Dragon  —   A Global Call to Action. ” In an email on Friday, Mr. Navarro, the Trump transition team’s economic adviser, said that imposing steep tariffs on China was an essential step to begin to address the American trade deficit with China, which reached $365 billion last year. He blamed Chinese trade practices for “destroying entire industries, hollowing out entire communities” and “putting millions out of work. ” But Mr. Navarro also cast the threat of tariffs as an opening gambit in a refashioning of trade positions. “Tariffs are not an end game but merely one of several negotiating tools to bring our trade back into balance,” he said, adding that Mr. Trump’s administration would do so “in a measured way. ” Mr. Navarro’s   Greg Autry, a professor at the University of Southern California, said he assumed the Trump camp was dead serious about its threats to impose tariffs on China. The goal is to force manufacturers to come back to the United States as a condition of selling into the American market. A   trade war between the world’s two largest economies would cost American jobs in the immediate term, Mr. Autry said, but eventually millions of new ones would be created as the United States again hummed with factory work. “We moved our supply chain to Asia in about two decades,” he said. “You certainly can do it in the U. S. a whole lot faster. It’s going to take a few years, but it’s going to be a much better America. ” Even if factory work does return to the United States, though, that is unlikely to translate into many paychecks. As automation spreads, robots are primed to secure most of the jobs. At Mr. Reid’s factory, talk of a bountiful future through trade barriers resonates as dangerous nonsense. Mr. Reid has a business to run in the here and now. His customers are waiting for product. He must be able to tap the supply chain. “You can’t just turn your ship around and bring that stuff back,” he said. In threatening tariffs, Mr. Trump is wielding a blunt instrument whose impacts are increasingly easy to evade by sophisticated businesses with operations across multiple borders. The geography of global trade is perpetually being redrawn. In China, factory owners, casting a wary eye on Mr. Trump, are accelerating their exploration of alternative locales with   workers across Southeast Asia and even as far away as Africa. In Vietnam, entrepreneurs are preparing for a potential surge of incoming investment from China should Mr. Trump take action. In Europe, factories that sell manufacturing equipment to China are watching to see if Mr. Trump will unleash trade hostilities that will damage global growth. “Money and goods will always find their way, regardless of what barriers you put up,” said Ernesto Maurer, chairman of SSM, a Swiss maker of textile machinery that operates a factory in China. “You just make it more difficult and more expensive. ” In the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, Jiang Jiacheng exudes confidence that China will continue to serve as the factory floor for the world  —   with tariffs or otherwise. His company, the Guangzhou Shuqee Digital Tech Company, makes movie chairs, exporting about 20 percent of its wares to the United States. It is an exemplar both of China’s manufacturing prowess and of the conditions that make it a competitive threat. Mr. Jiang pays his factory workers $290 a month. They work six days a week. Lax environmental rules allow him to dispose of pollutants cheaply. The total cost of making one of his   products, a   movie chair, runs $72. He sells it for $116 to wholesalers who export to the United States. Back in September, Mr. Jiang gathered with other Chinese movie chair manufacturers to discuss the alarming statements coming from Mr. Trump. The consensus view was not to worry. “Once he takes up the post, he will certainly return things to the normal state,” Mr. Jiang said. Still, he has a backup plan. Even before President Trump entered the lexicon, Mr. Jiang was exploring a transfer of some of his work to   places like Vietnam. His company would not be the first to make the journey. A dozen years ago, the United States Commerce Department accused China of dumping wooden bedroom furniture at below cost. It imposed protective tariffs. For Lawrence M. D. Yen, who had a furniture factory in southern China, that was the impetus to move to Vietnam. Labor costs were cheaper. Today, Mr. Yen’s company, Woodworth Wooden Industries, operates a factory in Cu Chi, on the outskirts of Ho Chi Minh City, a district best known for the elaborate tunnels used by Vietcong guerrillas in their battles against American forces. This former hive of combat is now the workplace for 5, 000 people making sofa beds, recliner chairs and bedroom furniture.   of the products are destined for the United States, including Las Vegas casino resorts like Mandalay Bay and the MGM Grand. Woodworth’s plant churns out more than 10, 000   sofas each month. This year, the company opened a second Vietnam factory. Arithmetic gives Mr. Yen confidence that Mr. Trump’s talk will be muted by the realities of the marketplace. Brands that deliver   goods to American retailers have leaned heavily on Asian suppliers to secure low prices. In pledging to bring manufacturing back, Mr. Trump is effectively pitting the interests of a relatively small group of people  —   those who work in factories  —   against hundreds of millions of consumers. “The retail industry now employs an awful lot more people than apparel industries ever did,” said Pietra Rivoli, a trade expert at Georgetown. Seven years ago, the Obama administration accused China of unfairly subsidizing tires. It imposed tariffs reaching 35 percent. A subsequent analysis by the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan think tank, calculated the effect: Some 1, 200 American   jobs were preserved, but American consumers paid $1. 1 billion extra for tires. That prompted households to cut spending at retailers, resulting in more than 2, 500 net jobs lost. The TAL Group claims to make one of every six dress shirts sold in the United States. It produces finished goods for Brooks Brothers, Banana Republic and J. Crew, operating 11 factories worldwide. If Mr. Trump places tariffs on China, the company will accelerate its shift to Vietnam, said TAL’s chief executive, Roger Lee. If that trade is disrupted, the work would flow to other   countries like Bangladesh, India and Indonesia. Mr. Lee can envision no situation in which the physically taxing, monotonous work of making garments will go to the United States. “Where are you going to find the work force in the U. S. that is willing to work at factories?” Mr. Lee said. Horgen, a Swiss village on the shores of Lake Zurich, seems far removed from the gritty industrial zones of Asia. With its gingerbread homes and mountain views, it looks more like a resort. But Horgen is home to SSM, a company that has become an important supplier to Asia. Its machines turn polyester and other synthetic fibers into   threads. If the rise of textiles in Asia has been a gold rush, this Swiss company has been among those cashing in by making the picks and shovels. Workers at the factory earn roughly 6, 000 Swiss francs ($5, 940) a month  —   some 10 times what SSM pays its workers at its Chinese factory. It makes its most sophisticated components in Switzerland and at another plant in Italy. It uses China for   machines. The company sells virtually all of its products abroad, chiefly in Asia. It buys metal parts from the Czech Republic and Poland, electronic components from Malaysia, and electric motors from an American company that makes them at a factory in India. Another American company supplies software. “There is not a single machine that we have that we are able to build with materials from one country,” said Mr. Maurer, the SSM chairman. If the United States were to impose trade barriers on China, that might slow Chinese demand for   textile machinery. That would potentially reduce Swiss purchases of American goods and services. But Mr. Maurer struggles to see how this would create any jobs in the United States. The American textile industry is small and increasingly dominated by robots. The rest of the world holds billions of hands willing to work cheaply. “Someone else will pick up the business,” Mr. Maurer said. “These markets are very fast. ” But the textile and apparel trades are relatively simple businesses. If the cost of making trousers becomes less appealing in China, a room full of sewing machines in Cambodia can quickly be filled with   seamstresses. Industries involving precision machinery are not so easily reassembled somewhere else. An abrupt change to the economics would devastate factories that could not quickly line up alternative suppliers. American automakers are especially dependent on the global supply chain. Between 2000 and 2011, the percentage of imported components that went into exported   vehicles grew to 35 percent, from 24 percent, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. At EBW Electronics in Holland, Mich. workers in lab coats tend boxy soldering machines as they make circuitry for LED lights that go into cars. It buys tiny parts and slots them into circuit boards, which are sold to major automakers. Some 80 percent of the components are imported from China. Even that number fails to capture the degree to which the company  —   and its 240 workers  —   depend on unfettered trade. Pat LeBlanc, the chairman, pointed to a nib of metal on a circuit board. The silicon was extracted at a plant in Minnesota, then processed into a thin wafer at another factory in Massachusetts. The wafer was shipped to China for testing, cut into pieces at another Chinese factory, and then delivered to the Philippines for a chemical process. Then it went back to China to be put onto a reel that can be inserted into soldering machines here in Michigan. “It literally is a global supply chain,” Mr. LeBlanc said. Mr. Reid, the owner of the theater seating company, could not imagine having to buy everything from American suppliers. Buying upholstery domestically would raise his fabric costs as much as 40 percent. “All the componentry, all the cords, it all comes from China,” he said. “I don’t know that you could ever get all of that made in the United States. Some of these industries have just been abandoned. ” He wandered into the paint shop, where a worker was spraying chair backs. He picked up a can of paint and read the label: “Made in the U. S. A. with Global Materials. ”",0

7877,Fight - The New York Times,"PART 1 YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio  —   Numbered balls of chance rattle and rise two nights a week down at the cavernous community hall of Sts. Peter and Paul Ukrainian Orthodox Church. It’s called a good bingo when your number comes up. But that last Saturday before Christmas offered no good bingos. The night was reserved for a boxing event billed as Season’s Beatings, which had prompted a newspaper deliveryman named Anthony Taylor to pull up in his clattering Dodge Caravan.   years old, 5 feet tall, 115 pounds, about to turn pro. A fist of nerves, he walked down the   stairwell to the finished basement, a space used for church dances and wedding banquets, but now an open locker room. Chandeliers glittered above the fighters trying to warm up and calm down, while the crowds upstairs cheered on the amateurs, including a      who would knock out his   opponent. Taylor had longed for this moment. All those years of being picked on because of his size, all those street fights, all that anger needing redirection toward something constructive  —   all down to this. He had his hair in ropy dreadlocks and his   shorts,   for $300, pulled high on his hardened torso. Portable curtains in the basement separated the hometown favorites from the    the A’s from the B’s. Someone smart about boxing could walk in cold and tell which side was which. The local fighters are usually a notch above, in better shape, expected to win. But Taylor’s   trainer, Jack Loew, heard this hammering sound, a whap, whap,   from the curtain’s other side. He peeked and saw a sinewy teenager in    shorts pounding the outstretched mitts of his trainer with uncommon discipline.  . “We got a fighter,” Loew said to somebody. Taylor was on his own side of the divide, warming up, when the curtain briefly parted to reveal his opponent. They made eye contact. “Nothing like anger,” Taylor recalled. “Both nervous. Just looking at each other. ” The curtain closed. A Life of Taking Punches and Unleashing His Own “Five foot even. ” That’s how Anthony Taylor describes his height. Not a   higher or lower. Five foot even. When you’re 9 inches shorter than the average man, abuse will find you. But Taylor was determined from an early age to prove his true stature the only way he knew. “Street fighting,” he says. His mother, an   factory worker, and his father, a handyman, split up before he was in kindergarten, so he bounced around a little. Moving from the small Ohio city of Warren to Youngstown, then down to Jackson, Tenn. he learned that broken families were tough on children, and that bullies were ubiquitous. “I was always the smallest guy in the neighborhood, so I had a lot of people picking on me,” Taylor said. “I really didn’t go around looking for trouble. It just seemed to find me because I was so small. ” “And I had a bad attitude,” he added. One day the manager of a gym in Jackson saw this small angry kid giving as good as he got, and invited him to do something with those quick hands and quicker rage. The kid began to learn. “Somebody hit you, hit you really hard, and you want to do something back,” Taylor said. “But when you think about it, you can’t fight when you’re angry. Boxing is a thinking game. ” Taylor followed the amateur circuit  —   Florida, Alabama, Arkansas, Nevada  —   earning a reputation as a boxer who kept on coming. At a fight one night in Little Rock, his trainer called out, “Go get him, Tiger. ” The nickname stuck. He tried a semester of community college, but higher education wasn’t for him, at least not yet. Sometimes the classes would run over time, and he’d be late to the gym. College could wait, he figured boxing could not. He had his career goals. “To be at the top of the ladder,” he said. “Number one. Champion. ” Missing his family back north, Taylor returned to Ohio. He lives with his fiancée, Tiera Glover, their    daughter and her two sons in Warren, in a worn house with green plastic furniture planted under the porch’s sagging roof. They cover the $600 monthly rent by delivering 250 copies of The Tribune Chronicle, a Warren newspaper, every morning. And every afternoon, except on days when he can’t afford the gas, Taylor drives his knocking Dodge Caravan, with its car seat and little girl toys, the 20 miles to Youngstown  —   to Jack Loew’s South Side Boxing Club, his   sanctuary, where boxing gloves hang from nails like holiday ornaments. The club stands out along a   stretch of Market Street. Some years ago, its owner, Jack Loew, hired a resident of a nearby halfway house for convicts to paint the exterior red and black. The artist also painted a pair of boxing gloves, enveloped in a wreath of stars that can convey dreamlike glory or a concussive haze. Loew is 56,   and as squat and solid as his building. He boxed as an amateur before focusing on a college football career that ended after several knee operations. He became a Teamster, lost the warehouse job he thought would last to retirement, worked construction and started his own   company. He also opened this club in 1989, as if in homage to what his hometown had once been. Youngstown was a pugnacious steel city of 167, 000 when Loew was born, with boxing clubs anchored in many neighborhoods. This is where his childhood friend Ray Mancini  —   Boom Boom  —   learned how to become a world lightweight champion. A   later, Youngstown is down to a population of 65, 000, a hemorrhaging of 100, 000 people caused by   closings, a failure to diversify and the absence, so far, of a sustainable second act. Lost in the exodus were some signature parts of the Youngstown culture, including many boxing clubs. But Loew took a shot. He opened his gym on Southern Boulevard, moved to an ancient brick building on Erie Street, then settled here, on the city’s tough south side. No problems so far, save for that time someone removed a massive tractor tire from the gym and rolled it like a determined Sisyphus up and down the hilly neighborhood  —   only to return the tire the next day. His excuse was simple: Just wanted to see if I could do it, Coach. Two decades ago, a scrappy    kid from the south side’s Slovak neighborhood came to Loew’s gym looking to learn how to box. This kid, Kelly Pavlik, went on to become the Ghost, an electrifying, dominant boxer with a drinking problem. He abruptly quit in 2013, saying he feared the   medical impact of his chosen career. “Kelly picked my door to come through,” said Loew, who is called Coach Jack by his boxers. “We were always crowded, but when we won middleweight champion of the world.   …    ” No need to finish the sentence: Pavlik’s success was good for Jack Loew’s South Side Boxing Club. It attracted a lot of locals looking to make their mark, including a superflyweight named Anthony Taylor. “A   Joe Frazier,” Loew said. This is boxing code for saying that Taylor keeps coming at you, takes a punch to give a punch, and has fists that hit like anvils. Taylor couldn’t remain an amateur forever. Loew needed to find him a professional opponent, maybe for the Season’s Beatings event that he had set up for the week before Christmas at the Ukrainian hall. But flyweights and bantamweights  —   who weigh less than half the reigning heavyweight champion, Tyson Fury  —   are hard to come by in this part of the country. A couple of weeks before Christmas, though, a trainer from Detroit who was bringing in two amateurs for the boxing night offered a solution. He said that he could supply a flyweight who, like Taylor, was itching to turn pro. Two Partners Engaging in a Dangerous Dance The ding of a bell in a church hall transformed two slight young men into professional fighters, hired to withstand blows to body and head while trying to pound each other out of consciousness. Their pay for the   fight: $300 for Taylor and $500 for his    opponent, since he was coming in from 200 miles away. Moments earlier they had stood with heads bowed, their coaches massaging their backs as the referee went over final details. Then they had tapped gloves, a gesture conveying   solidarity between strangers, known to each other only through a stolen glance across that parted curtain. Anthony Taylor danced the cautionary dance with his partner, head bobbing, looking for a moment to strike. He prided himself on his patience. But when the opponent tested with a tentative, catlike thrust, Taylor responded with a wild swing that punched only air, betraying his overeagerness. Then came a   scrum, left right left right. Violent contact made. The crowd aahed in approval. More than 700 people had turned out. Loew, the promoter as well as Taylor’s trainer, had charged $20 for general admission and $50 for ringside, while also managing to sell more than two dozen corporate tables. But after covering expenses that included the referee, the hall and ring rentals, and the hotel rooms for    boxers, Loew would take in just $382 for his eight weeks of work. At least his choice of location and timing  —   a Ukrainian church hall in late December  —   ensured a festive touch to the boxing event. A decorated Christmas tree sparkled in the corner. A    Ukrainian flag hung over the water fountain. A Christmas wreath and bright lights hung beside signs that said, “Valid Bingo Is Ball Called  —   Not Off Monitor” and “Early Bird Winner Take All. ” Instead of calls of “ ” and “” though, there arose the grunts of boxers, the whacks of leather against flesh, the cries and sighs of spectators in thrall. Some of the loudest shouts came from Taylor’s friends and family members. “Come on, Ant’! You got this!” Taylor crouched as he stalked, making his   frame even smaller before springing like a    . He connected with a left that sent his opponent back, and kept on coming. He ducked under a swing, came over the top and delivered another left that knocked the fighter in red and white down into the ropes. As Taylor retreated to his corner, fans were shouting: “He’s done, he’s done! Stop the fight!” Seconds later, Taylor struck again. “His guard came down, and I hit him with a straight left hand,” he recalled. A second knockdown, although this time his opponent got up quickly, adjusting his trunks as if the fall had been nothing more than a wardrobe malfunction. Then Taylor found himself reeling backward, almost comically, after taking a hard left to the head. He responded with a punch that he thought connected for a delayed knockdown others saw more of a phantom punch and stumble. Still, Loew recalled, “If the ref had stopped the fight, I don’t think anyone would have complained. ” The bell clanged. Taylor slumped to his corner, exhausted from all that he had expended trying to end the fight. He drank some water and listened to encouraging words from Loew, who struggled to be heard over the    music pounding out of the sound system. Then, again, came the bell’s beckoning. Taylor found his opponent waiting for him at the center of the ring, as if awakened by the knockdowns of the previous round. Soon there came a left that bounced Taylor off the ring’s    ropes. “Anthony!” someone pleaded. But Taylor could not yet find the wind or strength. “I threw out a lot of gas in the first round by me trying to finish him off,” he said later. “You’re trying to hurry up and get done with the fight. And that’s where the turnaround was in the second round. ” “Knock him out,” someone in Taylor’s corner shouted. Then: “Get him! Get him!” And: “Let’s go, Tiger!” And: “Put him down, Ant’!” Taylor took quick rights to the jaw, another hard right that rocked him, then a left and a right. Gloved fists pounded his many tattoos: the “R. I. P. ” on his right shoulder that honors a brother shot to death (“Wrong place, wrong time,” he says) the    on his left shoulder that reminds him he’s a jewel in the rough the dice and playing cards adorning his chest, along with the inscription: “Life A Gamble. ” Tension and Triumph, Confusion and Dread The bell. Another squirt of water. More of Coach Jack’s encouragement, only now sounding urgent. The passing blur of a young woman holding aloft a placard announcing Round 3. The bell. And there was Taylor’s opponent again, at the center of the ring, waiting. Taylor connected with a roundhouse left, but his opponent returned with a   insult to the chin. Taylor seemed   almost disengaged, as if exhaustion had displaced his purpose. “Let’s go, little man!” someone called out. But Taylor’s coach was more concrete. “Breathe, breathe!” Loew was shouting. “You gotta push it, Anthony!” Taylor did revive, holding his own until the bell. He was convinced the round was a tossup, but his coach knew otherwise. “Anthony was gassed in the third round, and took an ” Loew said. Now it was the fourth and last round, the final three minutes, and there again was his opponent, waiting. Taylor knew this was it  —   “an    thing,” he called it. His dreadlocks swayed as he danced and dodged, as he punched and received punches. It went this way, a study in mundane violence, for most of the first two minutes. Toe to toe. But then Taylor suddenly had his opponent near the ropes. He threw a right that either glanced off the boxer or missed him entirely. The opponent fell backward to all but sit on the apron. Trying to capitalize, Taylor threw a left. But the opponent ducked to his right and stumbled forward, head sweeping briefly against Taylor’s chest, arms outstretched, looking for something to hold on to, as if the blue mat had been pulled from beneath him. He looped his left arm around Taylor’s torso as he fell onto his right knee, his lower body gone limp, his black gloves down in sudden vulnerability. The referee waved his arms. Fight over! He bent down to help the opponent, who reached up with his right hand. Halfway to his feet, the boxer wobbled and fell back down. The sudden uncertainty disrupted the order in the ring. The opponent’s coach had slipped through the ropes and was now trying to help his fighter, who struggled again to rise, only to sway and fall back against his coach’s shins. My knee, he was saying. My knee. Loew was also in the ring, yelling to Bernie Profato, the director of the Ohio Athletic Commission, sitting at ringside, that the round hadn’t ended, and you can’t have people coming into the ring, and that was a knockdown.   …     “Your kid’s gotta hit him for a knockdown,” Profato called back. Mere noise. The fight was over. The opponent lay on his back as some people hovered over him, including the ringside doctor  —   a dermatologist  —   now slipping on a pair of surgical gloves. Taylor, meanwhile, knew only that he had won. He raised an arm and took a few courtly bows. But a shadow of dread was settling over this decorated bingo hall masquerading as a boxing arena. A fallen man was not rising, not rising, still not rising. His eyes were closed. Medics were climbing into the ring. “You knew,” Loew said. “You knew right then and there. ” You knew right then and there. The loser, this kid from Michigan named Hamzah Aljahmi, now   was unconscious. And the winner, Anthony Taylor, now   was sobbing. PART 2 DEARBORN, Mich.  —   The amateur boxer slept. Huddled in the passenger seat of his family’s sport utility vehicle, he rocked in slumber as his father drove out of Dearborn, then south and east around Lake Erie, verses from the Quran intoning softly from the speakers. Now and then the boxer would rouse long enough for a snatch of small talk. But soon his eyes would close again, and he would sleep through the December blur of Rust Belt towns and   fields, right to the edge of the Ohio city where he was to fight his first professional fight. Youngstown. This was Hamzah Aljahmi, 19, the oldest child and best friend of the man behind the wheel, Ali Aljahmi. The   permit dangling from the rearview mirror hinted of the father’s   worries, but no matter how bad things got, he knew that he could always confide in this beautiful   beside him, sleeping now to the   rhythms. How could he deny his son’s passionate dream to box his way to fame and fortune? To become the pride of Dearborn? Of Yemeni people everywhere? This was Hamzah’s destiny: to make his professional debut at a Christmastime boxing event called Season’s Beatings. Hamzah’s father had followed a different path. Born in Yemen, he had immigrated to Brooklyn, left high school without graduating  —   joked around too much, he says  —   and begun a life of manual labor. Store work. Factory work. Lifting and moving. He gravitated to Dearborn, the world headquarters of the Ford Motor Company, where   of the nearly 100, 000 residents are  : Lebanese, Syrian, Iraqi, Palestinian, Yemeni. Here are the Henry Ford museum and the Arab American National Museum, plants that make the   truck and restaurants that make fahsa, a seasoned lamb stew that is shared with others and scooped with torn pieces of flatbread. Now Ali Aljahmi was the married father of five, disabled by a   injury and living in a   neighborhood, a block from a massive factory. But he was an Aljahmi, a member of a fiercely proud extended Yemeni family with deep roots in two cultures. The Aljahmis, the Eljahmis, the Algahmis, the Aljahims  —   all there for him, and he for them. Above all, he was there for Hamzah, his elder son, the boxer. Years earlier, when the family was living in Detroit, three kids ganged up on skinny young Hamzah Aljahmi. The boy held his own in the mismatch, prompting an onlooker to give grudging respect: Your son is one tough character. Sensing a purpose in life, Hamzah began training with one of his idols, Brian Mihtar, a prominent   middleweight boxer known as Brian the Lion, who compiled a   record, with 10 knockouts, before suspending his career in 2010. He took a liking to this fledgling boxer, who showed both talent and heart. “Like a brother,” Mihtar said. When Mihtar closed his gym, Aljahmi and his father searched the Detroit area for someone who could make the boy   someday. They eventually chose Mohamed Hamood, or Coach Mo, a muscular former Marine with a shaved head who builds houses to support his family and his boxing fix. The amateur’s determination and focus impressed Hamood. The boy had phenomenal hand speed, an ability to slip punches, and surprising pop for a flyweight. But his tendency to fight with his chin up often left him dangerously exposed it was almost as if he were daring to be hit. Still, Hamood said, “a very hard worker  —   very hard. ” Hamzah Aljahmi fought more than a score of amateur matches, winning most and learning from all. Turning pro became his obsession, his father said: “All the time, his mind go to the boxing. ” He admired the ferocious boxers of Yemeni blood. Sadam Ali, the tough welterweight from Brooklyn. Mohamed Adam, the young superfeatherweight from Dearborn. His former coach, the Lion, Brian Mihtar. And, of course, Prince Naseem, whose image even served for a while as the wallpaper on Aljahmi’s smartphone. True, the young man had other interests. He attended prayer services. Doted on his mother and younger siblings. Abided high school, barely. Kept girls at a safe but friendly distance. Worked at a Tim Horton’s doughnut shop and then at the American Coney Island restaurant, serving hot dogs smothered in chili and onions. But it was boxing that defined him. He craved cranberry juice, shunned bread and spent most of his spare time in Hamood’s gym, in Dearborn Heights, working out, sparring with heavier partners, itching to fight for a living. “He was bugging me to go pro when he was 17,” Hamood, 55, recalled. “And I’d say, ‘Let’s take our time.’ ” Some friends and relatives approached the inherent violence of Aljahmi’s passion delicately, occasionally suggesting that he give up the ring. Others accepted that he knew who he was, and admired him for it. He talked of becoming champion and parlaying his   fame in a way that would help others in need  —   in   Yemen and beyond. Remember when he helped to collect clothes for Syrian refugees? And somehow persuaded his father to donate his three favorite coats? Remember that saying he used to repeat? “You laugh at me because I’m different I laugh at you because you’re all the same. ” Mohammad Yacoubi, 19, a classmate of Aljahmi’s and one of his closest friends, shrugged in mock surrender while trying to explain the young man’s charms. He had no enemies, he was respectful to his mother and father, he loved his siblings, and he was loyal to his friends. “Just a special kid,” Yacoubi said. Opportunity came in early December, when Coach Mo Hamood struck a deal to have Aljahmi fight in Youngstown against another amateur who was also turning pro. “He was ready,” Hamood said of his young flyweight. Aljahmi girded for the day. After telling his father that a door had opened, he posted a photograph on Instagram of his application for a Michigan boxing license, along with a note sharing the date of his debut fight  —   “DECEMBER 19th”  —   and asking people to come support him. “Alhamdulillah. ” Praise be to God. Making Final Preparations and Planning to Celebrate As the S. U. V. approached the outskirts of Youngstown, some three hours after leaving Dearborn, Hamzah Aljahmi stirred into consciousness. Looking around, he said that it was his turn to drive. His father laughed but surrendered the wheel. Father and son headed to the prefight   at a government building in downtown Youngstown. The younger Aljahmi’s     manner impressed the director of the Ohio Athletic Commission, a retired police officer and former referee named Bernie Profato  —   so much so that Profato told him, win or lose, “You’ll be welcome back in Ohio anytime. ” After the   Aljahmi joined his coach and the two amateurs from Dearborn, including an    with a preternatural punching ability, for some   at a Carrabba’s Italian restaurant, not far from their rooms at the Red Roof Inn. Aljahmi had pasta with cream sauce. Before the night was over, the eager boxer posted one last photograph of himself on Instagram. Big smile. Throwing a right fist at the camera. “Ready for 2mrw fight night everyone keep me in ur prayers inshallah,” he wrote. If Allah wills it. The next morning, Aljahmi and his father ate breakfast at an IHOP  —   eggs and turkey sausage for more weight gain  —   then returned to the hotel for a short rest and the long wait. Since the next day would be the father’s 51st birthday, the two Aljahmis talked about getting a cake. “Win and we’ll celebrate twice,” the father promised. With the time drawing near, they drove with Coach Mo and his two young amateurs to the    community hall of Sts. Peter and Paul Ukrainian Orthodox Church, on Youngstown’s west side. Joining them were four friends who had driven from Dearborn in a cramped   Toyota. Down in the hall’s chandeliered basement, where curtains separated boxers from the opponents they were about to meet, young Aljahmi chatted away as his coach prepared him for his debut. While Aljahmi sat with his arms propped on a white towel draped over a chair back, Coach Mo wrapped his boxer’s hands in protective gauze, carefully, almost clinically. He then slipped   gloves over those hands and tied the strings. Finally, to cut down on the rudeness of leather against skin, he applied petroleum jelly with his fingertips to the unlined brow, the fresh cheeks, and the chin too often left exposed in the rashness of youth. There was one last detail. With his first professional fight just moments away, Aljahmi still had no nickname. But if his opponent  —   a short fighter he had seen when the curtain between them suddenly opened  —   was calling himself the Tiger, then how about something just as feral? How about the Lion? Agreed. A protective entourage  —   his father, his coach, a few friends  —   escorted Aljahmi up the basement steps and into the   auditorium, a   bingo hall set up for a boxing event. Now here he was, for the night’s first professional fight, a   in the superflyweight division. In    shorts with matching red shoes, the dynamo from Dearborn. The pride of the   community. His father’s best friend. Hamzah “the Lion” Aljahmi. A Sudden Shift in Mood After the Opening Bell Before the first bell, Aljahmi had told Coach Mo that this was his time. I’m ready, Coach, he had said. Let’s get this thing going. Now it was going, but not well. Aljahmi’s opponent was quick, active, and crouched so small that he made for a difficult target. The sight of their Hamzah being pummeled startled his friends, who had been harboring a more abstract understanding of what it meant to box professionally. Then down Aljahmi went, tagged by a powerful left. His opponent had capitalized on the weakness that Coach Mo had been working on: the “boxing ” he called it, of leaving the chin exposed. “It felt like a movie when he went down,” Aljahmi’s friend Mohammad Yacoubi said. “He had gone into that ring like a superhero. ” A few seconds later, Aljahmi went down a second time, forcing Coach Mo to make quick assessments. His young boxer was more “wobbly” after the first knockdown, the coach later said, after taking a punch that was “right on the button. ” But the second one? “He had a little wobble,” he said. “But he can go. ” Aljahmi did bounce up quickly. He adjusted his trunks  —   as if recalibrating body and mind  —   and went back to work. Becoming more aggressive, he delivered a hard left that had his opponent backpedaling. Then, while trying to avoid a swing that seemed to hit more air than flesh, Aljahmi fell against the ropes. He might have simply tripped, but it was not an impressive way to end the first round. Two knockdowns and one stumble. He returned to his corner charged with energy. What did I do wrong, Coach? “Hamzah, your chin is way up in the air,” Hamood recalled saying. “And your right hand is down. ” Aljahmi went out to own the second round, exploiting his opponent’s fatigue and blocking out the shouts of a Youngstown crowd eager to see this    fall. When the bell rang, he all but ran back to his corner after leaving his weary opponent on the ropes. “Great job,” Coach Mo told Aljahmi. “Let’s keep doing what you’re doing. Use your jab. No need to wrestle with him. ” Aljahmi looked at his clutch of friends in the seats, smiled, nodded his head  —   and returned to the ring to follow his coach’s instructions exactly. Round 3 repeated Round 2. Although his opponent tagged him quickly with a left from nowhere, Aljahmi answered with a hard right to the chin. “There he goes!” Yacoubi, Aljahmi’s friend, shouted. Soon another Aljahmi right found purchase. “There you go! There you go! He’s tired! He’s tired! Hamzah, he’s tired!” This was true. Aljahmi’s opponent was still recovering from having fought so aggressively in the first round. His own coach was shouting for him to push through it  —   which he did, briefly, during a   flurry. The bell rang just as Aljahmi uncorked one more punch. A little late, it seemed, but clearly accidental. He tapped his opponent’s chest in apology. Coach Mo gave Aljahmi water and applied more petroleum jelly, that translucent touch of protection, to his eyebrows, cheeks and nose. “We need this round,” the coach said, as if to make clear to his boxer the tossup closeness of the fight. I got you, Coach. Aljahmi then leaned over, found his father in the crowd, and shook his right glove in a gesture that seemed to say now is the time. Now. He was so jacked up on adrenaline that he hurried to the center of the ring well before the bell. The   referee had to nudge him back a step or two, while his coach called after him that he was the toughest kid he knew. “Go get him,” Coach Mo commanded. The two superflyweights gave it their all, each determined not to lose his professional debut, as the crowd urged them on. “Give him one, Hamzah!” Aljahmi’s friends shouted. “There you go! More! More!” “Get him, get him, get him!” “Hamzah, get him! Hamzah, he’s done! He’s done!” “Keep going!” Then  —   a punch to their friend’s head. “Oooh!” Aljahmi, who had been dominating, was suddenly backed into a corner by his flailing opponent. “Get out of the corner!” a friend yelled. “Get out of the corner!” Too late. Their superhero was squat against the apron, dodging swings, lurching forward, grasping to hold on to something unseen, then falling, drooping, legs not cooperating, arms down. The referee stopped the fight, causing confusion about what had just happened. He tried to help Aljahmi to his feet, but the boxer could not find the strength. Panicking, Coach Mo rushed into the ring. “Good job, Hamzah!” he said, mistakenly thinking the bell had rung. “Get up. You won the fight!” I can’t. My knee. I twisted my knee. He leaned back, or maybe fell back, onto Coach Mo’s shins. Aljahmi’s father and friends had just been shouting that his opponent was “done” now they were mute. A moment ago their Hamzah had been controlling the fight now he was propped against his coach’s legs like a rag doll. A dermatologist serving as the ringside doctor slipped under the ropes and donned surgical gloves. The Lion lay flat on the mat. Then, Coach Mo said, “Hamzah closed his eyes. ” PART 3 YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio  —   The fearless young boxer feared what he would see, feared how he would be received. He lingered at the threshold of the surgical intensive care unit, unable to take those few short steps to the bedside of his comatose opponent. The boxer, Anthony Taylor, known for his        ferocity, froze under the unforgiving lights of crisis care at St. Elizabeth Youngstown Hospital, where a chorus of beeping monitors and exhaling respirators sang of lives at the precipice. He did not want to be here. That is, he wanted to be here, and his coach told him that he should be here, but he was frightened. In his gloveless hands he carried the shield of a bouquet, bright yellow flowers that were like dandelions, only nicer. A nurse asked if he needed help. Soon, a relative of the patient he had come to see invited him into a crowded room. There, in a small bed, with a white bandage wrapped around his head and a blue air tube running from his mouth, was the man Taylor had recently danced and fought with: Hamzah Aljahmi, 19, his eyes still closed. Taylor handed the flowers to someone and sat in a chair near the foot of the bed, stunned. To think that less than 72 hours earlier, he and this person had each been paid a few hundred dollars to fight their first professional fight, a   in the hall of a Ukrainian church. To think how they had stared into each other’s eyes while engaged in a most violent form of intimacy. It could be    Anthony Taylor in that bed, not Hamzah Aljahmi. Now Anthony would be spending the holidays with his family, while Hamzah.   …     The visitor began to cry. Ali Aljahmi, a first cousin, was moved, even impressed, by the sight of this distraught stranger paying his respects. For you to step into this room of anger and grief, Aljahmi thought to himself. For you to come to be with us. Takes a lot of strength. The cousin led Taylor into the hall to offer comforting perspective. Whatever was happening in that hospital room was Allah’s will, he said, and do not doubt that you helped Hamzah to realize his dream of becoming a professional boxer. One more thing, Aljahmi said. “You have become family with me forever for this kind of gesture. ” Taylor returned to the room and, for the next hour, talked with the father, an uncle and a few cousins of the man laid out before them, the black of his eyebrows enhanced by an enveloping whiteness of bandages and blankets. “They told me they wanted me to keep going,” Taylor recalled. “That he would want me to keep going, and that I have to honor him and keep him alive by continuing to box. ” The father, also named Ali Aljahmi, would only vaguely remember Taylor’s visit, so   were his waves of grief. He had been at the fight. He had seen his beloved son, a determined fighter, crumple to the blue mat. Not in direct response to any punch, it seemed, but almost as an afterthought. The elder Aljahmi had been here in this chilling, antiseptic environment ever since, save for when nurses would gently tell him it was time to leave for the night. He’d return to a hotel whose name he would not remember and try to avoid the many anxious telephone calls from family members and friends back in their hometown of Dearborn. How is Hamzah? How is Hamzah? How is Hamzah? The father did not want to answer. If he did respond, it was to tell a version of the truth: “Hamzah is sleeping. ” Finally, the father telephoned a nephew in Dearborn with the same name as his: Ali Aljahmi, Hamzah’s cousin. I need you to bring Hamzah’s mother here to Youngstown, Ali. She needs to see him. The nephew understood what his uncle was not saying. He did as he was told. He packed Hamzah’s mother, Jamilah Aljahmi, and other relatives into a borrowed Chevy Cruze and began to drive, listening to them cry because Hamzah had been injured, but knowing that worse news awaited them in Youngstown. The mother saw her child wrapped in white, as if already prepared for the coffin. She held his feet, felt warmth, and in her profound grief exclaimed that he was alive! All this was too much for her health, it was decided. A relative drove Hamzah’s mother and the other women back to Dearborn. To wait for what was to be. But the father clung to hope as his son had clung to the ropes. He arose one morning in that strange hotel feeling as though all would be well. These efficient people in lab coats and nursing outfits would find some   equivalent of smelling salts, and his son’s eyes would open. Finally, though, the father let go. Shedding his stoicism, he collapsed onto his son’s chest and begged between sobs that Hamzah rise and come with him to IHOP for another restorative meal. Please, Hamzah, he implored. Do not leave your best friend like this. The shaken cousin, Ali Aljahmi, sought out the neurosurgeon and asked to be told straight, so that the family could prepare. “He said in 30 years he hadn’t seen a brain so damaged,” he remembered. “He told me  : Start making arrangements. ” By this point, Anthony Taylor the boxer had said his hospital goodbyes and driven his dented Dodge Caravan the 20 miles back to the weathered white house he rented with his fiancée. Exhausted by it all, he fell asleep, only to awake an hour later to a text message aglow on his phone. Hamzah Aljahmi was dead. A Tribute to a Man Who ‘Was Everything’ After the autopsy, a Youngstown funeral home arranged to return Hamzah Aljahmi to Michigan, retracing his interstate journey past the deadened brown of a Rust Belt December, to a funeral home in Detroit, close to the Dearborn line. A handful of relatives and friends, all men, prepared the young body for burial. They prayed as they tended to their somber task, while verses of the Quran emanated from a loudspeaker. The dead young man was laid upon a table. Fingernails and toenails were clipped. The body was meticulously cleansed and gently rubbed with a scented oil that made the skin glisten  —   “The smell was very beautiful,” the cousin Ali Aljahmi said. Then it was wrapped in three sheets of white cloth. The boxer was placed in a   coffin made of fiberboard and cardboard, in keeping with an adherence to simplicity. A pleasant perfume was sprinkled over the burial cloth. Late the next morning, a dark blue Dodge Caravan hearse carried the body the seven miles to the American Moslem Society mosque, a   building topped with a turquoise dome. Hundreds were already gathering in the parking lot. Family members shelved their shoes and carried the modest coffin up the stairs, past the small brown donation boxes and into a   area reserved for women, at the far back of the cavernous hall. The sounds of weeping escaped the divide. The coffin, draped in a    cloth, was then moved to one side of the long rectangular hall, where mourners paid their respects to many, many relatives: the extended Aljahmi tribe. The father, Ali Aljahmi, sat in the first chair, and in the second, at the family’s insistence, was Mohamed Hamood  —   Coach Mo  —   Hamzah’s   trainer. The mourning paused for the afternoon prayer. Long rows of men and boys, including many not before seen at the mosque, stood shoulder to shoulder on the    carpet with patterns pointing toward Mecca. They spilled into the downstairs space and out into the parking lot. After the afternoon prayer, relatives carried the coffin to the front of the room. The imam led a short funeral service that included prayers for forgiveness, for Hamzah Aljahmi, for all of humankind, and for mercy upon the family. Allahu akbar. God is great. It was time for burial. The shoeless pallbearers descended the stairs to meet the December cold and the jostle of thousands. They walked with purpose across the lot, some slipping into shoes as they went, carving a path through a human crush that was affecting traffic along Vernor Highway. Many vied to touch the coffin, while others competed for an honored turn as a pallbearer. But why so many mourners for a    man? People explain that Hamzah Aljahmi “died in action” that he represented the Yemeni embrace of boxing that he made friends with Arabs and   black, white, male, female that he embodied an infectious liveliness. “He was everything, to be honest with you,” Ibrahim Aljahim, a cousin and community leader, said. Another cousin, Fayez Algahmi, a former honorary consul of Yemen, agreed. “The way he died, and the thing he died for, touched everyone,” Algahmi said. The funeral procession turned right onto Riverside Drive, along which the rusty   fence of Woodmere Cemetery disappears into the distance. Now and then the undulations in the cemetery’s brown grass revealed the   tops of tombstones. Chanting prayers as they walked, the mourners turned left at a gate to enter the cemetery, many of them forming a protective bubble around the raised coffin. The occasional cold breeze ruffled its drape of    cloth. Near the grave site, relatives opened the coffin one more time, so that the father and a few others could say their final goodbyes. “I gave him a bunch of kisses on the forehead,” his first cousin Ali Aljahmi recalled. In keeping with Islamic ritual, the body was turned on its right side to face Mecca, and some dirt was placed beside it. The coffin was closed, and lowered into its concrete rectangular case. Then mourner after mourner threw dirt three times into the hole, signifying the beginning and end of things. God is great, they whispered. To God we belong, and to him we shall return. The communal grieving did not end at the grave. For weeks afterward, streams of people came to the Aljahmi family’s simple home to offer condolences and distraction. Among them were many young people seeking some token or relic of their friend the boxer, Hamzah the Lion. A  . A jacket. A shoe. A ribbon. A trophy. Of course, of course, the brokenhearted father would say. “I don’t close the door,” he explained. A Fighter Finds Comfort in Someone Who Understands On the tough south side of Youngstown, in the squat   refuge called Jack Loew’s South Side Boxing Club, the boxing life continues for Anthony Taylor. He and other   champions punch bags and skip rope, spar with partners and obey the sign that says “no weapon of any kind”  —   other than fists. Taylor had taken some time off after the Hamzah Aljahmi fight to get his body and mind straight. His right hand had been damaged, among other parts. True, the first time Taylor returned to the ring to spar, he froze for a moment. (“I was waiting on him, and he hit me, and hit me again,” he says. “And I was like, O. K. ”) But now the Tiger is back, shorn of his dreadlocks and preparing for his second professional fight, which is scheduled to be at the same venue, Sts. Peter and Paul Ukrainian Orthodox Church. He’ll be taking his chances, once again, in a bingo hall. “I can’t walk in there thinking about what happened,” Taylor says, as if trying to convince himself. “You can’t change what’s happened in the past. I wish I could. ” As Taylor works out, his coach, Jack Loew, sits in his back office, the walls covered with boxing memorabilia, a broken speed bag on his desk. He was the promoter behind that fatal boxing event, and he has wept over Aljahmi’s death. “You don’t think about stuff like that,” Loew says, voice cracking. “A frigging club show with   for four rounds. ” A few loose ends from that night remain to be tied. For one thing, the Mahoning County coroner has yet to release the results of his autopsy (although the weakness in Aljahmi’s right leg that night could be suggestive of a left hemispheric brain bleed). This is why Bernie Profato, the Ohio Athletic Commission’s director, has not formally closed the case, although he says his own inquiry found no lapses of protocol by the commission he oversees. Profato is also haunted by the memory of this polite young man, such a model of respect at the  . But the inherent dangers are made plain in the contracts signed by boxers, including these two   pros, Taylor and Aljahmi. “You’re entering a sport where you could be seriously hurt or injured,” Profato says. “They know that. That’s just the nature of the sport. ” A childhood friend of Loew’s comes through the boxing club’s door: Ray Mancini, the onetime lightweight world champion, known in Youngstown and far beyond as Boom Boom. Unfairly, he is also known for one fight:   Kim, Las Vegas, 1982. Mancini connected with two hard rights to Kim’s head at the start of the 14th round, sending the tenacious South Korean challenger to the canvas and prompting the referee to declare a technical knockout. Incurring a brain bleed known as a subdural hematoma, Kim lapsed into a coma and died four days later. He was 27. Mancini was 21. It took years, but Mancini worked his way through the depression and   that followed. Even though he eventually forgave himself and made peace with the tragedy, he says, others have shown less grace over the years. “Hey, Boom Boom,” he mimics. “Hey, man, let me ask you something. What’s it like to kill somebody in the ring? I mean, what’s it like to see someone go down and never get up?” Mancini is 54 now,   and fit, with various business and entertainment interests. He has come to his friend’s club this evening to counsel the young boxer with whom he shares a sorrowful bond. He wants to talk about forgiveness, and loudmouths, and giving up the game if there is even the slightest hesitation in the ring. Loew heads for the door in search of his boxer Taylor, saying, “I don’t even know where this kid is at. ” Soon Anthony Taylor, fresh from the stutter of speed bags and the whack of skipped rope, is in the   quiet, sitting shyly across from the Boom Boom Mancini like a confessor before a priest. “Really sad for you, man,” Mancini begins. “I never met you before, but.   …    ”",0

7879,Trump victory: A new political awakening,"Trump victory: A new political awakening 09.11.2016 Donald Trump's historic Challenge victory over Hillary Clinton's Establishment saw another law being written in the modern geopolitical rule book in a world where globalization has marginalized millions, for whom ""change"" can only mean something better. Trump translates as businesslike pragmatism... Donald Trump won a brilliant victory over Hillary Clinton for one clear reason: because he adoped a businesslike and pragmatic approach, directing his message at his target, dealing the cards throughout the game and delivering what people wanted to hear. The target Around a quarter of the electorate in the United States of America live on under one thousand USD per month; a substantial slice of the electorate is one paycheck away from the street. Globalization has meant little for these people, other than fewer jobs, as factories relocate abroad to the Philippines and as Filipinos come home to work for less and to drive down wages. Donald Trump understood the discourse of America's blue-collar workers and on election day, they turned out en masse . The opinion polls Print version Font Size However, the Trump vote was also an anti-establishment one and this was the magical hidden number of voters who eluded the election pundits and opinion poll makers. Those who regard the Establishment as having failed them participate neither in re-electing the Establishment, nor in participating in any of its mechanisms, including opinion polls, so these cannot take into account a growing percentage of the population and this by far exceeds the three per cent margin of error the pundits work with. Today, the opinion polls have become meaningless. Dealing the cards Throughout the campaign, Donald Trump appealed as the dealer even on polemical issues. The Mexican Wall had Hillary supporters crying blue murder and had the Mexican President jumping up and down as the world media buzzed. But Trump dealt the card. Ditto women's rights, immigration, Moslems, terrorists in America's communities and all other sexy soundbites from start to finish. Trump was out there, sometimes visiting five States a day while Hillary Clinton became famous for her prolonged absences. Delivering what people wanted to hear Clinton, as the Establishment candidate, could only offer more of the same (how can you speak about ""change"" when you have been part of the system for three decades and how much change did Obama deliver?) Trump, as the Challenger, played his role to perfection, attacking the system, promising much more in terms of jobs, working conditions and prosperity. Foreign policy Again, Trump has been making the sounds of a businessman and a pragmatist in relation to foreign policy. A businessman likes a level playing field, a businessman likes to set and know and play by the rules, clear rules, a businessman has values, a businessman respects his partners and tries to get along with them. This, if the Trump presidency is not hijacked by a cabal of lobbies, if Trump himself is not neutered, or worse, will dictate a businesslike and fresh start for the international community. Conclusion Hillary Clinton's embodiment of the Establishment, as an insider, saw her regarded as being out of touch in the corridors of power. The allegations surrounding the way the Clinton Foundation was perceived as a mechanism to facilitate favors in return for donations did nothing to further her cause and the arrogance with which she and the Democrats conducted policy, such as the interference in Ukraine, such as her giggling fit when told that terrorists had murdered Gaddafi, such as the continuation of the policy of siding with terrorists in Syria, served her political epitaph in this election and placed a heavy tombstone on her career. In a word, Hillary ""almost"" Clinton. For Trump, with both Houses in his favor, the cards are stacked for him to start dealing. I repeat, if the lobbies do not neuter him, or worse, he may be the best dealer the USA has had for many decades. And time will tell. Donald Trump may be out of the box but he is not out of his mind.

7880,Silent Counter-Coup by 17 Intel Agencies To Stop Crooked Clintons [Video],"Leave a reply 
Bill Still – Good evening, I’m still reporting on an ongoing counter-coup being run by patriotic members of 17 U.S. intelligence agencies to stop the Clinton Crime syndicate from proceeding with the rigging of the coming election. 
According to a 4 minute video, done by Dr. Steve Pieczenik, a Harvard and MIT-educated psychiatrist who has written 26 New York Times Best Sellers, the Clinton coup has been put down by an intelligence community counter-coup, effective at noon today. 
Dr. Pieczenik has great contacts in the American intelligence community. He put the following video up on his YouTube channel at noon today and says that the channel was down twenty minutes later. 
Currently, that channel is up, so perhaps our channel will not be harmed. 
I believe what you are about to see is true because of the nature of the recent WikiLeaks revelations. To me, hackers could not have done this. To me, white hats at NSA had to have been involved. 
Having spent my adult life working around the community, I knew that folks who were at most of these agencies – exempting DHS and CIA – are American patriots who would not allow this nation to be destroyed by the Clinton Crime Syndicate. 
[insert] 
This may well be the reason President Obama yesterday had his press secretary praise the work of Jim Comey, head of the FBI, at the very moment that Hillary Clinton was speaking in Florida deriding Comey.

7881,Fyre Festival Organizers Slapped with $100 Million Fraud Lawsuit,"Organizers of the   Fyre Festival  —   a promised “luxury” music festival in the Bahamas that left guests who paid tens of thousands of dollars scrambling immediately to find flights home  —   have been hit with a $100 million lawsuit alleging the whole enterprise was a “   scam” from the beginning. [Attorney Mark Geragos filed the $100 million proposed   lawsuit in California Sunday on behalf of client and festival attendee Daniel Jung, Billboard reports.  The claim alleges that Fyre organizers  —   namely, the rapper Ja Rule and    entrepreneur Billy McFarland  —   attempted to “fleece attendees for hundreds of millions of dollars by inducing them to fly to a remote island without food, shelter or water —  and without regard to what might happen to them after that. ” Ticket buyers  —   some of whom spent up to a reported $200, 000 on the most luxurious festival accommodations  —   arrived at the Island of Exumas on Thursday to find a festival site in disarray, with unfinished infrastructure and stages, disaster relief tents in place of luxury villas, and “gourmet” bread and cheese sandwiches in a cafeteria organizers had promised would be staffed by a celebrity chef. The festival  —   which had been heavily promoted for months by models and influential social media personalities including Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid and Hailey Baldwin  —  had been billed as a unique “cultural experience,” with planned performances from   and the rappers Tyga and Desiigner, and opulent ticket packages offering the ability to charter a yacht. The festival’s official video promised the island was once owned by legendary drug kingpin Pablo Escobar.  But guests who made it to the island reported seeing wet, soggy tents, a lack of security and food, and even stray animals roaming the campgrounds. After organizers cancelled the event Friday, attendees struggled to schedule return flights home as the Island of Exumas’ tiny airport was overrun with   travelers. In the lawsuit, Geragos alleges that the festival was “more like The Hunger Games or Lord of the Flies than Coachella,” according to Billboard. The suit alleges fraud, breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, with Geragos charging that the island was not “private,” as had been advertised, and had never been owned by Escobar. The lawsuit also claims that Rule and McFarland knew the festival would be a catastrophe and warned   promoters not to attend. “They called all the   names and the modeling agencies and told them not to come,” a source told the New York Post‘s Page Six over the weekend. “They were just like, ‘Oh, come next weekend when all the kinks have been worked out.’ This was before the chaos even started. ” Organizers issued a statement to Billboard claiming “full responsibility” for the festival, but promised full refunds and VIP accommodations to next year’s event, which they said would take place at a “United States beach venue. ” “We apologize for any inconvenience the past   has caused and we look forward to making a considerable donation to the Bahamas Red Cross Society as part of our initiatives,” the organizers wrote. “We need to make this right. And once we make this right, then we will put on the dream festival we sought to have since the inception of Fyre. ”   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum",0
7882,"Yemeni Bankers Get in Trouble Over a Customer, Al Qaeda - The New York Times","AL SHIHR, Yemen  —   When fighters from Al Qaeda seized control of a stretch of southern Yemen in 2015, they looted millions of dollars from the central bank, spreading such fear that other banks shut down. But during the year Al Qaeda reigned, Al Omgy Brothers Money Exchange kept running its business here in the coastal town of Al Shihr. It held accounts for the national oil company, disbursed salaries for the Yemeni government and earned the praise of local officials for providing needed services during a tough time. And if members of Al Qaeda wanted to open accounts, too, well, the company could not really say no, according to Muhammad   who runs the money exchange with his brother, Said. The United States was not impressed. This month, the United States Treasury Department designated the brothers and their company as having provided “financial services to or in support of” Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which is widely considered to be the terrorist group’s most dangerous branch. Any of their assets subject to United States jurisdiction are blocked, and Americans are generally prohibited from having transactions with them. During an interview in his office here, Mr. Omgy acknowledged that his company had provided financial services to Al Qaeda. “We had no other option but to comply with them,” he said. “They were the rulers of the city. ” But he denied the Treasury Department’s charge that he was a Qaeda member, describing his ties to the group as a business relationship that had ended. “They withdrew their money before they left the city,” he said. The case of the Omgy brothers is a small but telling account of the chaos that has engulfed Yemen, the southernmost country on the Arabian Peninsula and the Arab world’s poorest state. Since 2011, when protests erupted against the previous president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, much of the state has collapsed, and armed tribes and militias have taken control of significant territory. In 2014, rebels from the north known as the Houthis stormed the capital, Sana, forcing the government into exile and dividing the country. The Houthis now control the northwest, including the capital, where they have struggled to exert authority over what remains of the government. Much of the south and east are held by forces backed by Persian Gulf nations and are nominally loyal to the exiled president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi. So much upheaval has often left struggling Yemenis to deal with whichever armed group has most recently taken control. And so it was in April 2015, when Qaeda fighters seized territory along Yemen’s southern coast  —   and turned to the Omgy brothers for their banking needs. Mr. Omgy was so upset by the charge against him that he invited an employee of The New York Times to his office in Al Shihr to tell his side of the story. His headquarters bore testament to the business’s success, with green marble floors, comfortable sofas and central    —   a luxury in a country where millions struggle to find enough food, much less power to charge their phones. Three new Lexus sport utility vehicles were parked outside. The brothers opened their first money exchange in 1990 and now have 95 offices across Yemen that work like banks, holding accounts and performing inexpensive money transfers, Mr. Omgy said. “I received the news from social media and news sites,” Mr. Omgy said of the Americans’ designation of him as a Qaeda member. “I have never financed Qaeda activities nor joined the organization. ” He did, however, acknowledge doing the group’s banking. After the militants seized the area, the brothers closed their offices, he said, but reopened because none of the banks would. The local branch of Yemen’s national oil company maintained an account, as did the civilian council that helped run local affairs. Even the government relied on the company to get salaries to its employees, according to Yemeni officials. The United States said in its designation that a Qaeda official in charge of taxation had held an account with Al Omgy from which he sent money to militants around Yemen. It also said that early this year Al Qaeda ordered the oil company to transfer more than $1 million to Al Omgy “to support terrorist activities. ” Mr. Omgy said he had been forced to give the militants accounts. “We opened the accounts when they threatened us,” he said. Then, to pay their taxes, the oil company and local businessmen would ask Al Omgy to transfer money from their accounts to those of Al Qaeda. He denied that the company had paid Al Qaeda a 10 percent commission on all transactions, as the United States also charged, but said that individual Qaeda members could have transferred money through the company. “We have branches everywhere,” he said. “We could not reject their orders. ” He dismissed the rest of the United States’ charges, that he had smuggled arms for Al Qaeda and that his brother had raised funds for the Iraqi insurgency. “I have neither political nor religious affiliations,” he said. Staying open had been the only way the company could provide services for others, he said, including the Yemeni government, which the United States considers an ally against Al Qaeda. “The government asked us to turn to Al Omgy,” said Saeed Bahmran, who works for the Education Ministry in Al Mukalla, a nearby city also seized by Al Qaeda. “Al Omgy has branches everywhere, and we can get our salaries at anytime, even at midnight. ” Mohammed Sharem, the director of the local branch of the national oil company during Al Qaeda’s control, said, “Our relationship with Al Omgy is strong and it is an excellent company. ” He said   gas stations deposited their profits directly into the oil company’s account with Al Omgy, and kept doing so after Yemeni forces pushed Al Qaeda out in April 2016. After the designation, the governor of Hadramawt Province blasted the decision in a statement, saying the Omgy brothers had “stood with the sons of the province during the hardest and most complicated times. ” Mr. Omgy is unsure how the designation, which the Americans made in cooperation with the United Arab Emirates, will affect his business, as he has no assets in either country. But he is looking for ways to challenge a decision that he says has tarnished his name. Its effects may have already hit others. A soldier with the local force supported by the United Arab Emirates in southern Yemen said that so many of his colleagues used to get their salaries through Al Omgy that the company would deliver the cash to their base to prevent backups at its branches. But last month, their pay did not come. “This is the first time they haven’t paid our salaries,” said the soldier, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being associated with a company associated with Al Qaeda.",0
7883,"Os Estados Unidos vão reformar-se, ou dilacerar-se?, Thierry Meyssan","Os Estados Unidos vão reformar-se, ou dilacerar-se? Thierry Meyssan Ao observar a campanha eleitoral presidencial norte-americana, Thierry Meyssan analisa a ressurgência de um velho e grande conflito civilizacional. Hillary Clinton acaba de declarar que esta eleição não versava sobre programas, mas sobre a questão de saber «Quem são os Americanos?». Não é baseados em questões políticas que os tenores republicanos acabam de retirar o seu apoio ao seu candidato, Donald Trump, mas antes a propósito do seu comportamento pessoal. Segundo o nosso autor, até à data presente, os Norte-americanos eram emigrantes vindos de horizontes diferentes e aceitando submeter-se à ideologia de uma comunidade especial. É este modelo que está em vias de se desfazer, com o risco de estilhaçar o próprio país.
Rede Voltaire | Damasco (Síria) | 26 de Outubro de 2016 français Español italiano русский English Deutsch ελληνικά Türkçe عربي No decurso do ano de campanha eleitoral norte-americana que estamos a acabar de atravessar, a retórica mudou profundamente e uma clivagem inesperada surgiu entre os dois campos. Se, à partida, os candidatos falavam de assuntos basicamente políticos (tais como a repartição de riqueza ou a segurança nacional), agora eles tratam principalmente de sexo e dinheiro.
Foi este discurso, e não as questões políticas, o que fez explodir o Partido Republicano –-cujos principais líderes retiraram o apoio ao seu candidato–- e que reformula o tabuleiro político, fazendo ressurgir uma clivagem civilizacional muito velha. De um lado, a senhora Clinton pretende ser politicamente correcta, enquanto do outro «O Donald» fez voar em estilhaços a hipocrisia da antiga «primeira Dama».
De um lado, Hillary Clinton promove a igualdade homens/mulheres, muito embora ela jamais tenha hesitado em atacar e emporcalhar as mulheres que revelavam ter-se deitado com o seu marido; que se apresenta não pelas suas qualidades pessoais, mas enquanto esposa de um anterior presidente, e que ela acusa Donald Trump de misoginia porque ele não esconde o seu gosto pela espécie feminina. Do outro lado, Donald Trump denuncia a privatização do Estado, e a extorsão de personalidades estrangeiras pela Fundação Clinton, sempre que queriam obter acesso ao Departamento de Estado; a criação do ObamaCare, não no interesse dos cidadãos mas para benefício dos Seguros médicos; e vai até ao ponto de pôr em causa a idoneidade do sistema eleitoral.
Estou perfeitamente ciente que a maneira como Donald Trump se exprime encoraja de facto o racismo, mas não acho de todo que isto esteja no centro do debate eleitoral apesar do martelar que os média(mídia) pró-Clinton fazem a propósito.
Não é indiferente que, aquando do escândalo Lewinsky, o presidente Bill Clinton tenha apresentado as suas desculpas à Nação e tenha reunido Pastores para rezar pela sua salvação. Enquanto ao ser posto em causa por factos parecidos, numa gravação áudio, Donald Trump se tenha contentado a apresentar as suas desculpas às pessoas atingidas, sem fazer apelo a membros do clero.
A clivagem actual retoma a revolta de valores dos Católicos, de Ortodoxos, e de Luteranos, contra os dos Calvinistas, representados nos Estados Unidos principalmente pelos Presbiterianos, Baptistas e os Metodistas.
Mesmo se os dois candidatos foram educados na tradição puritana (Clinton como Metodista e Trump como Presbiteriano), H.Clinton retornou à religião pela morte do seu pai e participa hoje em dia no grupo de oração dos chefes do estado-maior das forças armadas, The Family («A Família»- ndT), enquanto Trump segue uma espiritualidade mais interiorizada e não frequenta habitualmente os templos.
É claro, ninguém fica fechado nos padrões em que foi criado. Mas, quando se age sem reflexão, podemos reproduzi-los de forma inconsciente. A questão do ambiente religioso de cada um pode portanto ser importante.
Para entender o que está em jogo, é preciso voltar à Inglaterra do século XVII. Oliver Cromwell derruba, com um golpe de Estado militar, o rei Carlos Iº. Ele pretendeu instaurar uma República, purificar a alma do país, e assim fez decapitar o antigo soberano. Criou um regime sectário inspirado nas ideias de Calvino, massacrou os Irlandeses papistas em massa, e impôs um modo de vida puritano. Concebeu também o sionismo: ele chamou à atenção para os judeus em Inglaterra e foi o primeiro chefe de Estado, no mundo, a reivindicar a criação de um Estado judeu na Palestina. Este episódio sangrento é conhecido com o nome de «Primeira Guerra civil britânica».
Após a restauração da monarquia, os Puritanos de Cromwell fugiram da Inglaterra. Eles instalaram-se nos Países Baixos, de onde alguns de entre eles partiram a bordo do Mayflower para as Américas (os chamados “Pais Peregrinos""), enquanto outros fundaram a comunidade Afrikaner na África Austral. Aquando da guerra de independência dos Estados Unidos, no século XVIII, reviu-se o confronto dos Calvinistas contra a Monarquia britânica, de tal modo que nos manuais actuais de História Britânica, designam-na como a «Segunda Guerra civil».
No século XIX, a Guerra de Secessão opôs os Estados do Sul (sobretudo habitados por colonos católicos) aos do Norte (principalmente habitados por colonos protestantes). A História dos vencedores apresenta este confronto como uma luta pela Liberdade face à Escravatura, o que é pura propaganda (os Estados do Sul aboliram a escravatura durante a guerra, quando fecharam uma aliança com a monarquia britânica). Com efeito, regressa-se ao enfrentamento dos Puritanos contra o Trono inglês, razão pela qual certos historiadores falam aqui de uma «Terceira Guerra civil britânica».
Durante o século XX, este enfrentamento interno da civilização britânica parecia ultrapassado, fora o ressurgimento dos Puritanos ao Reino Unido com «os cristãos não-conformistas» do primeiro-ministro David Lloyd George. Estes últimos dividiram a Irlanda e dedicaram-se a criar o «Lar nacional judaico» na Palestina.
Seja como fôr, um dos conselheiros de Richard Nixon, Kevin Phillips, consagrou uma volumosa tese a estas guerras civis, constatando que nenhum dos problemas estava resolvido e anunciou uma quarta volta [ 1 ].
Os adeptos das Igrejas calvinistas, que desde há 40 anos votavam maciçamente pelos Republicanos, apoiam agora os Democratas.
Eu não duvido que H. Clinton será a próxima Presidente dos Estados Unidos, ou que se Trump fosse eleito, ele seria rapidamente eliminado. Mas, em alguns meses, assiste-se a uma ampla redistribuição eleitoral sobre o fundo de uma evolução demográfica irreversível. As Igrejas vindas dos Puritanos não somam mais que um quarto da população e basculam para o campo Democrata. O seu modelo aparece como um acidente histórico. Ele já desapareceu na África do Sul e não poderá sobreviver ainda por muito mais tempo, nem nos Estados Unidos, nem em Israel.
Para além da eleição presidencial, a sociedade dos EUA deve evoluir rapidamente ou irá dilacerar-se novamente. Num país onde o juventude rejeita maciçamente a influência dos pregadores puritanos, não é mais possível mover a questão da igualdade. Os puritanos idealizam uma sociedade onde os homens são todos iguais, mas não equivalentes. Lorde Cromwell queria uma República para o Ingleses, mas só depois de ter massacrado os papistas Irlandeses. É assim que actualmente nos Estados Unidos, todos os cidadãos são iguais perante a lei mas, em nome dos mesmos textos, os tribunais condenam sistematicamente negros enquanto encontram circunstâncias atenuantes no caso de brancos tendo cometido crimes ou delitos equivalentes. E, na maioria dos Estados, uma condenação penal, mesmo por um excesso de velocidade, basta para retirar o direito de voto. Por conseguinte, brancos e negros são iguais, mas em alguns Estados, a maioria dos negros tem legalmente sido privada do seu direito de voto. O paradigma deste pensamento, em política externa, é a «solução de dois Estados» na Palestina: iguais, mas acima de tudo não equivalentes.
Foi o pensamento puritano que orientou as administrações do Pastor Carter, de Reagan, de Bush (o Sr. e o Jr. são dois descendentes directos dos “Pais Peregrinos”), de Clinton e de Obama a apoiar o wahabismo, em contradição com os ideais propagados pelo seu país, e hoje em dia a apoiar o Daesh(E.I.).
No passado, os “Pais Peregrinos” fundaram comunidades em Plymouth e Boston, que foram mitificadas na memória colectiva americana. Contudo os historiadores são rigorosos. Eles afirmavam construir o «Novo Israel» e escolheram a «Lei de Moisés». Eles não colocaram a Cruz nos seus templos, mas, sim as Tábuas da Lei. Muito embora cristãos, atribuíam mais importância às Escrituras Judaicas que aos Evangelhos. Eles obrigaram as suas mulheres a tapar a cabeça com véu e restabeleceram os castigos corporais.

7884,IS THIS WHY COMEY BROKE: A STACK OF RESIGNATION LETTERS FROM FURIOUS FBI AGENTS,"Home › POLITICS › IS THIS WHY COMEY BROKE: A STACK OF RESIGNATION LETTERS FROM FURIOUS FBI AGENTS IS THIS WHY COMEY BROKE: A STACK OF RESIGNATION LETTERS FROM FURIOUS FBI AGENTS 0 SHARES 
[10/31/16] Conspiracy theories have swirled in recent days as to why FBI Director James Comey reopened Hillary’s email investigation after just closing it back in July concluding that, although Hillary had demonstrated gross negligence in her establishment of a private email server, that “no reasonable prosecutor” would bring a case against her. Democrats, after lavishing Comey with praise for months on concluding his investigation in an “impartial” way, have since lashed out at him for seeking to influence the 2016 election cycle with Hillary herself describing his recent actions as “deeply troubling”. Republicans, on the other hand, have praised Comey’s recent efforts as an attempt to correct a corrupt investigation that seemingly ignored critical evidence while granting numerous immunity agreements to Clinton staffers. 
According to the Daily Mail , and a source close to James Comey, the decision, at least in part, came after he “could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the FBI” who “felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist.” 
James Comey’s decision to revive the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email server and her handling of classified material came after he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the FBI , including some of his top deputies, according to a source close to the embattled FBI director. 
‘The atmosphere at the FBI has been toxic ever since Jim announced last July that he wouldn’t recommend an indictment against Hillary,’ said the source, a close friend who has known Comey for nearly two decades, shares family outings with him, and accompanies him to Catholic mass every week. 
‘Some people, including department heads, stopped talking to Jim, and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall,’ said the source. ‘They felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist.’ 
According to the source, Comey fretted over the problem for months and discussed it at great length with his wife, Patrice. 
He told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents. The letters reminded him every day that morale in the FBI had hit rock bottom. 
‘The people he trusts the most have been the angriest at him,’ the source continued. ‘And that includes his wife, Pat. She kept urging him to admit that he had been wrong when he refused to press charges against the former secretary of state. 
Though we’re sure there are many facets behind Comey’s decision making process, we can all be quite certain, at this point, that he’s not motivated by a desire to make friends having now alienated just about everyone in Washington, both in law enforcement and in both political parties. In fact, after Tim Kaine just last week praised Comey as a “wonderful” career public servant with the “highest standards of integrity” …. Post navigation",0
7885,"Colin Powell, in Hacked Emails, Shows Scorn for Trump and Irritation at Clinton - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   Former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell has long been one of the high priests of the Washington establishment, staying quiet in this year’s raucous presidential campaign while tending to his reputation as a thoughtful officer and diplomat. But a hack of Mr. Powell’s email this week has ripped away the diplomatic jargon and political niceties to reveal his unvarnished disdain of Donald J. Trump as a “national disgrace,” his personal peeves with Hillary Clinton and his lingering, but still very raw, anger with the Republican colleagues with whom he so often clashed a decade ago. There has been an expectation that Mr. Powell, who waited until the final weeks to endorse Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, would do the same for Mrs. Clinton this year. But in one 2014 email released online, Mr. Powell lamented that while he respected Mrs. Clinton, he would “rather not have to vote for her,” describing the Democratic presidential nominee as having “a long track record, unbridled ambition, greedy, not transformational. ” The emails make clear that if Mr. Powell endorses Mrs. Clinton, he will be motivated by intense feelings about Mr. Trump, whom he also called an “international pariah. ” In the email messages, which an aide to Mr. Powell confirmed were authentic, the retired   general who served as President George W. Bush’s top diplomat also accuses Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee for president, of having embraced what Mr. Powell called a “racist” movement when he aggressively questioned the validity of Mr. Obama’s birth certificate and his legitimacy to serve as the country’s top elected official. But the emails, many of which were sent in recent weeks, also reveal Mr. Powell’s disapproval of Mrs. Clinton’s handling of her email scandal and expose his sometimes unflattering observations of the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband. In a series of exchanges, Mr. Powell lamented efforts by Mrs. Clinton’s “minions” to drag him into the controversy surrounding her use of a private email server by claiming he had advised her on the issue. “H. R. C. could have killed this two years ago by merely telling everyone honestly what she had done and not tie me into it,” Mr. Powell wrote late last month, referring to Mrs. Clinton by her initials. “I told her staff three times not to try that gambit. I had to throw a   at a Hamptons party to get their attention. She keeps tripping into these ‘character’ minefields. ” In the 2014 email, Mr. Powell, though offering no independent knowledge, alluded in graphic language to coverage in The New York Post suggesting that Bill Clinton had continued to cheat on his wife. The emails, some of which were first reported by BuzzFeed News, also show Mr. Powell venting about some members of Mr. Bush’s administration. In one reference to Donald H. Rumsfeld, the former defense secretary, he accuses “the idiot Rummy” of being disloyal to both President Bushes. In another email, Mr. Powell calls Dick Cheney, the former vice president, and his daughter Liz Cheney “idiots and a spent force peddling a book that ain’t going nowhere. ” Mr. Powell appeared to be angry that NBC proposed that he appear on “Meet the Press” with Mr. Cheney and his daughter, who were promoting a book they wrote together. In the email, Mr. Powell said the network agreed to invite the Cheneys at a later date. Mr. Powell’s emails appeared on a website called DCLeaks. com, which had previously posted documents that the site had obtained after hacks into the accounts of prominent Democrats and some Republicans, including Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, the former commander of NATO forces in Europe, and George Soros, a wealthy backer of liberal causes. It is unclear who operates DCLeaks. com. Peggy Cifrino, an aide to Mr. Powell, responded Wednesday morning to an inquiry about the emails: “We are confirming that General Powell has been hacked and that they are his emails. We have no further comment at this time. ” Mr. Powell did not respond to an email sent directly to his personal account. In several emails, Mr. Powell suggested that speaking out against Mr. Trump would only add to the attention the Republican nominee was getting from the news media. Responding to a reporter asking for comment, Mr. Powell wrote last month that Mr. Trump is “his own best enemy” and added: “I will speak out when I feel it appropriate and not after every idiot thing he says. ” But the emails make clear that Mr. Powell, who also served as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has no intention of supporting Mr. Trump. In one    with a former aide, Mr. Powell insisted that Mr. Trump should not be elected president. “No need to debate it with you now, but Trump is a national disgrace and an international pariah,” Mr. Powell wrote in June, noting the criticism of Mr. Trump by several prominent conservatives. “He is in the process of destroying himself, no need for Dems to attack him. ” Mr. Powell also made clear in a series of exchanges how much he was offended by Mr. Trump’s attacks on the issue of Mr. Obama’s birth. “Yup, the whole birther movement was racist,” Mr. Powell wrote. “That’s what the 99% believe. When Trump couldn’t keep that up he said he also wanted to see if the certificate noted that he was a Muslim. As I have said before, ‘What if he was?’ Muslims are born as Americans everyday. ” Mr. Powell dismissed as completely ineffective Mr. Trump’s recent attempts to reach out to black voters, saying that the Republican nominee “takes us for idiots. ” Mr. Powell said that nothing Mr. Trump could say to black voters would improve his standing, in part because of the things he said about Mr. Obama. “He can never overcome what he tried to do to Obama with his search for the birth certificate hoping to force Obama out of the presidency,” Mr. Powell wrote, saying to his aide, “You don’t fall for his false sincerity, I hope. ” In the emails, Mr. Powell blamed the news media for helping fuel Mr. Trump’s candidacy. In December 2015, he turned down a request from CNN’s Fareed Zakaria to discuss Mr. Trump. “It is time to start ignoring him. You guys are playing his game, you are his oxygen,” Mr. Powell responded. In August 2015, Mr. Powell predicted that Mr. Trump would “take it to the convention” in part because news networks were chasing ratings. “He appeals to the worst angels of the G. O. P. nature and poor white folks,” Mr. Powell said in the email.’ ”In that email, Mr. Powell in part defended Mrs. Clinton’s actions in the attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012.” ’In December 2015, he told Condoleezza Rice, his successor at the State Department, that the Republican political attacks on Benghazi were “a stupid witch hunt” and wrote that “basic fault falls on a courageous ambassador who thought Libyans now love me and I am O. K. in this very vulnerable place. ” He added that “blame also rests on his leaders and supporters back here,” including Mrs. Clinton. A few months later, in a discussion about Mrs. Clinton’s email scandal, Mr. Powell lamented that “everything H. R. C. touches she kind of screws up with hubris. ” He then related a story about “the gig I lost at a university” when the institution said it could no longer afford his speaking fees after paying Mrs. Clinton. “I should send her a bill. ”",0

7887,Five Must-See Shows if You’re in New York This Month - The New York Times,"April, known as the month of deluges, is certainly flooding New York’s theater landscape. There are 14  —   count ’em 14  —   shows opening on Broadway, with more   forms of entertainment cropping up like wild crocuses all over the rest of the city. Audience members can submerge themselves in everything from the brassy manipulations of a little old matchmaker named Dolly (embodied by a little old diva named Bette) to the more recessive mysteries of humanity according to American theater’s patron saint of the inarticulate, Annie Baker. “Hello, Dolly!” Jerry Herman’s   whinnying war horse from 1964 returns after a   absence from Broadway, in a feverishly awaited production directed by Jerry Zaks and featuring David Hyde Pierce as the curmudgeonly tycoon Horace Vandergelder. The show also includes a staircase made for one really grand entrance, a slew of singing waiters and, in their midst (in the title role) she whom the patrons of louche bathhouses in the 1970s hailed as the Divine Miss M. If you don’t know that’s Bette Midler, don’t bother joining the queue for   cancellations. Tickets: hellodollyonbroadway. com “Oslo” You probably already know the   outcome of this intricately wrought drama about the Middle East peace talks of 1993. (Spoiler: they’re still fighting.) But that doesn’t keep J. T. Rogers’s portrait of the backdoor diplomacy that led to the Oslo Accords from being a nail biter, or from inspiring hope. Vividly directed by Bartlett Sher, and starring Jefferson Mays and Jennifer Ehle as a    pair of married diplomats, this   tale moves from downstairs (where it opened last summer at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater) to upstairs (at the more commodious Vivian Beaumont) just in time to become a   for the Tony Awards. Tickets: lct.      “The Antipodes” Nobody’s saying what this latest offering from Signature Theater is about, exactly. But the fact that it was written by Annie Baker, the hugely influential Pulitzer   author of “The Flick,” automatically makes it a   for students of contemporary American drama  —   and for those of us who just like to hear Ms. Baker’s fumbling characters talk about nothing and everything. The director, auspiciously, is Lila Neugebauer, whose energizing production of Sarah DeLappe’s “The Wolves,” a   study of a girls’ soccer team, was a knockout.

With its yellow peel and seedless fruit, the Cavendish makes up 95 percent of bananas sold worldwide, according to the U. N. Food and Agriculture Organization. The previous dominant variety, the Gros Michel, was devastated by another form of the fungus in the 1950s. Growers turned to the Cavendish, whose strength lies more in disease resistance than flavor.

7891,Should We Be Scared of Butter? - The New York Times,"Is butter, along with other sources of saturated fats, back on the table, as many have recently claimed? It is. Just not in the quantities the meat, dairy and   industries might have you ingest. Unless you have a medical condition that dictates otherwise, there’s no reason to cut anything  —   not butter, ice cream or Porterhouse steak  —   completely from your diet as long as you mainly eat   foods (vegetables, fruits and whole grains) lean animal protein and fish and don’t go overboard on foods rich in saturated fats that can cause harm in excess. That’s the conclusion of the best available evidence I’ve reviewed for maximizing the health of body and brain and enjoying a long life. The unending controversies about a wholesome diet provide much fodder for this column. An extensively researched book by the science writer Nina Teicholz (“The Big Fat Surprise: Why Butter, Meat and Cheese Belong in a Healthy Diet”) published in 2014, has raised serious questions about the evidence that nearly 40 years ago prompted the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs to recommend that Americans follow a diet low in saturated fats and cholesterol to curb what was then a runaway epidemic of heart and other cardiovascular diseases. Those recommendations spawned an outpouring of   and   processed foods that replaced the maligned fats with carbohydrates, primarily sugars and refined starches, which the body treats like sugar. A result: Heart attacks and coronary deaths are way down (thanks largely to the decline in smoking and use of   medications along with dietary changes) but obesity and Type 2 diabetes have soared. So what should we do? Cut back on carbs and go back to eating lots of   meats and dairy products? Not if you value your health. The task now is to appreciate the effects that different nutrients have on the body and adopt a rational and enjoyable diet that takes both health benefits and risks into account. Upon reviewing the newest reports, Dr. Boris Hansel, a French   who specializes in obesity management, wrote in a Medscape commentary: “Butter is one of the foods with the highest saturated fat content, and consuming it on a regular basis promotes an increase in blood cholesterol levels. ” But, he added, “It should be considered a pleasure food for those who are fond of it, provided that it is consumed in moderate amounts and not consumed in addition to other foods that are high in saturated fatty acids. ” At the same time, a lot more attention should be paid to the overconsumption of simple and refined carbohydrates  —   the sugary drinks, desserts, pastries and snacks, as well as white bread, white rice and potatoes  —   that promote obesity and now threaten to reverse the   decline in cardiovascular disease. “Not all fats and not all carbohydrates are created equal,” Dr. Frank Hu, the senior author of a recent report on saturated fats, told me. “The types of fats and carbohydrates are more important than the quantity. ” Dr. Hu is a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health and a member of the nation’s Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee that last year recommended a diet lower in red and processed meat, which have been linked to heart disease and cancer. “Saturated fat is still bad for heart disease risk,” Dr. Hu told the Nutrition Action Healthletter, published by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a public advocacy group. “Evidence from studies on thousands of people shows that if you replace saturated fat with unsaturated fat, you reduce your risk of heart disease. If you replace saturated fat with refined carbs, you don’t reduce your risk. ” Studies that seem to exonerate saturated fats often fail to compare their effects with the appropriate nutrients, Dr. Hu said in an interview. Furthermore, claims that, heart risk aside, diets low in saturated fats do not prevent premature death have now been refuted by a huge observational study published online in July in JAMA Internal Medicine. With Dr. Dong D. Wang in Dr. Hu’s department as first author, this study of 83, 349 female nurses followed for 32 years and 42, 884 male health professionals followed for 26 years found that both total death rates and deaths from specific diseases like heart disease, respiratory disease, cancer and dementia were reduced among those consuming the least amount of saturated and trans fats, replacing them with polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats. Simply substituting 5 percent of calories from saturated fats with the equivalent amount of polyunsaturated fats reduced total deaths by 27 percent, and replacing saturates with monounsaturates (from foods like olive and canola oil, nuts and avocados) reduced deaths by 13 percent.   fatty acids from fish also “modestly” lowered total mortality, the researchers found. However, when saturated fats were consumed in place of carbohydrates, there was no significant drop in cardiovascular death rates and slightly higher death rates from cancer. Dr. Wang and colleagues wrote that this finding was not surprising “because the major sources of carbohydrates in a typical Western diet are highly processed foods with large amounts of refined starch and sugar” that can raise the risk of cardiovascular disease independent of saturated fats. For the various diseases with death rates linked to diets high in saturated fats, chronic inflammation is believed to be a main underlying cause. Chronic   inflammation promotes atherosclerosis, leading to   arteries and setting the stage for heart attacks and strokes. The same process affects arteries in the brain and can result in vascular dementia, a common cause of memory loss. On the other hand, a   diet rich in olive oil and nuts but relatively low in saturated fats not only protects the heart but also has been shown to improve cognitive function and may reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, according to a report from Barcelona last year. Diets rich in red meat and processed meats have repeatedly been linked to an increased risk of developing colon cancer. And an ongoing study of young nurses under the auspices of the Harvard School of Public Health is exploring evidence that higher intakes of saturated fats (as well as too many simple carbohydrates) can raise the risk of premenopausal breast cancer. All saturated fats are not alike, which is good news for chocolate lovers. Stearic acid, the saturated fat in dark chocolate, does not raise unhealthy cholesterol. And there’s room for an occasional indulgence  —   if you eat healthfully most of the time.",0
7892,Evidence Emerges That ‘Clinton Cash’ May Have Played a Role in the FBI’s Investigation of Hillary Clinton,"Evidence Emerges That ‘Clinton Cash’ May Have Played a Role in the FBI’s Investigation of Hillary Clinton Posted on Tweet Home » Headlines » World News » Evidence Emerges That ‘Clinton Cash’ May Have Played a Role in the FBI’s Investigation of Hillary Clinton 
While most people are rightly focused on FBI head James Comey, there’s another person who needs to be investigated far more closely. That person is deputy director of the FBI. Andrew McCabe. 
Submitted by Michael Krieger : 
A theme I’ve been focused on for the past several weeks, relates to the growing anger from within the ranks of current and former FBI agents over the agency’s questionable and shady investigation into the email practices of Hillary Clinton. For example, in last week’s post, Internal Anger at the FBI Over Clinton Investigation Continues to Grow , I noted: 
“This is a textbook case where a grand jury should have convened but was not. That is appalling,” an FBI special agent who has worked public corruption and criminal cases said of the decision. “We talk about it in the office and don’t know how Comey can keep going.” 
DiGenova told WMAL radio’s Drive at Five last week, “People are starting to talk. They’re calling their former friends outside the bureau asking for help. We were asked to day to provide legal representation to people inside the bureau and agreed to do so and to former agents who want to come forward and talk. Comey thought this was going to go away.” 
He explained, “It’s not. People inside the bureau are furious. They are embarrassed. They feel like they are being led by a hack but more than that that they think he’s a crook. They think he’s fundamentally dishonest. They have no confidence in him. The bureau inside right now is a mess.” 
He added, “The most important thing of all is that the agents have decided that they are going to talk.” 
While most people are rightly focused on FBI head James Comey, there’s another person who needs to be investigated far more closely due to his ties to cash from long-time Clinton ally and Virginia Governor, Terry McAuliffe. That person is deputy director of the FBI. Andrew McCabe. 
The Wall Street Journal reports: 
The political organization of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, an influential Democrat with longstanding ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton, gave nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of the wife of an official at the Federal Bureau of Investigation who later helped oversee the investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s email use. 
Campaign finance records show Mr. McAuliffe’s political-action committee donated $467,500 to the 2015 state Senate campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe, who is married to Andrew McCabe, now the deputy director of the FBI. 
The Virginia Democratic Party, over which Mr. McAuliffe exerts considerable control, donated an additional $207,788 worth of support to Dr. McCabe’s campaign in the form of mailers, according to the records. That adds up to slightly more than $675,000 to her candidacy from entities either directly under Mr. McAuliffe’s control or strongly influenced by him. The figure represents more than a third of all the campaign funds Dr. McCabe raised in the effort. 
The FBI said in a statement that during his wife’s campaign Mr. McCabe “played no role, attended no events, and did not participate in fundraising or support of any kind. Months after the completion of her campaign, then-Associate Deputy Director McCabe was promoted to Deputy, where, in that position, he assumed for the first time, an oversight role in the investigation into Secretary Clinton’s emails.” 
FBI officials said that after that meeting with the governor in Richmond on March 7, Mr. McCabe sought ethics advice from the bureau and followed it, avoiding involvement with public corruption cases in Virginia, and avoiding any campaign activity or events. 
Mr. McCabe’s supervision of the Clinton email case in 2016 wasn’t seen as a conflict or an ethics issue because his wife’s campaign was over by then and Mr. McAuliffe wasn’t part of the email probe, officials said. 
Mr. McAuliffe has been a central figure in the Clintons’ political careers for decades. In the 1990s, he was Bill Clinton’s chief fundraiser and he remains one of the couple’s closest allies and public boosters. Mrs. Clinton appeared with him in northern Virginia in 2015 as he sought to increase the number of Democrats in the state legislature. 
Indeed, McAuliffe is also the guy who made it clear over the summer that Hillary Clinton’s “private position” on the TPP was to support it. This was discussed in July’s post: Nobody Knows Who’s Paying for the Privately Funded Democratic National Convention . 
Dr. McCabe announced her candidacy in March 2015, the same month it was revealed that Mrs. Clinton had used a private server as secretary of state to send and receive government emails, a disclosure that prompted the FBI investigation. 
At the time the investigation was launched in July 2015, Mr. McCabe was running the FBI’s Washington, D.C., field office, which provided personnel and resources to the Clinton email probe. 
At the end of July 2015, Mr. McCabe was promoted to FBI headquarters and assumed the No. 3 position at the agency. In February 2016, he became FBI Director James Comey’s second-in-command. 
As deputy director, Mr. McCabe was part of the executive leadership team overseeing the Clinton email investigation, though FBI officials say any final decisions on that probe were made by Mr. Comey, who served as a high-ranking Justice Department official in the administration of George W. Bush. 
Mr. McAuliffe has been under investigation for months by the FBI’s Washington field office, a probe that includes an examination of donations made on behalf of a Chinese businessman, according to people familiar with the matter. His lawyers have denied any wrongdoing and said the investigation is seeking to determine if Mr. McAuliffe may have violated a law requiring people to register as agents of a foreign entity. 
Just further evidence that the U.S. has been transformed into little more than a glorified Banana Republic. This entry was posted in World News and tagged Clinton Cash , Hillary Clinton , Liberty Blitzkrieg , Michael Krieger . Bookmark the permalink . Post navigation",0
7893,Lufthansa ersetzt streikende Piloten kurzfristig durch umgeschulte Busfahrer,"Mittwoch, 23. November 2016 Lufthansa ersetzt streikende Piloten kurzfristig durch umgeschulte Busfahrer Frankfurt (dpo) - Gute Nachrichten für Flugreisende! Offenbar fällt trotz des Pilotenstreiks kein einziger Flug aus. Möglich wurde dies, weil die bestreikte Fluglinie Lufthansa nach eigenen Angaben kurzerhand 1172 Busfahrer in einem fünfstündigen Lehrgang zu Piloten umgeschult hat. Die Pilotenvereinigung Cockpit zeigt sich empört. Bei der Lufthansa dagegen sieht man die Entscheidung als notwendigen Schritt. ""Unsere Piloten halten sich offenbar für unersetzbar"", erklärt der Vorstandsvorsitzende Carsten Spohr. ""Das sind sie aber nicht. Busfahrer machen die gleiche Arbeit für deutlich weniger Lohn – und das ganz ohne dieses arrogante Pilotengehabe."" Die eingesetzten Busfahrer, die bereits gestern in einem kurzen Crashkurs Start und Landung, das Verhalten bei Gewitter sowie den typischen beruhigenden Piloten-Singsang beigebracht bekommen haben, geben sich jedenfalls bescheiden. Über den Wolken: Grabowski mit über 400 Passagieren auf dem Weg nach Boston ""Airbus, Linienbus… Das ist doch alles das Gleiche, nur dass man eben fliegt statt zu fahren"", erklärt etwa Aushilfspilot Harry Grabowski und lehnt sich zufrieden zurück, nachdem er mit seinem 9.13-Uhr-Direktflug Frankfurt-Boston gerade die Reiseflughöhe über dem Atlantik erreicht hat. Die Umstellung auf einen Airbus 380-841 fiel dem 44-Jährigen, der sich nach zwölf Jahren Berufserfahrung als Busfahrer nun als Streikbrecher bei der Lufthansa etwas dazuverdient, nicht besonders schwer. ""Weniger Stopps auf der Strecke, keine Jugendlichen mit lauter Handymusik mehr und weniger Omas, die sich mit mir unterhalten wollen – ich habe eine wunderbare Zeit hier. Und diese Stewardessen, da träumen wir bei der Stadtbuslinie 34 von."" Hier nickt Grabowskis Co-Busfahrer zustimmend. Sollte sich das Konzept bewähren, steht für die Lufthansa die Frage im Raum, ob man auch grundsätzlich weiterhin auf Piloten setzen will. Immerhin verlangen die Busfahrer nur rund 2400 Euro brutto und damit einen Bruchteil eines Pilotengehalts. ssi, dan; Idee: mle; Foto oben: Cray of CatPRO / Shutterstock.com , Foto rechts: von Wedelstaedt , GNU 1.2 ; Hinweis: Erstmals erschienen am 4.12.14 Artikel teilen:",0
7894,"Brexit, Chris Christie, Ivanka Trump: Your Wednesday Evening Briefing - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. We all knew it was coming, but now it’s official: The “Brexit” has begun. Prime Minister Theresa May invoked Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, putting Britain on track to leave the European Union in 2019 and upending the order established after World War II. Here’s what comes next in the country’s march into the unknown. The bloc loses its   economy, and hard questions abound about whether the pivot toward nationalism and   marks the start of a more volatile global era. _____ 2. The United States and China appear likely to switch roles on environmental issues, thanks to President Trump’s executive order aimed at undoing the Obama administration’s climate change policies. China, despite its own dire air pollution, seems ready to push the U. S. to adhere to the 2015 Paris Agreement, which Mr. Trump has signaled he has no intention of doing. Today on The Daily podcast, we discuss Mr. Trump’s efforts to roll back environmental rules. _____ 3. Leaders of the Senate investigation into Mr. Trump’s possible ties to Russia sought to distance themselves from the flagging House inquiry  —   and present a unified political front. The top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee pledged to interview key players and press intelligence agencies to provide information. “This investigation’s scope will go wherever the intelligence leads,” said Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, above with Senator Mark Warner of Virginia. _____ 4. Ivanka Trump is becoming an official, though unpaid, federal employee. The move, which she says subjects her to federal rules, is meant to answer concerns over the ethics implications of her earlier unofficial role in her father’s administration. The implications for her business are not immediately clear. Ms. Trump’s title will be special assistant to the president. Her husband, Jared Kushner, has the title of senior adviser. _____ 5. “An outrageous abuse of power. ”  That was the judge who sentenced two figures in the “Bridgegate” case, when lanes to the George Washington Bridge were closed to jam traffic in a New Jersey town whose mayor had refused to endorse Gov. Chris Christie for  . Bridget Anne Kelly, a former Christie aide, above, is to serve 18 months, and Bill Baroni, a former Christie ally at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, is to serve two years. _____ 6. The Fox News host Bill O’Reilly apologized to Representative Maxine Waters of California. He had called her hair “a James Brown wig. ” But right after the mea culpa, he went on the attack, accusing her of demagogy for criticizing Mr. Trump. Ms. Waters declined to spar. “I’m not going to be put down, I’m not going to go anywhere,” she said on MSNBC. “I’m going to stay on the issues. ” _____ 7. We compiled tips on how to protect your privacy online, like using a VPN. They may come in handy, given Congress’s decision to dismantle   rules that, had they been allowed to go into effect this year, would have required internet providers to get permission before collecting and selling customers’ online information, including browsing activities. But our tech writer points out that you didn’t have much online privacy to begin with. _____ 8. “It was never my intention to go against the president of the United States,” said Mohamed Iye, a   American citizen whose wife and daughters were stranded abroad when the Trump administration’s travel ban took effect. “I was just following the law and doing everything the way it’s in the books. And it came to this. ” Like more than 50 others, he has filed a lawsuit against Mr. Trump over the ban on travelers from predominantly Muslim countries. (The second version of the ban is currently held up by rulings from federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland.) _____ 9. The supplies in many school nurses’ offices include EpiPens for allergic reactions, inhalers for asthma  —   and now naloxone, an antidote for opioid overdoses. As communities across the country face a deadly toll from heroin and pills, educators are increasingly worried. “Some people worry that this says, ‘Oh, there are drugs in the schools,’” said one school official. “No, there are drugs everywhere. ” _____ 10. Bob Dylan will accept his Nobel Prize for literature in Stockholm after all. On his terms. Mr. Dylan greeted news of the prize last fall with silence and skipped the December ceremony, citing   commitments. He’s to receive the award this weekend in Stockholm, where he’s playing two concerts. Members of the Academy “will show up at one” and then hand over his medal privately, an academy spokesman wrote. “All according to Dylan’s wishes. ” _____ 11. Finally, the cast of “The Daily Show” proposed a new strategy to save Meals on Wheels: deliver sandwiches via rocket launcher. And The Times’s chief TV critic investigated the existential doubt caused by surreal shows, like FX’s “Legion,” before its season finale airs tonight.

7895,‘We Are Orphans Here’ - The New York Times,"Standing at an intersection in Shuafat Refugee Camp, in East Jerusalem, I watched as a boy, sunk down behind the steering wheel of a   sedan, zoomed through an intersection with his arm out the driver’  window, signaling like a Nascar driver pulling in for a pit stop. I was amazed. He looked about 12. “No one cares here,” my host, Baha Nababta, said, laughing at my astonishment. “Anyone can do anything they want. ” As Baha and I walked around Shuafat this spring, teenagers fell in behind us, forming a kind of retinue. Among them were cool kids who looked like cool kids the world over, tuned in to that teenage frequency, a dog whistle with global reach. I noticed that white was a popular color. White slouchy, pegged jeans, white polo shirts, white  . Maybe white has extra status in a place where many roads are unpaved and turn to mud, where garbage is everywhere, literally, and where water shortages make it exceedingly difficult to keep people and clothing clean. So few nonresidents enter Shuafat that my appearance there seemed to be a highly unusual event, met with warm greetings verging on hysteria, crowds of kids following along. “Hello, America!” they called excitedly. I was a novelty, but also, I was with Baha Nababta, a    Palestinian community organizer beloved by the kids of Shuafat. Those who followed us wanted not just my attention but his. Baha had a rare kind of charisma.   charisma, you might call it. He was a natural leader of boys. Every kid we passed knew him and either waved or stopped to speak to him. Baha founded a community center so that older children would have a place to hang out, because there is no open space in Shuafat Refugee Camp, no park, not a single playground, nowhere for kids to go, not even a street, really, where they can play, because there are no sidewalks, most of the narrow roads barely fitting the cars that ramble down them. Youngers kids tapped me on the arms and wanted to show me the mural they painted with Baha. The road they helped to pave with Baha, who supervised its completion. The plants they planted with Baha along a narrow strip. Baha, Baha, Baha. It was like that with the adults too. They all wanted his attention. His phone was blowing up in his pocket as we walked. He finally answered. There was a dispute between a man whose baby died at a clinic and the doctor who treated the baby. The man whose baby died tried to burn the doctor alive, and now the doctor was in critical condition, in a hospital in Jerusalem. Throughout the two days I spent with Baha, I heard more stories like this that he was asked to help resolve. People relied on him. He had a vision for the Shuafat camp, where he was born and raised, that went beyond what could be imagined from within the very limited confines of the place. In an area of   apartment buildings clustered around a mosque with spindly, futuristic minarets, a pudgy boy of 10 or 11 called over to us. “My dad is trying to reach you,” he said to Baha. Baha told me that the buildings in that part of the camp had no water and that everyone was contacting him about it. He had not been answering his phone, he confessed, because he didn’t have any good news yet for the residents. I got the impression Baha was something like an informal mayor, on whom people depended to resolve disputes, build roads, put together volunteer committees and try to make Shuafat safe for children. The building next to us was 12 stories. Next to it was another   building.   apartments in the camp are built so close together that if a fire should happen, the results would be devastating. There would be no way to put it out. The buildings were all built of stone blocks that featured, between blocks, wooden wedges that stuck out intermittently, as if the builders had never returned to fill the gaps with mortar. I gazed up at a towering facade, with its strange wooden wedges, which made the building look like a model of a structure, except that it was occupied. The pudgy boy turned to me as I craned my neck. “This building is stupidly built,” he said. “It’s junk. ” “Do you live here?” I asked him, and he said yes. Shuafat Refugee Camp is inside Jerusalem proper, according to the municipal boundaries that Israel declared after the Six Day War in 1967. (Though the entire walled area is frequently referred to as the Shuafat Refugee Camp, the actual camp, run by the United Nation’s relief agency for Palestinian refugees, is only a small portion. Adjacent to the camp are three neighborhoods that are the responsibility of the city of Jerusalem.) The Palestinian Authority has no jurisdiction there: The camp is, according to Israeli law, inside Israel, and the people who live there are Jerusalem residents, but they are refugees in their own city. Residents pay taxes to Israel, but the camp is barely serviced. There is very little legally supplied water, a scarcely functioning sewage system, essentially no garbage pickup, no road building, no mail service (the streets don’t even have names, much less addresses) virtually no infrastructure of any kind. There is no adequate school system. Israeli emergency fire and medical services do not enter the camp. The Israeli police enter only to make arrests they provide no security for camp residents. There is chaotic land registration. While no one knows how many people really live in the Shuafat camp and its three surrounding neighborhoods, which is roughly one square kilometer, it’s estimated that the population is around 80, 000. They live surrounded by a   concrete wall, a wall interspersed by guard towers and trapdoors that swing open when Israeli forces raid the camp, with reinforcements in the hundreds, or even, as in December 2015, over a thousand troops. Effectively, there are no laws in the Shuafat Refugee Camp, despite its geographical location inside Jerusalem. The Shuafat camp’s original citizens were moved from the Old City, where they sought asylum in 1948 during the   War, to the camp’s boundaries starting in 1965, when the camp was under the control of the Jordanian government, with more arriving, in need of asylum, during and after the war in 1967. Now, 50 years after Israel’s 1967 boundaries were drawn, even Israeli security experts don’t quite know why the Shuafat Refugee Camp was placed inside the Jerusalem municipal boundaries. The population was much smaller then and surrounded by beautiful green, open forestland, which stretched to the land on which the Jewish settlement of Pisgat Ze’ev was later built. (The forestland is still there, visible beyond the separation wall, but inaccessible to camp residents, on account of the wall.) Perhaps the Israelis were hoping the camp’s residents could be relocated, because they numbered only a few thousand. Instead, the population of the camp exploded in the following decades into the tens of thousands. In 1980, Israel passed a law declaring Jerusalem the “complete and united” capital of Israel. In 2004, Israel began erecting the concrete wall around the camp, cutting inside Israel’s own declared boundaries, as if to stanch and cauterize the camp from “united” Jerusalem. If   buildings are not typically conjured by the term “refugee camp,” neither is an indoor shopping mall, but there is one in the Shuafat camp: two floors and a third that was under construction, an escalator up and down and a store called Fendi, which sells inexpensive women’s clothes. The mall owner greeted us with exuberance and pulled Baha aside to ask for advice of some kind. A teenager who worked at a mall   parlor, a hipster in a hoodie and eyeglass frames without lenses, did a   beatbox for me and Moriel   a writer and organizer who had walked me into the camp in order to make introductions between me and Baha and to serve as my Arabic interpreter. Moriel and the teenager from the   shop took turns. Moriel’s own beatbox was good but not quite up to the Shuafat Refugee Camp beatbox standard. We met an accountant named Fahed, who had just opened his shop in the mall to prepare taxes for residents. He was stunned to hear English being spoken and eager to use his own. The tax forms are in Hebrew, he explained, so most people in the camp must hire a bilingual accountant to complete them. Before the separation wall was constructed, the mall was bulldozed twice by the Israeli authorities, but the owner rebuilt both times. Since the wall has gone up, the Israelis have not tried to demolish any large buildings in Shuafat, though they have destroyed individual homes. Armed Palestinian gangsters could take away someone’s land or apartment at any moment. A fire or earthquake would be catastrophic. There are multiple risks to buying property in the Shuafat camp, but the cost of an apartment there can be less than a tenth of what an apartment would cost on the other side of the separation wall, in East Jerusalem. And living in Shuafat is a way to try to hold onto Jerusalem residency status. Jerusalem residents have a coveted blue ID card, meaning they can enter Israel in order to work and support their families, unlike Palestinians with green, or West Bank ID cards, who need many supporting documents in order to enter Israel  —   to work or for any other reason, and who also must pass through military checkpoints like Qalandiya, which can require waiting in hourslong lines. Jerusalem residency is, quite simply, a lifeline to employment, a matter of survival. There are also   in the camp. Since the wall went up, it became a sanctuary, a haven. I met people from Gaza, who cannot leave the square kilometer of the camp or they risk arrest, because it is illegal for Gazans to enter Israel or the occupied West Bank except with Israeli permission, which is almost never granted. I met a family of Brazilian Palestinians with   passports who also cannot leave the camp, because they do not have West Bank green IDs nor Jerusalem blue IDs. Shuafat camp is often depicted in the international media as the most dangerous place in Jerusalem, a crucible of crime, jihad and trash fires. On the day that I arrived, garbage was indeed smoldering in great heaps just inside the checkpoint entrance, against the concrete separation wall, flames jumping thinly in the strong morning sun. I had been to countries that burn their trash it is a smell you get used to. My main concern, over the weekend I spent in the camp, was not getting my foot run over by a car. If you are seriously hurt in the camp, there isn’t much help. Ill or injured people are carried through the checkpoint, on foot or by car, and put in ambulances on the other side of the wall. According to residents of the camp, several people have unnecessarily died in this manner. As we walked, I began to understand how to face the traffic without flinching, to expect that drivers are experienced at navigating such incredible human density. I asked Baha if people were ever run over by cars, assuming he would say no. “Yes, all the time,” he said. “A child was just killed this way,” he added. I hugged the walls of the apartment buildings as we strolled. Later that evening, I watched as a tiny boy riding a grown man’s bicycle was bumped by a car. He crashed in the road. I ran to help him. He was crying, holding out his abraded hands. I remembered how painful it is to scrape your palms, how many nerve endings there are in an open hand. A Palestinian man told the little boy he was O. K. and ruffled his hair. When I asked Baha if garbage was burned by the separation wall because it was safer  —   a way to contain a fire, like a giant fireplace  —   he shook his head. “It’s, aah, symbolic. ” In other words, garbage is burned by the wall because the wall is Israeli. Drugs are sold along the wall by the Israeli checkpoint, not for symbolic reasons. The camp organizers, like Baha, cannot effectively control the drug trade in a zone patrolled by the Israeli police and monitored by security cameras. Dealers are safe there from the means of popular justice exacted inside the camp. The most heavily militarized area of the camp is perhaps its most lawless. The popular drug the dealers sell is called Mr. Nice Guy, which is sometimes categorized as a “synthetic cannabinoid”  —   a meaningless nomenclature. It is highly toxic, and its effects are nothing like cannabis. It can bring on psychosis. It damages brains and ruins lives. Baha told me that Mr. Nice Guy is popular with kids as young as 8. Empty packets of it sifted around at our feet as we crossed the large parking lot where buses pick up 6, 000 children daily and transport them through the checkpoint for school, because the camp has only one public school, for elementary students. Every afternoon, children stream back into camp, passing the dealers and users who cluster near the checkpoint. I didn’t see the dealers, but I doubt Baha would have pointed them out. What I mostly noticed were children working, being industrious, trying to find productive ways to live in a miserable environment and to survive. Across from Baha’s house, a group of kids run a carwash. We waved to them from Baha’s roof. Baha introduced me to a group of teenage boys who own their own     service. He took me to a barber shop, where kids in flawless outfits with   fades were hanging out, listening to music, while a boy of about 13 gave a haircut to a boy of about 5. A young teenager in a pristine white polo shirt and delicate gold neck chain flexed his baby potato of a biceps and announced his family name: “Alqam!” The children in the barbershop were all Alqam. They ran the shop. They were ecstatic to see Baha. We were all ecstatic. The language barrier between me and the boys only thickened our collective joy, as my interpreter Moriel was whisked into a barber chair for a playfully coerced beard trim, on the house. The boys and I shouldered up for selfies, put on our sunglasses and posed. Whenever men shook my hand after Baha introduced me, I sensed  —   especially after Moriel left that afternoon  —   that men and boys would not get so physically close to a Palestinian woman who was a stranger. But I was an American woman, and I was with Baha, which made me something like an honorary man. Later I told myself and everyone else how wonderful it was in the Shuafat camp. How safe I felt. How positive Baha was. All of that still feels true to me. But I also insisted, to myself and everyone else, that Baha never expressed any fears for his own safety. In looking at my notes, I see now that my insistence on this point was sheer will. A fiction. It’s right there in the notes. He said he was nervous. He said he’d been threatened. Also in my notes, this: Baha says, two types 1. Those who want to help make a better life 2. Those who want to destroy everything And in parentheses: (Arms trade. Drugs trade. Construction profits. No oversight wanted.) “I wanted you to meet the boys because they are nice people,” Baha said, after we left the barbershop. “But they do all carry guns. ” It was only after I returned home to the United States that I learned, in the banal and cowardly way, with a few taps on my computer, that two Alqam boys, cousins who were 12 and 14, had been accused of stabbing, with a knife and scissors, an Israeli security guard on a tram in East Jerusalem. I still don’t know whether they were related to the boys in the barber shop. Several of the young assailants in what has been called the Knives Intifada have been from the Shuafat camp, which has also been the site of huge and violent protests in which Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces. In 2015, three children from the Shuafat Refugee Camp lost eyes from sponge bullets shot by Israeli forces. The other thing I suppressed, besides Baha’s admissions of fear, was his desire for police. I didn’t write that down. It wasn’t part of my hero narrative, because the police are not part of my hero narrative. “Even if they have to bring them from India,” he said several times, “we need police here. We cannot handle the disputes on our own. People take revenge. They murder. ” A Middle East correspondent I met in the West Bank, hearing that I was going to spend the weekend in the Shuafat camp, asked me if I “planned to visit Shit Lake” while there. Apparently that was his single image of the place. I assumed he was referring to a sewage dump, but Baha never mentioned it, and after seeing Baha’s pleasure in showing me the community center, the roads his committee had built, the mall, which was the only open gathering space, all things that, for him, were hopeful, I wasn’t going to ask him for Shit Lake. That correspondent had never stepped foot in the camp. I hadn’t expected to either, until I was invited on an extensive tour of the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and was asked to choose a subject to write about, for a book to be published next year. With no previous experience in the region, and little knowledge, I gravitated instinctually to Shuafat camp. From my own time there, the sustaining image is shimmering white. The kids, dressed in white. The buildings, a baked tone of dusty,   white. The minarets, all white. And there was the 1972 Volkswagen Beetle in gleaming white, meticulously restored. It was on the shop floor of a garage run by Baha’s friend Adel. A   enthusiast and owner myself, I wanted to talk to Adel about the car. He showed me his garage, his compressor, his lift. Like the escalator in the mall, these were things you would never expect to find in a place without services. We sat, and Adel made coffee. He and Baha told me about the troubles with the drug Mr. Nice Guy. They said every family has an addict among its children and sometimes among the older people as well. A third of the population is strung out on it, they said. It makes people crazy, Adel and Baha agreed. Is there a link, I asked, between Mr. Nice Guy and the kids who decide, essentially, to end it all by running at an Israeli soldier with a knife? They each concurred that there was. Two years earlier, Baha said, by way of contrast, there was a man from the Shuafat camp who did a deadly car ramming. The Israelis came and blew up his house. He was older, Baha said, and out of work and he decided that he was finally ready to lose everything. With the kids, Baha said, it’s different. It’s an act of impulsive courage. The drug helps enormously with that. Adel kept making reference to his    daughter, who is physically disabled and cannot attend school. I asked to meet her or Adel asked if I wanted to meet her. Either way we ended up in Adel’s large apartment, and his daughter Mira was wheeled out to the living room. Mira was burned over most of her body and is missing part of one arm and a kneecap. Her face and scalp are disfigured. A school bus filled with children from the Shuafat camp were on a trip to Ramallah when their bus collided with a truck on wet roads. The bus overturned and burst into flames. Five children and a teacher burned to death. Dozens were injured. Emergency services were delayed by confusion over who had jurisdiction. As a result, Mira and other children had to be taken in the cars of bystanders to the closest hospital. The accident took place between the Adam settlement and Qalandiya checkpoints, in what is called Area C of the West Bank, which is entirely under Israeli control. The likelihood of something like this occurring was well known. Later, a report from Ir Amim, an Israeli human rights group, established that the tragedy resulted from the multiple challenges of living beyond the separation barrier. Roads were substandard. There were too many children on the bus, the children had no access to education in their own communities and there was no oversight. “When the accident happened, we didn’t know how to cope with it,” Baha told me. Someone got up on a loading dock in the camp and called out the names of the dead. Afterward, Baha and Adel cried all the time. They felt that the lives of Shuafat’s children were disposable. They decided to start their own volunteer emergency team, through WhatsApp, and it has 80 members, who are trained in first aid and in special skills they are ready to employ at a moment’s notice. They are saving up to purchase their own Shuafat camp ambulance, whose volunteer drivers will be trained medical professionals, like Baha’s wife, Hiba, who is a nurse. Baha, I noticed, seemed more optimistic about their emergency team, and about the future, than Adel did. At one point, Adel, who has a shattered and frantic but loving, warm energy, turned to me and said, “We are orphans here. ” Mira, who had been transferred from her wheelchair to the couch, sat and fidgeted. She understood no English but was forced to quietly pretend she was listening. I kept smiling at her, and she smiled back. I was desperate to give her something, to promise something. It’s very difficult to see a child who has suffered so tremendously. It’s basically unbearable. I should give her the ring I was wearing, I thought. But then I saw that it would never fit her fingers, which were very swollen and large, despite her young age her development, after the fire, was thwarted because her bones could not properly grow. I’ll give her my earrings, was my next idea, and then I realized that her ears had been burned off in the fire. I felt obscene. I sat and smiled as if my oversize teeth could beam a protective fiction over this poor child, blind us both to the truth, that no shallow gesture or petty generosity would make any lasting difference, and that her life was going to be difficult. The travel agency in the Shuafat mall is called Hope. There is a toy store in the mall called the Happy Child. The children I met were all Baha’s kids, part of his group, on his team, drafting off his energy, which was relentlessly upbeat. I have to recreate, with all the precision I can manage, to remember what I am able to about Baha. I see Baha in his pink polo shirt, tall and handsome, but with a soft belly that somehow reinforces his integrity, makes him imperfectly, perfectly human. Baha singing “Bella Ciao” in   Italian, a language he learned at 19, on the trip that changed his life, working with Vento di Terra, a   and human rights group based in Italy. Later, I sent a video of Baha singing to various Italian friends, leftists who were thrilled that a guy in a Palestinian refugee camp knew the words to “Bella Ciao. ” Baha’s friends and relatives all hugging me and   me, the women bringing out boxes that contained their   wedding dresses, insisting I try on each dress, whose colors and designs specified where they were from: one in black with white stitching, from Ramallah. Cream with red, Jerusalem. In each case we took a photo, laughing, me in each dress, with the woman it belonged to on my arm. Everyone imploring me to come back, and to bring Remy, my    and I was sure that I would come back, and bring Remy, because I had fallen in love with these people. And in the background of the hugs and kisses, in almost every home where we spent time, the TV playing the Islamic channel, Palestine   a relentless montage of blood, smoke, fire and   fighters with  . The constant hospitality. Coffee, tea, mint lemonade, ice water, all the drinks I politely accepted. Drank and then sloshed along, past faded   posters of jihadist martyrs. Come back. Bring Remy. I will, I told them, and I meant it. Late at night, Baha and Hiba decided to show me their digital wedding photo book. It was midnight, their two young daughters asleep on couches around us. Hiba propped an iPad on a table  —   she was four months pregnant, expecting her third child, a boy  —   and we looked at every last image, hundreds of images, of her and Baha in highly curated poses and stiff wedding clothes, her     tiara, her beautiful face neutralized by heavy makeup but the makeup is part of the ritual, and the ritual is part of the glory. The two of them in a lush park in West Jerusalem. Every picture we looked at was, for them watching me see the images, a new delight: There were more and more and more. For me, they all started to run together, it was now 1 in the morning, I was exhausted, but I made myself regard each photograph as something unique, a vital integer in the stream of these people’s refusal to be reduced. I slept in what they called their Arabic room, on low cushions, a barred window above me issuing a cool breeze. I listened to roosters crow and the semiautomatic weapons being fired at a nearby wedding celebration, and eventually I drifted into the calmest, heaviest sleep I’d had in months. The next day, Baha had meetings to attend to try to solve the water problem. I spoke to Hiba about their kids. She asked me at what age Remy started his piano lessons. “I want music lessons for the girls,” she said. “I think it’s very good for their development. ” As she said it, more   fire erupted from the roof of a nearby building. “I want them to know the feel, the smells, of a different environment. To be able to imagine other lives. ” When I think of Hiba Nababta wanting what I want for my child, her rightful desire that her kids should have an equal chance, everything feels hopeless and more obscene, even, than my wanting to give earrings to a child without ears. I went with Hiba that morning to her mother’s house, where she and Hiba’s sisters were preparing an exquisite meal of stuffed grape leaves and stuffed squashes, the grape leaves and vegetables grown on her mother’s patio. We were all women, eating together in relaxed company. A    came downstairs to join us, sleepy, beautiful, with long red nails and hair dyed honey blond, in her pajamas and slippers. She said that she was leaving for New Jersey with her husband, Hiba’s brother, and their new baby. Relatives had arranged for them to immigrate. She would learn English and go to school. When it was time to say goodbye, a younger sister was appointed to walk me to the checkpoint. Halfway there, I assured her I could walk alone, and we said goodbye. On the main road, shopkeepers came out to wave and smile. Everyone seemed to know who I was: the American who had come to meet with Baha. At the checkpoint, the Palestinian boy in front of me was detained. I was next, and the soldiers were shocked to see an American, as they would have been shocked to see any  . There was much consternation in the reinforced station. My passport went from hand to hand. The commander approached the scratched window. “You’re a Jew, right?” he blurted into the microphone. For the context in which he asked, for its reasoning, I said no. But in fact, I’m ethnically   on my father’s side, although I was not raised with any religious or even a cultural connection to Judaism. My mother is a white Protestant from Tennessee. I might have said, “Yes, partly,” but I found the question unanswerable, on account of its conflation of Zionism and Jewish identity. My   Odessan   was a clothing merchant on Orchard Street. My grandfather worked in his shop as a boy. That is classically Jewish, but my sense of self, of what it might mean to inherit some trace of that lineage, was not the kind of patrimony the soldier was asking after. I was eventually waved along. The day I left Shuafat camp was April 17. Fifteen days later, on May 2, Baha Nababta was murdered in the camp. An unknown person approached on a motorcycle as Baha worked with roughly a hundred fellow camp residents to pave a road. In front of this very large crowd of people, working together, the person on the motorcycle shot at Baha 10 times and fled. Seven bullets hit him. It is now December. Baha’s wife, Hiba, has given birth to their son. His father is gone. His mother is widowed. But a baby  —   a baby can thrive no matter. A baby won’t even know, until it is told, that someone is missing.",0
7896,Putin BURNS Legal System For Letting “Sexual Emergency” Migrant Walk FREE After Molesting Boy,"0 comments 
There are things that we tend not to agree with when it comes to Putin. However, I think when you see the point he is trying to make here, this is common ground we can all meet on and agree with one another on. 
His reason for being upset with the government is clear. They allowed a sexual predator free for reasons that are so asinine that one could think the defendant himself made the ruling. 
It’s sickening.. 
The Russian president rarely comments on the internal affairs of European countries, and even less on specific court cases. However, Mr. Putin refused to stay silent this week as he slammed the Austrian justice system over a case in which the infamous “sexual emergency” migrant rapist was alleged to have been acquitted by an Austrian court who will seek a retrial on the case, reports OE24. 
According to Mr. Putin, the court’s decision was the result of a “dissolution of traditional national values”. He added: “In a European country a child is raped by a migrant. The court acquitted him for two reasons: he speaks the language poorly and he did not understand that the boy, yes it was a boy, didn’t want this.” 
Putin called the resulting court ruling inconceivable and said that a nation that refuses to defend its children has no future. “This is the result of the dissolution of traditional national values and a sense of guilt towards migrants,” he said. 
Breitbart London reported on the attack, which occurred late last year, in which the Iraqi asylum seeker brutally raped a ten-year-old boy in a swimming pool in the Austrian capital of Vienna. 
The boy was so brutally assaulted that he had to be hospitalised for his injuries and the migrant, when asked why he committed the crime, claimed it had been a “sexual emergency”. The phrase became notorious on social media as many used it to highlight the clear social problems many of the new migrants presented to European societies. 
According to Austria’s chief justice, the migrant had not, in fact, been acquitted of the charges, but rather the trial was expected to be re-run on the basis that the boy now suffers post-traumatic stress disorder. This new charge could allow prosecutors to put the Iraqi behind bars for up to 15 years. 
Putin says when a country refuses to protect its’ children, it becomes a country with no future. What do you think about that, would you agree? Related Items",0
7897,Is Giving the Secret to Getting Ahead? - The New York Times,"Editor’s note: We’re resurfacing this 2013 magazine article to remind you that tirelessly helping others could be the key to hyperefficiency. Just after noon on a Wednesday in November, Adam Grant wrapped up a lecture at the Wharton School and headed toward his office, a   speed walk away. Several students trailed him, as often happens at conferences, Grant attracts something more like a swarm. Grant chatted calmly with them but kept up the pace. He knew there would be more students waiting outside his office, and he said, more than once, “I really don’t like to keep students waiting. ” Grant, 31, is the   and   professor at Wharton. He is also one of the most prolific academics in his field, organizational psychology, the study of workplace dynamics. Grant took three years to get his Ph. D. and in the seven years since, he has published more papers in his field’s   journals than colleagues who have won   awards. His influence extends beyond academia. He regularly advises companies about how to get the most out of their employees and how to help their employees get the most out of their jobs. It is Grant whom Google calls when “we are thinking about big problems we are trying to solve,” says Prasad Setty, who heads Google’s people analytics group. Plenty of people have made piles of money by promising the secrets to getting things done or working a   week or figuring out what color your parachute is or how to be a brilliant   manager. But in an academic field that is preoccupied with the study of efficiency and productivity, Grant would seem to be the most efficient and productive. When we arrived at Grant’s office on the Philadelphia campus, five students were waiting outside. The first was a student trying to decide between Teach for America and a   job at Google. Grant walked her through some other possibilities, testing her theories about potential outcomes. Although she was aware of the crowd, she seemed to be in no hurry to leave, in part because Grant was so clearly engaged. A second student came in. Then a third. Someone dropped off a bottle of wine to say thank you another asked for a contact (Grant pledges to introduce his students to anyone he knows or has met, and they shop his LinkedIn profile for just that purpose). For every one of them, Grant seemed to have not only relevant but also scientifically tested,   advice: Studies show you shouldn’t move for location, since what you do is more important than where you do it. Studies show that people who take jobs with too rosy a picture get dissatisfied and quit. If you truly can’t make a decision, consider delegating it to someone who knows you well and cares about you. Is there anything else I can help you with? How else can I help? He was like some kind of  . Grant might not seem so different from any number of accessible and devoted professors on any number of campuses, and yet when you witness over time the sheer volume of Grant’s commitments, and the way in which he is able to follow through on all of them, you start to sense that something profoundly different is at work. Helpfulness is Grant’s credo. He is the colleague who is always nominating another for an award or taking the time to offer a thoughtful critique or writing a lengthy letter of recommendation for a student  —   something he does approximately 100 times a year. His largess extends to people he doesn’t even know. A student at Warwick Business School in England recently wrote to express his admiration and to ask Grant how he manages to publish so often, and in such   journals. Grant did not think, upon reading that   I cannot possibly answer in full every such query and still publish so often, and in such   journals. Instead, Grant, who often returns home after a day of teaching to an   of 200   responded, “I’m happy to set up a phone call if you want to discuss!” He attached handouts and slides from the presentation on productivity he gave to the Academy of Management annual conference a few years earlier. For Grant, helping is not the enemy of productivity, a   diversion from the actual work at hand it is the mother lode, the motivator that spurs increased productivity and creativity. In some sense, he has built a career in professional motivation by trying to unpack the puzzle of his own success. He has always helped he has always been productive. How, he has wondered for most of his professional life, does the interplay of those two factors work for everyone else? Organizational psychology has long concerned itself with how to design work so that people will enjoy it and want to keep doing it. Traditionally the thinking has been that employers should appeal to workers’ more obvious forms of  : financial incentives, yes, but also work that is inherently interesting or offers the possibility for career advancement. Grant’s research, which has generated broad interest in the study of relationships at work and will be published for the first time for a popular audience in his new book, “Give and Take,” starts with a premise that turns the thinking behind those theories on its head. The greatest untapped source of motivation, he argues, is a sense of service to others focusing on the contribution of our work to other people’s lives has the potential to make us more productive than thinking about helping ourselves. “Give and Take” incorporates scores of studies and personal case histories that suggest the benefits of an attitude of extreme giving at work. Many of the examples  —   the selfless C. E. O. ’s, the consultants who mentor ceaselessly  —   are inspiring and humbling, even if they are a bit intimidating in their natural expansiveness. These generous professionals look at the world the way Grant does: an   filled with requests is not a task to be dispensed with perfunctorily (or worse, avoided) it’s an opportunity to help people, and therefore it’s an opportunity to feel good about yourself and your work. “I never get much done when I frame the 300   as ‘answering ’ ” Grant told me. “I have to look at it as, How is this task going to benefit the recipient?” Where other people see hassle, he sees bargains, a little work for a lot of gain, including his own. The message sounds terrific: Feel good about your work, and get more of it done, and bask in the appreciation of all the people you help along the way. Nice guys can finish first! (Now there’s research to prove it.) But I couldn’t help wondering, as I watched Grant race through his marathon day (even one of his mentors admitted, “He can be exhausting”) about the cost of all this  . If you are devoted to being available to everyone, all the time, how do you relax? How can you access the kind of creativity that comes from not being on task every waking moment? How do you make time for the more important relationships in your life? As Grant’s office hours came to an end four and a half hours later, he patiently continued offering help until he finally had to close the door and tell a student to try him by phone he would squeeze him in on his commute or by  . But he would not say no. The study of job design in the   and   century focused on how to improve the drudge work of manufacturing: Grant is credited with reviving the field, shifting the thinking toward the more modern conditions of a service and knowledge economy. He first realized that his ideas about giving at work might actually yield quantifiable results when he was a    graduate student at the University of Michigan, and he proposed a study set in a university   call center. Call centers, even on college campuses, are notoriously unsatisfying places to work. The job is repetitive and can be emotionally taxing, as callers absorb verbal abuse while also facing rejection (the rejection rate at that call center was about 93 percent). The manager, Howard Heevner, did not have a lot of faith that Grant would be able to motivate his  . He had already tried, in a previous job at a call center, the usual incentives  —   cash prizes, competitive games  —   and was generally unimpressed with the results. But Grant had a different idea. When he was an undergraduate at Harvard, he took a job selling advertisements for the travel guide series “Let’s Go,” but he was terrible at it. “I was a pushover,” he says in “Give and Take,” “losing revenues for the company and sacrificing my own commission. ” Then he met another undergraduate whose job at “Let’s Go” was helping her pay her way through college. Suddenly the impact of his role became clear to him: without advertising revenues, the company could not make money, which in turn meant it couldn’t provide jobs to students who needed them. With that in mind, he was willing to make a harder sell, to take a tougher line on negotiations. “When I was representing the interests of students, I was willing to fight to protect them,” he writes. It would not be a   psychology book if every anecdote did not have a dramatic ending: Grant eventually sold the largest advertising package in company history and less than a year later, at 19, was promoted to director of advertising sales, overseeing a budget of $1 million. As a psychology major, Grant always hoped to do a study on the “Let’s Go” staff, in which the books’ editors and writers would meet with or read letters by people whose travels had been enhanced by their work. Would knowing how the books benefited others inspire them to work harder? Now, at the call center, Grant proposed a simple,   experiment: given that one of the center’s primary purposes was funding scholarships, Grant brought in a student who had benefited from that  . The callers took a   break as the young man told them how much the scholarship had changed his life and how excited he now was to work as a teacher with Teach for America. The results were surprising even to Grant. A month after the testimonial, the workers were spending 142 percent more time on the phone and bringing in 171 percent more revenue, even though they were using the same script. In a subsequent study, the revenues soared by more than 400 percent. Even simply showing the callers letters from grateful recipients was found to increase their   draws. When Grant went back and talked to the callers about their improvement, many actively discounted the possibility that the brief encounter with a scholarship student helped. “Several of them were stunned,” Grant said. “Their response was, ‘Yeah, I knew I was more effective, but that was because I had more practice,’ or, ‘That was because I had a better alumni pool in that period  —   I got lucky.’ ” Eventually, having replicated the test five times, Grant was confident that he had eliminated other explanations. It was almost as if the good feelings had bypassed the callers’ conscious cognitive processes and gone straight to a more subconscious source of motivation. They were more driven to succeed, even if they could not pinpoint the trigger for that drive. The study quickly raised Grant’s profile in his field, partly because it relied on hard data: dollars, as opposed to manager assessments or  . “I don’t know the last time there was a study in our field that had such striking results,” says Stuart Bunderson, a professor of organizational behavior at Washington University. “In terms of an intervention that has practical significance and moves the needle on employee behavior  —   you don’t see them that often. ” The intervention was also a manager’s dream: fast and practically free. Over the years, Grant has followed up that study with other experiments testing his theories about prosocial motivation  —   the desire to help others, independent of easily foreseeable payback. In one study, Grant put up two different signs at   stations in a hospital. One reminded doctors and nurses, “Hand hygiene prevents you from catching diseases” another read, “Hand hygiene prevents patients from catching diseases. ” Grant measured the amount of soap used at each station. Doctors and nurses at the station where the sign referred to their patients used 45 percent more soap or hand sanitizer. These studies, two of Grant’s best known, focus on typically worthy beneficiaries: needy students and vulnerable patients. But some of his other research makes the case that prosocial behavior is as applicable in corporate America as it is in a hospital or a university. “Think of it this way,” he said. “In corporate America, people do sometimes feel that the work they do isn’t meaningful. And contributing to   can be a substitute for that. ” Take, for example, Grant’s study of workers at Borders who contributed to an   fund managed by the staff, with Borders matching donated funds. The money was set aside for employees in need  —   someone facing a pregnancy that would put a strain on their finances, for example, or the funeral of a loved one. Interestingly, Grant found that it was not the beneficiaries who showed the most significant increase in their commitment to Borders it was the donors, even those who gave just a few dollars a week. Through interviews and questionnaires, Grant determined that “as a result of gratitude to the company for the opportunity to affirm a valued aspect of their identities, they developed stronger affective commitment to the company. ” The study is uplifting and troubling at the same time: even Grant acknowledges the possibility of corporations playing off their employees’ generous impulses, as a sop to compensate for other failings  —   poor pay or demeaning work. (After all, if the employees at Borders had better benefits and pay, they might not have needed the emergency fund.) Jerry Davis, a management professor who taught Grant at the University of Michigan and is generally a fan of his former student’s work, couldn’t help making a pointed critique about its inherent limits when they were on a panel together: “So you think those workers at the Apple factory in China would stop committing suicide if only we showed them someone who was incredibly happy with their iPhone?” Grant’s answer to these questions is academic: he tries to understand how these mechanisms function but does not necessarily advocate implementation. “I am also skeptical about the motivations of corporations,” he said. “My concern is ultimately for the success and   of people in organizations. To the extent that individual and group accomplishments and quality of work life contribute to profits, I’m happy, but that’s not my primary goal. ” For all his general interest in psychology, Grant doesn’t seem interested in digging too deeply into the origins of his own psyche. About his   desire to help, he says simply: “My mother has what she calls the   gene. Maybe I just inherited it. ” He grew up in the suburbs of Detroit, raised by a lawyer, his father, and a teacher, his mother. He was an upbeat boy, though socially awkward and burdened by numerous food allergies and strong aversions  —   to haircuts, to bluejeans, to chocolate. He felt things deeply those aversions were matched by equally consuming passions. An aspiring basketball player, he would not allow himself to go inside until he made 23 consecutive free throws, even if it meant missing dinner. (That he never made the   team is the one failure that still pains him.) On weekends, he played video games for so many consecutive hours  —   10 was not unusual  —   that his mother called the local paper to complain about what the paper called, in the subsequent article, “The Dark Side of Nintendo. ” Grant started significantly losing his hair in his 20s, as if his head were trying to keep pace with his overall precociousness. Now almost entirely bald, he has a striking, monklike look. Though he comes across as charming and agreeable, there are still traces of the awkward boy he says he once was, a hint of discomfort in the smile he gives a student he runs into unexpectedly, a longstanding dread of parties (“unless they like psychology or magic tricks, in which case I’d come alive,” he said). He is aware of his own introverted tendencies, and some of his research involves the strengths of introverts at work. For the most part, Grant has more than compensated for the shyness he felt growing up. Once phobic about speaking in public, he forced himself to lecture as much as he could as a graduate student, handing out feedback forms so he could methodically learn from his weaknesses. He developed strategies for socializing comfortably, even though, he said, “I feel uncomfortable when I’m in a situation and I don’t know what people want or expect of me. ” Giving, he eventually realized, was a reliable way of mediating social interactions. On the day I followed Grant as he hurried to his office hours at Wharton, I read something on his face that registered as more than just busyness he seemed anxious. I wondered whether Grant was driven by the desire to help or a deep fear of disappointing someone. “That is one astute observation!” Grant said when I asked him about that by  . (With Grant, every observation is an astute one.) Grant often starts his research with observations about himself  —   “” they call it in the field  —   and he had conducted a study trying to determine which of those two impulses was more motivating. The answer turned out to be a combination of the two. “Givers motivate themselves to avoid complacency by focusing on the benefits to others if they succeed and worrying about disappointing them if they fail,” Grant wrote. One of Grant’s roommates, he went on, once joked that he had a productive form of O. C. D. “He noticed that when I was anxious about something, I had a habit of throwing myself   into tasks in which I felt responsible to others,” he said. “A few days later, my mentor, Brian Little, sent me an article by Ian McGregor, one of his doctoral students, who studied ‘compensatory conviction’: anxiety in one domain motivates people to dive into passionate pursuit in another. It was one of those crystallizing moments that triggered a ‘Yes, I want to be a psychologist!’ reaction  —   I was fascinated by how closely his theory and findings mapped onto my own experience. ” It’s not hard to imagine a   interpretation of Adam Grant: that his generosity might have its roots in some kind of need  —   maybe a need he feels, even more than the rest of us, to be liked. Or perhaps that he is channeling his extreme ambition into a   form of achievement. Productive and happy, Grant could even be seen as a paradigm of Freud’s definition of mental health: aggression sublimated into work. But he has never put much stock in psychoanalysis  —   if the work is not   he’s skeptical. “I think a lot of it is baggage that goes back to Freud, and Freud would always say that whatever is going on with you can be traced back to something that happened early in childhood with your mother,” he told me, by phone, as he was driving to work one day. “You can either accept that or be in denial. You can’t win!” He would rather simply understand himself as someone who gets a lot out of giving, then harness that feeling, study it and see how the mechanisms involved can inspire others to succeed. One night Grant forwarded me a grateful   from a student whose life, the student said, changed because of some advice Grant gave her. I commented that most people would be thrilled to receive one note like that in a lifetime. “I get several dozen a week,” Grant said. He agreed to send some my way. That evening, at around 8:30, the   started coming  —   Thank you for our conversation the other day and for your genius. . . . I couldn’t have done this without you. . . . I cannot thank you enough for your time and insight. . . . I’m thrilled. And I have you to thank. . . . After the first 10, I was impressed when they kept arriving, I was surprised. On and on, until almost 11, my   kept pinging when I awoke the next morning, I saw that he had forwarded me 41   from the preceding week, each one of them numbered for my convenience. Was this compulsive behavior? “Not really,” Grant said. “I would see it as   and focused. ” He said the question had generated a new research idea for him: “How Prosocial Behavior Can Mitigate O. C. D. Tendencies. ” Grant’s book, incorporating several decades of   research on reciprocity, divides the world into three categories: givers, matchers and takers. Givers give without expectation of immediate gain they never seem too busy to help, share credit actively and mentor generously. Matchers go through life with a master chit list in mind, giving when they can see how they will get something of equal value back and to people who they think can help them. And takers seek to come out ahead in every exchange they manage up and are defensive about their turf. Most people surveyed fall into the matcher category  —   but givers, Grant says, are overrepresented at both ends of the spectrum of success: they are the doormats who go nowhere or burn out, and they are the stars whose giving motivates them or distinguishes them as leaders. Much of Grant’s book sets out to establish the difference between the givers who are exploited and those who end up as models of achievement. The most successful givers, Grant explains, are those who rate high in concern for others but also in  . And they are strategic in their giving  —   they give to other givers and matchers, so that their work has the maximum desired effect they are cautious about giving to takers they give in ways that reinforce their social ties and they consolidate their giving into chunks, so that the impact is intense enough to be gratifying. (Grant incorporates his field’s findings into his own life with methodical rigor: one reason he meets with students four and a half hours in one day rather than spreading it out over the week is that a study found that consolidating giving yields more happiness.) The studies are elaborate, the findings nuanced  —   but it is easy to walk away from the book forgetting the cautionary tales about people who give too much and remembering only the wash of stories about boundless generosity resulting in surprising rewards: a computer programmer who built a Web site at no cost for music fans (one of whom turns out to be an influential figure in Silicon Valley) a financial adviser who travels to take on a client thought to be impoverished (only to find that person sitting on a significant fortune) the writers who start out working free on a project for a friend (and somehow end up among the most successful in Hollywood). I had assumed that Grant, and the other examples of extreme givers in his book, were simply superhuman in one way or another  —   not only in the acute empathy that makes giving so rewarding for them but also in their unusual focus and stamina and   speed, traits that allow them to bend time and squeeze in more generosity than the rest of us. Grant, clearly, has some advantages beyond his propensity to help: more than one of his colleagues told me, for example, that when they cannot find the citation for a particular paper, they simply   Grant directly, who is more reliable than Google and almost as fast (his childhood friends called him Mr. Facts). But Grant believes that in terms of giving, we all have the same muscle it’s just that he and the other givers in his book have exercised it more. In “Give and Take,” he cites a study that found that most people lose physical strength after enduring a test of will, like resisting   cookies when they are hungry. Typically, the study’s subjects could squeeze a handgrip for only 25 seconds after an exercise in willpower. But one group distinguished itself, squeezing the grip for 35 seconds after the test of will. They were people who were on the giving end of the   scale. “By consistently overriding their selfish impulses in order to help others, they had strengthened their psychological muscles, to the point where using willpower for painful tasks was no longer exhausting,” writes Grant of the study, conducted by researchers at Northwestern University. It seems too simple to assume that Grant just happens to be capable of great discipline across all facets of his life all those exercises in will, he would argue, feed each other, with one making the others possible. I like to think I am a typically helpful person, but after reading Grant’s book, I found myself experimenting with being more proactive about it. I started ending   by encouraging people to let me know if I could help them in one way or another. I put more effort into answering random entreaties from students trying to place articles. I encouraged contacts seeking work or connections to see me as a resource. And I did notice that simply avoiding the mental lag of deciding whether to help or not was helpful. At a minimum, Grant’s example presents a   rule: Unless the person on the other end is a proven taker, just do it  —   collaborate, offer up, grant the favor. The first time I exchanged those   I usually felt good after the second exchange on a given topic, I thought perhaps I had done my duty. But I noticed that every offer of help I initiated or granted engendered four or five   at the end of which I sometimes felt surly and behind on my work  —   and then guilty for feeling that way. Worse, those exchanges often even ended with the person on the other end wanting to meet for coffee. Coffee! Now I struggled to find a way to say, gracefully, that there was no way I could meet for coffee  —   not this week or next or the week after that, because there are only so many hours in the day, and if I do not get home in time to make dinner, my children will dine on Pirate’s Booty and Smarties, which would not make me feel helpful or productive or good. Children. It must be said that in the middle of a national debate about flexible hours and telecommuting, there is precious little in Grant’s book about work and family balance. The division of labor in Grant’s own marriage is very traditional his wife, who has a degree in psychiatric nursing, does not work outside the home, devoting her time to the care of their two young daughters and their home. Grant would be an extraordinary giver under any circumstances but it can only help that he doesn’t have to worry about running to the grocery store or renewing the car registration. “Sometimes I tell him, ‘Adam  —   just say no,’ ” his wife, Allison, told me, referring to the hundreds of requests he gets every day. “But he can’t say no. That’s what he is. That’s his way. ” Grant is devoted to his family  —   he has dinner most nights at home and takes his daughter to a preschool activity on many afternoons. But he also works at least one full day on the weekend, as well as six evenings a week, often well past 11. Once, when Grant was asked to give a talk on productivity, he confessed to a mentor that for all his research, he was still not sure what he did that was any different from anyone else. It wasn’t exactly a mystery, his mentor told him: He worked more. “I made a commitment to talk about that more,” Grant said. He did not mean to suggest that everyone should work on weekends he wanted them to be aware that they were making a choice, maybe even one they felt good about. “The way I see it, I have several different roles,” he told me: teacher, scholar, adviser, friend, to name a few. “I’d be concerned if any of those roles took more of my time than my family. ” Grant, of course, has conducted a study investigating whether giving behaviors at work translate into happiness at home. He found that people who felt they had contributed to others’   at work did not always feel great at the end of the workday but they usually did by bedtime, especially if they had reflected about their contribution in the intervening hours. It turns out that bringing your work home with you can be beneficial after all  —   if you’re thinking about it the right way. A skeptic might read Grant’s book and conclude that extreme givers are just matchers who are in it, maybe even subconsciously, for the long run. Eventually, in ways that are predictable and unpredictable, the bounty returns to them. Grant’s giving instincts might be reflexive, but they do clearly contribute to his success. “The entire world feels like it owes him a favor  —   including me,” says Justin Berg, a doctoral candidate who studies creativity at Wharton and who has collaborated with Grant. “People rush at the opportunity to work with him. ” And one round of giving enables another: when Grant calls on a work contact and asks her to meet with an undergraduate seeking work, chances are that contact is more than happy to enable Grant’s favor, because she has already been the beneficiary of more than one from him herself. The path to success is filled with people helping to clear the way. From the point of creativity, Grant’s undiscriminating helpfulness also reaps professional benefits, Berg says. “The best ideas occur to people who are touching multiple worlds and domains. And in our field, he’s at the nexus of a lot of them. ” Because one study found that old friends and connections can be even more valuable as resources than current ones  —   because they intersect with different worlds and therefore have more fresh ideas  —   Grant has a tickler built into his calendar reminding him, once a month, to get in touch with a contact he likes but with whom he has temporarily lost touch. And he is highly efficient about his giving: he virtually never says no to the   favor, something that will help someone out  —   an introduction, a quick suggestion  —   but cost him very little, relative to impact. We were sitting in Grant’s office one afternoon talking about efficiency, when he said: “The truth is, I don’t care how many articles I publish or how many words I write. Productivity is an imperfect way of indexing how much I’m contributing, how I’m using my limited time to make the most difference. ” It wasn’t until I was transcribing the conversation a few days later that I realized that when he referred to his limited time, he wasn’t just talking about a busy schedule there was a more existential tug in the phrase. I brought it up with him by phone. “It’s the kind of thing I almost never talk about,” Grant said. “But my responsibility is to be open. ” Mortality, he said, was the one subject that gave him something like panic attacks. He had always felt that way, since he was a brainy, sensitive kid playing basketball in his driveway, staring at the sun, suddenly terrified of what would happen when it burned out. That was why he first wanted to be a scientist  —   before he realized biology bored him and he would never reinvent physics  —   so he could help figure out how to extend life, or at least design the spacecrafts that he is sure, even now, will take us to safer planets if this one runs dry. Mortality, he said, is “something I can’t fix. I can’t do anything with or about it. ” He can’t let himself think about it too much he has lost days at a time to his anxiety, “to the point that it’s the equivalent of extreme physical pain. ” It struck Grant as odd that no one had ever tried to figure how the awareness of death motivates people’s behavior at work, and in 2009, he published a paper trying to understand the link between mortality and productivity: “The Hot and Cool of Death Awareness at Work: Mortality Cues, Aging and   and Prosocial Motivations. ” The study walks the reader through the fascinating field of death awareness, which measures how people respond to reminders of death, like a news clip about a deadly car crash. When and how, he asked, does the prospect of death become relevant to employees at work? Grant argued that when people’s reactions to reminders of death are “hot”  —   anxious and panicked  —   those workers tend to withdraw. But when they are “cool”  —   more reflective, as in response to chronic reminders, the kinds, for example, firefighters face  —   those workers would be more likely to “reflect on the meaning of life and their potential contributions. ” Grant wrote the paper, in part, to try to sort out his own hot and cool feelings on the subject. Contemplating the meaning of life doesn’t make him want to relax and work less. “I always go back to William James,” he said. “ ‘The greatest use of a life is to spend it on something that will outlast it.’ A big part of it is being remembered. ” Besides, relaxing stresses him out. “For me, in my moments of idleness, I experience the most existential anxiety, so I like that every moment is scheduled, even when it’s having on my calendar that I’m going to watch a television show with my wife. It means my brain is engaged in other things, and it’s not going to be a terrifying evening. ” Grant would be the first to say that he is not purely altruistic  —   that pure altruism, giving without regard for one’s   perhaps does not even exist. When he writes those 100 student recommendations, he says, he gets the satisfaction of helping them succeed. But there are other happy byproducts of that work as well: he might end up the beneficiary of those students’ good will later on and possibly inspire them to try to do right by those who will eventually ask them for help. He will also have kept himself busy enough that he won’t have much time to spend agonizing over what happens when he can’t give anymore. As he left the office after one of our meetings, Grant headed for his car, carrying another gift of gratitude: a twiggy box filled with organic jellies and dried fruit from the Environmental Defense Fund, to which he had recently spoken about how to motivate their  . On the way to the garage, Grant told me the story of a time that someone asked quite a lot from him. “So I got an   out of the blue from a recent Ph. D. who wanted career advice,” Grant said. “And I spoke to him for a while on the phone  —   twice. But then, after that, he asks me if I could give him comments on his dissertation, and he sends me this thing that was like 300 pages long. It was one of those moments  —   yikes!” Grant did not know this academic and was not an expert on the subject. This, I thought, was the   last straw, an occasion when Grant not only said no but also perhaps found the request itself galling. Surely he did not shun his family, his students, his ultimate Frisbee game, his research and his   list of   requests for the hours that it would have taken him to analyze a   dissertation. Even Adam Grant must say no sometimes. Grant said that he rarely feels resentful of such requests. “It’s on me if I want to say no,” he said. “I own my guilt. ” He did decide that in this case, the time it would take to read the paper would be excessive  —   and that indulging the impulse to read it all would be tantamount, in the logic of Grant’s thinking, to letting himself down, flouting his own rules of efficient giving. “So I just skimmed it for the most important parts,” he said, and gave general feedback on those points. The author then reworked the paper completely and sent it back to Grant to read again. Grant, of course, complied. “And guess what?” Grant said, breaking out in a smile. “The paper was great!”",0
7898,Introducing The Upshot’s Presidential Prediction Model - The New York Times,"For now, at least, Hillary Clinton has a 76 percent chance of defeating Donald Trump to become president of the United States. A victory by Mr. Trump remains quite possible: Mrs. Clinton’s chance of losing is about the same probability that an N. B. A. player will miss a free throw. This electoral probability, the first forecast by the Upshot’s presidential prediction model, is based on the voting history of each state and on roughly 300 state and national polls of the race conducted since  . Our model suggests Mrs. Clinton is a strong favorite in 14 states and the District of Columbia, enough to give her 186 of the 270 electoral votes she needs to win the White House. Add to this eight more states that polls currently show are leaning Democratic  —   including Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania  —   and Mrs. Clinton would have 275 electoral votes and the presidency. But, with 16 weeks remaining in the campaign, a lot can change. Using the same model, we would have said that Bill Clinton had less than a 20 percent chance to win the presidency with roughly four months to go in 1992. It was only after Ross Perot left the race and the Democrats rallied around Mr. Clinton after the Democratic convention that his polls improved. And they improved sharply. One month later, he was an 84 percent favorite. This kind of polling volatility should be expected, particularly with party conventions at hand. It is one reason that Mrs. Clinton’s probability of victory is not higher. Current polling averages suggest a   victory in the national popular vote for Mrs. Clinton, if nothing changes. But we expect changes between now and Election Day. The Upshot is not the only news organization trying to forecast election results. We believe each model provides useful glimpses of possible futures, so we are compiling forecasts from a variety of them into one    table. Viewed side by side, the differences among the models become clearer. Arizona, for example, is rated as a tossup by FiveThirtyEight, while our model has not yet seen enough polling evidence to revise its assessment of Arizona’s recent history as a   state. Similarly, while the betting markets rate New Mexico as almost a sure thing in the Democratic column, our model is not as certain, giving Mr. Trump a 21 percent chance to upset Mrs. Clinton there. We’ll update our forecast every day until Election Day. Check here to see our predictions and that of others, and to play around with the possible paths that could lead Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Trump to victory. Below is more about how we built our model. Our model is slow to move. This is by design. Our model starts with a weighted average of polls in each state, giving polls conducted more recently and polls with a larger sample size a greater weight in the average. At this point in the election cycle, it uses a longer time window to calculate these averages. This steadiness means it is more stable and less inclined to chase after the most recent poll. But it also means it is slower to react to developing trends, such as recent polling that may indicate a tightening race. This can be a feature or a bug, depending on your perspective. Preconvention polls are informative, but history suggests that it is a mistake to place too much emphasis on a week’s worth of polling. Let’s say you want to forecast the average margin of national polls for the next month. Would you rather take the average of the polls from the previous two weeks or average every poll from the previous two months? More often than not, you’d be better off taking the average of the longer period. This informs the approach taken by our model. That said, we expect the simulations in our model to converge rapidly over the next month or two, as the conventions end and polling becomes more predictive of the final outcome. Distributions are more interesting than averages. Our estimate for Mrs. Clinton’s lead over Mr. Trump nationally is 3. 7 points our friends at FiveThirtyEight have a slightly smaller estimate of 3. 4 points, but our overall probabilities of winning differ by 12 percentage points. This is a small difference, but a notable one. We believe one source of the difference is in the ways we believe states will (or won’t) swing together, and how much they’ll shift. This is illustrated best by seeing our electoral distributions side by side: The FiveThirtyEight histogram is wider and flatter than ours. It assigns a greater chance that something highly unusual will happen, while ours thinks that the course of this election will look pretty much like the ones that have come before it. For example, we think there is only about a 1 percent chance that Mrs. Clinton will get fewer than 160 electoral votes. The FiveThirtyEight model assigns that prospect an 8 percent chance. Fundamentals say it’s a good year for Mr. Trump, but we don’t rely much on fundamentals.  Although our model uses how states voted in previous presidential elections as a starting point, it is almost entirely a   model. In contrast, some other models of presidential elections use   fundamentals to arrive at their forecasts, like the state of the economy and the number of years the Democrats have been in power. These fundamentals models will generally be more favorable to Mr. Trump history suggests that this should be a more   election cycle. For example, the FiveThirtyEight “ ” model has been more favorable to Mr. Trump than the “ ” model. Our model is well calibrated. One of the differences between a model and a simpler polling average is that the model knows how wrong it has been in the past. So when we say that we think Mrs. Clinton has a 14 percent chance of winning North Dakota, we mean that, judging from how the polling averages have moved in previous election cycles, candidates in Mrs. Clinton’s position have won in one in seven similar situations in past elections. Of course, there is no guarantee that this election will turn out the way that elections have in the past, a flaw that is common to any forecasting model. These numbers are our best guesses using the information we have. Expect shifts. This has been a long election cycle, but the ride will probably get even more wild. Our forecast will move again, here’s where you can find it.",0
7899,Aleppo Close to Falling Under Complete Control of Syrian Government - The New York Times,"BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   The siege in Aleppo is almost over. Advances by Syrian government forces and their allies have squeezed the fighters and civilians remaining in   parts of the city into a sliver of territory, spokesmen for the government and the opposition forces said on Monday. The last civilians caught in the shrinking antigovernment enclave issued panicked calls for help. Late Monday, several residents reported via text and voice messages that they were crowded into abandoned apartments and rainy streets, exposed to shelling and afraid they would be killed or arrested if   forces reached them, as antigovernment activists circulated reports of scores of summary killings in retaken areas. The United Nations secretary general, Ban   said in a statement on Monday that he was alarmed by reports of atrocities against a large number of civilians, including women and children. It appeared increasingly likely that the government would gain control of the whole of Aleppo, the largest city in Syria, within days, if not hours. Videos from   districts showed people celebrating in the streets, waving flags and honking horns. That would be a turning point in the civil war, cementing government control over all of Syria’s most important cities and forcing the opposition and its backers to reckon with whether their movement, especially the armed rebellion, has failed. It also raises questions about how an increasingly confident President Bashar   will govern a deeply wounded and divided country where war still rages. Mr. Assad’s recent military successes have depended heavily on help from Russia, Iran and the   Lebanese Shiite militant group Hezbollah, which are reviled by many of Mr. Assad’s Sunni opponents, and viewed with unease even by some of his supporters because of their growing power in the country. Large areas of Aleppo and other cities and towns have been reduced to rubble by the fighting. And rebel forces, Kurdish militias and Islamic State fighters are still operating in large areas of northern and eastern Syria. That has been vividly clear in recent days, with Islamic State fighters advancing in the desert city of Palmyra, amid its ancient ruins, as the government focused on Aleppo. For civilians trapped behind the battle lines in Aleppo, though, more urgent questions loomed. Time appeared to be running out to strike a deal to allow them to evacuate. Rebel and opposition leaders want evacuees to be given an option to go to territory they control. Many of the remaining civilians refuse to go to   territory because they are afraid they would be jailed and tortured there. Others say the bombardment in their districts is too intense to allow any escape. There were also reports in state news media of rebel shelling of   areas. According to the Russian government, Mr. Assad’s main foreign backer, more than 100, 000 people have fled from the rebel enclave to   areas, and 2, 200 rebel fighters have surrendered. At least 13, 000 people have fled in the past 24 hours, it said. But there are still believed to be thousands of civilians trapped in districts that have been bombarded for more than 24 hours, while the army and its militia allies seized most of the southern part of the city. “An important call in the name of civilians to help them,” Abdelkafi   a teacher and antigovernment activist, said in a text message to a group of journalists. “Stop bombing. Take them out. ” The situation was so desperate, residents said, that it was unclear whether rebels and civilians there could even hold a meeting to decide whether to surrender and evacuate. “Believe me, no one rejects the safety evacuation,” one resident, Yasser Abu   said in a text message to the journalists’ group. “All of us are waiting, dying now in the last neighborhoods. ” Hisham   is a civilian member of the local council that had tried to govern the   areas of Aleppo, which once included half the city. Mr. Skeif expressed frustration that while international officials were in contact with rebel leaders, no one appeared to be talking directly to the trapped civilians. “All the political activists and the media, the relief workers, the unarmed, we are about 1, 000, including our families,” he said. Though the government has said it would offer amnesty to anyone who surrenders, “if the regime entered, we will be slaughtered,” he said. “Of course everybody is negotiating with those who are armed, but we are not armed. ” “The armed can defend themselves, but we can’t,” he added. Mr. Hamdo said in a series of text messages that families in Aleppo were “waiting death together. ” “People are running, don’t know where,” he wrote. “People are under the rubble alive, and no one can save them. Some people are injured in the streets, and no one can go to help them cuz the bombs are always on the same place. ” Some rebel leaders have said that the United States, which backs some rebel groups, sent them a proposal that would allow evacuees their choice of destination, under security guarantees from Russia. But trust has eroded, and no agreement had emerged by Monday night. Syrian and Russian officials say the offensive in Aleppo will continue until rebels surrender or die. “The issue of withdrawing militants is the subject of separate agreements,” Sergei Ryabkov, the Russian deputy foreign minister, told the Ria news agency on Monday. “This agreement has not yet been reached, largely because the United States insists on unacceptable terms. ” The sticking point for months has been a dispute between Russia and the United States over what to do about fighters linked with Al Qaeda who are among the rebel groups in eastern Aleppo. The United Nations estimates that about 10 percent of the 8, 000 rebel fighters in the city belong to a   group, the Levant Conquest Front. The rebels and their international backers say the figure is much lower the government says it is much higher. Before the government broke through the rebel defenses, the United Nations was proposing that the Levant Conquest Front leave Aleppo in exchange for three main broad concessions from the government side: an end to bombardment protection and aid for remaining civilians and some form of local administration for rebel areas. But the government rejected any form of   saying that it would “reward terrorists,” while the rebels rejected versions of the deal that did not include it. Now, there is no meaningful rebel territory left for the local opposition council to govern. “We are hearing terrifying S O S calls from the civilians, but we can’t do anything,” said Bassem   a spokesman for Nour     one of the main rebel groups in Aleppo. “The fighters are defending, but they are retreating under pressure. Unfortunately, the situation is very bad. ” The focus has now shifted to ending the bombardment and protecting the remaining civilians from reprisals, a reasonable fear in a country where, throughout the   conflict, people have been tortured and killed in prison for opposing the government. “Understand this,” Mr. Hamdo, who said his wife and small daughter were cowering in their apartment with him, wrote on Twitter. “I can’t simply surrender and being captive. I am speaking out, and this is a crime. I might then ask death, and not got it. ” Malek, an activist who asked to be identified only by his first name for fear that he would soon find himself in government territory, said he had moved on Monday to a safer place for the 10th time since the offensive began, along with his cats, Rocky and Loz, the Arabic word for almond. “Why should I lie? I’m not well,” he said in a series of voice messages. “We are people, are being deleted from the human map. We have two neighborhoods and one street, and the regime will keep bombing this small area. ” Bodies were stuck under the rubble, Malek said, and even members of the White Helmets civil defense group could not rescue anyone, because the group’s equipment had been destroyed and their members scattered by the shelling. Still attempting to find humor, he said that his cat Rocky had lost “his fiancée” along the way. “Now he’s lonely,” Malek said. Dr. Salem, a dentist who had kept his clinic open until last week, finally moved to one of the last rebel neighborhoods as his own was taken by government forces. He said he walked through streets shrouded in smoke, and littered with the dead and wounded, to a small area where thousands were crowded in a shrinking space. “There will be a massacre if one rocket falls here,” said Dr. Salem, using only his first name.",0

[With over two billion pageviews generated in 2016 and 45 million unique monthly visitors, Breitbart News has now surpassed Fox News (#47) Huffington Post (#50) Washington Post (#53) and Buzzfeed (#64) in traffic.   “The numbers speak for themselves,” said Breitbart News President and CEO Larry Solov. “Our 2017 global expansion strategy is hands down the most aggressive growth initiative in the history of the company.

Breitbart has the number one political Facebook and Twitter pages in the world, according to analytics giant NewsWhip. Yet unlike many competitors, says Breitbart News    Alex Marlow, the company’s primary traffic is not disproportionately beholden to social media it comes from destination traffic. “Establishment media —  the same folks who laughed off Donald Trump —  are mystified by what makes Breitbart the powerhouse we’ve become,” said Marlow. “We’ve built an authentic,   community where people come to hang out to join in the conversation that’s taking place 24 hours a day. ” Marlow added: “It’s a beautiful, loud, intensely savvy 45   community where we read    reporting devoid of establishment spin and then discuss, debate, and share what it all means with the world. ” When Breitbart relaunched its website in 2012, the publisher generated roughly 12 million pageviews a month.

7902,A Business With Legs (and Abs): Boom Times for Male Striptease Revues - The New York Times,"LOS ANGELES  —   It all started with Uncle Tony. In summer 1989, Tony Hassan opened a Detroit agency to book strippers for local bachelor blowouts. By the time his shy nephew, Myles Hass, finished high school two decades later, the little company, Erotic Image (“give the gift that unwraps itself”) was a scorching success  —   so much so that Mr. Hass hatched a spinoff plan. Nude dudes. Mr. Hass spotted bachelorette parties as a growing market for male strippers. (Credit “Sex and the City. ”) And he started to fantasize: What about creating a   male revue? Competing with the    Chippendales or the   Thunder From Down Under was too much to dream. But he could probably book Michigan clubs. Detroit. Grand Rapids. Maybe even Kalamazoo. “Something quality, with real showmanship,” Mr. Hass told me over drinks at the W Hollywood hotel recently. “Not a traveling group of man whores. ” His publicist, seated beside him, shifted uncomfortably, but Mr. Hass, 28, has nothing to be embarrassed about. Last year, his touring revue, Magic Men Live, sold roughly $5 million worth of tickets at 148 shows in North America. Mr. Hass, who will introduce a    Magic Men on Tuesday in Rapid City, S. D. thinks attendance could double in the coming years. Now that is a business with legs. “I can’t believe it, either, to be honest with you,” said Mr. Hass, who moved to Los Angeles from Detroit a few months ago. “When we started out, we were literally driving our own cars, four guys to a vehicle, sleeping on each other in uncomfortable positions. ” He added: “I started this company while living with my parents. From my childhood bedroom. Now women arrive by the thousands. It’s like, ‘Here we go, boys! ’” As it turns out, and I did some serious investigating here, this   corner of show business is booming. Interest has been fueled by the “Magic Mike” male stripper movies  —   no relation to Magic Men  —   and the “Fifty Shades of Grey” books, films and products, which have prompted women in more conservative areas (and audiences are 99 percent women, Mr. Hass said) to more openly enjoy watching guys gyrate onstage. The Chippendales are not only still grinding away in Las Vegas (“  goodness,” the website promises). Their global tours also attract a growing audience roughly two million people (again, mostly women) went to see a Chippendales show last year, according to Michael Caprio, a spokesman. Competitors include Thunder From Down Under and   . The creation of Black Magic Live, a new multiracial revue, was chronicled on a Lifetime reality show in January that starred Vivica A. Fox. (She was pilloried for claiming gay men are not a target audience  —   “hell no,” she said  —   leading to a public mea culpa.) And another mainstream star, Channing Tatum, is joining the fray. His male revue, Magic Mike Live, took up residency at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas late last month. Mr. Tatum, a force behind the “Magic Mike” movies, served as one of the revue’s directors. A publicist for Magic Mike Live declined interview requests, so it’s difficult to know how serious of a production it is. The Las Vegas   said it included “acrobatic aerialism on harnesses. ” (Sorry, ladies  —   and gents!  —   Mr. Tatum will not disrobe in it. But he does know how: He once made a living in a Florida revue called Male Encounter.) You may think that the young upstart of Magic Men would be sweating Magic Mike’s arrival. After all, Mr. Hass  —   even in his      state  —   is just a guy from Detroit, while Mr. Tatum has all the resources of a major celebrity. Mr. Hass also openly trades on the “Magic Mike” films, billing his Magic Men revue as “the first stage production to bring the phenomenon of ‘Magic Mike,’ ‘Fifty Shades of Grey’ and others to life with a   experience. ” Among the Magic Men merchandise that Mr. Hass sells is a $25 shirt with the words “Alright, alright, alriiiight,” a phrase associated with Matthew McConaughey, who starred in “Magic Mike,” which was released in 2012 and took in $167 million, spawning a 2015 sequel. But Mr. Hass does not seem worried. “They will do their thing, and we will do ours,” he said. “I don’t see us as competing. We tour. They stay in Vegas. ” His new Magic Men show, he added, “has nothing to do with those movies except for us paying our respects to them. ” Mr. Hass declined to say how “Magic Mike” would be incorporated into his revamped show. “He wants to be able to surprise the fans,” his publicist, Andy Keown, wrote in an email. Despite different packaging and a few unique niches  —   the Chippendales also sing, for instance  —   these shows are fairly interchangeable. A striptease is a striptease. Just switch out the abs, put on some dance music and add fake fog. “Everyone who is doing this now is just copying what we originated,” Mr. Caprio said. (For the record, he added, the Chippendales have brand cachet that others lack, pointing to the casting of Chippendales dancers in the Syfy channel’s “Sharknado 4. ” I told him I had missed that one. Mr. Caprio sent me to Google with these instructions: “Search for Chippendales and crotch fight. ”) Mr. Hass, who arrived for our interview wearing a leather jacket and a backward baseball hat, has a boyish charm and manscaped eyebrows. He performs in Magic Men as the M. C. warming up the crowd and introducing dancers who go by names like Cowboy Christian and Boy Toy Troy. He employs 25 people, including 10 dancers, and tours with two sleeper buses and an   to carry sound and lighting equipment. Part of his success appears to come from a savvy use of geography: Magic Men mostly visits smaller cities, bringing a style of entertainment not often seen in spots like Bismarck, N. D. and Owensboro, Ky. Troupe members regularly interact with fans on Snapchat and Instagram. Magic Men has 1. 1 million followers on Facebook Chippendales has about 803, 300. “One of my friends was following them on Snapchat, and she kind of got me hooked,” Johnelle Allen, 28, told me by phone from her home in Albuquerque. Ms. Allen, a single mother, has been to five Magic Men shows over the last year, posting about her experiences online and trading messages with the dancers on Snapchat. “You wouldn’t think they would be    but they are,” she said. “They make us feel like we’re all friends. ” Ms. Allen said she enjoyed the escape that Magic Men performances provided from her everyday life. Watching the men strip down to “the smallest boxer briefs you have ever seen in your life” is less titillating than funny, she said. At one of the last performances she saw, a dancer started his routine wearing a furry,   Elmo costume. Putting a “Sesame Street” character into a sexually charged setting, she said, made the audience really hoot and howl. But wait. Five performances over the past year? “They have multiple stops in one area, so we also went to see them in Amarillo and El Paso,” she said. “It’s like a boy band. ” Except without as many clothes.",0
7903,The SPLC’s Libelous New Report on 'Anti-Muslim Extremists',"The SPLC’s Libelous New Report on 'Anti-Muslim Extremists' Equating counter-jihadists with jihadists. Robert Spencer 
The objective of this libelous new report from the hard-Left money-making and incitement machine the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) is made plain within it: “Before you book a spokesperson from an anti-Muslim extremist group or quote them in a story, research their background — detailed in this in-depth guide to 15 of the most visible anti-Muslim activists— and consider the consequences of giving them a platform.” 
They wish to silence those who speak honestly about the nature and magnitude of the jihad threat, blaming us for a supposed rise in “Islamophobia.” If they really want to stamp out suspicion of Islam, of course, they will move against not us, but the likes of Omar Mateen, Syed Rizwan Farook, Tashfeen Malik, Nidal Malik Hasan, Mohammed Abdulazeez, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, and the myriad other Muslims who commit violence in the name of Islam and justify it by reference to Islamic teachings. 
The SPLC doesn’t do that because its objective is not really to stop “Islamophobia” at all, but to create the illusion of a powerful and moneyed network of “Islamophobes,” who can only be stopped if you write a check to the SPLC. That’s what this is really all about. 
In constructing this illusory edifice, the SPLC labels me and fourteen others “anti-Muslim extremists.” We are, of course, no more “anti-Muslim” than foes of the Nazis were anti-German, but note the word “extremists.” That’s the mainstream media and Obama administration’s term of choice for jihad terrorists. In what way are we “extremists”? Has anyone on the SPLC’s hit list (and given the SPLC’s track record of inciting violence against its targets, that is exactly what it is) ever blown anything or anyone up? Beheaded anyone? Boasted of our imminent conquest of any territory and the massacre of or enslavement of its people? No, all we have done is speak critically about jihad terror and Sharia oppression. The SPLC is trying to further the libel that we are the other side of the coin, the non-Muslim bin Ladens and Awlakis. Until we commit any terror attacks or conspire with others to do so, however, the SPLC’s libel is only that: a libel. 
It’s also passingly ironic that the SPLC list includes several people who are doubtless horrified to be in this company, as they have endeavored for years to distinguish their message from that of those whom they themselves would smear as “Islamophobes.” But their temporizing and pandering didn’t work: they ended up on the Index of Prohibited Thinkers anyway, as will, ultimately, anyone who dares to note that Islam just might have something to do with the acts of murder committed in its name and in accord with its teachings. 
The “report” as a whole stands as an example of the Left’s strange tendency to present true statements as if they were self-evidently false, without bothering to explain why. Apparently the SPLC knows its supporters and is aware that it doesn’t need to bother with troublesome things like, you know, facts. 
The SPLC’s hit list recurrently excoriates people for making true statements that it apparently regards as self-evidently false. For example, it says that Ann Corcoran of Refugee Resettlement Watch “accuses immigrant-run stores of illegally trafficking in food stamps.” This is a case that Corcoran makes with evidence – evidence that the SPLC doesn’t bother to try disproving. It says that Steven Emerson of the Investigative Project on Terrorism “has claimed that the Obama administration ‘extensively collaborates’ with the Muslim Brotherhood.” That he actually has done so doesn’t seem to bother them. As Andrew C. McCarthy has noted , “Barack Obama has spent his presidency cultivating Islamists, particularly from the international Muslim Brotherhood and its affiliates in the United States.” The SPLC also hits Emerison for having “asserted that Europe is riddled with ‘no-go zones.’” Regarding “no-go zones,” here are some news articles from just the past few weeks: 
Germany: Police “sick” of citizens’ no-go zone fears 
The SPLC excoriates Brigitte Gabriel of ACT for America for saying that any “practicing Muslim who believes the word of the Koran to be the word of Allah … who goes to mosque and prays every Friday, who prays five times a day — this practicing Muslim, who believes in the teachings of the Koran, cannot be a loyal citizen of the United States.” Yet it says nothing, of course, about the many teachings of the Qur’an that contradict American Constitutional principles: the denial of the freedom of speech, the death penalty for apostasy, the devaluation of women, and more. How to reconcile these teachings with U.S. citizenship, the SPLC did not bother to explain. 
The SPLC quotes David Horowitz saying: “There are only a couple of degrees of separation between anybody on the left and the terrorists — and that includes people in the Democratic Party, even those who are anti-terrorist.” Here again, no refutation is offered – yet the Left’s dalliance with Palestinian jihad groups and overall anti-Americanism make it impossible to dismiss Horowitz’s assertion. 
Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy, we’re told, “is gripped by paranoid fantasies about Muslims destroying the West from within.” The SPLC doesn’t bother to mention the Explanatory Memorandum on the General Strategic Goal for the Brotherhood in North America , the captured Muslim Brotherhood internal document that explained that Brotherhood members “must understand that their work in America is a kind of grand Jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and ‘sabotaging’ its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and God’s religion is made victorious over all other religions.” 
In attacking Pamela Geller of the American Freedom Defense Initiative, the SPLC descended to outright fabrications. Notes Geller : “Their claim that I insist that Obama is the ‘love child’ of Malcolm X is patently untrue. The SPLC also states that I ‘have spoken to a neo-fascist group in Germany,’ when in fact I have never even been to Germany.” It characterizes former FBI agent John Guandolo’s claim that CIA director John Brennan was a convert to Islam as an “outlandish accusation,” when in fact “a U.S. asset assigned overseas with Brennan in Saudi Arabia when he was station chief confirmed years ago their firsthand account that Brennan was indeed the target of a Saudi intelligence influence operation that led to his conversion. Brennan has also stated publicly that he visited Mecca, which is impossible for a non-Muslim to do unless he is a special guest of the Saudi King.” 
Even more strangely, the SPLC targets Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a woman who grew up as a Muslim in Somalia, suffered genital mutilated at the hands of Muslims, is under death threats from Muslims, and lives in exile from her homeland because of Muslims. Instead of trying to discredit her, the SPLC should be honoring her for her stand for human rights against Sharia oppression. But the SPLC has other priorities. 
Of me, the SPLC concedes that I am a “real intellectual” but complains that I am “entirely self-taught in the study of Islam.” An odd objection. One cannot be both “self-taught” and a “real intellectual”? In any case, it’s false: I am indeed mostly self-taught in the study of Islam, and make no secret of or apologies for it; every day’s headlines proves me correct. Nonetheless, the fact is that I did first read the Qur’an and began studying Islam in earnest while at the University of North Carolina. My claims, says the SPLC, are “provably false,” but then only offers a number of them that are demonstrably true, without any attempt to refute them. 
It even says that I have “referred to Barack Obama as ‘the first Muslim president.’” This one epitomizes the dishonesty of the SPLC. The quote comes from an article I wrote in 2007 discussing how Obama was not a Muslim, stating that his obvious affinity for Islam and the Muslim world could make him into “our first Muslim president” the way Bill Clinton was called “our first black president.” After eight years of Obama, I’d say I was proven correct in rather spectacular fashion. 
The SPLC, finally, hits me for having “even suggested that the media may be getting money to depict Muslims in a positive light.” 
The facts are once again deeply unfortunate for the SPLC: George Soros funded a report on “Islamophobia” on Twitter and gave $200,000 to the Center for American Progress for a defamatory report on alleged “Islamophobes.” He also spent $600,000 for favorable coverage of the Muslim migrant inundation, bought favorable coverage of the Iran deal , and bought “Islamophobia” propaganda after the San Bernardino jihad massacre. 
But what need does the SPLC have of facts? It knows its readers won’t check up on the veracity of its claims, but will accept them at face value, since the SPLC is of the camp of the saints, the enlightened and tolerant Left. Those who are outside that camp clearly have no rights that the SPLC feels bound to respect.",0
7904,"Review: In ‘The Girl on the Train,’ a Boozy Emily Blunt Never Winks - The New York Times","“The Girl on the Train” is a preposterous movie but not an unenjoyable one. If that sounds like faint praise, well, it is and it isn’t. There’s always something to be said for an entertainment that sustains its nuttiness all the way to its twisty finish. This one may not make much sense, but  —   like a demented old film noir or a Shonda Rhimes show at its crazed best  —   “Girl” doesn’t falter in its absurdity or commitment to its own seriousness. It never winks. You may laugh (as the audience I saw it with did, on and off) but there’s genuine pleasure in that mirth. It’s based on the 2015 book by the British author Paula Hawkins that vaulted to the top of the   list with a mix of unreliable narration, suspicious characters, ugly emotions, freewheeling gender stereotypes and a slowly kinking mystery that becomes as perilous as the labyrinth at the Overlook Hotel. With a troika of dubious female narrators, the book isn’t an obvious choice for the big screen, partly because of its rotating   voices. One problem is how to get into those separate heads, which the director Tate Taylor has tried to solve with   and by piling on   creating a proximity approaching the dermatological. Its loomingest head belongs to the   Emily Blunt, who plays Rachel, the story’s hub. She was once married to Tom (Justin Theroux, trying out his smile) who’s now married to Anna (Rebecca Ferguson) with whom he has a baby. A hard drinker, Rachel chugs booze like water and weeps like a broken faucet. She’s a sloshy mess, or so we’re meant to believe from her alternating lightly or heavily smeared eyeliner, which functions as a kind of mood  . She’s a masochist: She stares out of a   window at the house where she lived with Tom, and where he now lives with Anna and their child. Rachel is also a fantasist: She ogles another couple, dreaming about their lives. Put another way, Rachel is a   for us, the viewer, the voyeur who peers into other lives. Specifically, she’s a proxy for the consumer of a certain kind of glorious romantic fiction, in which beautiful women suffer magnificently. Hollywood used to excel at these kinds of stories, movies in which, say, Bette Davis or Ingrid Bergman suffered, endured and suffered some more before their teary,     triumph. Those types of movies aren’t all that common in American cinema these days, partly because women and their stories aren’t. The sobs and drama nonetheless did keep flowing, first in daytime soap operas and later in nighttime soaps. Rachel is a clever surrogate, especially because she doesn’t really appear that far gone. She may drink way too much, but, well, she looks like the lovely, spunky and very appealing Ms. Blunt, just with chapped lips, splotchy skin and raccoon eyes. Like almost every star in a mainstream vehicle who plays a problematic character, Ms. Blunt  —   her persona, filmography, likability, relatability  —   serves as a kind of assurance from the filmmakers to the viewers not to worry, that things will turn out all right. Her stardom is our light at the end of the dark tunnel, a flickering promise, which is one thing that hasn’t changed much since the days of   female martyrdom. You need a tough woman for that sort of job, and Ms. Blunt, who moves easily out of crinolines and into combat gear, holds this material together with fierce, unwavering conviction. Rachel’s fantasy duo turn out to be Megan (Haley Bennett) and Scott (Luke Evans) a married couple who tend to pose or rut whenever Rachel’s train conveniently passes by. Megan also likes to stand on her balcony, playing peekaboo with her robe and flashing her undies and tummy. Or at least that’s how Rachel sees Megan. That’s also how we see Megan, an outlook that’s meant to change as the points of view shift, diverge and unite. As always, much depends on who’s telling the story. Mr. Taylor doesn’t so much juggle the movie’s various parts  —   including a fragmented timeline, a device that here is nothing but empty mannerism  —   as lob them at the screen. (Erin Cressida Wilson wrote the script.) When Megan disappears, Rachel turns detective, if one mildly hindered by her drinking and narratively convenient habit of blacking out, which means that she doesn’t always know what’s happened in her own life. Rachel goes through a crucible of agony, braving abuse, infertility, betrayal and ravages of the body and the mind. But she looks. And she learns, including about other women. That’s the moral of this story, the appealing, gleaming jewel in the trash. “The Girl on the Train” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for extremely bad adult behavior. Running time:  1 hour 45 minutes.",0
7905,Border Patrol Arrests Sex Offender Deported in Feb,"U. S. Border Patrol agents assigned to the Nogales Station arrested a Mexican national who   the country after being deported just last month. [The agents from the Tucson Sector arrested    Rene   a previously deported criminal alien. A records check carried out by the agents revealed   has an extensive criminal history and prior deportations. His most recent deportation occurred just weeks ago.  His criminal history dates back to 1990 according to information obtained by Breitbart Texas from U. S. Customs and Border Protection officials. In one of the cases, a court convicted   for raping a child. The court sentenced him to only 26 months in prison. Upon the conclusion of his prison sentence, he received two years of probation. That conviction occurred in 1994. Court records obtained by Breitbart Texas show that agents arrested the Mexican citizen near Nogales, Arizona, on March 7. On February 9, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Enforcement Removal Operations agents deported   through the El Paso Port of Entry, court records stated.   now faces new criminal charges of illegal   after removal as a sex offender. This is a felony charge. Breitbart Texas extensively reported on previously deported sex offenders who are arrested by Border Patrol agents after illegally returning to the U. S after being deported. In February, Breitbart Texas reported that agents in the El Centro Sector, Southern California, arrested their fifth previously deported sex offender since the new fiscal year began in October. Following the arrests of two previously deported sex offenders in Southern California in early February, El Centro Sector Assistant Chief Patrol Agent David S. Kim said, “These two arrests highlight the importance of knowing who is coming into the United States. The two sex offenders our Border Patrol Agents arrested took advantage of and preyed on minors.

7906,Trump Voter Arrested When Officials See What His Shirt Says About Hillary,"Share This A Trump supporter was arrested after polling officials spotted what he was wearing at an early voting station in Bulverde, Texas. 
As the election draws near, liberals are attempting to stifle any votes for Hillary Clinton’s increasingly popular opponent, Donald Trump, hoping their felonious candidate can pull off a win. However, what a Trump supporter was recently arrested for wearing shows just how desperate leftists really are to stop the conservative vote. 
When Brett Mauthe woke up last Monday morning, he was eager to get his ballot in early and secure a vote for Trump while the Republican nominee’s approval rate continues to rise. The 55-year-old Texan got dressed, put on his favorite hat, and headed out the door. Unfortunately, he didn’t realize that it was his choice of clothing that would not only prohibit him from voting but also land him inside a jail cell. 
KSAT 12 reports that Bulverde polling officials confronted Mauthe when they spotted him wearing a pro-Trump hat and a t-shirt that read “Basket of Deplorables,” a sarcastic reference to Hillary’s crude remarks about conservative voters. Apparently unaware that he wasn’t allowed to sport campaign gear inside the polling station, Mauthe removed his hat but refused to turn his shirt inside out. It was then that the officials called the police and had him arrested. 
Mauthe was placed in cuffs and charged with electioneering and loitering as local police threw the book at the confused man. Like Mauthe, voters at the same polling place were shocked that wearing such clothing is not only prohibited at the polls but can result in a misdemeanor charge . Brett Mauthe, 55, was charged with electioneering and loitering for wearing a “Basket of Deplorables” t-shirt mocking Hillary Clinton’s crude reference to conservatives. 
“I don’t feel like you should be preaching to anybody, but I do feel like you should be able to wear a shirt if you want and if it has the candidate,” Georgina Pereida said after casting her vote Wednesday morning. “I’m kind of shocked because I think that’s part of the freedoms that we’re voting for. “ 
While Mauthe is wholly responsible for not following the rules, although he may not have understood the severity of his violation, we’re betting that career politicians are keen on the election rules. Proving that the liberal elites are above the rules, Hillary herself was caught breaking the same law as Mauthe but with a very different outcome. This year, Hillary was caught campaigning in front of a North Carolina polling station and Bill was busted thanking Hillary voters over a loudspeaker within 20 feet of a Massachusetts polling station. Unlike Mauthe, neither of the Clintons were arrested. 
Mad World News reported that Hillary was captured on video campaigning in front of Raleigh’s Chavis Center, a polling place in North Carolina. The female candidate walked straight up to early voters, greeting them and snapping selfies as if she was at one of her own rallies. Of course, the scheming doesn’t end there. 
In March of this year, Bill was busted thanking “those of you who are supporting Hillary Clinton” with a loudspeaker while within 20 feet of a Massachusetts polling station. His massive police detail also blocked civilians from entering the precinct to vote. The Daily Kos reports that even though electioneering, which is Mauthe’s crime, is only a misdemeanor, interfering with voting rights is a felony, which is exactly what Bill did. As expected, Mauthe was arrested and charged for his crimes, but Bill was fawned over and even abetted by police officers. 
Although Mauthe definitely broke the law when he refused to remove his shirt, his real crime is that he wasn’t a Hillary supporter. If he had been a liberal celebrity or the husband of a Democratic politician, he would’ve been allowed to block voters and openly campaign for his choice right there in the station. 
The bias is clear â not only are the electronic polling machines switching votes for the left, influential Democrats are potentially changing views right there in the polling stations. It’s undeniable that, regardless of the results, the American people don’t stand a chance at a fair election.",0
7907,Chip & Joanna Gaines Say They Rarely Fight Thanks to One Knock-Down-Drag-Out Fight When They First Married,"Share on Twitter 
It's no secret just how much time HGTV stars Chip and Joanna Gaines spend together. They have four children together and run an entire Magnolia empire together, so needless to say their time apart is few and far between. 
As Joanna writes on her blog “Magnolia Market,” they don't really want to be apart. Image Credit: Donna Ward/Getty Images 
In fact, she says that early on in their marriage they learned that they work better when they are together than when they are apart: 
“One pretty amazing thing we learned early on was that the more time we spent together, the better our relationship was. We seem to give each other energy. We function better together than we do apart, and I don't think either one of us has ever felt the urge to say, 'I need a break from you.'” 
And although the inspirational couple admits they have their little squabbles every now and then, they never find themselves in full-blown arguments... anymore, that is. A photo posted by Joanna Stevens Gaines (@joannagaines) on Aug 19, 2016 at 7:07pm PDT 
During an interview with YouTube's Jefferson Bethke , Chip described a fight they had as newlyweds that Joanna says ended all other fights: 
“I remember when we were first newly weds, we had just bought our first little flip property and we were working at this thing till like two o'clock every morning for weeks at a time. When it got to basically the end of this sleepless endeavor that we were on, Jo and I got into some argument about something completely irrelevant.” 
At this point in the story, Jo chimed in saying that the fight started because of something Chip said, but never explained exactly what her husband said some 12 years ago. A photo posted by Chip Gaines (@chippergaines) on Oct 19, 2016 at 3:09pm PDT 
That's when Chip continued by saying: 
""Jo slammed this gallon of primer down on the floor and the primer bounced back up and literally hit her on the face, as if she's been egged in the face, so this primer is just falling of off her eye lashes, falling off of her nose and mouth. 
In my family, you know we are just average middle class American folks, when we would get into these knock-down-drag-out fights and something hilarious happens, we would all be like, 'Timeout, you got primer on your face. That's hilarious.' You know, it's God's way of telling everybody to calm down, you're going to make it."" 
In Jo's family, however, having something like that happen during a fight changes the nature of the fight from simple argument to “ninja warfare.” 
""She started doing these roundabout high kicks toward my face and head. I remember, it was almost like a Matrix moment, where in slow motion, she is wheel-housing toward my face and for no reason I was doing these complete lateral bends that I didn't even know I was capable of. 
But in that same moment I was like, 'I love this woman, I think this is going to work.'"" 
As Joanna made sure to point out, that was the first and only fight of that intensity they have had as a married couple, and Chip agrees with Joanna that they got all of their fighting out in that one night. 
However, there was one other time that Chip says Joanna pulled a knife out on him, but Jo didn't want that story told. 
If they can get past all of Chip's bad jokes, then this adorable, creative couple can get through anything. ",0
7908,Isis Leader ‘hiding in Mosul’ as Troops Storm Iraqi City,"  Recipient Email => 
The Iraqi Army has entered Mosul for the first time in over two years at the start of a battle which is likely to end in a decisive defeat for Isis . The significance of the fight for Mosul will be all the greater for Isis because its self-declared caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi , is believed to be still inside the city, a senior Kurdish official has told The Independent . 
Fuad Hussein, chief of staff to Kurdish President Massoud Barzani, said in an exclusive interview that his government had information from multiple sources that “Baghdadi is there and, if he is killed, it will mean the collapse of the whole [Isis] system.” Isis would have to choose a new caliph in the middle of a battle, but no successor would have the authority and prestige of Baghdadi, the leader who surprised the world by establishing the caliphate after capturing Mosul in June 2014. 
Baghdadi has kept himself concealed for the last eight or nine months according to Mr Hussein, who added that the caliph had become very dependent on Isis commanders from Mosul and Tal Afar, a city just to the west of Mosul. Other senior and better known figures in Isis, particularly those from Syria and other countries, have been killed since their initial triumphs in the summer of 2014 when they took over much of northern Iraq and eastern Syria. 
The presence of Baghdadi in Mosul may complicate and prolong the battle for Mosul as his surviving adherents fight to the death to defend him. Mr Hussein said that “it is obvious that they will lose, but not how long this will take to happen.” He said that Kurdish Peshmerga forces had been impressed by the extraordinary number of tunnels that Isis had dug in order to provide hiding places in the villages around Mosul. 
Iraqi Special Forces advanced into Mosul, which once had a population of two million, on Tuesday seizing the state television on the east bank of the Tigris River that divides the city in half. Mr Hussein said that the speed of the fall of Mosul would depend on many factors especially whether or not Isis “is going to destroy the five bridges over the river.” 
Iraqi army units backed by US-led air strikes have been attacking across the Nineveh Plain to the east of Mosul, capturing empty towns and villages from which the inhabitants have almost entirely fled. Where Christians and other minorities have tried to return to their old homes in towns like Bartella and Qaraqosh, they have found them looted and often burned by retreating Isis fighters. 
Iraqi troops entered Gogjali, a district inside Mosul’s city limits, and later the borders of the more built-up Karama district, according to Major General Sami al-Aridi of the Iraqi special forces. Under an agreement reached before the offensive began on 17 October, Kurdish Peshmerga and Shia-militia paramilitaries known as the Hashd al-Shaabi, will not join the attack into Mosul, which is a largely Sunni Arab city. 
As night fell, a sandstorm blew up cutting visibility to only 100 yards making air support for Iraqi forces more difficult and bringing the fighting to an end. “Daesh (Isis) is fighting back and have set up concrete blast walls to block off the Karama neighbourhood and [stop] our troops’ advance,” General Aridi said. He added later that the troops had taken the nearby state television building, the only one in Nineveh province, but there had been heavy fighting when they tried to move further into built-up areas. They are still some six miles from the city centre. 
The anti-Isis offensive is dependent on US-led air strikes and the presence of US special forces. “I assure you that the Iraqi Army and the Peshmerga do not move one millimetre forward without American permission and coordination,” said one Kurdish observer. He did not think that the battle for Mosul would necessarily go on a long time. But it is increasingly difficult for the 3,000 to 5,000 Isis fighters in Mosul and the 1,500 to 2,500 on the outskirts to escape, even if they wanted to. The Iraqi Army and the Peshmerga encircle the city to the north, east and west and the Hashd are moving in from the west, cutting the last routes to Syria. 
US spokesman Colonel John Dorrian said that the US-led airpowers had noticed that Isis forces could no longer move in large numbers. “And when we see them come together where there are significant numbers we will strike them and kill them,” he said during a televised press conference. Some 1,792 Iraqis of whom 1,120 were civilians were killed in October according to the UN, though the total probably does not include Isis fighters. 
Eyewitnesses inside Mosul, where Isis is reported to have killed 40 Iraqi prisoners at the weekend and thrown their bodies into the Tigris, say there are few fighters to be seen in the streets. “There are mostly just teenagers with guns,” said one Mosul resident reached by telephone. Part of the city is shrouded in smoke because of air strikes and artillery fire, but also because Isis fighters are lighting fires to produce a smokescreen which will make observation from the air more difficult. 
It has been reported that Isis commanders were divided on whether or not it was better for them to make a last stand in Mosul or withdraw, after inflicting the maximum number of casualties on its enemies, and revert to guerrilla warfare. Last month 100 Isis fighters staged a spectacular raid on the Kurdish-held oil city of Kirkuk. An advantage for Isis in fighting in Mosul is that it would be more difficult for the US and its allies to carry out air strikes because there may be up to 1.5 million civilians still in the city. Isis has been preventing them leaving though the number is increasing as the anti-Isis forces move forward and it becomes clear that they intend to assault the city. 
Isis has never been popular in Mosul according to local residents who detest its extreme violence, religious bigotry and subjugation of women. But it found more support in Sunni Arab villages around the city and among the Sunni Turkman of the nearby city of Tal Afar, who have always been notorious for their religious extremism and hatred for Shia and Kurds. Some observers believe that Isis might want to fight here against the Shia paramilitaries of the Hashd, because the US-led air coalition has not been providing air cover for the Hashd on the grounds that they are sectarian and under Iranian influence. 
The fighting is so far on the eastern side of Mosul that traditionally had a Kurdish and Christian population while, if Isis has local support, it will be in the overwhelmingly Sunni Arab west of the city. Life here is said to be still relatively normal with markets open and people in the streets. In addition to the indigenous population of Mosul, there are believed to be several hundred thousand Sunni Arabs, many of them Isis supporters, who fled there from Iraqi provinces such as Anbar, Diyala and Salahudin where Isis has already been defeated.

7911,The Images in ‘Billy Lynn’? Razor Sharp. Your Eyes? Bewildered. - The New York Times,"Ang Lee’s new film, “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk,” contains sights perhaps never so vividly rendered in a movie. When bullet casings fly from a machine gun, each one is clearly visible rather than appearing in a blur. When Billy Lynn (Joe Alwyn) a soldier on leave from Iraq, tears up at the national anthem or experiences battle flashbacks during the smoke bombs of a Destiny’s Child performance, the emotions in his eyes register with uncommon clarity. On the other hand, when Steve Martin mugs as the owner of a pro football team, his face contains a level of detail normally preferred by dermatologists. These are the   of working at a high frame rate, the speed at which a film is shot and, in some cases, projected. The rate has a strong effect on an image’s sharpness. Mr. Lee shot “Billy Lynn” at 120 frames per second, far faster than 24, the standard for about 90 years. Few theaters are presenting it at that rate, so most viewers are out of luck  —   or perhaps better off, depending on your views on frame rates. For some directors, like Peter Jackson  —   who shot “The Hobbit” at 48 frames per second, to largely negative reaction  —   and James Cameron, higher frame rates are the future of movies, an opportunity to correct the motion blur that afflicts   action sequences shot at the standard rate. Introducing “Billy Lynn” at the New York Film Festival last month, Mr. Lee, who won a directing Oscar for his work with   digital cinema on “Life of Pi,” expressed trepidation about reaction to what he called “kind of an experimental movie” and asked the audience to keep an open mind. He had reason to worry. David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter offered a typical reaction. The film, he wrote in his review, had the “somewhat distancing   sharpness of many outsize     TVs. ” High frame rates aren’t new they’re used in video games and on television. And that’s the problem: Viewers, accustomed to the softer texture of movies, see the extreme sharpness of    cinema and feel intuitively that they’ve stumbled into a theatrical broadcast or a football game. “If you start increasing the frame rate of the movie, whether it’s 48 or 60 or 120, it can tend to start looking like a television show,” said Douglas Trumbull, a director and special effects expert who has been a pioneer in high frame rates. In the 1970s, he developed the Showscan process, which ran at 60 frames per second. Still, he said, there is no need for that association: “I can guarantee you that we can make a    movie that does not look like television. ” The 24    rate, at which most movies, even digitally projected ones, are shown, was always something of an accident. At the dawn of sound, when the rate was standardized, going more slowly would have muddied the audio and going faster would have exceeded the sensitivity of existing film stocks, said Dean Goodhill, one of the editors of “The Fugitive” and an inventor of MaxiVision48, a    process from the late 1990s that never got beyond a demonstration clip. There were other experiments with frame rates in the celluloid era. The   process of the 1950s ran at 30 frames per second. Cinerama used three simultaneous projectors and ran at 26 frames per second. In both cases, the higher rates were needed to accommodate outsize screens that made flicker and blur more visible. Tim J. Smith, an academic who studies visual cognition at Birkbeck, University of London, said there is no scientific reason 24 frames per second should be more appealing to viewers. “What we’re coming into the cinema with is the same audiovisual sensory system we have before we go into the cinema,” he said. In theory, he said, the move to a higher frame rate should “lead to more natural, more effortless processing by the viewer’s visual system. ” Acculturation may be the main reason moviegoers find the sharpness  . “It’s interesting that people are sensitive to it,” Mr. Smith said. “They’re seeing a crispness to the image, which is unfamiliar in the cinema context. Their main frame of reference seems to be TV or video, and kind of implied by that association is ‘cheapness’ or ‘documentary’ or ‘immediacy.’ Is it good to have that? It’s hard to know. ” But the film historian David Bordwell said that high frame rates have only   as a solution to a problem that is specific to digital cinema, particularly murky digital   which grows less murky when frames are added. He noted that at least on a   screen, there was never any of the dreaded stammer in the panning shots of Kenji Mizoguchi, Max Ophüls or Jean Renoir. “People who doubt it should see the films (on film, not video) to check,” he wrote by email. For Mr. Trumbull, who demonstrated   rates for Mr. Lee but did not take part in the production of “Billy Lynn,” the increased film speed of his Showscan process was a natural outgrowth of the move toward bigger screens and bigger spectacles in the 1950s and 1960s, but a faster rate was never taken up as the industry moved toward multiplexes and tiny auditoriums. He was effusive about Mr. Lee and his willingness to experiment  —   a “wonderful, brave and courageous effort,” he said. But after watching the movie at the New York Film Festival, he wasn’t pleased. “I was really upset when I was at the premiere of ‘Billy Lynn’ that it was in a very narrow,   theater,” he said. He felt that it was projected with too much illumination, that it needed dark time between frames. (We don’t perceive them as such, but movies are successions of still images  —   and on most projectors, each flash is interspersed with moments of darkness.) “Billy Lynn” has almost no darkness. In response, Ben Gervais, the film’s technical supervisor, said, “We found that there was no real advantage in terms of the way that the movie felt” with added dark time. Mr. Trumbull also said that it was crucial to present the film on a screen that filled a wider frame of vision, like Imax, to show the benefits of   rates and to keep cinematic texture. “We shouldn’t draw conclusions about high frame rates as a result of ‘Billy Lynn’ being incorrectly presented,” he said. “It would be really tragic. ” Mr. Trumbull has a competing   rate format, Magi, which is different from Showscan. But he said Magi has solved what he sees as the problems of “Billy Lynn. ” It may also be necessary, he added, for filmmakers to alter their approaches to suit the format. He recalled his own experience working on the visual effects of “2001: A Space Odyssey,” for which the camera motion was slowed so that the visuals would look smooth on a giant screen. “That’s what kind of led to the style of the movie,” he said. Like Mr. Trumbull, Mr. Goodhill said that it was possible to retain the cinematic texture while gaining the clarity of the higher frame rate. MaxiVision48  —   lavishly praised in 1999 by Roger Ebert, among others  —   looked “both new and traditional at the same time,” he recalled. But he emphasized that he doesn’t necessarily regard that texture as the right one. “That’s up for the individual artist to decide. ”",0
7912,Amnesty Warns Against Using White Phosphorus in Attack on Mosul,"Notes Evidence of Use Northeast of Mosul by   
With Iraqi forces continuing to near the city of Mosul in a protracted military offensive, there are more than a few concerns about potential war crimes against the massive civilian population in the ISIS-held city. Today, Amnesty International’s concern centers on white phosphorus . 
White phosphorus is legally used both for smoke screens and for illumination in war zones, its use is often heavily criticized for the risk of civilian casualties in the intense temperature the chemical burns at. Its use in areas where civilians are present is considered a war crime. 
This is particularly true around Mosul, a huge city in which some 1.5 million people are believed to still reside. Amnesty noted it has photographic evidence of the use of the chemical to the northeast of Mosul, and warned against any further use in areas where civilians are present or may be present in the near future. 
US forces have been documented using white phosphorus recently in Iraq, though they insist they’ve only done so in ways consistent with their interpretation of international law. The US, of course, insists everything they do in Iraq is legal, but in the case of such a densely populated area, this could be a big problem.  ",0
7913,Judge Blocks Trump Order on Refugees Amid Chaos and Outcry Worldwide - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   A federal judge in Brooklyn came to the aid of scores of refugees and others who were trapped at airports across the United States on Saturday after an executive order signed by President Trump, which sought to keep many foreigners from entering the country, led to chaotic scenes across the globe. The judge’s ruling blocked part of the president’s actions, preventing the government from deporting some arrivals who found themselves ensnared by the presidential order. But it stopped short of letting them into the country or issuing a broader ruling on the constitutionality of Mr. Trump’s actions. The   legal case played out on Saturday amid global turmoil, as the executive order signed by the president slammed shut the borders of the United States for an Iranian scientist headed to a lab in Massachusetts, a Syrian refugee family headed to a new life in Ohio and countless others across the world. The president’s order, enacted with the stroke of a pen at 4:42 p. m. Friday, suspended entry of all refugees to the United States for 120 days, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely, and blocked entry into the United States for 90 days for citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Department of Homeland Security said that the order also barred green card holders from those countries from   the United States. In a briefing for reporters, White House officials said that green card holders from the seven affected countries who are outside the United States would need a    waiver to return. Mr. Trump  —   in office just a week  —   found himself accused of constitutional and legal overreach by two Iraqi immigrants, defended by the American Civil Liberties Union. Meanwhile, large crowds of protesters turned out at airports around the country to denounce Mr. Trump’s ban on the entry of refugees and people from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Lawyers who sued the government to block the White House order said the judge’s decision could affect an estimated 100 to 200 people who were detained upon arrival at American airports. Judge Ann M. Donnelly of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama, ruled just before 9 p. m. that implementing Mr. Trump’s order by sending the travelers home could cause them “irreparable harm. ” She said the government was “enjoined and restrained from, in any manner and by any means, removing individuals” who had arrived in the United States with valid visas or refugee status. The ruling does not appear to force the administration to let in people otherwise blocked by Mr. Trump’s order who have not yet traveled to the United States. The judge’s   ruling came swiftly after lawyers for the A. C. L. U. testified in her courtroom that one of the people detained at an airport was being put on a plane to be deported back to Syria at that very moment. A government lawyer, Gisela A. Westwater, who spoke to the court by phone from Washington, said she simply did not know. Hundreds of people waited outside of the courthouse chanting, “Set them free!” as lawyers made their case. When the crowd learned that Judge Donnelly had ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, a rousing cheer went up in the crowd. Minutes after the judge’s ruling in New York City, another judge, Leonie M. Brinkema of Federal District Court in Virginia, issued a temporary restraining order for a week to block the removal of any green card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport. In a statement released early Sunday morning, the Department of Homeland Security said it would continue to enforce all of the president’s executive orders, even while complying with judicial decisions. “Prohibited travel will remain prohibited,” the department said in a statement, adding that the directive was “a first step towards   control over America’s borders and national security. ” Around the nation, security personnel at major international airports had new rules to follow, though the application of the order appeared chaotic and uneven. Humanitarian organizations delivered the bad news to overseas families that had overcome the bureaucratic hurdles previously in place and were set to travel. And refugees already on flights when the order was signed on Friday found themselves detained upon arrival. “We’ve gotten reports of people being detained all over the country,” said Becca Heller, the director of the International Refugee Assistance Project. “They’re literally pouring in by the minute. ” Earlier in the day, at the White House, Mr. Trump shrugged off the sense of anxiety and disarray, suggesting that there had been an orderly rollout. “It’s not a Muslim ban, but we were totally prepared,” he said. “It’s working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over. ” But to many, the government hardly seemed prepared for the upheaval that Mr. Trump’s actions put into motion. There were numerous reports of students attending American universities who were blocked from returning to the United States from visits abroad. One student said in a Twitter post that he would be unable to study at Yale. Another who attends the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was refused permission to board a plane. A Sudanese graduate student at Stanford University was blocked for hours from entering the country. Human rights groups reported that legal permanent residents of the United States who hold green cards were being stopped in foreign airports as they sought to return from funerals, vacations or study abroad. There was widespread condemnation of the order, from religious leaders, business executives, academics, political leaders and others. Mr. Trump’s supporters offered praise, calling it a necessary step on behalf of the nation’s security. Homeland Security officials said on Saturday night that 109 people who were already in transit to the United States when the order was signed were denied access 173 were stopped before boarding planes heading to America.   people who were stopped were eventually given waivers to enter the United States, officials said. Legal residents who have a green card and are currently in the United States should meet with a consular officer before leaving the country, a White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told reporters. Officials did not clarify the criteria that would qualify someone for a waiver, other than that it would be granted “in the national interest. ” But the   administration appeared to be implementing the order chaotically, with agencies and officials around the globe interpreting it in different ways. The Stanford student, Nisrin Omer, a legal permanent resident, said she was held at Kennedy International Airport in New York for about five hours but was eventually allowed to leave the airport. Others who were detained appeared to be still in custody or sent back to their home countries. White House aides claimed on Saturday that there had been consultations with State Department and homeland security officials about carrying out the order. “Everyone who needed to know was informed,” one aide said. But that assertion was denied by multiple officials with knowledge of the interactions, including two officials at the State Department. Leaders of Customs and Border Protection and of Citizenship and Immigration Services  —   the two agencies most directly affected by the order  —   were on a telephone briefing on the new policy even as Mr. Trump signed it on Friday, two officials said. The A. C. L. U.’s legal case began with two Iraqis detained at Kennedy Airport, the named plaintiffs in the case. One was en route to reunite with his wife and son in Texas. The other had served alongside Americans in Iraq for a decade. Shortly after noon on Saturday, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, an interpreter who worked for more than a decade on behalf of the United States government in Iraq, was released. After nearly 19 hours of detention, Mr. Darweesh began to cry as he spoke to reporters, putting his hands behind his back and miming handcuffs. “What I do for this country? They put the cuffs on,” Mr. Darweesh said. “You know how many soldiers I touch by this hand?” The other man the lawyers are representing, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, who was en route to Houston, was released Saturday night. Before the two men were released, one of the lawyers, Mark Doss, a supervising attorney at the International Refugee Assistance Project, asked an official, “Who is the person we need to talk to?” “Call Mr. Trump,” said the official, who declined to identify himself. While the judge’s ruling means that none of the detainees will be sent back immediately, lawyers for the plaintiffs in the case expressed concern that all those at the airports would now be put in detention, pending a resolution of the case. The White House said the restrictions would protect “the United States from foreign nationals entering from countries compromised by terrorism” and allow the administration time to put in place “a more rigorous vetting process. ” But critics condemned Mr. Trump over the collateral damage on people who had no sinister intentions in trying to come to the United States. Peaceful protests began forming Saturday afternoon at Kennedy Airport, where nine travelers had been detained upon arrival at Terminal 7 and two others at Terminal 4, an airport official said. Similar scenes were playing out at other airports across the nation. An official message to all American diplomatic posts around the world provided instructions about how to treat people from the countries affected: “Effective immediately, halt interviewing and cease issuance and printing” of visas to the United States. Internationally, confusion turned to panic as travelers found themselves unable to board flights bound for the United States. In Dubai and Istanbul, airport and immigration officials turned passengers away at boarding gates and, in at least one case, ejected a family from a flight it had boarded. Seyed Soheil Saeedi Saravi, a promising young Iranian scientist, had been scheduled to travel in the coming days to Boston, where he had been awarded a fellowship to study cardiovascular medicine at Harvard, according to Thomas Michel, the professor who was to supervise the research fellowship. But Professor Michel said the visas for the student and his wife had been indefinitely suspended. “This outstanding young scientist has enormous potential to make contributions that will improve our understanding of heart disease, and he has already been thoroughly vetted,” Professor Michel wrote to The New York Times. A Syrian family of six who have been living in a Turkish refugee camp since fleeing their home in 2014 had been scheduled to arrive on Tuesday in Cleveland. Instead, the family’s trip has been called off. “Everyone is just so heartbroken, so angry, so sad,” said Danielle Drake, the community manager for US Together, an agency that resettles refugees. A Christian family of six from Syria said in an email to Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania, that they were being detained on Saturday morning at Philadelphia International Airport despite having legal paperwork, green cards and visas that had been approved. In the case of the two Iraqis held at Kennedy Airport, the legal filings by his lawyers say that Mr. Darweesh was granted a special immigrant visa on Jan. 20, the same day Mr. Trump was sworn in as president. A husband and father of three, Mr. Darweesh arrived at Kennedy Airport with his family. Mr. Darweesh’s wife and children made it through passport control and customs, but agents of Customs and Border Protection detained him. In Istanbul, during a stopover on Saturday, passengers reported that security officers had entered a plane after everyone had boarded and ordered a young Iranian woman and her family to leave the aircraft. Iranian green card holders who live in the United States were blindsided by the decree while on vacation in Iran, finding themselves in a legal limbo and unsure whether they would be able to return to America. “How do I get back home now?” said Daria Zeynalia, a green card holder who was visiting family in Iran. He had rented a house and leased a car, and would be eligible for citizenship in November. “What about my job? If I can’t go back soon, I’ll lose everything. ”",0
7914,"Report: U.S., Russia Said Agree To Assist Israel In Expelling Iran From Syria","TEL AVIV  —   The U. S. Russia and Israel are said to have reached a consensus on the threat posed by   forces in Syria, the Kuwati daily newspaper   reported Saturday. [Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has arrived at an understanding with Washington and Moscow that   forces, including Lebanese terror group Hezbollah, constitute an “existential threat” to the Jewish state. The three countries agreed that   forces would need their movements in Syria restricted, eventually leading to their expulsion from the   country.  The report cited unnamed U. S. officials saying that Israel was conducting military strikes in Syria, including airstrikes on   weapons convoys, in order to curb the threat. At the same time, Russia is reported to be withdrawing its forces in areas of southern Syria, leaving the Assad regime to take over. Israel is hoping that pressure exerted by Washington and Moscow will help weaken   military entities to the point where they can be removed entirely from Syria. However, Tehran’s grip over Damascus means that this will be no easy task, a U. S. official told the paper. Israel has long harbored concerns over Iran’s presence in Syria, and the Jewish state has made it clear that it will not allow for proxies of the Islamic Republic to remain a permanent fixture in its northern neighbor. Netanyahu has vowed to continue strikes against Iran’s affiliates, like Hezbollah, who threaten Israel. Lebanese newspaper   reported over the weekend that the Assad regime in Syria sent messages to Israel via Russia threatening that any further strikes by the Israeli military within Syria’s borders will be met with Scud missiles capable of carrying half a ton of explosives being fired deep into the Jewish state. Syria added that strikes on its military would result in Scuds being launched at IDF bases, while strikes in civilian areas would be met with counterstrikes on the northern coastal city of Haifa and petrochemical plants in the region, the report claimed.",0
7915,"At the Box Office, ‘Doctor Strange’ Is Lucky 13 for Marvel Hit Machine - The New York Times","LOS ANGELES  —   Marvel Entertainment hates to be called a machine  —   the   studio thinks that term sells its filmmakers short  —   but a machine it truly is: With the arrival of “Doctor Strange” over the weekend, Marvel has delivered an uninterrupted string of 13 critical and commercial hits in only eight years. No film company, not even Pixar, can claim a track record like that. “Doctor Strange,” starring Benedict Cumberbatch as one of Marvel’s lesser comic book heroes, collected an estimated $85 million at theaters in the United States and Canada, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. The movie, which received  strong reviews, cost at least $275 million to make and market worldwide. Disney said that “Doctor Strange” took in an additional $240. 4 million overseas Imax results in China were especially robust. With ticket sales of about $45. 6 million, “Trolls” took second place at the domestic box office it was produced by DreamWorks Animation at a cost of $125 million and distributed by 20th Century Fox. Turnout for “Trolls,” based on a line of   Danish toys and featuring songs by Justin Timberlake, was on par with efforts like “The Croods” and “How to Train Your Dragon,” both of which spawned sequels. Third place went to Mel Gibson’s “Hacksaw Ridge” (Lionsgate) which arrived to about $14. 8 million in ticket sales, a solid total for a   movie from a director with a lot of personal baggage that relied heavily on   marketing. It was independently financed for about $40 million and played mostly to older moviegoers Lionsgate said that 68 percent of the weekend audience was over the age of 35. Perhaps most notably, Mr. Gibson  —   assisted by savvy Lionsgate and Rogers  Cowan publicists  —   has   himself as a player in Hollywood after a decade when his offscreen behavior made him a movie industry pariah. “Hacksaw Ridge” received mostly positive reviews and has been generating awards buzz.",0
7916,UAE welcomes UN peace plan to end crisis in Yemen,"Yemen UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash (Photo by Reuters) 
The United Arab Emirates, a key Saudi ally in its deadly aggression against Yemen, has welcomed a new United Nations peace proposal to end the Yemen conflict. 
""The UAE supports the efforts of UN [Special] Envoy [for Yemen] Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed knowing that the mission of a mediator is always tough,"" Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said on his Twitter account on Thursday. 
The remarks came two days after the UN envoy submitted the plan to Yemen’s Houthi Ansarullah movement and its allies. 
According to informed sources, the roadmap urges agreement on naming a new vice president after the withdrawal of Houthis from the capital Sana’a and other cities and their handover of arms to a third party. 
The initiative further calls on former Yemeni president, Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, to transfer power to the vice president who would appoint a new premier to form a government. United Nations Special Envoy for Yemen, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, speaks to reporters at Sana’a airport following his visit to the Yemeni capital on October 25, 2016. (Photo by Reuters) 
“The roadmap represents a political solution for the Yemeni crisis,” Gargash said, adding, “UN efforts represent a chance to bring Yemenis back to the political track. Other alternatives are gloomy.” 
The Hadi administration, however, said that it had not received any roadmap for a political settlement. 
Peace talks, which were held between Yemen’s opposing parties in Kuwait, ended in deadlock in August. 
Earlier this week, Ahmed made a visit to Sana’a, where he held meetings with Yemen’s warring sides and called for a return to a cessation of hostilities to allow aid deliveries. 
The Riyadh regime resumed its deadly airstrikes on Yemen on Sunday hours after a three-day truce in the conflict-ridden country expired. 
Yemen has seen almost daily military attacks by Saudi Arabia since late March 2015, with the UN putting the toll from the aggression at more than 10,000. 
The offensive was launched to crush the Houthi Ansarullah movement and its allies and reinstate the former Yemeni government. 
The Houthi Ansarullah fighters took state matters in their own hands after the resignation and escape of Hadi, which threw Yemen into a state of uncertainty and threatened a total security breakdown in the country, where an al-Qaeda affiliate is present. Loading ...",0
7917,The Deceptive Nature of Hillary Clinton is Right in Line with Communism,"Posted by David Risselada 
Much to the surprise of the American electorate, both on the right and left, the FBI is reopening it’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email scandal . Whether this will amount to anything meaningful, or it is simply a distraction is any body’s guess. Many are speculating that this could be the issue which would cause President Obama to cancel the elections . In my recent article “Corrupting One’s Self is the Ultimate Morality in the Pursuit of Utopia,” I discussed the possibility that the blatant corruption is deliberately being thrust in our face to create the necessary attitude for social change. This idea of course, is based on the writings of Alinsky and other “social engineers” skilled in the arts of propaganda and psychological manipulation. Looking at it from this perspective, cancelled elections are a possibility. The truth is, with Hillary Clinton you never know what to expect because she is operating from an “ends justify the means mentality,” and she is willing to do anything to see her dreams of a collectivized America move forward. 
According to Elizabeth Harrington from the Washington Free Beacon, the Clinton campaign began conducting focus groups to determine which approach Hillary should take concerning her run for the presidency. Hillary is diehard ideologue whose beliefs are right in line with Communists dictators like Stalin and Mao. She believes that ordinary people have no idea how to best conduct their personal business and the state should be involved in every aspect of our lives. The goal of these focus groups was to determine the attitudes of the electorate in order to mold her message and her personality into something they would vote for. Many people would attempt to ridicule and discredit anyone associating Hillary Clinton with communists because she comes across as compassionate and caring, always blaming everything on a vast, right wing conspiracy. 
This has always been the modus operandi of the communist movement and it explains why so many young people have no idea about the atrocities committed under the regimes of communist rulers. Today’s millennials are well aware of the holocaust and the millions of Jews murdered by Adolph Hitler. They may not however, know that Hitler murdered more than Jews. He started by eliminating the sick and disabled, then he murdered Christians, homosexuals and anyone else essentially, that didn’t go along with his national socialism. The belief is that fascism is an extreme right wing world view. This explains the hostility towards today’s conservative movement. They have been branded as fascists, when in fact, the truth is the exact opposite. On the true political scale, national socialism or fascism is to the right of communism, which represents complete state control, but it is still way left of center. A true, extreme right wing world view would be complete absence of government control over anything. With this being said, and understanding that the horrors of communism have all been forgotten simply because they are no longer being taught, the communists have been very successful in deceiving people because like Hillary Clinton, they pretend to be something they are not. 
Millions of young people in America, due to left wing indoctrination in our universities , are falling for the communist propaganda under the guise that communism is a more fair, compassionate system of economics. Left wing professors, refusing to acknowledge the failures of communism because they believe the right leader has not come along to implement it the right way, have failed to teach these young minds that the pursuit of total equality has led to the death of 100,000,000 people under communist controlled governments. Communists, believing not in God but in evolution and science, believe that man can be trained into submission and a refusal to accept communist ideals is in fact, a sign of mental deficiency. Therefore, it is justifiable to eliminate them. To understand this read “Brainwashing: A Synthesis of the Russian Textbook on Psychopolitics.” Communists also hide this belief by claiming their pursuit of equality is motivated by a pursuit of social and economic justice when in fact, it is motivated by a pure desire to control every aspect of human being. 
The Black Book of Communism references the historical debate over the evil natures of both Communism and Nazism. Adolf Hitler, despite his cruelty was open about what his intentions were. He set out to create a perfect race that understood its role was to serve the state and nothing else. This isn’t any different than the goals of communism truthfully, only insofar as communists seek to accomplish this on a global scale, (using the economic class issue as opposed to race) while national socialism focuses on achieving such a goal for the country itself. The communists on the other hand, as mentioned above, pretended to be compassionate about the poor and oppressed when in reality- they use these groups to organize for power while hiding behind the guise of compassion and the struggle to achieve social justice, while in reality-they are systematically imprisoning and murdering all that don’t go along with their agenda. This, according to the Black Book of Communism, makes the communist ideology, if you could really assign degrees of evil, more evil than Nazism because of its deceptive nature. 
We all know Hillary Clinton is a liar, and she wrote her college thesis on Saul Alinsky but do we know anything else about her? Given the fact that she conducted focus groups to help mold her campaign message it is obvious she is hiding something. Over the past several weeks we have seen references to leaked emails which show she has an obvious disdain for the average American and the common beliefs in liberty that most of us share. She has referred to many of us as “irredeemable deplorables” in an effort to brand us as the uncompassionate ones while pretending to care about the poor and so called oppressed. In fact, this is the whole strategy of the Democrat party because as we all know, they have taken a hard turn left and do not represent the views of most Americans. They will however, pretend to in order to get in office. What are her intentions if she were to assume office? Are the massive dehumanization campaigns where conservatives are labeled as fascists and whites as automatic racists a first step to a repeat of history where millions were slaughtered because they were deemed as undesirable by their own government? Looking at the deceptive nature of Hillary Clinton and the violent nature of the left, it sure seems like a distinct possibility. 
The number of deaths under communist regimes from the Black Book of Communism Soviet Union- Vladimr Lenin and Joseph Stalin-20 million deaths China-Mao- 65 million deaths Vietnam- Ho Chi Mihn- 1 million deaths North Korea- 2 million deaths Cambodia- Pol Pot- 2 million deaths Eastern Europe- 1 million deaths Latin America- 150,000 deaths Africa- 1.7 million deaths Afghanistan (under soviet control) 1.5 million deaths 
These are not deaths represented by wartime or revolutions, but by outright murder committed by evil men intent on creating perfect societies based on social justice and equality. I guess the question remains. Is man capable of bringing about a perfect society?

7919,WrestleMania Stories Collide in the Ring - The New York Times,"John Cena popped the question to Nikki Bella on one knee. The Undertaker put one foot in the grave. And if you don’t know the significance of these two events, you are not one of the millions of fans who watched Sunday night as the 33rd annual WrestleMania event unfolded. About 75, 000 attended the live show in Orlando’s Camping World Stadium. The “Showcase of the Immortals”  —   as World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. likes to market the card  —   fulfilled its usual role of celebrating and capstoning a year of storytelling for the insular and bombastic world of wrestling entertainment. And make no mistake, that world is a big one: The WWE is a $1. 65 billion dollar company that has 750 million social media followers across multiple platforms and reports at least 3 million weekly television viewers. The major news of the evening for those who keep track of wrestling story lines had little to do with the main events in the ring. All five championship belts changed hands. But a proposal and a retirement were the most significant developments. Mr. Cena, a longtime WWE performer (and burgeoning movie star) proposed to his girlfriend and fellow wrestler, Stephanie Nicole   better known to fans as Nikki Bella. The proposal and presentation of a giant engagement ring came in the middle of the ring, but only after the couple successfully performed in a mixed   bout with matching finishing moves. She said yes. The Twitter account she shares with her sister, Brie, spread the news. The biggest news was saved for the finale when another longtime WWE performer, the Undertaker, made a dramatic, prolonged exit from the stadium to close the broadcast. Modern professional wrestling traces its lineage back through cable wars, territory fights, Vaudeville and carnival “strong man” contests. Throughout, performers who break the fourth wall talk of retirees “going out on their back” to make sure that favorable fan impressions of heroism are passed on to the next generation. And so it was last night when the anointed next big star, Roman Reigns, pinned the fabled Undertaker clean in the middle of the ring. Retirement for the performer, known in civilian life as Mark William Calaway, was never explicitly stated by the announcers on the broadcast or posted to the throbbing oversized screens in the stadium. But in a modern nod to the old tradition, chants of “Thank you, Taker” filled the arena, and corresponding hashtags flooded social media after the Undertaker left his fighting gloves, hat, and duster jacket in the middle of the ring. That these were the two most noteworthy events of wrestling’s most highly publicized night is curious. Both Mr. Cena and the Undertaker have been   performers for the WWE at this point, showing up every couple of weeks or monthly. Other performers work weekly on televised programming and at regional “house” shows. Over the last decade, the WWE has developed a formula of using high profile   performers like this for major events. For instance, the MMA competitor Brock Lesnar will drop in for a several monthslong engagements and just as quickly disappear from known story lines. This year three of the most established   performers were notably absent: Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, “Stone Cold” Steve Austin and Hulk Hogan. These absences opened up prominent places in the spotlights for emerging performers at WrestleMania like A. J Styles and Kevin Owens. It was not clear if this was part of a planned changing of the guard or other palace intrigue engineered by Vince McMahon, the founder and owner of the wrestling empire. Fans will have to search for the truth amid the innuendo found in trade publications, or the lore of “kayfabe,” the pro wrestling community’s phrase for the staged story lines that may or may not speak to underlying   rivalries. On Sunday night, the mass entertainment value was on full display. Mr. McMahon is known to enjoy connecting his wrestling product to mass culture by drawing celebrities to the event. Muhammed Ali, Liberace and Cyndi Lauper appeared at the first WrestleMania. So many other   names have appeared since to fill a pretty robust Wikipedia page dedicated to chronicling special appearances  —   including one in 2007 by Donald J. Trump. This year’s iteration was no exception. Rob Gronkowski, the star tight end of the New England Patriots, jumped in from the crowd to get involved in a Battle Royal match. The pop stars Pitbull and Flo Rida performed. Al Roker took a turn as ring announcer for a match. For the fans, this was their Super Bowl, their Oscars. And now it is done for another year until the next annual WrestleMania event in New Orleans, when the only seeming certainty is that for the first time in 25 years, no gong over the loudspeaker will announce the entrance of The Undertaker. Of course, this being professional wrestling, never say never.",0

[10/27/16] Metro Detroit Airport now has a new way to allow people to move seamlessly through airport security . 
It’s called CLEAR and it’s now in operation at the airport’s McNamara Terminal. Certified as a “qualified anti-terrorism technology” by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, CLEAR has been used more than five million times to move travelers quickly through airport security lines at 16 other airports. 
“They validate their identity using a knowledge-based quiz, they use a government identification that’s validated using technology, and then we link it to their bio-metrics — we take 10 fingerprints with a digital reader, we take a scan of their iris, and we take a high-res photo of their face,” said CLEAR spokesperson David Cohen. 
Cohen said the initial sign-up process takes about five minutes and after that, getting through security lines should be a breeze. He said there are special lines for CLEAR customers that can be a great time-saver for travelers, who will still have to pass through X-Rays and body scans. Post navigation",0
7921,Pence: World Will Know America Stands with Israel,"CBS News reports: LAS VEGAS  —   Vice President Mike Pence assured the Republican Jewish Coalition that he and President Donald Trump will work tirelessly on foreign and domestic issues important to the group, such as enacting   policies at home and supporting Israel abroad.

7922,Bernie Sanders’s New Political Group Is Met by Staff Revolt - The New York Times,"Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, his presidential campaign behind him, looked to advance the movement he built during the Democratic primary race, with the public unveiling on Wednesday of a political organization focused on addressing economic inequality and taking on special interests. But while the establishment of the new group, Our Revolution, had been eagerly awaited by many of his most ardent supporters, it has been met with criticism and controversy over its financing and management. A principal concern among backers of Mr. Sanders, whose condemnation of the campaign finance system was a pillar of his presidential bid, is that the group can draw from the pool of “dark money” that Mr. Sanders condemned for lacking transparency. The announcement of the group, which was live streamed on Wednesday night, also came as a majority of its staff resigned after the appointment last Monday of Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders’s former campaign manager, to lead the organization. Several people familiar with the organization said eight core staff members had stepped down. The group’s entire organizing department quit this week, along with people working in digital and data positions. After the resignations, Mr. Sanders spoke to some who had quit and asked them to reconsider, but the staff members refused. At the heart of the issue, according to several people who left, was deep distrust of and frustration with Mr. Weaver, whom they accused of wasting money on television advertising during Mr. Sanders’s campaign mismanaging campaign funds by failing to hire staff members or effectively target voters and creating a hostile work environment by threatening to criticize staff members if they quit. Claire Sandberg, who was the organizing director at Our Revolution and had worked on Mr. Sanders’s campaign, said she and others were also concerned about the group’s tax status  —   as a 501( c)(4) organization it can collect large donations from anonymous sources  —   and that a focus by Mr. Weaver on television advertising meant that it would fail to reach many of the young voters who powered Mr. Sanders’s campaign and are best reached online. “I left and others left because we were alarmed that Jeff would mismanage this organization as he mismanaged the campaign,” she said, expressing concern that Mr. Weaver would “betray its core purpose by accepting money from billionaires and not remaining    and plowing that billionaire cash into TV instead of investing it in building a genuine movement. ” Kenneth Pennington, who was the digital director of Our Revolution, declined to go into detail about his reasons for leaving but confirmed that he was no longer with the organization. The staff members who quit also said that they feared that the 501( c)(4) designation meant that the group would not be able to work directly with Mr. Sanders or the people that he had encouraged to run for office because such organizations are not allowed to coordinate directly with candidates. Mr. Weaver did not respond to requests for comment. In an email sent to Sanders supporters on Tuesday night encouraging them to participate, Mr. Weaver said that the new group would work together to “empower a wave of progressive candidates this November and win the major upcoming fights for the values we share. ” Mr. Sanders has been using his vast list of supporters to raise money for local lawmakers like Chris Pearson, a state representative in Vermont. He is also supporting Tim Canova, a liberal Democrat who is trying to unseat Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, whom Mr. Sanders accused of favoring Hillary Clinton’s campaign during the primary race. In his   announcement, Mr. Sanders sounded nostalgic about his presidential campaign as he repeatedly said his candidacy had changed the Democratic Party and pulled Hillary Clinton toward his progressive ideas. “We changed the conversation regarding the possibilities of our country. That is what we changed,” he said. “We redefined what the vision and the future of our country should be, and that is no small thing. ” Mr. Sanders also said Our Revolution would focus on seven specific initiatives across the country, including a California proposition aimed at lowering the cost of prescription drugs and a Colorado initiative aimed at creating a   health care system. But Mr. Sanders also made it clear that he did not plan to run the organization himself, saying, “As a United States senator, I will not be directing or controlling Our Revolution. ” Mr. Sanders praised Mr. Weaver as someone who had worked with him for 30 years and who has “very, very good qualifications. ” Mr. Sanders added that Shannon Jackson, his former assistant, would be the executive director of Our Revolution. “I expect big things from them and all of you who join with them to carry the political revolution forward,” Mr. Sanders said. The creation of the group comes as Mr. Sanders faces lingering disappointment from some of his supporters for his endorsement of Mrs. Clinton and questions about his finances that have arisen since he left the race. During the primary race, Mr. Sanders repeatedly delayed releasing his financial disclosure information, and ultimately never did. This month, he spent nearly $600, 000 on a vacation home in Vermont near Lake Champlain. Paul S. Ryan, a campaign finance expert at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit political finance group, said that it was unusual for a federal lawmaker to set up such a   organization and that Mr. Sanders should have had to follow Federal Election Commission donation limits and disclosure requirements. “There are definitely some red flags with respect to the formation of this group,” Mr. Ryan said. “We’re in a murky area. ”",0
7923,"Tesla, ‘World’s Safest Car,’ Explodes Like a Bomb","Tesla, ‘World’s Safest Car,’ Explodes Like a Bomb By DailyBellStaff - November 05, 2016 

Fiery Tesla Crash Sends Flaming Batteries Shooting Like Projectiles, Killing Two In World’s Safest Car … When a Tesla Model S collided with a tree in downtown Indianapolis Thursday, an inferno erupted. The crash, which killed the driver and her one passenger, sent battery cells “firing off almost like projectiles around rescuers,” fire department officials told local NBC affiliate WTHR. “It hit that tree and it bounced around and all of a sudden it just exploded,” Al Finnell, an eyewitness, told the station. -IBD 
The world’s safest car just blew up like a bomb but that message seems to be getting lost amidst the larger coverage about Tesla. 
For years and years, Tesla has never made a nickel despite spending hundreds of millions of dollars. But the company is beloved by the predictable monetary elites that seek more and more control over the rest of us. 
Founder Elon Musk offers that potential control. Every day, he works as hard as he can to ensure that sooner or later government will take away your ability to drive where you want when you want. 
Here at DB, we’ve written several articles about Tesla ( here and here , most recently). We don’t like the car and much more than that, we don’t like the implications behind it. 
Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, is fairly clear about his goals. He wants to create an electric, self-driving car. And he has Tesla fans throughout the US and the world. 
Extend the logic and you come the inevitable conclusion that larger entities will have to support Tesla’s vision. These entities will surely be linked to some sort of government control. 
Don’t pay your ticket? Have a confrontation of some sort outside of the home? Or simply fall afoul of one of a plethora of rules and regulations that increasingly hem-in behavior … and you will pay the consequences in terms of your driving life. 
You will get up in the morning and your car won’t start because someone has flagged your behavior. If you do manage to get your car started, it won’t go anywhere because its driving mechanisms have been disabled. 
You’ll have to go to court. You’ll have to pay a fine. Then you’ll be able to drive again. Or maybe not. Think driving is a “privilege”? Just wait. 
We could extend this logic beyond government. It’s perfectly possible that large private entities could have relationships with government that generate similar consequences. 
Why Musk has managed to attract fans for his cars given the inevitable results of his technology is a mystery to us. His ability to continue to fund his endless automotive depredations are a mystery as well. 
It is most probable that his access to funds has a lot to do with the maturation of his technology and the increasing governmental control it offers. 
We live in a time when technology is being celebrated as an enabler of freedom but it the kinds of technology that Musk is perfecting has little to do with freedom. No doubt it could, but not in the current climate. 
There are other issues as well. Musk is running a vast corporation with other people’s money. But if you look elsewhere you will see other titanic entities are throwing their resources behind the development of technology, especially robots. 
It would be one thing if these technological innovations were being developed by entrepreneurs. But one of the biggest developer of robot technology – deadly technology at that – is the Pentagon. 
Since we’ve already seen movies about deadly robots, we’re not shocked by the idea of what the Pentagon is doing. But that doesn’t make it much better. 
How many people wake up in the morning and decide they’re going to build a robot that will kill people automatically? 
But that’s what is going on. This technology is being developed by huge corporations with virtually unlimited funds. These corporations wouldn’t exist without monopoly central banking and a variety of rules and regulations to support them and ensure they have little or no competition. 
The world today is technocratic and fascist. It is run by gigantic corporations that would not exist without laws and judicial decisions that guarantee their viability no matter how incompetently they operate. 
These corporations work hand-in-glove with governments around the world. Both the corporations and governments are run secretly by the same banking cabal that runs central banking via the Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland. 
In other words, the technological progress that we are supposed to celebrate is actually being organized for nefarious purposes. It wouldn’t exist in the form it does without vast entities that have turned their energies toward perfecting technology that is intended to create additional control, not freedom. 
A normal entrepreneurial society in which individuals and groups applied technology with an eye toward marketplace acceptance might end up with completely different kinds of technology. 
Many people might reject self-driving cars and killer robots – at least without proper safeguards. 
But we don’t have normal societies in the world, for the most part. Instead we have people like Elon Musk who builds “the world’s safest car,” albeit one that explodes like a bomb at high impact. 
More:

7925,"Court Backs Rules Treating Internet as Utility, Not Luxury - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —     internet service can be defined as a utility, a federal court has ruled in a sweeping decision clearing the way for more rigorous policing of broadband providers and greater protections for web users. The decision affirmed the government’s view that broadband is as essential as the phone and power and should be available to all Americans, rather than a luxury that does not need close government supervision. The    decision from a   panel at the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Tuesday came in a case about rules applying to a doctrine known as net neutrality, which prohibit broadband companies from blocking or slowing the delivery of internet content to consumers. Those rules, created by the Federal Communications Commission in early 2015, started a huge legal battle as cable, telecom and wireless internet providers sued to overturn regulations that they said went far beyond the F. C. C. ’s authority and would hurt their businesses. On the other side, millions of consumers and giant tech firms rallied in favor of the regulations. President Obama also called for the strictest possible mandates on broadband providers. The court’s decision upheld the F. C. C. on the declaration of broadband as a utility, which was the most significant aspect of the rules. That has   implications for web and telecommunications companies that have battled for nearly a decade over the need for regulation to ensure web users get full and equal access to all content online. “After a decade of debate and legal battles, today’s ruling affirms the commission’s ability to enforce the strongest possible internet protections  —   both on fixed and mobile networks  —   that will ensure the internet remains open, now and in the future,” Tom Wheeler, chairman of the F. C. C. said in a statement. The two judges who ruled in favor of the F. C. C. emphasized the importance of the internet as an essential communications and information platform for consumers. “Over the past two decades, this content has transformed nearly every aspect of our lives, from profound actions like choosing a leader, building a career, and falling in love to more quotidian ones like hailing a cab and watching a movie,” wrote David Tatel and Sri Srinivasan, the judges who wrote the opinion. But the legal battle over the regulations is most likely far from over. The cable and telecom industries have signaled their intent to challenge any unfavorable decision, possibly taking the case to the Supreme Court. ATT immediately said it would continue to fight. “We have always expected this issue to be decided by the Supreme Court and we look forward to participating in that appeal,” said David McAtee II, the senior executive vice president and general counsel for ATT. For now, the decision limits the ability of broadband providers like Comcast and Verizon to shape the experience of internet users. Without net neutrality rules, the broadband providers could be inclined to deliver certain content on the web at slower speeds, for example, making the streams on Netflix or YouTube buffer or shut down. Such business decisions by broadband providers would have created fast and slow lanes on the internet, subjecting businesses and consumers to extra charges and limited access to content online, the F. C. C. has argued. “This is an enormous win for consumers,” said Gene Kimmelman, president of the public interest group Public Knowledge. “It ensures the right to an open internet with no gatekeepers. ” The   ruling also opens a path for new limits on broadband providers beyond net neutrality. Already, the F. C. C. has proposed privacy rules for broadband providers, curbing the ability of companies like Verizon and ATT to collect and share data about broadband subscribers. Google and Netflix support net neutrality rules and have warned government officials that without regulatory limits, broadband providers will have an incentive to create business models that could harm consumers. They argue that broadband providers could degrade the quality of downloads and streams of online services to extract tolls from web companies or to promote unfairly their own competing services or the content of partners. The court’s ruling was a certainty for the F. C. C. Two of the three judges who heard the case late last year agreed that wireless broadband services were also common carrier utility services that were subject to   and discrimination rules, a decision protested by wireless carriers including ATT and Verizon Wireless. In the opinion, the two judges in favor of the rules said internet users don’t feel the difference between   broadband and mobile service. To an iPad user, whose device switches automatically between   and wireless networks, the government’s oversight of those technologies should not differ, they said. Tech firms cheered the decision, which they said would be particularly helpful to   that did not have the resources to fight gatekeepers of the web. “Today marks a huge victory for the millions of microbusinesses who depend on the open internet to reach consumers and compete in the global marketplace,” said Althea Erickson, the senior director of global policy at the online crafts marketplace Etsy. In a statement, the cable industry’s biggest lobbying group highlighted the comments of the dissenting judge, Stephen Williams, and said that its members were reviewing the opinion. The group also said broadband legislation by Congress was a better alternative to the F. C. C. ’s classification of internet business as a utility. “While this is unlikely the last step in this   debate over internet regulation, we urge bipartisan leaders in Congress to renew their efforts to craft meaningful legislation that can end ongoing uncertainty, promote network investment and protect consumers,” the National Cable and Telecommunications Association said in a statement. In his lengthy dissenting opinion, Mr. Williams called the rules an “unreasoned patchwork” that will discourage competition in the broadband industry. The biggest threat to broadband providers is the potential of any regulations to hurt the rates they charge for the service, analysts said. The F. C. C. has promised it will not impose rate regulations on the firms like it does for phone companies. “The pendulum has today swung a bit further in the direction of   price regulation,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst at the research firm MoffettNathanson. The F. C. C. was divided along party lines on the rules. It began its quest for net neutrality rules in 2009, with two previous attempts at creating rules overturned by the same court. In a statement, Ajit Pai, a Republican commissioner who was among a minority who opposed the regulation of broadband as a utility, urged cable and telecom firms to keep going with their legal challenge. “I continue to believe that these regulations are unlawful, and I hope that the parties challenging them will continue the legal fight,” he said.",0
7926,THE BIG UPSET: Democrats Go Into Shock As Donald Trump Pulls Even With Crooked Hillary In Michigan,"  THE BIG UPSET: Democrats Go Into Shock As Donald Trump Pulls Even With Crooked Hillary In Michigan Trump and Clinton both received 44 percent support from respondents in a poll conducted Nov. 3 in Michigan. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson received 4 percent support, while Green party nominee Jill Stein received 3 percent. One percent of the respondents said that they were supporting someone else, and five percent said they were still undecided.   Republican nominee Donald Trump is tied with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in Michigan, according to a Strategic National Poll. 
The Michigan statewide poll revealed Trump is now dead even with Clinton , in a state that has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988. 
Trump and Clinton both received 44 percent support from respondents in a poll conducted Nov. 3, which was obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson received 4 percent support, while Green party nominee Jill Stein received 3 percent. One percent of the respondents said that they were supporting someone else, and five percent said they were still undecided. 
The survey , conducted by Strategic National , a Republican leaning consulting firm based in Michigan, contacted 573 likely voters in the State of Michigan on Nov. 3. The survey reported that 39 percent of the respondents were affiliated with the Democratic Party, 34 percent affiliated with the GOP, 21 percent affiliated with an independent or third party, and 5 percent said they were “unsure” of their party affiliation. Donald Trump MASSIVE Rally in Warren, Michigan: 
Clinton is scheduled to make an appearance in Detroit Friday afternoon. Clinton will attempt to inject enthusiasm into reliable Democratic Party voters that came out for President Barack Obama in full force both in 2008 and 2012. Trump appeared at two rallies in the state Monday, and his children, Donald Jr. and Ivanka stumped around the state this week. 
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz appeared at a campaign rally with vice presidential candidate Mike Pence Thursday in Portage, Mich. on the state’s west side — an area where Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich performed well in the GOP primary. 
Both candidates have made “ six-figure ” advertising purchases in the state in the last days before the election. Clinton’s campaign dumped $2.5 million in Michigan in two days alone, according to tabloid news outlet TMZ . Laura Ingraham on Why Trump Can Pull Off an Election Upset Over Clinton on Tuesday: 
Clinton enjoyed as much as a 13-point advantage over Trump in Michigan just two weeks ago. The Democratic nominee has not made Michigan a regular campaign stop while Trump has focused on the state and other rust belt states as a potential path to victory. 
While Michigan hasn’t voted for a Republican candidate for president since President George H. W. Bush in 1988, the state is home to vast swaths of conservative-leaning precincts and a well-established state party apparatus. Michigan’s governor and both legislative chambers are controlled by Republicans and the state’s congressional delegation is made up of nine Republicans and five Democrats. 
Democrats have been able to win presidential elections by “running up the score” in its urban areas and population bases, something Clinton hoped would keep the state safely in her corner without diverting resources and time from other battleground states. 
“Trump is over performing in key segments of the electorate especially in rural areas and Macomb County while Clinton is failing to get the numbers she needs out of the city of Detroit,” John Yob, CEO of Strategic National, who conducted the poll, reported. 
Out of the poll’s respondents , 75 percent were contacted by landline, while 25 percent were contacted over cellular phone. The poll was conducted through landlines, using Interactive Voice Response and the margin of error for the poll is 4.09 percent. source

7927,UN’s Yemen Peace Plan Would Sideline Former President Hadi,"Hadi Would Be Figurehead to Placate Saudis by Jason Ditz, October 27, 2016 Share This 
Heavily backed by Saudi Arabia, former Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi’s ambition to return as the ruler of Yemen appears to be waning, with a new UN peace plan proposal making the rounds that would sideline him more or less entirely. 
Hadi’s position has been contentious from the start. “Elected” in 2012 in a UN-mandated vote in which no opposition was allowed, Hadi was supposed to serve two years in office leading to a new constitution and free elections. The constitution never happened, and Hadi extended his reign unilaterally in 2014. He resigned in January 2015 when his anti-Houthi military offensive turned sour and he lost the capital. 
The Saudis, primarily opposed to the Houthis because they’re Shi’ites, insists to this day that Hadi remains the rightful ruler, and in March 2015 attacked Yemen, vowing to reinstall him. While the Houthis have expressed openness to a unity government that ends the conflict, they’ve also opposed it involving Hadi or his vice president Ali Mushin Ahmar, who they say were too corrupt to work with in a transitional government. 
The UN plan seems largely to agree, as it would require Ahmar to resign outright, and would allow Hadi to remain only as a figurehead with no real power, instead seeking to stack the government with people both sides are likely to accept. 
The decision to leave Hadi in at all appears to be designed to placate the Saudis, who vowed to reinstall him through their war, and would be able to claim that they succeeded under this deal, even if it ultimately means Hadi doesn’t get any power. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",0
7928,Rep. Adam Schiff’s Congressional Career Aided by Soros-Financed Groups - Breitbart,"Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, was previously financially aided by the George   MoveOn. org to win his Congressional seat. [Schiff was also awarded the Toll Fellowship, which is sponsored by the Council of State Governments, a nonprofit that monitors federal government activities and is heavily financed by Soros’s Open Society Foundations.  The Open Society and   groups have additionally supported a number of Schiff’s legislative efforts. Schiff has been helping to lead the Democrats’ unsubstantiated charges of alleged collusion between President Donald Trump and Moscow. Last month, Schiff delivered the opening statements at a Congressional hearing where he laid out the case for alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.  This reporter previously documented serious problems with Schiff’s charges, which include wild conspiracy theories and heavy reliance on a questionable source. In largely forgotten history, Schiff’s 2000 Congressional campaign against Republican incumbent Jim Rogan was openly aided by MoveOn. org. On January 1, 2000, the Wall Street Journal reported on the radical group’s fundraising efforts for Schiff.  The Congressional seat was particularly important since Rogan had gained fame after he was selected to be one of thirteen House Managers in the 1998 impeachment case of Bill Clinton. Rogan was supportive of Clinton’s impeachment and became a hero in the Republican Party. The Journal reported: If MoveOn were to achieve its ambitious goals, it just might have a big impact on this year’s struggle to control Congress, especially the House. Republicans hold only a slim   majority there, and the outcome will “likely be determined in no more than three dozen congressional districts,” says Thomas Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. And of course, most congressional impeachment proponents were Republicans. One of the most prominent among them, House impeachment manager James Rogan of California, faces a challenge this year from Democratic State Senator Adam Schiff, for whom MoveOn to date has raised $106, 000, Mr. Boyd says. CNN reported on the MoveOn. org money for Schiff’s 2000 campaign: “By 2000, MoveOn. org was raising $2 million for Democratic candidates, including more than $100, 000 to help California’s Adam Schiff beat Congressman James Rogan, one of the House managers during Clinton’s impeachment trial. ” MoveOn. org also sponsored a January 2010 rally in favor of health care reform outside Schiff’s office in Pasadena, California. Schiff’s 2000 campaign bio, meanwhile, relates that he was “awarded the prestigious Toll Fellowship, sponsored by The Council of State Governments. ” The bio continues: Nominated and endorsed by his peers in the Legislature, Schiff was selected from many outstanding applicants across the nation by a committee of state elected and appointed officials as one of the most promising new leaders of state government. In 1998, the California League of High Schools named Schiff Legislator of the Year. Schiff later said that the Toll Fellowship “helped me identify my own leadership strengths, work more effectively with my colleagues and strengthen my relationship with the media. ” The Council of State Governments, which sponsors the Toll Fellowship, is heavily financed by Soros.   The Open Society provided the group with $320, 000 in 2003 $1 million in 2004 and another $100, 000 that year alone. In 2009, Schiff introduced the Criminal Justice Reinvestment Act. The bill was described by the Justice Center at the   Council of State Governments  —   which gave Schiff the Toll Fellowship award  —   as providing “grants to state and local governments to design and advance     strategies to reduce corrections spending and increase public safety. ” A press release from the Council of State Governments said that Schiff’s bill “builds on the justice reinvestment work done by the Council of State Governments (CSG) Justice Center in Texas, Kansas, Vermont, Rhode Island and seven other states. ” The Justice Center’s justice reinvestment initiative was itself directly supported by Soros’s Open Society, the press release documents. In 2014, the Open Society released a statement publicly supporting legislation by Schiff “requiring the president to provide an annual public report on the total number of persons killed or injured in drone strikes. ”  The Open Society further signed a joint statement with other leftwing groups, including organizations financed by Soros, supporting Schiff’s Targeted Lethal Force Transparency Act.

7929,US/Russian Relations Sour Further As Putin Refuses To Open Snapchat From Obama,"0 Add Comment 
IN the clearest indication yet that US/Russian relations may be at an all-time low post-Cold War, Russian leader Vladimir Putin is staunchly refusing to open a Snapchat he received from his US counterpart Barack Obama. 
“If Putin opens it, it’s a poor political play. It shows he’s curious, interested in what Obama has to say. By not opening it, he’s telling Obama and the world that he has something better to do with his time,” explained app and politics expert Morgan Wilde. 
A number of Snapchat users have become heavily invested in the ongoing brinkmanship between the two superpowers who are locked in a series of countermeasures in Syria, which have left lives of innocent civilians in the balance and with rumours persisting that Putin hasn’t looked at any Western leaders’ Snapchat stories in weeks, the outlook is bleak. 
“Oh, shit, I didn’t realise it was all this serious,” said one Snapchat user, who had finally begun to understand the full extent of the deterioration of the diplomatic relationship. 
“It’s one thing to be squabbling over Aleppo, and accusations of war crimes, but it really hits home when it’s played out on my favourite app,” added Snapchat user Ciaran Bergin. 
However, some political commentators have urged people not to read too much into the exchange. 
“Look, who knows what the Snap contained, it could have just been Obama with a dog face, his way of reaching out to Putin and saying ‘God, it’s lonely at the top, isn’t it? Now, how funny do I look with dog ears and a big tongue?’ Let’s not panic about this,” shared commentator Henrietta Norris. 
There is some hope in Russia circles that Putin was simply taking a day off the app as he’s sick of seeing the same 4 or 5 people send Snapchats all day long.",0

7931,What Trump Did For A Disabled Child Is Stunning,"What Trump Did For A Disabled Child Is Stunning Oct 28, 2016 Previous post A video has resurfaced that is reported to be from 2000, when a little girl named Megan appeared on the Maury Povich show with her mother, and a New York business man named Donald Trump took notice. 
Megan was 10 years old and was born with Brittle Bone Disease. Only 32 inches tall and unable to walk, Megan didn’t know any other children like herself. Her mother, Debbie, wrote in to Maury’s show, who found another child named Tiffany with the same disease and introduced the two as guests on a show segment called “I May Look Different But I Have New Friends.” 
Some time later, Megan was invited back onto the show again – and a new surprise was in store for her. Maury told Megan someone else had seen the original show and taken a special interest in her – a very famous person. Maury played a special video message from the famous person – Donald Trump. 
Trump told her, “Hi Megan, My name’s Donald. You probably don’t know me, but I was watching Maury’s show the other day, and I must tell you, you really hit me right here (in the heart.) I think you are so beautiful, both inside and out, I had a little something, a little gift that I gave to Maury, who’s a friend of mine… and I hope you and your mother have a good time with it. And you’re very special, and you just keep it up and keep up that attitude. So good luck, and you stay in touch.”

7932,"For Stranded Somali Refugees, ‘Friend of America’ Is a Deadly Label - The New York Times","NAIROBI, Kenya  —   Ismail Ali Ibrahim gave away everything he owned: his bed, his sheets, his shirts, his pots, his pans, his plates, even his house. He didn’t care. He was going to America. But this week, he remained 7, 000 miles away, marooned with more than 100 other Somali refugees in a spartan transit center in central Nairobi that smelled of nervous sweat. Mr. Ibrahim and many of his displaced comrades had been waiting more than two decades to be resettled in the United States and were supposed to fly to America this week. But their hopes were crushed by President Trump’s executive order to freeze the refugee flow into the United States for at least four months. More than 25, 000 refugees from Somalia, one of the poorest, hungriest,   countries on earth, were in the pipeline to be resettled in the United States. Mr. Ibrahim was much closer than most  —   so close that, with his ticket, paperwork and bag all zipped up, the thought of it made his voice quiver. He had waited 26 long years for this, living in a sweltering, crowded,   refugee camp along the   border that is the opposite of hope. Now his worst fears are shaping up. The Somali refugees who had already been extensively vetted and approved by several American government agencies will most likely be bused back to the camps. Many said that they feared for their lives and that their situation was actually worse than it had been before they came so close to leaving. “Trump shocked us,” Mr. Ibrahim said. Most of them are now broke, having just two weeks ago given away their worldly possessions in a spree of happiness to friends less fortunate. But more worrisome, many refugees said as they gathered under the shade of a mango tree at the transit center, was the risk that they could be labeled “friends of America. ” That’s a dangerous tag in a poorly policed refugee camp crawling with Islamic militants. “The Shabab will be suspicious of us,” said Deck Abdi Korriyow, another refugee, referring to the militant group that has slaughtered thousands of people across eastern Africa. “They don’t want anyone resettled to the U. S. They’ll think we’ve been giving information to the Americans. ” Several men around him vigorously nodded when he added, “Who knows what will happen to us next?” Kenya is home to hundreds of thousands of Somali refugees and many are treated terribly  —   constantly harassed, arrested, often beaten, discriminated against, kept in large camps or locked in a soccer stadium during police roundups, and sometimes they have even disappeared. Many Kenyans see Somalia the way much of the world does: as a terrorist threat. So the refugees have set their sights on a faraway dream. It’s called America. The United States runs a vigorous resettlement program, taking in thousands of Somalis each year. Being one of them is like holding a winning lottery ticket and it generates a lot of envy. Some of the refugees said another reason they dreaded going back to the camps was because they knew some of their neighbors would barely be able to contain their glee that the resettlement had not worked out. “The people against me will be happy,” Mr. Ibrahim said. The more than 100 approved refugees here are now stuck because they don’t have proper papers to walk the streets of Nairobi. They were supposed to be walking the streets of Atlanta, Buffalo, Des Moines and St. Louis by now. They aren’t allowed to leave the transit center, which is in Nairobi’s old Indian quarter it was supposed to be their last stop. The gate here is large and unmarked. Security is serious many of the refugees who pass through here are hunted in their homelands. On Wednesday, the center was crowded but relatively quiet. The refugees seemed bored. Somali women in full veils lay on the sidewalk on their backs. Young men lounged in a row of scratched up chairs and were not even talking to one another. When a   mango fell from the tree, a little boy pounced on it, clearly hungry. The men spoke of “the stress. ” “Am I worried?” asked Salad Rage Saleh, thin and antsy. “Ever since I’ve been born I’ve been worried. ” American officials did not address the fears of Shabab reprisals directly. One State Department official said that the government would continue to show compassion to refugees but that it was also important to protect American citizens. Refugee officials said the Shabab fears could be real, but that some refugees also played up such concerns in an attempt to delay or stop their return to the camps, which can be depressing on a good day. Life for many Somali refugees means confronting famine, anarchy, pestilence and death on a daily basis. Ever since the government collapsed in 1991, Somalia has been stuck in perpetual crisis. One set of three brothers at the transit camp fled Somalia after their parents were killed 25 years ago, trudging across the Kenya border as three lost souls. For more than a   the brothers had been living together in a small makeshift house in a refugee camp, usually jobless and surviving off the monthly United Nations rations, which they said had been cut down to seven pounds of grain, one cup of oil and a bottle capful of salt. The Kenyans have been threatening to close this camp because of terrorism fears. The brothers had just cleared the final medical checks to be resettled in Rhode Island. Ahmed Hassan, the eldest, a quiet man with a red pen in his pocket, spoke proudly of how in recent days they had been “trained” to wear jackets, hats and gloves when it was cold. While some Americans have said in recent days that they oppose Mr. Trump’s block on refugees, others have said it makes them feel safer. Refugee officials in East Africa have been quick to point out that, in the Somalis’ case, these refugees are among the most vetted people entering the United States. The resettlement process usually takes four to six years to complete and involves database checks, fingerprinting, countless forms and hours of background interviews. The tiny percentage of refugees who make it all the way through are selected because they are considered the most vulnerable of the vulnerable. Most will now return to the same squalid camps where they had been living for years. Others in the pipeline will be put on what the State Department calls indefinite hold. When this was announced at the transit center on Saturday at a meeting in the yard, several men cried. “It was pretty shattering for me,” said Lori Seymour, the official with the International Organization for Migration who made the announcement. This week, the group spoke of all the things they had been looking forward to in America: security, freedom, pizza, meat, driving a car and seeing buildings made not of sticks, but of “mirrors and stone,” as one man put it. “I was even looking forward to paying taxes,” Mr. Hassan said. “If you pay taxes, that means you have a job and you’re making money, right?”",0
7933,Leaked Emails Reveal What Top Advisers Said About Hillary When She Wasn't Around — This One's Brutal,"Getty - Chip Somodevilla 
Two of Hillary Clinton’s top advisers, including her campaign chairman, agreed in a leaked email exchange that the Democratic nominee's “instincts can be terrible.” 
Clinton adviser Neera Tanden, president of the far-left Center for American Progress, wrote to John Podesta on Sept. 6, 2015, to check in. 
“How are you feeling about things?” she wrote. 
Biden will get in 
We are still way more likely than not to win nomination 
We've taken on a lot of water that won't be easy to pump out of the boat. 
Most of that has to do with terrible decisions made pre-campaign, but a lot has to do with her instincts. 
She's nervous so prepping more and performing better. 
Got to do something to pump up excitement but not certain how to do that. 
Tanden agreed about Clinton’s “instincts” in her response: 
You know I'm not a sycophant to you by any means. But the thing that makes me most confident she will prevail is that you are there. 
Almost no one knows better me that her instincts can be terrible. 
She does have to give time to allow new things to take hold. Clinton's campaign chair John Podesta and adviser Neera Tanden agree on Hillary: ""...her instincts can be terrible"" pic.twitter.com/spAihHm9IP — Jason Howerton (@jason_howerton) October 26, 2016 
Trump used the email during the Las Vegas presidential debate, claiming even Clinton's own campaign chairman thinks her instincts are terrible, causing Podesta to push back and express his “love” for Clinton in a statement to The Daily Mail: 
“No, I think, you know, I love Hillary Clinton and I think if any fair reading of what I've said about her or what I think about her indicates that I think she is someone who's a tremendous leader who's gotten tremendous results for kids, for families, for people throughout her public service.” Image Credit: Rick Wilking-Pool/Getty Images 
In another awkward email exchange , Podesta and Tanden wondered in shock why Clinton's team didn't disclose information about her private email server long before her presidential campaign to avoid the distraction. 
“Why didn't they get this stuff out like 18 months ago? So crazy,” Tanden wrote to Podesta. 
“Unbelievable,” Podesta replied. 
Then Tanden answered her own question: “[I] guess I know the answer. [T]hey wanted to get away with it.” ",0
7934,"Bernie Sanders, Eyeing Convention, Willing to Harm Hillary Clinton in the Homestretch - The New York Times","Defiant and determined to transform the Democratic Party, Senator Bernie Sanders is opening a   phase of his presidential campaign aimed at inflicting a heavy blow on Hillary Clinton in California and amassing enough leverage to advance his agenda at the convention in July  —   or even wrest the nomination from her. Advisers to Mr. Sanders said on Wednesday that he was newly resolved to remain in the race, seeing an aggressive campaign as his only chance to pressure Democrats into making fundamental changes to how presidential primaries and debates are held in the future. They said he also held out hope of capitalizing on any late stumbles by Mrs. Clinton or any damage to her candidacy, whether by scandal or by the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump. After sounding subdued if not downbeat about the race for weeks, Mr. Sanders resumed a combative posture against Mrs. Clinton, demanding on Wednesday that she debate him before the June 7 primary in California and highlighting anew what he asserted were her weaknesses against Mr. Trump. Mr. Sanders, his advisers said, has been buoyed by a stream of polls showing him beating Mr. Trump by larger margins than Mrs. Clinton in some battleground states, and by his belief that an upset victory in California could have a psychological impact on convention delegates who already have doubts about Mrs. Clinton. But his newly resolute attitude is also the cumulative result of months of anger at the national Democratic Party over a debate schedule that his campaign said favored Mrs. Clinton a   arrangement between the party and the Clinton campaign the appointment of fierce Clinton partisans as leaders of important convention committees and the party’s rebuke of Mr. Sanders on Tuesday for not clearly condemning a melee at the Nevada Democratic convention on Saturday. While Mr. Sanders says he does not want Mr. Trump to win in November, his advisers and allies say he is willing to do some harm to Mrs. Clinton in the shorter term if it means he can capture a majority of the 475 pledged delegates at stake in California and arrive at the Philadelphia convention with maximum political power. Tad Devine, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, said the campaign did not think its attacks would help Mr. Trump in the long run, but added that the senator’s team was “not thinking about” the possibility that they could help derail Mrs. Clinton from becoming the first woman elected president. “The only thing that matters is what happens between now and June 14,” Mr. Devine said, referring to the final Democratic primary, in the District of Columbia. “We have to put the blinders on and focus on the best case to make in the upcoming states. If we do that, we can be in a strong position to make the best closing argument before the convention. If not, everyone will know in   and we’ll have to take a hard look at where things stand. ” The prospect of a   Democratic fight is deeply troubling to party leaders who are eager for Mrs. Clinton and House and Senate candidates to turn to attacking Mr. Trump without being diverted by Democratic strife. Mr. Sanders has won nearly 10 million votes, compared to Mrs. Clinton’s 13 million, and Democratic leaders say she needs time to begin courting the young voters, liberals and other Sanders supporters who view her as an ally of corporate and   interests. But Mr. Sanders has sharpened his language of late, saying Tuesday night that the party faced a choice to remain “dependent on   campaign contributions and be a party with limited participation and limited energy” or “welcome into the party people who are prepared to fight for real economic and social change. ” Mr. Sanders’s   instincts have been encouraged by his   campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, who has been blistering against the Clinton camp and the party establishment. On Wednesday, he took to CNN to accuse Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the Democratic national chairwoman, of “throwing shade on the Sanders campaign from the very beginning. ” For weeks, some current and former Sanders campaign workers have privately acknowledged feeling disheartened about Mr. Weaver’s determination to go after the Democratic National Committee, fearing a pitched battle with the party they hope to support in the general election. The intraparty fighting has affected morale, they say, and raised concerns that Mr. Weaver, a longtime Sanders aide who more recently ran a comic book store, was not devoted to achieving Democratic unity. Several described the campaign’s message as having devolved into a   with perceived conspiracies on the part of Mrs. Clinton’s allies. Democratic leaders said they wanted to do everything possible to avoid having   tensions send the Philadelphia convention into the sort of chaos they had expected to mar the Republican convention. So far, though, Mr. Sanders has not indicated that he would ask his delegates to support Mrs. Clinton, as she did in 2008 for Barack Obama. “I’m hopeful that the two candidates will come together, and soon, which could blunt the possibility of real trouble at our convention,” said Edward G. Rendell, the former governor of Pennsylvania and a Clinton supporter who is chairman of the Philadelphia host committee for the convention. “But you look at what happened in Nevada, and you worry. ” The melee there, at which Sanders supporters revolted and threatened the state Democratic chairwoman in a fight over delegates, intensified concerns among Clinton allies. Senator Barbara Boxer of California, who attended the convention, said she spoke with Mr. Sanders late Tuesday and said he was “distressed” by the Nevada episode. “He will be judged as whether or not he has leadership qualities by the way he handles this,” she said. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, who is close to Mr. Sanders, spoke with Mr. Sanders on Friday about not letting the state convention devolve into a messy fight. They spoke again on Tuesday afternoon, and Mr. Reid complained that a staff member who had attended feared for her safety. But Mr. Sanders’s subsequent statement condemning the violence, which mostly dwelled on how dismissively he felt the party was treating him, did little to soothe Mr. Reid’s unease. “Bernie and I have known each other for a long time, and I believe he is better than this,” Mr. Reid said Wednesday. But some Sanders supporters said that Democrats were ignoring an undercurrent of anger among those who fear that Mrs. Clinton, if elected, would lack the courage to challenge her friends and political contributors. “We want to have progressive values and socialism on the convention’s agenda, rather than slip back into centrist Democratic thinking if she gets elected,” said Tick Segerblom, a state senator in Nevada and a Sanders supporter. “I think there could be some chaos at the convention  —   at least outside, with a lot of anarchists, socialists, young people. ” Mrs. Clinton’s campaign has largely taken Mr. Sanders’s latest broadsides in stride. In soliciting donations Wednesday, it said that the   battle against Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump was “one of the toughest parts of our campaign so far. ” A Clinton campaign spokesman declined to comment about Mr. Sanders’s debate proposal in California. Privately, Mrs. Clinton’s advisers said Mr. Sanders could win California but emphasized their confidence that Mrs. Clinton would still win the nomination. She now has a total of 2, 293 pledged delegates and superdelegates she needs 90 more to win the nomination, although superdelegates can shift their support up to the convention. Mr. Sanders has 1, 533 pledged delegates and superdelegates. Mr. Sanders is now running slightly behind Mrs. Clinton in California in public polls. Ben Tulchin, Mr. Sanders’s pollster, pointed to signs of rising voter registration in California among young people and independents  —   two core Sanders constituencies  —   as evidence that he could win the state. But Hispanic registration is also rising, which could benefit Mrs. Clinton. With Mr. Sanders expected to campaign aggressively over the next three weeks, his supporters in the state said they were focused on winning the primary, not on November. “If you want to talk about historic, let’s talk about the record turnout numbers at his rallies,” said Mayor Bao Nguyen of Garden Grove, Calif. a Sanders supporter. “Senator Sanders isn’t obliged to help Secretary Clinton if she wins. That’s a decision his team can make if they face that choice. ” Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, Mr. Sanders’s lone endorser in the Senate, said that the party’s divisions would only deepen if Mr. Sanders was driven from the race now. “You can’t say to them, ‘Hey we don’t want to hear your views,’ and shut the door on them,” Mr. Merkley said, “and then a month later open the door and say, ‘Hey, can you come in and help us out?’",0

November 2016 Mann bucht Maas und Nahles für 10.000 Euro, damit sie beim Dachdecken helfen Bremen (dpo) - ""Das ist wahrscheinlich das teuerste Dach hier in der Wohngegend, aber das ist es mir wert"", erklärt Günther Neukamm. Der 43-Jährige hat sich bei der SPD-Agentur Network Media für insgesamt 10.000 Euro sowohl Bundesjustizminister Heiko Maas als auch Arbeitsministerin Andrea Nahles als Gehilfen zum Dachdecken angemietet. Als er zum ersten Mal hörte, dass man SPD-Minister gegen Geld buchen kann , sei ihm sofort sein Dach eingefallen, so Neukamm. ""Der Hausbau hat mich rund 200.000 Euro gekostet. Da kommt's auf die 10.000 nicht mehr an. Eigentlich kosten die einzeln 6000, aber ich habe Mengenrabatt bekommen, weil ich zwei genommen habe."" Über die dachdeckerischen Fähigkeiten der beiden Politiker macht sich Neukamm keine Illusionen: ""Mir ist schon klar, dass die in der Richtung nix drauf haben"", erklärt der Bremer Restaurantbesitzer. ""Aber ich dachte mir, die sollen wenigstens einmal im Leben auch was Anständiges machen. Mensch, Andrea! Das seh ich doch von hier unten, dass da ein abgeschliffener Ziegel hinmuss! Du bist doch Arbeitsministerin! Dann arbeite auch mal ordentlich!"" Nach neun Stunden harter Knochenarbeit verabschiedet Neukamm die beiden völlig erschöpften Minister. Er findet, dass sich die Aktion gelohnt hat: ""Ich hab mich fast totgelacht, als der Maas einmal fast vom Dach gefallen ist und mich gewundert, wie viele Ziegel die Nahles wuchten kann."" Soeben wurde bekannt, dass die SPD das mittlerweile in Verruf geratene Programm mit sofortiger Wirkung einstellt .

7936,Paul Ryan: ’No Evidence’ of Sessions Colluding with Russia During Election - Breitbart,"House Speaker Paul Ryan pushed back against hysterical Democrats who insist Attorney General Jeff Sessions had improper meetings with a Russian diplomat during President Donald Trump’s political campaign. [“I think Democrats are lighting their hair on fire to get you to cover this story,” Ryan said, pointing to House and Senate Democrats calling for Sessions to resign.  The Washington Post reported that Sessions did not reveal two meetings with a Russian ambassador during his confirmation hearings, even though he testified that he did not have contact with the Russians about the campaign. Ryan said there was zero evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians to interfere in the election. “We have seen no evidence from any of these ongoing investigations that anybody in the Trump campaign or the Trump team was involved in any of this,” he said during a press conference. Ryan added that there still wasn’t evidence than any American colluded with the Russians to sway the election to Trump, and he added that members of congress frequently communicate with ambassadors of other countries. “Honestly, we meet with ambassadors all the time,” he said. “I don’t even remember which  —   all the ones I met with and took pictures with. ”",0
7937,"Jeff Sessions Rips Bureaucrats Refusing to Back Trump Policies, Touts Border Security Success - Breitbart","Attorney General Jeff Sessions joined syndicated Boston radio host Howie Carr on his broadcast Thursday, laying out the new path his Department of Justice is charting in the Trump era. [New measures to crack down at the border were of particular focus in light of Sessions’s sweeping announcements in Nogales, Arizona Tuesday. Talk also turned to Sessions’ efforts to rebuild a Justice Department still largely staffed with holdover   appointees and career civil service employees, most of whom worked under the previous administration. Sessions’ continued crusade against   “sanctuary cities” made up the final portion of their conversation.  “I’ve been excited about progress at the border   …     March was the lowest level of illegal entrants to the country in 17 years. It was 72% below the last month of the Obama Administration,” Sessions relayed to Carr. Building on his statements on Fox News’s Hannity, he added: I thought if we had clear leadership by the President, by our officers, and tell people please don’t come illegally, if you want to come to America wait your turn. If we do that we’d see a decline, and so far it’s exceeded my expectation. Carr expressed his disbelief at the controversy that has arisen over Sessions’ directives. “You’re enforcing the law! There’s nothing new here. You’re just taking the federal criminal code and enforcing it,” he said. Sessions was equally incredulous: It is just beyond my comprehension how we drifted so far away from the common sense notion that sovereign nations have borders and those borders should be honored   …     Any country that has common sense, and almost all do, has laws that if you commit a crime while you’re in the country, lawfully or unlawfully, you are to be deported. Carr moved conversation to the pace of confirmations and appointments in the Sessions DOJ. Slowed by Democratic political maneuvering like the   protracted Senate battle over   Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, Sessions’ efforts to assemble a team of his choosing around him has been painfully slow. Only his choices for the number two and three spots at DOJ, Deputy Attorney General and Associate Attorney General have been received a hearing and been passed for a vote of the full Senate by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Only one other DOJ nomination has been officially taken up by the Committee, Antitrust Assistant AG nominee Makan Delrahim. Sessions told Carr that he expects his Deputy pick, Rod Rosenstein of Maryland, and his nominee for Associate AG, Rachel Brand of Iowa, to be confirmed soon, but expressed dismay over the whole process: It does appear, however, that we are further behind than normal with appointments. It looks like it will be two weeks before I get the first of my fifteen or so Senate confirmed deputies approved. Can you imagine that? The first. And he may be the first one in the entire government that’s been confirmed as a deputy  …    it’s not good. Carr pressed Sessions on “Obama holdovers” throughout his department, especially those in the Civil Rights Division who implemented   Assistant Attorney General Vanity Gupta’s response to the Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore riots that has drawn considerable criticism on the political right. “Are you trying to weed out these   people?” he asked. Sessions acknowledged that career employees have always and will continue to make up of the majority of the Justice Department, but had a stern message to those who might resist the new direction at DOJ. “The President, the Attorney General set the policy, and I expect those policies to be followed. If people can’t comply with the policies of this administration, they should look elsewhere. ” The Attorney General was hopeful at the prospects for the career   he oversees. “We’re getting pretty good cooperation,” he said, citing the example of career prosecutor and acting U. S. Attorney for the District of Rhode Island Stephen Dambruch, who did not shy away from revealing the immigration status of those caught in a   heroin roundup Thursday. Carr finally turned attention to a cornerstone of Sessions’ nascent tenure at DOJ:   “sanctuary” jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities on immigration enforcement. “We going to, um, urge, these people involved in sanctuary cities,” was Sessions’s suggestive reply. “The law says if somebody commits a crime in Boston or New Hampshire, they’re to be deported if they’re here unlawfully   …     why cities would block that and keep criminals in their cities is beyond me. ”",0
7938,"With Uncertainty at Top of Ticket, Republicans Back Off in Some States - The New York Times","HOLLYWOOD, Fla.  —   The Republican National Committee is scaling back its financial commitments to some of the most hotly contested states because of flagging   the most concrete evidence yet of how the party’s divisive and protracted presidential race is threatening the party’s entire ticket in November. Committee officials outlined detailed plans in written “playbooks” distributed this year in the most competitive states about how they intended to assist Republican campaigns up and down the ballot with money and manpower. By July 1, Florida was to have 256 field organizers and Ohio another 176, for example, according to a state party chairman in possession of the strategy books who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters. But Sean Spicer, the committee’s chief strategist, acknowledged this week that the committee had begun informing state parties and statewide campaigns that fulfilling such plans would now be “slower. ” He said the pledges had been made with the assumption that Republicans would have “a presumptive presidential nominee by now. ” Just as revealing, the party is also taking steps to create a separate   entity dedicated to Senate races, an acknowledgment that many of the wealthiest contributors are increasingly focused on protecting Republican control of Congress rather than on a presidential campaign they fear is lost. Taken together, the party’s financial difficulties illustrate the considerable fallout Republicans are facing from a nominating contest that could last through   and that features two leading candidates, Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz, who are deeply troublesome to many leading Republican donors. “I think everything is up in the air,” said Matt Borges, the chairman of the Republican Party in Ohio, which in addition to being a perennial, and perhaps the   swing state is also home to a competitive Senate race this year. That sense of uncertainty, along with ample apprehension, loomed this week over the party’s spring meeting here. What is typically an organizational gathering and convivial reunion for Republican state chairmen and chairwomen and other committee members has been subsumed by an explosive presidential race in which the   is waging open war against the party and its longstanding nomination rules. More worrisome to many veteran Republicans than Mr. Trump’s complaints about the   process, though, is what his nomination could mean for the party’s prospects across the board this fall. Mr. Trump has no   donor network and has given little indication that he is willing to tap into his fortune to give the party the hundreds of millions of dollars it will require to finance its campaigns in the fall. In remarks to committee members here Thursday night, Mr. Trump’s new top strategist, Paul Manafort, sought to allay these fears without being overly specific. “He is prepared to work with the R. N. C. and the committees to raise the money necessary so that we will be well funded,” Mr. Manafort said. In the 2012 elections, the R. N. C. raised more than $409 million. The party has raised $135 million this election, but what is deeply concerning to many Republican candidates, contributors and strategists is that it only had a little more than $16 million on hand, along with nearly $2 million in debt, at the end of March. Mr. Spicer stressed that this was partly because the committee had already begun paying to send staff members to battleground states, well ahead of the same time four years ago. But the party’s modest cash availability underscores how much hangs in the balance with its nominee. “The minute Trump gets the nomination, the party is going to have to raise another three or four hundred million,” said Al Hoffman, a   Republican donor. “Trump should pay for it himself. ” Mr. Hoffman, a former R. N. C. finance chairman, is the sort of contributor who illustrates the party’s predicament. He said he had little appetite to raise money for a   party and would probably focus his efforts this year on helping a local House candidate and assisting the   of his friend, Senator John McCain of Arizona. And he emphasized that he was not alone. “All the donors I’ve talked to have said they want to sit out the presidential and just focus on the Senate and House,” Mr. Hoffman said. Ray Washburne, a Republican   from Dallas who also previously served as a national committee finance chairman, said, “There’s a big switch to doing the Senate races and trying to hold onto the Senate. ” Mr. Washburne said Mr. Trump, who has relied on mostly   contributors in addition to about $36 million of his own money, showed no sign of being prepared for the   demands of a presidential general election. “The Trump group has done nothing about putting together a finance team at all,” he said. And Mr. Washburne would know. A former finance chairman of Gov. Chris Christie’s presidential campaign, Mr. Washburne was brought backstage to meet Mr. Trump in February when Mr. Christie, of New Jersey, endorsed Mr. Trump. Mr. Washburne said Mr. Trump lavished him with praise  —   “he makes you feel like a million dollars”  —   but did not ask him for any help raising money or to connect him with other top  . In the months since, Mr. Washburne said, he has not heard from Mr. Trump, even as donors have asked him, because of his ties to Mr. Christie, how they could help Mr. Trump. “I don’t even know who the hell to tell them to call,” Mr. Washburne said. This sort of unease about Mr. Trump, along with the dislike many of the party’s   donors have for the   Mr. Cruz, has prompted the R. N. C. to begin privately assuring donors that it will create a   Senate Trust fund. Money earmarked for that fund will go entirely to initiatives aimed at retaining the Senate  —   including hiring field operatives and opposition researchers and bolstering digital efforts. “We want to be able to look a donor in the eye and say, ‘Yes, your dollars are going to help maintain the Senate,’ ” said Mr. Spicer, who confirmed the program’s creation. The idea rankled top officials at the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the party’s Senate campaign arm, who said they had not been informed of the R. N. C. ’s Senate plan. The money cannot come soon enough to strategists and campaign officials in the most contested states, many of which, feature a competitive presidential race and   campaigns for Senate and governor. The situation is particularly urgent in Florida, the largest of the traditional presidential swing states, which this year is holding a   contest for Senator Marco Rubio’s seat, the outcome of which could determine control of the Senate. The usually   Florida Republican Party has encountered financial difficulties since Gov. Rick Scott’s preferred candidate for state party chairman was rejected last year, making it more reliant on national assistance. What is more, the sort of     efforts that are typically funded by the parties are especially crucial in Florida, because many of its voters cast absentee ballots or take advantage of early voting. “We’ve never not had a robust absentee and   program in Florida,” said David Johnson, a longtime Republican strategist here. There is similar concern in North Carolina, where what may be the country’s most competitive governor’s race is being fought and where Republicans who have seen private polling say Mr. Trump is trailing Hillary Clinton. But, as in other battleground states, that appears to be delayed until the national party has more clarity about its finances. “The unspoken concern,” said Mr. Borges, the Ohio chairman, is that if Mr. Trump secures the nomination, “he, No. 1, won’t participate in   for the party, and, No. 2, donors won’t want to help the party if he’s the nominee. ” “So that would put a real damper on   in a number of ways. ”",0
7939,"FBI Finds New Evidence, Reopens Investigation Into Clinton E-mail","Email 
Hillary Clinton may not be completely in the clear on her use of a private, unsecured e-mail server used to send and receive classified information during her time as secretary of state. FBI Director James Comey announced on Friday — in a letter to high-ranking members of Congress — that the FBI is reopening the investigation on the basis of new information. 
The letter was addressed to Senator Richard Burr (R-N.C.), chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence; Senator Charles “Chuck” Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman, Committee on the Judiciary; Senator Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), chairman, Committee on Appropriations and Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and related Agencies; Senator Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs; Representative Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), chairman, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence; Representative Robert “Bob” Goodlatte (R-Va.), chairman, Committee on the Judiciary; Representative John Culberson (R-Texas), chairman, Committee on Appropriations and Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and related Agencies; and Representative Jayson Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. 
Comey — who declined to recommend an indictment against Clinton after the conclusion of the previous investigation in July — wrote to the chairmen of these committees to say that “in connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation” of Clinton. Due to this new information, Comey wrote that he believes “it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony” regarding the investigation into whether Clinton knowingly broke the law. 
Comey did not say what the “unrelated case” is or how it is connected to Clinton’s e-mails. He did say that he had been briefed about the newly discovered e-mails on Thursday and wrote, “I agree that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.” CNN’s Evan Perez reported that law enforcement sources say the new e-mails are not from to WikiLeaks and are not about the Clinton Foundation. 
In response to the letter, Representative Bob Goodlatte released a statement which said: The FBI’s decision to reopen its investigation into Secretary Clinton reinforces what the House Judiciary Committee has been saying for months: the more we learn about Secretary Clinton’s use of a private email server, the clearer it becomes that she and her associates committed wrongdoing and jeopardized national security. Now that the FBI has reopened the matter, it must conduct the investigation with impartiality and thoroughness. The American people deserve no less and no one should be above the law. 
Jason Chaffetz tweeted about the letter, saying, “FBI Dir just informed me, ""The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation."" Case reopened.” 
The Clinton campaign claimed not to have had any previous knowledge of this most recent development. A Clinton aide reportedly told CNN, “We’re learning about this just like you all are.” That sounds strangely similar to President Obama’s claim that he learned about Clinton’s private e-mail server from news reports — a claim the White House later had to walk back. 
Caught off guard, Clinton’s running mate, Tim Kaine, was asked about the reopened investigation while campaigning in Tallahassee, Florida. The only response he offered to reporters was, “Got to read a little more, got to read a little more.” 
Donald Trump — who told Clinton in the second presidential debate that if he is elected, he will have her investigated and that the conclusion is “you’d be in jail.” — seized the opportunity to make a statement before giving a prepared speech in Manchester, New Hampshire. He told the audience, “They are reopening the case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United States,” adding, “We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.” 
Comey was careful in his letter to say that “the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant,” adding that “I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work.” This new phase of the investigation may — in keeping with a Clinton family tradition — continue past the election, and — if Clinton is elected — result in impeachment proceedings against her.

7940,"In Kayak Death Case, Jury Will See Police Interrogation Video - The New York Times","GOSHEN, N. Y.  —   The judge in the case of a woman accused of killing her fiancé during a kayak outing will allow jurors to watch virtually all of an   police interrogation video in which the defendant, Angelika Graswald, makes a series of incriminating statements. Ms. Graswald has been awaiting trial here in the Orange County jail for 19 months. Since the summer, County Court Judge Robert H. Freehill has postponed several pretrial conferences. But on Friday, he scheduled the start of jury selection for Feb. 14. The decision was a blow to the defense since Ms. Graswald’s lawyer had vigorously sought to keep the police interrogation and other statements out of evidence. Neither side is allowed to discuss the case. Ms. Graswald was charged with   murder in April 2015, nearly two weeks after her fiancé, Vincent Viafore, 46, drowned when his kayak capsized. The couple, who shared an apartment in Poughkeepsie, N. Y. had gone kayaking together on the Hudson River, paddling in the cold, choppy water to Bannerman Island. Prosecutors say Ms. Graswald, 36, a native of Latvia, intentionally caused the kayak of Mr. Viafore, who was not wearing a life jacket, to overturn. They say she was unhappy in the relationship and stood to gain $250, 000 in life insurance from two polices that listed her as the beneficiary. Along with allowing jurors to see the interrogation, Judge Freehill ruled that the district attorney’s office could tell them about statements Ms. Graswald made the day before her arrest, when she spoke to police investigators on Bannerman Island. She had gone there to lay a wreath. According to prosecutors, she told one of the investigators during a walk that she had removed the drain plug from Mr. Viafore’s kayak, as well as a ring from his paddle. During the lengthy interrogation that followed in the police barracks, Ms. Graswald stopped short of confessing to the murder. But she complained about Mr. Viafore’s interest in pornography and group sex, and described her ambivalence as he was drowning. “I’m like ripping in two halves,” she said then. “You know, angels and demons. The demon side, it’s not a good side, and that side was telling me this is gonna happen. Just let it. But the good side was, ‘Save him, save him, save him. You’re strong. ’” Ms. Graswald’s lawyer, Richard A. Portale, insists that the police coerced her into making the statements by wearing her down over hours. At the end of the questioning, she had blurted out, “I wanted him dead and now he’s gone and I’m fine with it. ” Judge Freehill decided to keep one part of the interrogation from jurors: a brief conversation Ms. Graswald had in Russian with someone toward the end of the 11 hours. “Because a finding cannot be made that the statements were voluntary during the conversation in Russian, these statements and those that follow cannot be used by the People at trial,” he wrote. On the day of the kayaking trip in April 2015, the water had turned rough as the couple was returning to shore from Bannerman Island. The river was cold enough to cause hypothermia, according to the National Center for Cold Water Safety. This past June, a pretrial hearing determined how investigators had obtained their evidence. In the case against Ms. Graswald, the allegations hinge largely on her statements to investigators. Another issue that arose during the June hearing was whether Ms. Graswald had understood the meaning of the Miranda warning, which alerts suspects to their right to remain silent and to have a lawyer present. A State Police investigator in the case, Donald DeQuarto, testified at an earlier hearing that he had read Ms. Graswald her Miranda rights after they had spoken for over three hours at a police barracks, and that she had understood them. But Mr. Portale argued otherwise, pointing to her question  —   “Who’s Miranda?”  —   a few hours after they had been read. Mr. Viafore’s body was found in the Hudson River in May 2015. A medical examiner said the cause of death was drowning and the manner of death a homicide, citing “kayak drain plug intentionally removed by other. ” Legal experts questioned that citation, however, saying the medical examiner’s office overstepped its bounds in focusing on the drain plug when its mandate was to examine the body.",0
7941,Morning Sickness May Protect Mother and Child,"Morning Sickness May Protect Mother and Child VN:F [1.9.22_1171] Close Transcript Transcript: Morning Sickness May Protect Mother and Child 
Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video. 
“Since the beginning of time, pregnant women have been [known] to suffer…nausea and vomiting [during pregnancy].”“The term ‘morning sickness’ is [actually] misleading,” since women can feel sick all day long. And sometimes, it can get so serious women have to be hospitalized. 
Researchers at Harvard’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital found that saturated fat seemed to be a primary dietary risk factor for severe sickness. Five times the odds for each 15 grams’ intake of saturated fat, like a quarter-pound cheeseburger’s worth. The reason saturated fat intake may be such a strong risk factor could be through its effect on estrogen, as “[s]aturated fat has been shown to increase circulating levels of estrogen.” 
Why would we evolve to have such a negative reaction to saturated fat? Why would we evolve to get sick at all? “Pregnancy sickness is a universal phenomenon, [with nausea and vomiting] affecting 70 to 85% of all pregnant women.” If you include food aversions in the definition, then the incidence is more like 100%. “Because pregnancy sickness is such a common phenomenon, one must question why this is so. Is there a purpose for such a potentially devastating condition?” Well, in the past, pregnancy sickness was dismissed as all just in women’s heads, but “recent…studies have reconsidered pregnancy sickness as an embryo-protective mechanism, an evolutionary adaptation to protect the [baby].” 
Protect the baby from what? Maybe from meat. “Meat is the principal source of pathogens for humans. Meat is also the most common type of food avoided by pregnant women.” So, the development of an aversion to meat during pregnancy could be protective, as “meat may have toxins that are mutagenic, carcinogenic, and teratogenic”—meaning birth defect-causing. Tainted meat may also be contaminated by pathogens, and “[p]regnancy is a time of relative immunosuppression.” Normally, we can fend off most meat pathogens; however, by design, pregnant women are immunosuppressed to not reject the developing embryo, since half the baby—from the father’s side—is foreign. 
So, maybe morning sickness evolved as a way to get us to stay away from meat during this vulnerable time. This would be consistent with a “profound overrepresentation” of taboos against meat eating during pregnancy in sample societies around the world. 
If this theory is true, then we should be able to make five predictions. If nausea and vomiting in pregnancy is there to be protective, then women who have it should have better pregnancy outcomes. And, indeed, women who experience nausea and vomiting are significantly less likely to miscarry, or suffer a stillbirth. 
Prediction #2 would be that the triggering foods contain things that can be particularly harmful to the baby. And, indeed, “[o]f all food types, animal protein (including meat, poultry, eggs, and seafood…) is the most dangerous. Meat is the source of a wide range of pathogens that pose a grave threat to pregnant women and [their developing babies].” 
Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy should also coincide with when the embryo is most vulnerable. That’s between like, you know, weeks 5 and 15, when all the critical organ structures are being formed—which is right when nausea and vomiting is peaking, which is right when pregnant women find meats, fish, poultry, and eggs most aversive. 
And, finally, if this theory is true, one would expect a lower frequency of morning sickness among plant-based populations. And, yes, the few societies where you don’t see such morning sickness problems are the ones that tend to have only plants as dietary staples, rather than meat.

So nice to have a video without pop-ins!! :) In early pregnancy my food aversion wasn’t to meat (which I didn’t eat anyway). However I did have a major aversion to peanut butter–couldn’t even take a whiff of the stuff! Maybe protection from aflatoxin? Secondary aversion was to oatmeal which had been my go-to breakfast for years. Didn’t touch either throughout pregnancy. WFPBRunner 
Something that is also curious is I had morning sickness the minute I got up but was fine for the rest of the day. If meat was the culprit wouldn’t I have been sick when the food was still in my stomach? What good would vomiting up nothing do? Julie 
Yeah, doesn’t make much sense, does it? I’ve never really thought there’s much rhyme or reason to the idiosyncrasies of pregnancy like morning sickness, food aversions and cravings.. Many of them don’t make much sense, although it would be interesting if they did. WFPBRunner

I wonder if our evolution is the culprit on things like this. Where we might have evolved the morning sickness as a reponse to toxins, when toxins were almost entirely from our diet. Today we wear make up, and touch chemicals among other things, who knows, maybe make up makes us throw up? It’d be interesting to see a more detailed breakdown of that. Foroogh – NF Moderator 
Yes, I think this is very interesting topic for further research. The bodies response to toxin to protect the fetus that his or her immune systems is not developed yet. Yes, our bodies are very complex system and we learn a lot from it. plant_this_thought 
Our bodies are equipped to tell us so many things, when we stop to listen. Tom Goff 
Symptoms often aren’t just messages. They are the body’s first line defences against infection and injury. Coughing expels noxious organisms, fevers kill pathogens etc etc. Suppressing symptoms may actually be counterproductive in some circumstances. plant_this_thought 
Disease, then, is not the body misbehaving, but working as designed. Darryl 
This paper offers a similar hypothesis that the reason saturated fat intake induces inflammation (in the nonpregnant as well) is that it’s an adaptive response to gut pathogens that meat promotes. 
Embyronic implantation “ resembles an open wound that requires a strong inflammatory response ” where the uterine lining is broken and endometrial tissue invaded, and this enhanced immune response is partly responsible for morning sickness. Terry 
We had 4 children and my wife got morning sickness with each one. I am not a doc and of course can’t give medical advise. But we used B-6 and the morning sickness was gone. With all 4 children. Others tried my suggestion and it worked for them too. B-6 is supposed to work for sea sickness too. Darryl 
They used 25 mg every 8 h for 3 d. nc54 
Eat a banana every 8 hours. Good source of B6. Joyce 
At the time I became pregnant with my son, my diet consisted mainly of vegetables with very occasional meals of chicken or fish. I did not experience morning sickness. However, as the pregnancy progressed, i began to crave red meat. Since I had not had any for more than 15 years, it was difficult to contemplate following through on this need. Eventually, the craving became so powerful, I purchased and ate an entire steak. I was surprised that the need persisted for the remainder of the pregnancy. Once my son was born, I reverted to a predominantly vegetarian diet. But clearly my usual diet was lacking in something required for the pregnangy lemonhead 
Same thing happened to me re: red meat. I did get morning sickness in my first trimester, though. Julie 
Same thing happened to a friend of mine. She normally hated red meat, but while pregnant she craved it like crazy! Bobbi 
I just love the pop-in images and the picture videos! what a nice way to change things up- thank you Nutritionfacts. 
This video is so interesting to me since I vomited for almost 7 months of my pregnancy and thus never had another child after my wonderfu Sebastian. I know this rationale is fact for me. It was always fried smells of any time and I literally lived on peanut butter and toast while fearing my son would then be allergic to peanuts after my high consumption, but he is 24 now and no signs of it. Our bodies are so wise! Bobbi 
Sorry, meant to write, “smells of frying or cooking meat” that made me have to literally walk quickly past restaurants and decline dinner invitations. I think the reason it turned on early in the morning and stayed all day and night for me was because that is when it needed to alert me; when I was awake. Foroogh – NF Moderator

uhg… baby center is full of pop info that aims to please everyone and anyone- not a great scientific resource….. Maria 
Oh my goodness- I love Dr. Gregor and my plant based diet but I get really upset at stuff like this… 6 weeks to the day (after eating pounds of asparagus and beans) I got debilitating nausea with my second pregnancy (that PS was quelled for awhile when I ate a high calorie/ high fat meal like…. meat. Which I wouldn’t touch until I was pregnant.) For all of you watching please don’t go around promising women they will not have morning sickness if they are plant based because it’s simply not true. I think it has more to do with changes in hormones (this is all from experience totally non scientific…). I am super sensitive to changes in hormones to the point where I get extremely nauseous at milk let down when I’m nursing (even after intercourse- which is a similar hormone “rush” if I’m not mistaken). I have searched all over for information about this but I feel like all of it is anecdotal. My biggest aversions during pregnancy were to rice, oatmeal, and whole beans (smashed was fine haha)- and it sounds stupid but I hated drinking water. I simply couldn’t eat enough calories to support myself because of the nausea. 
I didn’t try ginger or B6 but I just want to fix the cause of the nausea not put a bandaid on it…. 
As a side note I totally avoided heartburn because of the PB Diet. It was amazing!!! Had it horrible with my first but not with my second! Oil, meat, and anything processed (even a little) gave me horrible heartburn- greens and fruit rock! nire81 
I’ve had three pregnancies with severe morning sickness. The first pregnancy I was a vegetarian (for over a decade) and I threw up so much I lost weight for 7 months. The second pregnancy I was still a vegetarian and was also very sick, but threw up a little less. My third pregnancy I was vegan (for two years) and I couldn’t stand up without needing to puke, and I had issues with dehydration. I was having blood work done yearly because of my Hashimoto’s, and my nutrient levels were fine. All three times the sickness lasted the entire pregnancy and went away right after delivery. Maybe meat is one cause of morning sickness, but based on my experience I think there must be other causes as well. NutritionistMia 
I am 17 weeks pregnant with twins. I have suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) throughout my pregnancy and have been hospitalized due to dehydration before. I also am a primarily plant-based eater. While I think this theory could hold some merit since so many pregnant women experience aversions to meat and poultry, it really doesn’t begin to explain the range of nausea triggers for those of us with HG. For example, a simple car ride or a whiff of certain vegetables (especially ones that I used to love!) can induce excessive vomiting, and neither of these examples appear harmful for the fetuses. My point is I think this theory is a bit oversimplified and dismissive of a condition that is much more complex and mysterious than this video would suggest. Maria 
YES! I think pregnant women are just so widely misunderstood. It’s not JUST what you eat (maybe a factor)- maybe it’s even stress! I wonder if those other countries that are more plant based also see pregnancy as a normal part of life (not a disease like in the US) and have families who support the pregnant women (not have demanding work days and isolation from families as a normal part of the culture- not to mention a a negative view of pregnancy and children) NutritionistMia 
Agreed. Really limiting stress has been key for me, in addition to medication and monitoring by my medical team. Also in developing countries (even plant based societies in Sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia), women can and do die of HG due to dehydration and inability to access health services. Removing meat from one’s diet is not a cure for severe morning sickness, the same way that meat is not the cause of morning sickness. It is much more complicated than that! Foroogh – NF Moderator 
Hi, I think this is great video and we can learn a lot from it and it is a subject for further research as I can understand from reading the comments different pregnancy has different issues associated with morning sickness. Vege-tater 
Interesting irony…though I never liked meat and liver gagged me, when I was pregnant I craved it nearly raw! Can make me gag now just thinking about it! I had wicked morning sickness early on and barely could hold anything down, but by the craving stage it was history. The following pregnancy was uneventful. Odd. DashnMe 
Ok, this one is way off for me. I was ill enough to be hospitalized with my first pregnancy. I was kept in for 2weeks on I’ve fluids no food the entire time and when I was released, I couldn’t eat enough hamburgers to satisfy me…and I had been a vegetarian for the previous 5 or more years!! The smell of coffee or even the smell of boiling water made me ill, the taste of water, eating lettuce made me violently ill…I hated how my taste buds changed but there it is. With my second child, I was no lo get a vegetarian but felt just as sick but managed to stay out of the hospital. And for me, it was a 24/7 illness not just morning. 
Lol, humans didn’t evolve. Keri Hanson 
Two pregnancies, two healthy sons, no morning sickness. I was vegan prior to my first, ate some chicken and fish at my Midwife’s advice during my first pregnancy, and are no meat my second. Jen 
Hello Dr. Greger – I don’t mean to be nit-picky, but its quite unclear to me (and I would guess others as well by the nature of the comments we are seeing) whether you are speaking about this subject as a hypothesis or a theory. A couple of times you stated “If this theory is true . . . “. 
As a scientist, you know that a “theory” is generally regarded as accepted fact due to a plethora of information sufficient to fully support it. A “hypothesis” is still questioned as fact and is still in the “accepting information as to its validity” stage. So I’m a little unclear as to how you are representing this set of information: as hypothesis or as theory? I think it has added to some confusion in the discussions below. 
My sense of it is that this is a hypothesis at this point but you are using the word “theory” loosely as many of us do. I wouldn’t make a point of it except that this is a fact-based site and we are seeing lots of diverse perspectives and some confusion. So I’m wondering if you could clarify for us. Love your work however! broccoli 
This is bogus info from Dr Greger under the disguise to be against meat eaters. Morning sickness has to do with hormone imbalance in pregnant women but has nothing to do with vomiting to expel meat “poisons” from the body as a “protective mechanism”. And the saturated fat theory is even more laughable. 
Even vegan pregnant women have morning sickness.",0
7942,WaPo Drums Up ’Labor Shortage’ in Push for More Foreign Workers,"The Washington Post is drumming up hysteria over an American labor shortage if the   foreign guest worker visa is limited by the Trump Administration, despite no evidence indicating a crunch. [In a piece chronicling a   worker in the U. S. on an   visa, the Post pleads for the expansion of the program, with language already in a   omnibus spending bill that would do the same.  The   visa brings more than 66, 000 foreign nationals to the U. S. for   nonagricultural jobs each year. The visa impacts the   and poor most in the hospitality industry, entertainment venues, retail, and restaurants. More than half a million jobs in the U. S. have been filled by   visa workers in the last five years. The open borders lobby and The Washington Post piece drums on about a labor shortage if any changes are made to the   visa: The country’s $25 billion dollar horse racing industry relies on a majority Hispanic immigrant workforce. Many, like Julio, are in the United States on visas, but others are here illegally, working at racetracks and barns throughout the country. But this year, fear and uncertainty have swept through the industry as the Trump administration has cracked down on immigration, increasing raids and deportations of undocumented immigrants and limiting visa programs. The policies could have a significant impact on the racing industry, and many employed in it. Without enough visas, horse trainers would face a labor shortage, which could force them to either hire more immigrants illegally or slow down their operations. Under an expansion of the   visa currently included in the omnibus spending bill, the number of   foreign workers entering the U. S. could increase by 20, 000. The lengthy, complicated process of the   visa, which is often riddled with fraud and abuse, is good business for immigration lawyers, as The Washington Post piece gleefully notes. Claims of labor shortage are regularly pushed by the mainstream media, the open borders lobby and big business interests whose profit margins can rise from insourcing jobs. In a recent report by Breitbart Texas, American unemployment rolls and stagnant, often decreased, wages for   workers in the U. S. indicate there is no such labor shortage, according to experts. “Despite such claims from industry groups —  other than employer anecdotes —  no credible data or labor market metrics have been presented by    groups or organizations —  let alone by disinterested academics —  proving the existence of labor shortages in   occupations that could justify a large expansion of the   program,” the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) wrote in a recent analysis report. There are 1. 37 million “missing workers” in the American labor force between the ages of 45 and   . These individuals are not included in the monthly unemployment rate, but if they were, the unemployment rate would be 5. 3 percent, according to EPI. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart Texas.

7943,Federal Jury Finds UVA Rape Hoax Journalist Sabrina Rubin Erdely And Rolling Stone Liable For Defamation,"A ten-person federal jury has found that Rolling Stone journalist Sabrina Rubin Erdely defamed University of Virginia dean Nicole Eramo with actual malice over a fraudulent college rape story. Rolling Stone and its parent company Wenner Media were also found to have defamed Eramo, who is seeking $7.5 million in damages, but to a lesser extent than the writer herself. Rubin Erdely’s piece conveyed that Eramo was indifferent and even callous towards the accuser, Jackie Coakley , in addition to discouraging her from reporting the “crime.” And so continues coverage of the rape hoax of the decade.
The controversy, which began with the publication of Rubin Erdely’s story in 2014, centered on a now debunked fraternity gang rape alleged by fabulist Coakley . Well before this week’s court decision, Rubin Erdely admitted to not bothering to contact the male UVA students accused of the act. These young men, via their Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, are suing separately for $25 million , a surprisingly low figure which makes Eramo’s claim look comparatively astronomical.
Sabrina Rubin Erdely, far left, arrives for court. Pictured on the right is the Deputy Managing Editor of Rolling Stone, Sean Woods, instrumental in the bogus story’s publication and who defended it later.
Because of Coakley’s limited financial position, and the respect even outed sexual assault frauds are given, Eramo is legally pursuing only Rubin Erdely, Rolling Stone , and Wenner Media for the $7.5 million. Nevertheless, Eramo’s attempts to portray herself as a victim are troubling. She was, after all, UVA’s go-to college administrator for handling “sexual violence” cases, a euphemism for the organizer of what are basically kangaroo courts.
Aside from Eramo, UVA President Teresa Sullivan’s actions were appalling. Giving basic credence to Jackie’s allegations, Sullivan suspended all Greek Life activities at the University of Virginia as publicity about the accusations grew. This only increased the suffering of the falsely maligned fraternity members, plus gave ammunition to the “rape culture” activists who ridiculously represent every young male on campus as a potential sexual abuser of women.
The true victims are the falsely accused young men, not Nicole Eramo Nicole Eramo is a “victim” of the same system she helps to prop up and defend: “rape culture.”
Nicole Eramo may have been defamed, but she was also intricately involved in a UVA system that does not afford young men even the most basic procedural rights. Whilst we should be happy that she did not rush into supporting Jackie Coakley’s lies to the extent of trying to eschew police involvement, we are still not dealing with either an admirable or upstanding individual.
After extensive research, I am yet to find instances of Eramo challenging the shameful treatment of college students accused of sexual assault, whether in specific instances or more broadly. She is neither a defender of these young men nor some kind of principled whistleblower. The only “positive” thing that can be generally said of her is that she is somewhat less prone to typical knee-jerk SJW reactions, i.e. she did try to get Jackie to talk to the police.
Again, Jackie Coakley has escaped any punishment Stupid does not even begin to describe the man who decided to marry rape hoaxer Jackie Coakley. Thanks to Chuck Johnson and www.gotnews.com for their work in outing Coakley as a fabulist and sociopath.
Jackie Coakley is the sociopathic architect of this whole mess. Notwithstanding that Rubin Erdely and others would have gleefully found another poster girl from somewhere else in America, the degree of malice and calculation in Coakley’s actions is the worst I have seen. Even the very terrible Crystal Mangum , the black stripper who is now serving a long sentence for homicide (not false rape allegations), made her bogus accusations of racism and being gang raped much more opportunistically, after Duke lacrosse players declined her services as a stripper. Coakley’s misdeeds, however, inhabit a world of their own.
Because women like Jackie Coakley, obsessed as they are with fantasy worlds and self-victimization, have next to no money to go after in defamation suits, they need to be charged and prosecuted for crimes such as public mischief. It obviously would be better if they were charged with making a false rape claim, yet Coakley had enough self-preserving foresight to avoid talking to the police. Consequently, the system usually gives next to no remedies for discouraging outright lies about rape. To boot, The Washington Post may have savaged Rubin Erdely and Rolling Stone , but it still refuses to publish Jackie Coakley’s full name, despite all the evidence completely disproving the rape accusations.
If Nicole Eramo gets $7.5 million, the accused male UVA students deserve $7.5+ billion Attention-seeker Emily Renda. She used Jackie Coakley’s lies to promote an agenda, not seek redress for a “victim.”
Determination of damages in the Nicole Eramo case is yet to take place and the $7.5 million claim may just have been posturing by her legal team, a high watermark figure designed to secure a smaller but nonetheless very tidy sum. At a minimum, the accused UVA students deserve 100 times more than whatever Eramo gets. Of course, Wenner Media’s coffers are nowhere near that big, but the principle remains. Compared to the mauled reputations of the witch-hunted fraternity members, Eramo suffered a slight pinprick from a broken system she has otherwise staked her career on supporting and expanding.
Other villains in this saga also need to be held to account. Chief among them is Emily Renda , a sociology major at UVA who is now completing a law degree at UC Berkeley. A “rape culture” extremist, she acted as the conduit between Coakley and Rubin Erdely. As Chuck Johnson and Got News have already demonstrated, Renda’s own “rape survivor” story has changed . Biased “journalists” such as Anna Merlan , formerly of Jezebel , additionally promoted the UVA hoax and were greatly upset when the gang rape was found not to have taken place. So many supporting actors created this mess.
Let’s hope that the heavy legal blows against Rubin Erdely, Rolling Stone , and, obliquely, Jackie Coakley’s lies continue with the UVA fraternity defamation suit. Only significant financial and legal hardship, not the pangs of conscience, will stop SJWs and their enablers from attempting to ruin the lives of innocent men.

7945,"As Dubai’s Skyline Adds a Trophy, the Architect Calls It Stolen - The New York Times","DUBAI, United Arab Emirates  —   Few cities on earth can compete with Dubai for sheer verticality. The pale sands of this once forgettable port alongside the emptiness of the Arabian desert have proved fertile ground for all manner of skyscrapers. They rise as if conjured by an obsession with Las Vegas and a jones for altitude. The Burj Khalifa, the tallest structure on the planet, reaches twice the height of the Empire State Building. Now, Dubai is about to gain another landmark. The Dubai Frame, set to open this year, is literally and figuratively a frame imposed on the overwhelming view  —   two parallel towers linked by an observation deck. It is a marker of how far the city has traveled, drawing the eye from the drab buildings of the old settlement along Dubai Creek to the riotous profusion of   skyscrapers stretching south to the Persian Gulf. It is a totem of Dubai’s ambitions. It may also be counterfeit. The   architect whose initial design inspired the structure, Fernando Donis, has accused the Dubai municipality of breaching his copyright in a lawsuit filed in December in United States federal court. Nine years ago, Mr. Donis won an international competition to design the building, besting more than 900 other entrants. Yet he was not included in the project’s execution and was not compensated for his intellectual property, his lawsuit claims. “It’s shocking,” Mr. Donis said. “The Frame is mine, and they don’t want to grant that it is mine. The infringement doesn’t just victimize me. They have taken something from all architects  —   the protection of our ideas. ” Raised as a monument to Dubai’s aspirations as a center of international commerce, the Frame is now a physical manifestation of the crude system that erected it. Dubai’s ruling   family has long pledged reforms aimed at bringing rule of law to a business realm often subject to the   edicts of officials. But the city’s entrenched system leaves outsiders vulnerable to mistreatment  —   from professionals sketching blueprints to construction workers laying foundations. Both tend to arrive for similar reasons, using Dubai as an opportunity to advance their fortunes. Professionals come hoping to make their names. Migrant workers descend from some of the poorest nations on earth  —   Nepal, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, the Philippines  —   seeking to support families at home. Both are prone to similar fates. Professionals can find themselves shortchanged and lacking redress in a system in which kinship can outweigh contract terms. Migrant workers frequently fall prey to shady recruiters proffering exaggerated wages. In crying foul, Mr. Donis joined other foreign professionals who have described a system in which proximity to power trumps the sanctity of law. In 2009, investors from the United States, Britain, Russia and elsewhere contended that they had been cheated by Al Fajer Properties, a developer founded by a sheikh who is part of the   family. One British investor, Moses Oye, said the developer used falsified pictures to raise $140 million, making it appear that apartments in a   development had already been completed though no construction had taken place. Calls for a probe by the Dubai government yielded no action, Mr. Oye said. “What do you do when the independent government agency trusted by the ruler of Dubai to regulate and monitor the real estate developer’s performance actually participates in a   operation that deprives investors of their rights?” Mr. Oye said. A spokesman for Al Fajer denied wrongdoing, adding that any blame should fall on a local sales agent. Two years ago, dozens of investors in the Palm Jebel Ali  —   a manufactured archipelago shaped like a palm tree, and planned to include villas, a water park and six marinas  —   took the extraordinary step of writing to Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid   pleading for clarity on the future of their holdings. The project is the work of Nakheel, now a   developer started by a sheikh who served as a key adviser to the ruling family. Construction began in 2002. But as real estate prices plunged after the global financial crisis of 2008, Nakheel halted work while hanging on to deposits reaching 50 percent of the villa prices. Nakheel said it began offering refunds in 2011, but investors complained that they were not being made whole. The company maintains that it has “ ” plans to complete the project. A Nakheel spokesman did not respond to questions. Among migrant workers in Dubai, tales of mistreatment are legion. As a parade of workers returned to their dormitories from prayers at a nearby mosque on a recent afternoon, some complained that they receive less than what is due. Most are in debt to recruitment agents who arranged their jobs. The agents typically retain their passports, workers say. When things go awry, workers sometimes find themselves caught  —   unable to switch jobs, and unable to go home. One such worker is S. Ramesh, who arrived here last summer from India thinking he had found a way to support his family and who now worries he may never see his family again. On a recent morning, he stood outside a dormitory that houses workers constructing the Frame, begging for help. The United Arab Emirates, the federation that includes Dubai, has responded to such experiences with reforms for workers at both ends of the economic spectrum. The federation has strengthened contract law while protecting minority shareholders. It has made it permissible for migrant workers to switch jobs while outlawing payments to recruitment firms. But the niceties of the law contrast with the daily realities of the marketplace. Dubai’s economy is dominated by developers that function like arms of the government and have relationships with the   family. “The ruler is earnest about it and recognizes the need for rule of law to continue to attract foreign investment and tourism,” said Christopher M. Davidson, a political scientist at Durham University in northern England, and an expert on the United Arab Emirates. “But in practice, you’ve got these layers of management below him that cut corners, give jobs to cronies and family members, and take bribes. That’s been a problem that has plagued Dubai. ” The lawsuit Mr. Donis filed seeks unspecified compensation for damages and a ruling that his copyright was breached. The Dubai municipality has “taken the Dubai Frame as its own without paying or crediting the person who created it,” said Edward Klaris, a New   lawyer representing the architect. (Mr. Klaris is married to Robin Pogrebin, a writer for The New York Times.) “This is an egregious infringement of international copyright and a sad case of sovereign bullying that deserves to be corrected. ” The Dubai municipality did not respond to questions. In correspondence with Mr. Donis reviewed by The New York Times, the Dubai government dismissed his complaints, noting that he received a $100, 000 prize for winning the competition. City officials maintain Mr. Donis lacked local licenses needed to execute the project. Dubai is not the only place where architects decry stolen ideas. In China, where anything of value is susceptible to counterfeits, there has been a boom in replicas of landmark foreign buildings, from the Eiffel Tower to Tower Bridge. A copy of a famous modern development in Beijing, Wangjing Soho, by the  British architect Zaha Hadid, who died last year, even popped up in the southwestern Chinese city of Chongqing. “Architecture is a field where intellectual property has been extended protection in the more recent past,” said James Conley, an expert on the history of copyright at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. “Monarchy states play the game by their own rules. ” So much has changed here since the 1960s, when this smuggler’s paradise was home to only 40, 000 people and barely had electricity. In the decades since, Dubai has exploded into a modern metropolis of 2. 7 million, a global transportation hub, a regional financial center and a popular tourist destination. Yet beneath the surface, much remains the same. In Bur Dubai, the oldest part of the city, young men patrol the outskirts of a bazaar, wooing shoppers with promises of cheap copies of Rolex watches, Gucci handbags and Louis Vuitton luggage. “Real, genuine fakes,” one said. Three miles away, inside the gates of Za’abeel Park, scores of laborers apply a patina of gold to the sides of Mr. Donis’s creation. “They simply wanted to take the project and eliminate my name,” he said. From the observation tower atop the Frame, Dubai is supposed to shimmer with modernity. Lost in the haze are the   dormitories honeycombed with   rooms that house migrant workers. They are the inconspicuous force behind Dubai’s staggering development. Some eight million migrants reside in the United Arab Emirates, according to the United Nations, or roughly 84 percent of the population  —   the largest concentration on earth. Like every shiny structure in a city defined by them, the Frame depends on this influx for its existence. Kauser Sorker, 31, a laborer from Bangladesh, works at the Frame, erecting scaffolding. He earns 850 dirham a month (about $231)  —   enough to send money home to his wife and    daughter, but not enough to see a different life ahead of them. “The company makes the promised payments,” he said, “but it’s not much. ” On a recent trip home to visit his family, his daughter treated him like a stranger. Here in Dubai, loneliness tears at him. “I am always thinking about my family,” he said. And yet the Frame workers are comparatively fortunate. Outside Mr. Sorker’s dormitory in the al Quoz industrial area, S. Ramesh stands on the cracked sidewalk, beseeching   for rescue. Mr. Ramesh, who like many Indians uses a single initial, comes from outside the city of Hyderabad. He and his wife and their two children grew okra, corn and tomatoes, subsisting on less than $2, 000 a year. When the monsoon rains failed to arrive last June, their crops vanished into dust. They went to a Hindu temple and made an offering. A staffing agency offered to secure him a construction job in Dubai, promising he would earn more than $500 a month. Mr. Ramesh had to hand over two months of his future salary to cover the cost of arranging his contract, his air travel and his visa. His wife sold her wedding jewelry. When he arrived in Dubai, he was taken to a squat dormitory block on a street reeking of raw sewage. The next morning, the agent drove him to a   building. He would not be doing construction, but rather cleaning apartments. From 5 in the morning until 7 at night, Mr. Ramesh vacuumed, dusted and scrubbed, he said, stopping only for a   lunch break. Then he walked back to the dorm through the blistering Arabian heat, past an indoor ski area complete with   snow. Four months after arriving, he had yet to be paid, he said. The agent tells him that his visa has proved more expensive than expected. Mr. Ramesh cleans the rooms of other migrant workers in exchange for minutes on their phones to call his wife in India. She sobs and tells him to come home. But the agent has his passport and has refused to refund his recruitment fee, he said. He has no money for a plane ticket. “There is a huge dependence on migrant workers who have employment terms that are no different than indentured servitude,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch, an advocacy group that has documented abuses of migrant workers in the neighboring emirate of Abu Dhabi. “This is a system that’s put in place to entrap workers. ” The view engineered by Mr. Donis, the architect, crops out such everyday tragedies, spotlighting a futuristic tangle of glass and steel. Mr. Ramesh is beyond that frame. “This is my destiny,” he said. “I’m stuck. ” For Mr. Donis, Dubai was supposed to be the place for his solo debut. For eight years, he labored alongside a glittering star, the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas. Mr. Donis handled the design for the CCTV tower headquarters in Beijing, an oddly angular structure that has gained international acclaim. He designed a new airport for Jedda, Saudi Arabia, but it was never built. Ditto an office building in Dubai. The competition, in 2008, beckoned as an invitation to create something prominent  —   “an iconic tall emblem structure that contributes to the new face of Dubai,” according to the rules. The municipality set a goal of attracting two million tourists a year to the site. The contest was overseen by ThyssenKrupp Elevator, a German industrial giant. It was governed by the rules of the International Union of Architects, an organization affiliated with Unesco that lays down a code of conduct for professionals.   competitions had produced designs for the Sydney Opera House in Australia and the Pompidou Center in Paris. Mr. Donis, 44, had already spent enough time in Dubai to be struck by its audacity. “It’s incredible that a city can just be raised from scratch in such a short time,” he said. Unlike neighboring Abu Dhabi, which is rich in oil, Dubai has little of that precious commodity. City leaders folded the proceeds from what oil they had into infrastructure, making Dubai a major shipbuilder and container port. Then, they turned it into one of the busiest air hubs on earth, a gateway connecting Asia to Europe and North America. Successive waves of real estate development have constructed an empire of luxury   apartments and resorts centered on hedonistic pursuits. Today, Dubai is a city where one can sit in a   dining room atop a   hotel and dine on truffles and caviar while gazing at beachfront villas set on an island shaped like a palm tree. “I was very critical of the architecture,” Mr. Donis said. “I thought, you could propose something else, something more serious. ” He sketched a slender, unadorned frame, a concept he had written about at length in his graduate studies. City leaders declared him the winner. They flew him to Dubai and honored him with a celebration dinner at the Raffles Hotel. He presented his vision to the crown prince. The contest rules endowed him with legal ownership of his idea: “The author of the preliminary design placed first will keep his copyright and his work may only be used by the Dubai Municipality when he has signed the corresponding contract. ” Yet almost as soon as contract negotiations commenced in June 2009, municipal officials signaled their intent to force Mr. Donis to transfer the copyright, according to hundreds of pages of correspondence reviewed by The Times. They haggled over fees. The municipality threatened to give the job to a local firm, according to the documents reviewed by The Times. Mr. Donis repeatedly lowered his demands for compensation while holding fast to the one thing he valued most  —   his copyright. But the municipality insisted on gaining the copyright, Mr. Donis said. It cited rules requiring that architects working in Dubai maintain a local registered office, meaning he could serve only as a consultant. In May 2011, Mr. Donis received an alarming email from Roxy Binno, an expert in the urban design and planning department of the Dubai municipality. His copyright covered only the “conceptual design,” the letter declared, whereas the municipality “owns the project now,” ostensibly meaning it had the authority to proceed absent a contract. Mr. Binno did not respond to repeated calls and emails posing questions. Mr. Donis raised the specter of legal action. He sought aid from ThyssenKrupp. He wrote a complaint to the International Union of Architects, addressing his letter to the   of the union’s competition division, Tomaz Kancler. In an email to The New York Times sent in response to questions, Mr. Kancler said he and the union confronted Dubai officials with concerns that Mr. Donis was being unfairly excluded. “We realized the deviations from the rules,” Mr. Kancler wrote. The pressure produced an invitation for Mr. Donis to visit Dubai. There, the architect recalled, municipal officials assured him that a contract would soon be readied enabling him to keep the copyright. But when the proposed contract arrived, it offered only an advisory role. He had to hand over his copyright. He would be barred from promoting his work. The municipality could terminate the contract at any point. “It’s like you have no contract,” Mr. Donis said. He tried to negotiate further, but Dubai officials stopped responding. Construction began. In October 2012, he received a letter from Ramón Sotomayor, chief executive at the time for southern Europe, Africa and the Middle East for ThyssenKrupp Elevator. The issue Mr. Donis had been complaining about amounted to “a commercial disagreement,” Mr. Sotomayor wrote in the letter, which was reviewed by The Times. “ThyssenKrupp does not have any possibility to interfere. ” Mr. Donis ultimately named ThyssenKrupp a   in his lawsuit. A ThyssenKrupp spokesman said the suit “has no basis at all,” because the company “had no role in the decision awarding the architecture contract for the Dubai Frame,” adding, “We will defend our position in court vigorously. ” Late in 2013, Mr. Donis was aghast to find photos on the web showing that the Frame had been transformed into a literal picture frame adorned with gold leaf  —   a departure from his stark, unornamented conception. He wrote one last time to the Dubai director general: “If the images published indeed show what seems to be the updated building design, the Dubai Frame  —   and I say this with the highest respect  —   will be far from becoming a masterpiece. ” These days, Mr. Donis works in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, more than 4, 000 miles away from Dubai. He catches glimpses of his creation via occasional news articles on the web. “It looks fantastic over all,” he said. “But they stole it. ”",0

7947,National Biotechnology Panel Faces New Conflict of Interest Questions - The New York Times,"The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine are assigned by Congress to provide policy guidance to the government. The group describes itself as “advisers to the nation. ” The advice often comes through written reports from scientific committees organized by the group. One of those committees, though, is facing questions about how its members were selected. The concerns focus on a panel studying biotechnology, a booming area of business, including in the food industry, and one of the most contentious scientific issues in Washington. Critics say that several committee members have financial ties to biotech businesses that could color the panel’s report, expected to be published soon, potentially giving short shrift to health and environmental worries. By the academies’ own account, two of the scientists already violate the group’s extensive    policy. In addition, an employee at the academies who helped pick the scientists to serve on the panel was pursuing a different job while he put together his recommendations for the group. Three of the 13 people he recommended  —   all of whom were eventually selected for the panel  —   were board members at his new employer, a new biotechnology nonprofit. The criticism adds to the heated debate about how federal regulators are handling the fast development of biotechnology. The National Academies play an outsize role in the debate because of their stature in the academic community and connections to the federal government. A separate study the organization did on genetic engineering in agriculture, published in May, also came under intense criticism from environmentalists. The National Academies have defended the panel that produced the May report, as well as the current panel on biotechnology, saying that the type of expertise needed to staff them is limited and thus some conflict must be tolerated. But people with ties to the academies say any perceived conflicts of interest may undermine some of the group’s authority. “There’s often a lot riding on what the academies say, and so their ability to act with objectivity and independence defines any value they have,” said Dr. Harvey Fineberg, a former leader of what is now the medical division of the National Academies. The most recent committee convened to study biotechnology was formed this year at the behest of the White House. The group was asked to predict what new technologies might arise over the next 15 years and advise the government on how to oversee them. The regulation for the industry was last updated in 1992, years before the first approval of genetically engineered seeds, which are now widely used by farmers. Like the 200 or so other reports published by the National Academies each year, the biotechnology report is undergoing peer review, the   process regularly used by academic journals. The report could have broad implications for the industry. Big food companies like   and Archer Daniels Midland, for instance, have invested in synthetic biology, a term used for the more sophisticated genetic engineering now coming into use that was the panel’s area of study. Food companies are exploring its use in creating flavorings and sweeteners. When the National Academies announced the committee this year, they disclosed that two of the group’s 13 scientists had ties to the biotech industry that violated the organization’s    policy. Such disclosures are rare for the academies, said William Kearney, a spokesman for the organization, but scientists with conflicts are sometimes allowed to work on a committee when the academies think the scientist has a specialty or knowledge that cannot be found elsewhere. Mr. Kearney would not, however, provide data on how frequently the academies have to disclose such conflicts, saying only that they are “rare. ” The two scientists with conflicts are Dr. Steven Evans, a scientist at Dow AgroSciences, a major biotechnology company, and Jeffrey Wolt, a professor at Iowa State University, who the academies said has investments in a company that could benefit from the study’s results. The academies noted their conflicts when the panel members were announced. Dr. Evans and Professor Wolt referred questions about their role to Mr. Kearney. Mr. Kearney said the disclosed conflicts of interest were discovered during the usual vetting of panel members by the academies. The academies kept the scientists on the panel, he said, because they could not find anyone with the same expertise. But more than three dozen environmental and health advocates argue that the National Academies also allowed several other scientists with potential financial conflicts onto the panel without any disclosures. “Several members of this committee stand to benefit directly or indirectly from the rules and regulations their recommendations will help shape,” said Tim Schwab, a food researcher at Food  Water Watch, an advocacy group leading the group of critics. “Nor does the committee include anyone who might advocate a more judicious approach to regulating the industry. ” The group made note of Farren Isaacs, an assistant professor at Yale. Professor Isaacs is a founder of enEvolv, a   that engineers tiny organisms “to produce   chemicals. ” DuPont, which has major investments in biotech, has funded Dr. Isaacs’s research, and he holds two patents that could be used in synthetic biology. Professor Isaacs referred questions to Mr. Kearney. Mr. Kearney said all conflicts that violate the academies’    policy had been disclosed when the panel was announced. Professor Isaacs, he said, did not have a conflict that required disclosure because his company’s technologies are not now being used in biotech. “The term ‘conflict of interest’ applies only to current interests, not prospective ones,” Mr. Kearney said. He said the same about similar questions raised about other members of the committee by the group of critics. (One panel member resigned: Richard Johnson, a former partner at Arnold  Porter, a law firm that counts many biotech companies as clients. Mr. Kearney attributed the decision to scheduling conflicts.) The job of finding the scientists to fill the 13 open spots on the biotech committee largely fell to Douglas Friedman, the “responsible staff officer,” or study director. Such employees help the academies identify scientists to serve on a study’s panel, set the agenda for their meetings and oversee the production of the final report, among other tasks. But while Mr. Friedman, who has degrees in chemistry and chemical biology, was putting together his recommendations, he was also applying for a leadership job in the biotech world. In January, Mr. Friedman widely distributed an email seeking nominations for the panel. The email was one of many digital records about Mr. Friedman and the panel that were discovered by Food  Water Watch. The group found the records, including the emails and spreadsheets, through Google searches of the panel’s members and shared them with The New York Times, which repeated the search and also found the documents. The records have since been removed from the websites where they had been cached. One recipient of the email was the Engineering Biology Research Consortium, a nonprofit dedicated to fostering and advancing synthetic biology research. According to the digital records discovered online, Mr. Friedman was firmly on the nonprofit’s radar as a possible leader by the time he began his search for members for the National Academies panel. Ginni Ursin, a Monsanto executive on the nonprofit’s board, commented on a spreadsheet dated December 2015 that Mr. Friedman was the “top candidate by a decent margin. ” The 13 scientists Mr. Friedman recommended to his superiors at the National Academies  —   including three members of the nonprofit’s board  —   were all ultimately approved, he said. The panel was appointed in April, and in July, Mr. Friedman started as the new executive director of the Engineering Biology Research Consortium. In a phone interview, he said that he pursued the new job while helping to put the panel together but did not see any reason to tell the academies about the job search. He said he was only one of many layers in the process of appointing members to the biotech panel. And he said it was a coincidence that so many committee members also have roles at the nonprofit. “It’s a relatively small community of people involved in the biotech space,” he said. But Mr. Kearney of the National Academies said Mr. Friedman should not have played the role he did in the selection of the committee in the midst of a job search he did not disclose. The National Academies, he said, are reviewing the selection process, including the oversight of the staff members who oversee it. “No staff member,” he said, “should be participating in the appointment of a committee with members who are also on the board of an organization with which he or she is negotiating employment. ”",0
7948,"Tony Romo Retires From N.F.L. and Heads to CBS, Replacing Simms - The New York Times","No one has passed for more yardage or more touchdowns in a Dallas Cowboys uniform than Tony Romo. Not Troy Aikman, Roger Staubach, Danny White or Don Meredith. But Romo has apparently completed his last pass for the team. After losing his starting job last season, he is retiring as a player to become the lead football analyst for CBS Sports, replacing Phil Simms. CBS announced the hiring on Tuesday and said that Romo would join the    man Jim Nantz and the sideline reporter Tracy Wolfson on the lead announcing team. “We know Tony will quickly develop into a terrific analyst,” the news release said. On Tuesday afternoon, Romo posted on Twitter a photograph of himself in a CBS blazer with the message, “I guess it’s time to start dressing up. ” CBS’s announcement acknowledged Simms, who has been its lead N. F. L. analyst for 20 years. “We are discussing with Phil his future role with CBS Sports,” it said. Romo played for the Cowboys for 13 seasons and compiled a   record as a starter, but, unlike Aikman and Staubach, he never won a Super Bowl. In fact, he was never on a team that produced a decent playoff run, going   in his career. As a result, he will probably always sit just below the top quarterbacks in the Cowboys pantheon. But playoff failures are not the reason the Cowboys cut him. They had plenty of other reasons. Chief among them was the emergence of Dak Prescott, the rookie who stepped in last season when Romo was injured and put up huge numbers for the   Cowboys. Romo will be 37 at the start of next season, and he has struggled to stay on the field of late, managing only four games in 2015 and only four passes in 2016. After missing the first 10 weeks of last season with a back injury, he returned, but Prescott had been so impressive that Romo did not get his job back. Nonetheless, there were some suitors who had hoped to get something out of Romo’s twilight years. Romo was a   Pro Bowl selection and could have provided veteran leadership to a young team or been the final piece of the puzzle for a team close to the top prize. Most of the speculation recently centered on the Broncos and the Texans. Denver, which struggled with Trevor Siemian last season, and Houston, whose   signing of Brock Osweiler was a bust, will now have to look elsewhere. Still, Romo has been good enough recently enough that some wondered if he would return, if the offer was right. Starting quarterbacks get injured, and teams have been known to have midseason quarterback crises. Veteran players are also known to have second thoughts about retirement  —   ask Brett Favre. Romo has certainly been the most   player in this   linked with a dozen or more teams at one time or another. The Browns, the Redskins, the Chiefs, the Jets and the 49ers were all linked with him. It seemed likely that there would be a job for him somewhere. Instead, he retires ranked 21st in career passing touchdowns, with 248, sandwiched between the standouts Drew Bledsoe and Boomer Esiason. But like them, he will be remembered for never winning a Super Bowl as a starter. Romo played college football at Eastern Illinois. In a year in which quarterbacks Carson Palmer, Byron Leftwich, Kyle Boller and Rex Grossman were all taken in the first round of the draft, Romo was bypassed by every team through all seven rounds in 2003. The Cowboys signed him to a   contract, and he sat on the bench for three years behind Quincy Carter, Vinny Testaverde and Drew Bledsoe before finally taking over as starter in 2006. His elevation led to a reversal of fortune for the Cowboys. They had made the playoffs just once in the previous six seasons. Under Romo, they made it in three of four years, including in   and   seasons. But they won just one playoff game. After a fallow period, Romo had a last hurrah in 2014, making the Pro Bowl and leading the Cowboys to a   record. But the team tripped up in the playoffs again, losing to the Packers in the divisional round.",0
7949,Report: Trump Commands State Department to Slash UN Funding in Half,"President Donald Trump has instructed the State Department to slash its $10 billion budget for funding United Nations programs by as much as 50 percent, Foreign Policy is reporting. [The article said the move is “signaling an unprecedented retreat by [the] administration from international operations that keep the peace, provide vaccines for children, monitor rogue nuclear weapons programs, and promote peace talks from Syria to Yemen. ”  FP used three unnamed sources for its report, which also called Trump’s directive “draconian measures” taken ahead of the planned release on Thursday of his 2018 federal budget proposal. The budget “is expected to include cuts of up to 37 percent for spending on the State Department, the U. S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and other foreign assistance programs, including the U. N. in next year’s budget,” according to the report, which went on: It remains unclear whether the full extent of the steeper U. N. cuts will be reflected in the 2018 budget, which will be prepared by the White House Office of Management and Budget, or whether, as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has proposed, the cuts would be phased in over the coming three years. One official close to the Trump administration said Tillerson has been given flexibility to decide how the cuts would be distributed. Richard Gowan, a U. N. expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told FP these budget cuts would create “chaos. ” The U. N. refugee agency (UNHCR) for example, received nearly 40 percent of its budget from the United States in 2016. Cutting the U. S. contribution would “leave a gaping hole that other big donors would struggle to fill,” according to Gowan. The   FP cites Trump’s intention to cut diplomacy and foreign assistance programs will help him increase the funding for the U. S. military by $54 billion, a “shift” from the Obama administration’s approach to the federal budget. “State Department officials, for instance, were told that they should try to identify up to $1 billion in cuts in the U. N. peacekeeping budget, according to one source,” FP reported. “The United States provides about $2. 5 billion per year to fund peacekeepers. ” Nikki Haley, the U. S. ambassador to the United Nations, cautioned against “   cuts” during her Senate confirmation hearing but is said to be reviewing the U. N.’s 16 peacekeeping missions for possible cuts. The United States pays over 22 percent of the U. N.’s $2. 5 billion yearly administrative budget, including money “to battle climate change. ” FP reported that “U. N. diplomats and foreign dignitaries say they expect the United States to seek to eliminate funding for some agencies unpopular with conservatives  —   including the U. N. Population Fund, which receives about $35 million a year from the United States for family planning programs, and the U. N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. ” Also, “the U. N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) which provides aid to Palestinian refugees, has long been the target of Israeli and congressional criticism on the grounds that it has a   bias. According to the FP report: But one diplomat said UNRWA might be spared because it relieves Israel of the obligation to care for some Palestinians and because Israel sees the program as ultimately promoting stability. The United States has broad discretion to cut voluntary funds to humanitarian agencies, including the World Food Programme and UNICEF. But those programs are popular among Democrats and Republicans, and any move to slash funding could undermine Washington’s case for leading those agencies. In the early days of his administration, Trump reinstated the “Mexico City Policy,” a policy first instituted by President Ronald Reagan and continued by Republican presidents since. The policy prohibits funding international NGOs and other entities that provide or promote abortion around the globe. “Anticipating cuts to family planning programs, Dutch Development Minister Lilianne Ploumen recently established a fund to solicit contributions to institutions that have faced a cutoff of U. S. assistance because they perform abortions,” FP reported. FP also reported that if the U. S. “fails to honor its funding commitments to the U. N.’s regular budget, which is obligatory, it could lose its voting rights in the General Assembly. ”",0

Minnesota’s governor called for a federal investigation into the police shooting of a black man, Philando Castile, during a traffic stop. Mr. Castile’s girlfriend, above, streamed the aftermath live on Facebook, immersing viewers in the grisly scene, below. It has been replayed more than four million times. With a composure periodically fractured by wailing, she described an officer shooting at least four times after Mr. Castile began complying with a request to produce his registration  —   and alerted the officer that he had a licensed gun. An emotional President Obama said “all Americans should be troubled” by the shootings caught on video this week in Minnesota and Louisiana. _____ 2. A House panel questioned the F. B. I. director, James Comey, for nearly four hours about the bureau’s decision not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. Under strong Republican pressure, Mr. Comey reiterated that while Mrs. Clinton’s use of a personal email network as secretary of state showed “great carelessness,” it did not meet the bar for criminality. But he also said a series of her statements were untrue. Those included her assertions that none of the emails were marked classified and that she had turned over all   emails. _____ 3. Donald Trump held a series of meetings with congressional Republicans that turned rocky. A spokesman for Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska said the meeting had not persuaded him to endorse Mr. Trump, calling the election “a Dumpster fire. ” Mr. Trump also raised a new wave of anxiety about his motives and temperament, hedging when asked about speculation that he might win the presidency but decline to serve. “I’ll let you know how I feel about it after it happens,” he told our reporter. _____ 4. Democrats are seeking to leverage Mr. Trump’s unpopularity among broad sectors of voters in other November elections.

7953,TRUMP CUTS OFF FUNDRAISING EVENTS FOR REPUBLICAN PARTY,"Email 

Donald Trump’s campaign has ended fundraising events meant to support the Republican Party’s get-out-the-vote efforts in next month’s elections. 
Aides to the Republican nominee told Fox News that Trump Victory, the joint fundraising committee for the GOP and the campaign, held its most recent fundraiser on Oct. 19 and no more such events were scheduled. 
The move, which was first reported by The Washington Post, cuts off a key money source for Republicans hoping to keep hold of both houses of Congress. 
“We’ve kind of wound down,” Trump national finance chairman Steven Mnuchin told the Post. “But the online fundraising continues to be strong.” 
By contrast, the Post reported that Democrat Hillary Clinton’s campaign has scheduled 41 fundraising events between now and Nov. 4. The former secretary of state was scheduled to make her last personal fundraising appearance Tuesday in Miami. 
Mnuchin told the paper that the real estate mogul was focusing on making his final pitch to the voters at a campaign events rather than raising money in the final two weeks of the race. 
“We have minimized his fundraising schedule over the last month to emphasize his focus on political [events],” Mnuchin said of the candidate. “Unlike Hillary, who has been fundraising and not out and about, he has constantly been out and about.” 
According to the Post, the Republican National Committee had collected $40 million through Trump Victory as of Sept. 30. 
RNC spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the organization “[continues] to fundraise for the entire GOP ticket.” 
Meanwhile, Politico reported Tuesday that the Senate Leadership Fund, a Super PAC with ties to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was putting $25 million into seven Senate races deemed crucial in determining the balance of power on Capitol hill.",0
7954,FBI Wiretapped Corruption Suspect Discussing Clinton Deals,"FBI Wiretapped Corruption Suspect Discussing Clinton Deals November 3, 2016 Daniel Greenfield 
If you're wondering why Team Hillary panicked and unleashed hell on the FBI, this may be another ingredient in the stew. The Wall Street Journal article is clearly trying to spin things to the left and damage the credibility of the FBI, but it's an interesting data point . 
The FBI had secretly recorded conversations of a suspect in a public-corruption case talking about alleged deals the Clintons made, these people said. The agents listening to the recordings couldn’t tell from the conversations if what the suspect was describing was accurate, but it was, they thought, worth checking out. 
Prosecutors thought the talk was hearsay and a weak basis to warrant aggressive tactics, like presenting evidence to a grand jury, because the person who was secretly recorded wasn’t inside the Clinton Foundation. 
FBI investigators grew increasingly frustrated with resistance from the corruption prosecutors, and some executives at the bureau itself, to keep pursuing the case. 
As prosecutors rebuffed their requests to proceed more overtly, those Justice Department officials became more annoyed that the investigators didn’t seem to understand or care about the instructions issued by their own bosses and prosecutors to act discreetly. 
In short, FBI people had material for a case that the government didn't want brought because Team Obama were Hillary backers and the senior leadership in the DOJ saw their careers linked to the rise of Hillary. And so a stand down order was handed down. 
Following the February meeting, officials at Justice Department headquarters sent a message to all the offices involved to “stand down,’’ a person familiar with the matter said. 
This is what happens when the DOJ has been so thoroughly corrupted from the top down. 
Meanwhile there's little doubt, considering what we already know, that the DOJ people had been updating Hillary's people on the FBI investigation. Should those emails come out, they will be some of the most damning of all. And so Hillary's people panicked and decided to pull the trigger.",0
7955,$70 Million Awarded to Woman with Ovarian Cancer Due to Baby Powder Usage,"Associated Press 
Excerpts: 
A St. Louis jury on Thursday awarded a California woman more than $70 million in her lawsuit alleging that years of using Johnson & Johnson’s baby powder caused her cancer, the latest case raising concerns about the health ramifications of extended talcum powder use. 
The jury ruling ended the trial that began Sept. 26 in the case brought by Deborah Giannecchini of Modesto. She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2012. The suit accused Johnson & Johnson of “negligent conduct” in making and marketing its baby powder. 
“We are pleased the jury did the right thing. They once again reaffirmed the need for Johnson & Johnson to warn the public of the ovarian cancer risk associated with its product,” Jim Onder, an attorney for the plaintiff, told The Associated Press.",0
7956,"‘The Crown’ Episodes 1 and 2: Stiff Lips, Warm Heart - The New York Times","This recap discusses events in detail from the first two episodes of Netflix’s “The Crown. ”  As we saw from the success of “Downton Abbey,” the reassuring rigidities of the British class system can do wonders for angsty Americans. If you’re grossed out by the utter charmlessness and moral squalor of a year’s worth of debased political   a perfect antidote is “The Crown,” Netflix’s compulsively watchable dramatization of the life of Queen Elizabeth II, served up on a silver platter by dramatist Peter Morgan (“The Queen”) and the director and producer Stephen Daldry (“The Audience”). Instead of sitting with an ice pack on your head and listening to John King yakking on CNN about red and blue paths to victory, revel in John Lithgow’s droll old war horse, Winston Churchill, as he makes his imperial progress up the aisle at Westminster Abbey. Notice how augustly the patriotic hero takes his seat in a pew next to his sanely amused,   wife, Clemmie, at the wedding of the young Princess Elizabeth to Lt. Philip Mountbatten of the Royal Navy, formerly the Prince of Greece and Denmark and newly the Duke of Edinburgh, Earl of Merioneth and Baron Greenwich of Greenwich. Instead of ranting about the leaking and the belching and defaming of email leaks and social media, experience the private courage  —   the crushing, unexpressed pain  —   of the    King George VI, played with quiet depth and range by Jared Harris (best known as the tormented Lane Pryce in “Mad Men”). Shudder as he begins to realize that his   cough is a death sentence hidden from him by his own doctors and struggles with what that will mean for the British constitution and his own beloved family. The marvel of both Mr. Harris’s performance and Mr. Morgan’s versatile script is how much unspoken emotion is communicated to the audience. One of the most memorable scenes from the opening episodes is the king’s private conversation on a   excursion at Sandringham, the royals’ Norfolk estate, with his young    Prince Philip. Without ever hinting that his own health is failing, the king tries to explain to Philip in the gathering mist the burden of duty that awaits him now that he is married to the young woman who will be queen. “She is the job,” he tells a quizzical Philip with the intensity of impending death. “Loving her. Protecting her. ” And  her  —   Her Royal Highness  —   is the most refreshing moral counterpoint of all. Claire Foy’s young Elizabeth is luminously ordinary. In the first two episodes, Mr. Daldry achieves something unusual: He tells the story of Elizabeth II through the prism of being unprepared. Her character is formed by being forced to rise to an occasion. We see hints of her grounded certainties in her instant attraction to Philip. She wants this dazzlingly alpha young naval officer, who mocks the pomp of royal ceremony while always knowing how to observe it. No amount of family disapproval deters her. When the king, knowing he is too sick to undertake a monthslong commonwealth tour, asks her if she, a young mother of two, will take his place, she unhesitatingly agrees, despite Philip’s resistance to abandoning his own promising naval career. And what about the children? “They’re too young to notice,” she says firmly, a line that signifies her first acceptance of a lifetime’s distancing between her own desires and the needs of her country, along with the collateral damage that will inevitably follow. (I think of the famously poignant moment when the    Prince Charles greeted his mother after a   absence on a royal tour in 1953, not with a hug but a grave, extended handshake.) As Philip, Matt Smith (an erstwhile Doctor of “Doctor Who”) has great chemistry with Ms. Foy’s Elizabeth. He has just the right combination of rippling impatience and dangerous, masculine   for a consort whose loyalty is laced with a sometimes heedless power to cause her pain. The real triumph of the first two episodes of “The Crown” is the unerring emotional focus of Mr. Daldry, the director. He finds the heart in every scene and takes us into the interior world of people so famous and so familiar they have drained into stereotypes and gesture. He makes us care so much I winced every time the king dragged deeply on one of the lethal cigarettes to which he was addicted. In short, he discovers the royal family’s humanity. Anyone who has seen Mr. Daldry’s theatrical tour de force “Billy Elliot” or his flying fleet of Mary Poppinses at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics might expect the visual audacity he brings to his stage productions. And “The Crown” has plenty of that, from the jarring opening image of a toilet bowl flushing blood from the king’s diseased lungs to the soaring, saturated scenes in Westminster Abbey as the packed congregation sings “I Vow to Thee My Country” over a thundering organ. (Netflix’s    budget is, as they say, all up on the screen.) But Sam Spiegel once told me that the biggest challenge in making “Lawrence of Arabia” was “to not let the sand overwhelm the movie. ” Mr. Daldry could have let pageantry overwhelm “The Crown,” or allowed it to slide into costume drama. He avoids the sentimental clichés. When the young queen, far away with Philip in Kenya on the royal tour at the idyllic wildlife retreat Treetops, is brought the news that the king has died, Mr. Daldry does not give us her reaction. We see her as her aides would  —   at a distance, held in Philip’s embrace on the lawn. Nor do we see the grief of the dead king’s wife, suddenly the queen mother. Instead Mr. Daldry shows a household suddenly in motion as the news sweeps through Sandringham  —   first the shock, then the running, running through the corridors, the queen mother still in her nightdress, everyone running toward the death chamber except the queen’s younger sister, Princess Margaret, who stands in a stricken eddy of silence, her grief  : not only for the loss of her father, the king, but for fear she will also have to say goodbye to his closest aide, the married group captain Peter Townsend, with whom she has fallen hopelessly in love. It’s fair to say that, so far at least, “The Crown” is not a work of political or social history. It’s family history, and it’s a love story  —   more precisely, a series of overlapping love stories: between a father and a daughter, between a princess headed for greatness and her dashing prince, between another princess headed for heartbreak and her forbidden swain, and between a royal household and an adoring public. It shows us that public as the royals see it  —   again distantly, from palace balconies or through the windows of limousines and planes and luxuriously outfitted steam trains rushing through the peaceful beauty of the British countryside. Beyond the manicured gardens and immaculate driveways that surround the royals, and as invisible to us as it was to them, is a postwar Britain of drab,   streets and pale, exhausted Londoners clutching their ration books. If all goes as intended, these two enthralling episodes will be the opening chapters of an epic that promises to occupy viewers into the 2020s. “The Crown” has already been approved for two seasons of 10 episodes each. The plan is for each season to cover a decade in the life of the queen and her realm, with casts that change as the central characters age. My hope is that the show’s canvas will open up and out into the world as Elizabeth’s emerging   composure and moral clarity are tested by family and country into the 1960s and beyond, right through what is now the seventh decade of an extraordinary and still vibrant reign.",0
7957,Shannon Watts: ’Gun Lobby’ Uses Word ’Suppressor’ to Confuse Us,"Gun control proponent Shannon Watts, founder of the Michael   Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, claims the “gun lobby” is using the term “suppressor” instead of “silencer” as a way to confuse members of her group. [Both the NRA and the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) recently held their own suppressor demonstration for media members with the goal of showing what suppressors will and will not do. For example, suppressors reduce the sound of a gunshot —  making it manageable and protecting hearing —  but they do not silence firearms. NSSF’s Larry Keane said, “We prefer to refer to them as ‘suppressors,’ because that more accurately describes what they do. ” He added:  They reduce the noise of gunfire, but they don’t block it. They are simply a muffler for your gun. You hear a car go by without a muffler and it’s loud, but you can still hear it with a muffler. Even former ATF agent David Chipman, a Gabby Giffords’ gun control supporter, believes “suppressor” is the better term for devices that reduce the decibel level of a gunshot. But according to the Hill, Shannon Watts thinks the word “suppressor” is the result of a “gun lobby” tactic to confuse her members and other gun control proponents: “It’s all semantics. Focusing on the name distracts people from the real conversation,” Watts said. “They did the same thing with the debate over whether to use the term ‘assault rifles’ or ‘semiautomatic rifles,’ and then the whole conversation shifted to ‘What are we going to call these things? ’” “They want to get into semantics about the language, so we don’t talk about how dangerous they are. ” Watts’s fellow gun controllers at the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence are also taking issue with the difference between silenced and suppressed, warning their members to be wary of “gun lobby” claims that suppressors do not silence guns: . @NRA  @NSSF say silencers rn’t dangerous   they don’t fully suppress sound of guns.

7958,Beyoncé Cancels Coachella Appearance Under Doctor’s Orders,"Beyoncé has canceled her scheduled headlining appearance at the Coachella music festival this year after her doctor advised her to maintain a less strenuous schedule while she is pregnant with twins. [In a statement, festival organizer Goldenvoice said the    singer would not be able to perform in Indio on April 15 and April 22 as planned, but would instead headline Coachella in 2018.  “Following the advice of her doctors to keep a less rigorous schedule in the coming months, Beyoncé has made the decision to forgo performing at the 2017 Coachella Valley Music  Arts Festival,” the organizer said in a statement. “However, Goldenvoice and Parkwood are pleased to confirm that she will be a headliner at the 2018 festival. Thank you for your understanding. Stay tuned for more information. ” Coachella organizers had hoped that Beyoncé’s performance at the Grammy Awards this month was a sign that she would be able to take the stage at the   Southern California festival in April. The singer’s fans took to social media Thursday afternoon to express their disappointment, with many saying they would request refunds from the festival or else sell their tickets to interested buyers.

7959,Judge Rules Video Game Publisher 2K Games Owns the Rights to Your Face - Breitbart,"2K Games won a   case about its right to store and distribute the biometric data it collects from face scans in its games. [When you use your console’s camera to scan your face into one of 2K’s sports titles to create custom players with your likeness, that information is uploaded and stored on 2K Games’ servers. According to the terms of service you almost certainly didn’t read, that means you’ve granted 2K permission to make your face visible to others.  Two players took exception and sued 2K over NBA 2K15 and 2K16 in October 2015. They argued that 2K’s practices violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act and that the publisher had not obtained explicit informed consent before storing the 3D renditions of their heads. A judge, however, has decided that there was not enough proof of “sufficient injury” to the plaintiffs, stating: At best, more extensive notice and consent could have dissuaded the plaintiffs from using the MyPlayer feature, meaning that   would have never collected the plaintiffs’ biometrics. But the plaintiffs have failed to establish that their use of the MyPlayer feature resulted in any imminent risk that the data protection goal of the BIPA would be frustrated. Consequently, more extensive notice and consent could not have altered the standing equation because there has been no material risk of harm to a concrete BIPA interest that more extensive notice and consent would have avoided. The dismissal of this case may set precedent on the rights of corporations on things as sensitive as a digital image of your physical likeness. As the technology to gather precision biometrics advances, that could become a very real privacy concern.

7960,South Koreans Rally in Largest Protest in Decades to Demand President’s Ouster - The New York Times,"SEOUL, South Korea  —   In one of the largest   protests in recent decades, hundreds of thousands of South Koreans filled central Seoul on Saturday to demand the resignation of President Park   whose administration has been paralyzed by a scandal involving an unofficial presidential adviser. “You are surrounded! Park   come out and surrender!” protesters chanted, their voices reverberating through the center of the capital. The main boulevard that faces the presidential offices and residence, known as the Blue House, shimmered with light from candles held by the protesters. Police buses formed a barricade to block protesters from getting too close to the presidential compound. Outrage at Ms. Park has grown in recent weeks over allegations that she let a private adviser manipulate her and extort large sums from Korean companies. Protesters have rallied in downtown Seoul over the past three weekends, and their numbers have continued to grow. Ms. Park has delivered repeated apologies for the scandal and offered to share power with a prime minister to be appointed by the   Parliament, but her efforts to stem the crisis have failed. The police estimated the crowd on Saturday at 260, 000, while organizers said as many as one million people had turned out. By either estimate, the rally rivaled the huge demonstrations in 1987 that forced the government, then controlled by the military, to hold a free presidential election. Those protests were pivotal in a long struggle to end the military dictatorship started by Ms. Park’s father, Park   in the 1960s. Ms. Park has become the least popular South Korean leader since the late 1980s, according to recent polls. Her secretive adviser, Choi   has been arrested on charges of leveraging her ties to the president to bully businesses into donating $69 million to two foundations she controlled. Ms. Choi is a daughter of a cult leader who became Ms. Park’s mentor in the 1970s, when Ms. Park’s father was still in power. Two former aides to Ms. Park have been charged with helping Ms. Choi meddle in state affairs from behind the scenes. Ms. Park has admitted only that she let Ms. Choi, who has no background in government or policy matters, edit her speeches. But she has apologized for the scandal, promised to sever ties with Ms. Choi and agreed to be questioned by prosecutors. On Saturday, train and bus stations in provincial cities reported that tickets to Seoul had been sold out, and people struggled to find transportation to the capital. Many protesters brought their children, and some mothers were pushing baby carriages. Some marched alongside a mock hearse meant to symbolize the death of Ms. Park’s government. Teenagers in school uniforms marched holding signs that said, “Park   step down!” Protesters also used Saturday’s rally to voice their anger at Ms. Park’s unpopular policies, including her decision to replace privately published history textbooks with uniform   texts by next year. Many also criticized the agreement that Ms. Park’s government struck with Japan on the issue of the   comfort women, Korean sex slaves who were forced to work in brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. The main opposition party has yet to call for Ms. Park’s resignation, although its leaders joined the rally on Saturday. The party wants to reduce her role to that of a figurehead, demanding that she distance herself from key policy decisions. Ms. Park’s   term ends in early 2018. Since 1948, South Koreans have seen three governments ousted before the end of their terms. The country’s first president, Syngman Rhee, fled into exile in Hawaii amid a popular uprising in 1960. The succeeding government was overthrown by Mr. Park’s father, who seized power in a military coup in 1961. His rule ended when he was assassinated in 1979.",0
7961,Project Veritas Reveals Who Was REALLY Behind Romney’s 47% Video,"You are here: Home / US / Project Veritas Reveals Who Was REALLY Behind Romney’s 47% Video Project Veritas Reveals Who Was REALLY Behind Romney’s 47% Video October 28, 2016 Pinterest 
Once again, the lengths to which the Democrats have to go to win elections was evidenced by a Project Veritas video released Wednesday night on Fox News’“The O’Reilly Factor.” In the video, we found out that the “bartender” who obtained video of former Gov. Mitt Romney’s infamous “47%” comments during his 2012 presidential campaign may have actually been part of a coordinated effort by Democrat operatives to tank Romney’s campaign — despite the truth of his comments. 
Scott Foval, who was fired from his post at Americans United for Change after Project Veritas began releasing their videos, revealed that there may have been more behind the “47%” video than just a bartender at the fundraiser taking footage on his own, with no direction from anyone else. 
Twitchy reported : 
In Wednesday’s video release, Foval explains that the bartender who caught Romney’s devastating “47 percent” remarks on video during a fundraiser was part of a coordinated operation to sneak a video recording device into the event. That video eventually was passed along to David Corn of Mother Jones, who won a George Polk Award for his efforts. 
The story at the time, of course, was that bartender Scott Prouty brought a camera along in hopes of perhaps getting a photo with Romney — which somehow involved setting down the camera and hitting the record button. Progressives hailed Prouty as a hero for coming forward with the video. 
Yeah, not according to Foval. 
“Bob [Creamer] got a hold of our guys who did the original insertions back in the 2000 and 2004 campaigns against Bush where they were inserting people and interrupting his fundraisers and rallies,” he told an undercover Project Veritas journalist. “And then, I don’t know if you remember, well from, they are the ones who negotiated to get that lawyer in in Florida who recorded the 47 percent video.” 
“Wait, I thought that was a bartender,” the undercover PVA reporter responded. 
“It was actually a lawyer at the event,” Foval said and added: “The lawyer took his phone and had the bartender walk around with it and set it up.” 
Foval continued, “It was a whole coordinated operation to get the phone in because they had taken away all the cell phones from all the staff and so what they did was they set it up in the room.” 
When Foval was asked about who the lawyer was, he claimed he didn’t know. “I have no idea who it is but they, the people who do the operations, they have a team of about 25 folks that this is what they do.” 
Of course, Foval is walking back his comments, and Corn has claimed that it isn’t true. Then again, that’s what liberals always do when they’re caught — deflect, lie, pretend it didn’t happen, etc. etc. James O'Keefe's New Story About the 47-Percent Video Is Totally False. https://t.co/uFnbTTqOLk",0
7963,Trump Administration’s First Immigrant Detention Center Goes Up in Texas,"AUSTIN, Texas  —   Texas is set to get its first immigrant detention center under the Trump administration after a private prison company announced that it won a    contract with ICE. [The GEO group announced in a press release on Thursday that it has been awarded a contract by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for the construction and operation of a   detention facility located in Conroe, Texas, which is just north of Houston.  Under the   $110   contract with ICE, GEO is expected to, “design, finance, build, and operate the   Facility. ” GEO has a long history of partnering with ICE spanning well over two decades. “We are very appreciative of the continued confidence placed in our company by U.

7964,"Amazon’s Ambitions Unboxed: Stores for Furniture, Appliances and More - The New York Times","SEATTLE  —   Last Sunday in Palm Springs, Calif. Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, climbed into the cockpit of a   robot and began flailing his arms as though warming up for a workout, causing the robot’s enormous appendages to mimic his movements. “Why do I feel so much like Sigourney Weaver?” Mr. Bezos said, referring to the actress who wore a mechanical suit in a climactic battle in the 1986 movie “Aliens. ” The intimate audience of entrepreneurs and academics, attending an Amazon conference on robotics and artificial intelligence, chuckled. Later, Mr. Bezos posted a photo on Twitter of himself in the suit with a more menacing air, the robot’s arms raised as if about to deliver a   bear hug. For years, retailers have been haunted by the thought of Amazon using its technological prowess to squeeze them into powder. That battle has mostly played out on Amazon’s home turf, the world of online shopping. Now the fight is coming directly to retailers on actual streets around the globe, where Amazon is slowly building a fleet of physical stores. And while most of the attention has been focused on Amazon’s grocery store dreams, the company has a more ambitious collection of experiments underway. If those experiments work  —   and there is no guarantee of that  —   they could have a profound influence on how other stores operate. Over time, they could also introduce new forms of automation, putting traditional retail jobs in jeopardy. At the same time, locating those stores close to customers’ homes could also help Amazon further its ambitions of delivering internet orders within hours. The company is exploring the idea of creating stores to sell furniture and home appliances, like refrigerators  —   the kinds of products that shoppers are reluctant to buy over the internet sight unseen, said one of several people with knowledge of the discussions who, in conversations with The New York Times, spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans were confidential. The stores would serve as showcases where people could view the items in person, with orders being delivered to their homes. These would not be your average Home Depots: Amazon has considered using forms of augmented or virtual reality to allow people to see how couches, stoves and credenzas will look in their homes, the person briefed on the discussions said. Amazon is also kicking around an   concept similar to Apple’s retail emporiums, according to two of the people familiar with the discussions. These shops would have a heavy emphasis on Amazon devices and services such as the company’s Echo smart home speaker and Prime Video streaming service. And in groceries  —   a giant category in which Amazon has struggled  —   the company has opened a convenience store that does not need cashiers, and it is close to opening two stores where drivers can quickly pick up groceries without leaving their cars, all in Seattle. It has explored another grocery store concept that could serve   customers and act as a hub for home deliveries. Overseas, Amazon is quietly targeting India for new    grocery stores. It is a vast market, and one still largely dominated by traditional street bazaars where shoppers must wander from stall to stall haggling over prices and deliberating over unrefrigerated meat sitting in the dusty open air. Amazon’s internal code name for its India grocery ambitions: Project Everest. Last week, Amazon opened its fifth physical book store in Chicago, and it has five more announced locations under construction. It is possible that some of the store ideas will never see the light of day. Groups within Amazon are often encouraged to come up with zany initiatives (this is the company that popularized the idea of drone deliveries). Many ideas are chucked after deeper scrutiny by executives. Amazon declined to talk about any stores it has not announced publicly. “We are always thinking about new ways to serve customers, but thinking is different than planning,” said Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman. Since the late ’90s, pundits have asked when Amazon  —   the company Mr. Bezos founded on the premise that people would rather shop from the comfort of their screens  —   would finally start building stores. But Amazon executives saw plenty of opportunities in online retail and new ways to reach people, from creating digital   devices like Kindle to building up the Prime membership service for getting faster deliveries and other benefits. In 2012, Mr. Bezos told the television interviewer Charlie Rose that shoppers were already well served by existing retailers and that Amazon had no interest in a   effort. “We want to do something uniquely Amazon,” he said. “If we can find that idea, and we haven’t found it yet, but if we can find that idea, we would love to open physical stores. ” Despite Amazon’s internet retailing success, over time it has become clear that there is a lot of shopping that people prefer to do in person. The most glaring example is groceries  —   the mother of all shopping categories, with about $770 billion for the supermarkets represented by the Food Marketing Institute, a nonprofit group that includes the majority of such stores in the United States. After pouring resources into an online grocery service, AmazonFresh, for almost a decade, the company has made only modest progress. According to people familiar with the workings of the company’s grocery business, it has struggled to operate it profitably, leading to a slow rollout of the service in new locations. One big desire many customers have is that they want to see fresh fruits, vegetables and meat in person before buying them. The relatively high cost of home delivery  —   Amazon charges $15 a month for its Fresh service, on top of a $99 annual Prime membership  —   is another barrier. Online grocery delivery accounts for only about 3 percent of the market in the United States, though it is closer to 10 percent in Britain, said Randy Burt, a partner in the food and beverage practice of A. T. Kearney, a strategy and management consulting firm. Mr. Burt said Amazon’s growing interest in stores mirrored the conclusion that other online merchants with physical stores  —   the apparel seller Bonobos and the eyewear seller Warby Parker  —   had come to. “I think they are recognizing, for certain things you can’t digitize and replicate online all the experience one has in a store,” Mr. Burt said. “The ability to create experiences is going to be critical for them to continue to get share. ” Joe Thompson, a former general manager in Amazon’s retail business, sees physical retail as key to Mr. Bezos’s outsize ambitions for the company. ”I can’t help but feel that, in Bezos’s mind, he wants to be the first   valuation company,” said Mr. Thompson, who is now an executive at BuildDirect, an online home improvement store. To do that, he said, Amazon would have to “crack” a couple of “completely underpenetrated markets online. ” Amazon’s current market value is bobbing around $400 billion. In the coming weeks, Amazon is expected to open its first two grocery pickup stores, in Seattle’s Ballard and SoDo neighborhoods, which will allow customers to order food online and schedule brief windows for picking them up in person. Recently, as cars ripped by, workers hung a sign on the exterior of one of the stores  —   to be called AmazonFresh Pickup, according to city permit documents obtained by GeekWire  —   before quickly covering it up. A growing number of established grocery retailers are experimenting with this “click and collect” approach to shopping, including Walmart, Kroger and others. According to one person briefed on Amazon’s plans, the company has been developing technology for automatically detecting when a customer pulls into the parking lot so orders can be brought to them more quickly. A few miles away from its other Seattle stores, on the ground floor of one of its many office towers in the city, the company is testing Amazon Go, a convenience store concept stocked with beverages, sandwiches and prepared meals, which are put together by chefs in a kitchen that is visible from the street. The retail industry has been captivated by Amazon Go’s technology since the company unveiled the store late last year. The store uses a combination of sensors and artificial intelligence to automatically detect the food items shoppers remove from shelves, so they can leave the store without visiting a cashier  —   the way customers do when they bolt from an Uber. “Amazon is wonderful at frictionless commerce,” said Timothy Laseter, a professor at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business. There have been glitches with the technology that Amazon engineers continue to work on, according to a person familiar with the operations. For now, only Amazon employees are allowed to use the store. Amazon previously said it would open Amazon Go to the public in early 2017. If Amazon is successful at automating the checkout process, the   implications for employment could be   because other retailers would probably do everything possible to copy it. More than 3. 4 million people are employed as cashiers in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Amazon Go technologies like artificial intelligence are “Latin for ‘fire cashiers,’” said Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University’s Leonard N. Stern School of Business. “I’ve probably been in 30 boardrooms of retailers in the past year,” Mr. Galloway said. “I would say the No. 1 topic of conversation is Amazon. ” For months, reports have circulated that Amazon was considering a concept for a larger grocery store that would combine shopping formats like traditional   purchases,    and home delivery. One of those articles, a February piece by The New York Post, described a futuristic Amazon grocery store staffed by robots, requiring only three human workers. That was too much, apparently, for Mr. Bezos, who became uncharacteristically feisty on Twitter, attacking the article by saying The Post’s sources had “mixed up their meds. ” But a group within Amazon has explored another larger grocery store format, according to both a person familiar with the concept and to internal Amazon documents reviewed by The New York Times. The store could stock fresh produce, meats and other items in a public area of the store, while keeping frozen foods, cereals and other items traditionally found in the center of a grocery store behind a wall, in what would be a kind of small Amazon warehouse. Workers behind the wall, not robots, could quickly package orders for customers. The idea resembles a concept laid out in a paper, “A Beautiful Way to Save Woolworths,” written by the retail industry consultant Brittain Ladd, who was later hired by Amazon. The status of that project at Amazon is unclear: One person said it never advanced far and was effectively dead, and another disputed that characterization. While Mr. Bezos was known for coining the motto “Get Big Fast” in the early days of Amazon, the company’s plans in physical retail could be better described as “Get Big Slow. ” Some reports have said Amazon has discussed building up to 2, 000 grocery stores. But that figure was floated mainly as a hypothetical to consider the impact on Amazon’s supply chain, not as a goal that was under serious consideration, a person familiar with the discussions said. In addition to the two soon to open in Seattle, as many as five more AmazonFresh Pickup locations could open by next year, and the company hopes to expand Amazon Go to Britain and several cities in the United States in the same time frame, this person said. India could represent another big market for Amazon in physical retail. The company, which has vowed to spend billions of dollars on its efforts in the world’s   populous country, recently sought approval from the Indian government to open online and physical food stores in the country, The Economic Times reported in February. According to a person familiar with Amazon’s India grocery efforts, the company hopes to open its first Indian grocery store in Bangalore. In a statement, Amazon said the company was excited by the Indian government’s efforts to encourage foreign investment in a “stronger food supply chain. ” “We have sought an approval to invest and partner with the government in achieving this vision,” Amazon said. For Mr. Galloway at N. Y. U. the slow pace of Amazon’s rollout of stores is a sign that it has not figured out physical retail yet, and that has surprised him. Five years ago, he believed Amazon would have hundreds of stores by this time. “What appears to be clear is they haven’t yet zeroed in on a format they’re willing to massively scale,” he said. “This is a company that the moment it figures out something that works, it puts nuclear energy behind it. ”",0
7965,Davi to Hollywood Elite: Invite Illegal Aliens and Refugees to the Oscars... or You’re Racists! - Breitbart,"An open letter to the Hollywood Elite and the rest of America:[My Dear friends and colleagues,  I have recently been pondering President Trump’s executive action with regard to our nation having extreme vetting and our immigration policy finally being enforced. It has pained me deeply to see such a violent reaction to something that, to my mind, makes absolute common sense. Let me begin by saying that I am from a family of immigrants that came to this country for a better life. They came to the US “legally,” assimilated, integrated, and learned English to the best of their ability, and demanded we speak it. As we all know, we live in a time in which there are forces who wish to destroy our way of life. There are thousands of illegal immigrant criminals in the United States whose country of origin will not take them back. These criminals are free on the streets of America. We have recently heard from a plethora of Hollywood stars on this issue  —   Meryl Streep, Robert DeNiro, Ashley Judd, Madonna, major agencies, musicians, singers and even the indomitable Shia LaBeouf. After much prayer on this issue, I must now stand in solidarity with all of my Hollywood elite brethren. They are right! The rest of you are wrong! It is now in this spirit that I make an appeal to all in Hollywood and the media for us to use the Oscars to take a stand for the entire world to see and hear. It is time for Hollywood to lead the way. I propose that Meryl Steep, Chelsea Handler, Richard Gere, Robert DeNiro, Christoph Waltz and others lead an Oscar first: let’s do away with the rules, barriers, and tickets to the Oscars and   such as the swanky Vanity Fair party or the Weinsteins’   affair. I ask all migrants, all illegal immigrant criminals and all   refugees to converge on Hollywood to come to the Oscars and all the   even those held at the mansions or the Chateau Marmont or anywhere else. After all, we in the Hollywood community want to show all Islamic extremists that we have love in our hearts  —   and what better way to do that than by inviting them along on our most important night? It’s time the walls and electronic security gates come down. There are roughly 3, 600 seats to the Oscars we should have at least 2, 500 seats reserved for illegal aliens, refugees and migrants, or maybe even more. For those celebrities skipping the ceremony, each should invite at least 100 illegal aliens, refugees or migrants to come to their home to watch the Oscars with them. The Academy and the Vanity Fair people should also get the 150 criminals who have recently been deported from Los Angeles and bring them to the show as honored guests. I find it curious that when President Obama did the same exact thing  —   and more  —   in terms of enforcing the law on illegal immigration, the Hollywood elite were silent. Why were they silent then, but are so vocal now when President Trump is doing basically the same thing? Is Hollywood racist? Why  —   when Christians are being slaughtered in Syria, Iraq, and other places in the Middle East  —   is Hollywood silent? Of course, the people that wish death upon Christians, Jews, gay people and the West are greeted with open arms by the elite in Hollywood  —   so why can’t they come to our Oscar parties? Additionally, I am now pleased to announce that Hollywood and the recording industry no longer require the protection of the Men in Blue at any of their events! We do not need a country of laws only a country of illegal immigrants, refugees and migrants. How dare we ignore the words inscribed on the Statue of Liberty: “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free  …    ” So now, we ask you all: please come to the Oscars on February 26th at the Dolby Theater on Hollywood Boulevard. We welcome you to our homes with open arms and love in our hearts. Together, let us celebrate the Progressive left and its policies, which have helped make blue collar America Tired, Hungry, and Poor. And the Oscar goes to  …       With love in my heart, Robert Davi",0
7966,Hate-filled Monkeys Shut Down George Washington Bridge,"What do they want, you ask? 
More. 
All they ever want is more. 
And they’re not going to stop until we stop them. 
Physically. 
NBC NY : 
The inbound upper level of the George Washington Bridge was closed by an immigrant rights protest on Wednesday morning, snarling traffic on one of the region’s most important crossings at the height of rush hour. 
Delays at the bridge for traffic heading into New York from New Jersey were up to nearly 90 minutes; traffic cameras showed bumper-to-bumper traffic barely inching along. 
The protesters apparently chained themselves across the roadway to block traffic, unfurling large banners in an attempt to spread their message. One banner appeared to read “Resist, Organized, Act Up!” 
Drivers were clashing with the protesters in an effort to get the bridge open, according to witnesses. Police quickly detained the small group and traffic began moving again about 15 minutes. 
The Port Authority said 10 people who were blocking the eastbound lanes were arrested. No injuries were reported. The agency said it is investigating.",0

7968,"Sergey Kislyak, Russian Envoy, Cultivated Powerful Network in U.S. - The New York Times","Sergey I. Kislyak, the longtime Russian ambassador to the United States, hosted a dazzling dinner in his     mansion four blocks north of the White House to toast Michael A. McFaul just weeks before he took up his post as the American envoy to Russia. It was, Mr. McFaul recalled, an “   extraordinary dinner,” including five courses of Russian fusion cuisine for 50 seated guests who shared one main characteristic: They were government officials intimately involved in formulating Russia policy for the Obama administration, including senior figures from the Defense and State Departments. “I admired the fact that he was trying to reach deep into our government to cultivate relations with all kinds of people,” Mr. McFaul said of the dinner in late 2011. “I was impressed by the way he went about that kind of socializing, the way he went about entertaining, but always with a political objective. ” Mr. Kislyak’s networking success has landed him at the center of a sprawling controversy and made him the most prominent, if politically radioactive, ambassador in Washington. Two advisers to President Trump have run into trouble for not being more candid about contacts with Mr. Kislyak: Michael T. Flynn, who was forced to resign as national security adviser, and now Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who admitted two previously undisclosed conversations. Mr. Kislyak also met during the transition with Mr. Trump’s    and adviser, Jared Kushner. A career diplomat raised in the Soviet era, Mr. Kislyak, 66, (pronounced  ) may seem an unlikely protagonist in such a drama. He has interacted with American officials for decades and been a fixture on the Washington scene for the past nine years, jowly and cordial with an easy smile and fluent if accented English, yet a pugnacity in advocating Russia’s assertive policies. Invited to think tanks to discuss arms control, he would invariably offer an unapologetic defense of Russia’s intervention in Ukraine and assail Americans for what he portrayed as their hypocrisy  —   then afterward approach a debating partner to suggest dinner. “Not all of us, myself included, initially appreciated his very tough,    style,” said Dimitri K. Simes, president of the Center for the National Interest and an advocate of closer   relations, who hosted a dinner at his home for Mr. Kislyak after his arrival in Washington and regularly invited him to events at his center. “But we gradually came to develop a grudging respect for him as someone who was really representing the positions of his country. ” Mr. Simes introduced Mr. Kislyak to Mr. Trump in a receiving line last April at a foreign policy speech hosted by his center at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington. Mr. Kislyak was one of four ambassadors who sat in the front row for Mr. Trump’s speech at the invitation of the center. Mr. Simes noted that Mr. Sessions, then a senator from Alabama, was there, but he did not notice whether he and the ambassador spoke at that time. The Russian Embassy did not respond to an email on Thursday, but Mr. Kislyak defended engagements with American officials last November, when he was asked during a speech at Stanford University about allegations of Russian meddling in the elections. Mr. Kislyak echoed his government’s line that it was not involved in hacking. He said it was natural for diplomats to attend events such as political conventions and foreign policy speeches by candidates. “It is normal diplomatic work that we have been doing: It is our job to understand, to know people, both on the side of the Republicans and Democrats,” he said. “I personally have been working in the United States for so long that I know almost everybody. ” Even some critics of Russian policy said it was hardly surprising that Mr. Kislyak would meet people around Mr. Trump. “That was part of his job,” said Steven Pifer, a former ambassador to Ukraine who is now at the Brookings Institution. “I don’t see anything nefarious in that per se, and I don’t think it was out of the box for Senator Sessions to talk with Kislyak. ” An expert on arms control negotiations with a degree from the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute, Mr. Kislyak first served in the Washington embassy from 1985 to 1989 during the late Soviet period. He became the first Russian representative to NATO and was ambassador to Belgium from 1998 to 2003. He returned to Moscow, where he spent five years as a deputy foreign minister. He was appointed ambassador to Washington in 2008. “He is a brilliant, highly professional diplomat  —   affable, pleasant, unbelievably good at arms control and   relations for decades,” said Sergei A. Karaganov, a periodic Kremlin adviser on foreign policy. Some Russian foreign policy experts compared him to Anatoly F. Dobrynin, the Soviet ambassador to Washington from 1962 to 1986 and a political player in both capitals. Until recently, at least, Mr. Kislyak played a more discreet, quiet role in Washington and was even less visible in Moscow. “I would describe him as Russia’s top authority on the United States,” said Vladimir Frolov, a foreign policy analyst. The questions about contacts between Mr. Trump’s circle and Russian officials have revealed what both sides presumably knew, that American intelligence agencies closely track Mr. Kislyak’s movements and tap his phone calls. Russian officials on Thursday expressed anger that their ambassador’s actions were being questioned and that some news reports suggested he might be an intelligence operative. Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, delivered an extended diatribe during her weekly briefing against what she called the low professional standards of the American news media. “I will reveal a military secret to you: Diplomats work, and their work consists of carrying out contacts in the country where they are present,” she said. “This is on record everywhere. If they do not carry out these contacts, do not participate in negotiations, then they are not diplomats. ” Until Vladimir V. Putin returned to the Russian presidency in 2012 and tensions between Washington and Moscow rose again, Mr. Kislyak was a popular host, especially for weekend events at the estate at Pioneer Point in Maryland, which the Obama administration ordered closed last December over the hacking allegations. He invited the Americans who negotiated the New Start nuclear arms treaty and their families to a party at the estate. Russian security guards took the children of his guests tubing on the ambassador’s boat. During the treaty negotiations, Mr. McFaul remembered, Mr. Kislyak frequently telephoned the secretary of defense or others involved, thwarting the American desire to limit his channels of communication. “He was actively pushing to try to find fissures and disagreements among us,” Mr. McFaul said. “He is very smart, very experienced, always well prepared,” said R. Nicholas Burns, a former under secretary of state who negotiated three Iran sanctions resolutions at the United Nations with Mr. Kislyak. “But he could be cynical, obstreperous and inflexible, and had a Soviet mentality. He was very aggressive toward the United States. ” Some of that aggression was on display at the Stanford event last fall, which was moderated by Mr. McFaul. Saying that he had been sent to Washington to improve relations, Mr. Kislyak named areas of possible cooperation, but then went through a long list of grievances, accusing the United States of meddling around the globe. When an audience member asked about Russian mistakes, he demurred. He said the most serious problem with the United States is that it believes it is exceptional. “The difference between your exceptionalism and ours is that we are not trying to impose on you ours, but you do not hesitate to impose on us yours,” he said. “That is something we do not appreciate. ” He has told associates that he will leave Washington soon, likely to be replaced by a   general. His name recently surfaced at the United Nations as a candidate for a new post responsible for counterterrorism, diplomats there said. Vitaly I. Churkin, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations, died last month and that post remains vacant. For Mr. Kislyak, Washington is no longer the place it once was. It has become lonely, and he has told associates that he is surprised how people who once sought his company were now trying to stay away.",0
7969,Donald Trump threatens to jail Hillary Clinton,"Email 
The second presidential debate flew off the rails on Sunday night when Donald Trump invoked accusations of sexual misconduct against Bill Clinton and suggested that Hillary Clinton could ""be in jail"" if he's elected in November, threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to look into her private email server. 

ABC's Martha Raddatz, one of the debate moderators, asked Trump whether his behavior exposed in the shocking 2005 video released Friday, in which he bragged about groping and kissing women without permission, was consistent with his current behavior. 
""As I told you, that was locker-room talk,"" Trump said. ""I am not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for people of this country, and I'm not proud of it."" 
Trump then said if you ""look at the history of politics in this country, no one had been so abusive of women"" as former President Bill Clinton, the husband of the Democratic nominee, whom Trump suggested intimidated those women. 
Three women who had previously accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct held a press conference with Trump earlier Sunday, and each was seated in the front row at the debate. 
""Mine were words — his were actions,"" Trump said. 
""So, don't tell me about words,"" he continued. ""I am absolutely, I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. Bill Clinton. He was impeached. He was no longer allowed to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women, Paula Jones, who is here tonight. That when Hillary brings up a point like that, brings up words I say 11 years ago, I think it's disgraceful. And I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth."" 
Donald Trump: ""If I win, I'm going to instruct my attorney general"" to investigate Clinton https://t.co/raPU4ICkl6 https://t.co/IWGVUleEtr 
— CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 10, 2016The former secretary of state responded by saying that ""so much of what he just said is not right"" but that he was doing it because of his floundering campaign. 
""I am reminded of what my friend Michelle Obama advised us all,"" she said. ""When they go low, you go high."" 
""And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he's saying tonight would be understandable,"" she said. ""But everyone can come to their own conclusions about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. But he never apologizes to anyone for anything."" 
She mentioned that Trump had not apologized to the Khans, a couple who lost a son, a Muslim US soldier, during the Iraq War. Trump engaged in a lengthy back-and-forth with the Khans after they appeared at the Democratic National Convention in July. 
Clinton also said Trump had not apologized to a reporter whose disability he mocked in front of a camera, a federal judge who Trump said couldn't do his job fairly because he was of Mexican descent, and President Barack Obama, whose birthplace Trump tried to discredit in a multiyear campaign. 
""He owes the president an apology, he needs to apologize to our country, and he needs to take responsibility,"" she said. 
Trump responded by repeating the false claim that the Clinton campaign started the rumors casting doubt on Obama's birthplace in 2008. He added that she owed an apology for the ""33,000 emails you deleted."" 
""If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation,"" Trump said. ""Because there have never been so many lies, so much deception. And we're going to have a special prosecutor."" 
Clinton said everything Trump said was ""absolutely false"" but she was ""not surprised."" 
""Oh really?"" Trump interjected. 
Clinton then mentioned the difficulty in fact-checking Trump, to which he capped off the exchange by saying ""you'd be in jail"" during his potential administration.",0
7970,Chicago Review of Books Editor Says MILO’s Words Could Inspire Terrorism - Breitbart,"Adam Morgan, Editor in Chief of the Chicago Review of Books, published an article in The Guardian today where he called MILO’s new book “hate speech” and claimed that it would inspire the likes of Omar Mateen and Dylann Roof. [Adam Morgan, the Editor in Chief of the Chicago Review of Books, published an article today in The Guardian explaining why the Chicago Review of Books chose to boycott Simon  Schuster, the company publishing MILO’s new book, DANGEROUS.   The title of the Guardian article reads, “Publishing Milo Yiannopoulos’ book is wrong. My magazine is fighting back. ” However the URL of the article and the Facebook sharing preview reveal the title, “Simon  Schuster is rewarding   hate speech. We cannot stay silent. ” This may be a simple error but it is also likely that the title calling MILO’s book “  hate speech” was the original tile of the article. The Guardian may have realised their error in calling MILO “ ” a political movement which MILO has repeatedly stated he is not part of, despite the media’s various attempts to paint him as a “leader” of the movement, and changed the article title. Morgan’s article goes on to make a number of claims such as, “2016 taught us that ridiculing women, people of colour, Muslims and members of the LGBTQ community can make someone immensely popular,” and that MILO is, “not a conservative intellectual leader with a political agenda. He’s a clickbait grifter who has made a name for himself spewing hate speech. ”  What Morgan considers to be “hate speech” have garnered MILO a position as Senior Editor of one of the largest political news website on the internet, media appearances on news outlets across the world, over one million Facebook likes and an army of fans that listen to him speak at his immensely successful Dangerous Faggot college tour. Morgan then states that he “made a decision that has nothing to do with political ideology and everything to do with human rights and decency,” by refusing to review Simon  Schuster books in 2017. Exactly what human rights MILO’s book is denying people, Morgan fails to state.  Morgan then states that MILO’s book may inspire terrorist acts. “Rhetoric like [MILO’s]  —   which targets racial, religious and cultural minorities  —   invites discrimination. It arguably encourages people such as Omar Mateen and Dylann Roof to think of entire groups of people as less than human. ” MILO of course gave a speech at the site of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando where he urged the gay community to fight back, to let it be known that they will never let an attack such as the one at Pulse nightclub happen again, and that they will protect themselves if the left will not.  When asked for comment on the accusation that his words will lead to terrorism MILO said, “Following Omar Mateen’s horrific crimes, I travelled to Orlando and spoke out against Islam’s hatred of homosexuals outside Pulse nightclub. The websites Dylann Roof is associated with hate me as much as anyone. Regressives like Adam Morgan can’t stand free speech or opposing viewpoints being heard. ” Further discussing the Chicago Review of Books’ decision to refuse to review Simon  Schuster books in 2017, Morgan states “After the Chicago Review of Books attracted so much attention for our stance, and writers more talented than me asked us to reconsider, I lost sleep. But on Saturday, when the biographer of a lesbian artist criticised Simon  Schuster, Yiannopoulos responded: ‘There is only one place for lesbians: porn. ’” Read the article in full here. DANGEROUS is available to   now via Amazon, in hardcover and Kindle editions. And yes, MILO is reading the audiobook version himself! ",0

7973,"Seeking Support and Invoking Faith, Donald Trump Visits a Black Church for the First Time - The New York Times","DETROIT  —   Donald J. Trump, who has campaigned for president as a blunt provocateur, dismissing complaints of racial insensitivity as political correctness, took an uncharacteristic step on Saturday: He visited a black church for the first time and tried to blend in. Flanked by a few black supporters, including Ben Carson, a former presidential candidate, and Omarosa Manigault, a former contestant on “The Apprentice,” Mr. Trump cut a subdued figure here at Great Faith Ministries International. He beamed as congregants greeted him and swayed to the chords of the song “What a Mighty God We Serve. ” Speaking softly, he invoked the civil rights movement and Abraham Lincoln. Donning a prayer shawl given to him by the church’s pastor, Bishop Wayne T. Jackson, Mr. Trump proclaimed, “I feel better already. ” Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular with black voters and perceived by many as hostile to their community. His company has faced accusations of discrimination against black tenants he has alleged falsely in the past that President Obama was not born in the United States and as a champion of aggressive policing, he has stirred indignation by caricaturing black neighborhoods as blighted by crime and economic despair. In Detroit, Mr. Trump did not express regret for, or even acknowledge, the actions and remarks that had opened a gulf between him and black voters. Instead, reading from prepared remarks, he hailed the Christian values and political contributions of black Americans and told his audience he cared about making their lives better. “I fully understand that the   community has suffered from discrimination and that there are many wrongs that must still be made right,” Mr. Trump said, adding: “For any who are hurting: Things are going to turn around. Tomorrow will be better. ” Mr. Trump’s visit to the church concluded a week of fitful outreach to black and Hispanic voters, capping off a frenzied campaign schedule that took him to Mexico’s presidential palace, to a meeting in North Philadelphia with black leaders, and finally to Detroit. Far more than a typical Republican presidential candidate, Mr. Trump faces a wall of opposition from nonwhite voters. He records virtually no support from black voters in the polls. Their resistance has emerged as one of the most important impediments to Mr. Trump’s candidacy, threatening to put several major swing states, like Michigan and Pennsylvania, entirely out of reach. Mr. Trump’s appearance on Saturday, long billed by campaign aides as a pivotal opportunity to reintroduce himself to black voters, was swathed in uncertainty up to the last minute, as the Trump campaign and the pastor deliberated over whether the Republican nominee would actually speak at the church. Plans for stops in nearby neighborhoods were announced, then retracted Mr. Trump ultimately paid a short visit to Mr. Carson’s childhood home before flying out of Detroit. And a scheduled interview with Mr. Jackson, Mr. Trump’s host on Saturday, became a source of embarrassment when it was revealed that both the questions and Mr. Trump’s answers had been scripted in advance. Mr. Trump taped the television appearance before the church service on Saturday, and it is expected to air in the next few days on Mr. Jackson’s Christian cable network. Mr. Jackson acknowledged offhand the unusual spectacle of Mr. Trump’s presence in his church. Introducing Mr. Trump, Mr. Jackson noted with a chuckle, “This is the first   church he’s been in. ” Mr. Jackson had planned to let Mr. Trump speak for just one minute, but at a reception before the service, aides to Mr. Trump asked Mr. Jackson for more time, and he granted it. “His people said, ‘Mr. Trump had already written this out and he really feels that if he can say it, it would really be a blessing because this is his heart,’” Mr. Jackson said in an interview. In his relatively muted address, lasting roughly 10 minutes, Mr. Trump did not employ his typical heated language about urban crime or illegal immigration. Instead, he offered praise for black Christians and called for a “civil rights agenda for our time,” including support for charter schools and new job growth. And Mr. Trump, who has not made professions of faith a regular element of his campaign, called on Americans to “turn again to our Christian heritage to lift up the soul of our nation. ” Leaving the church, Mr. Trump made a stop at the former residence of Mr. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon who has become one of Mr. Trump’s steadfast political allies. Bantering briefly with the current owner, Felicia Reese, Mr. Trump mused that the house must be a valuable property because Mr. Carson had lived there. Ms. Manigault, who directs outreach efforts for the Trump campaign, told Ms. Reese that the campaign would send her a copy of Mr. Trump’s book of business advice, “The Art of the Deal. ” It remains to be seen if Mr. Trump will make a more sustained bid to attract black support. His campaign advisers have routinely announced changes in strategy, and promised adjustments to Mr. Trump’s message and political style, only to have the candidate quickly lose interest and revert to form. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump followed up his surprise trip to Mexico City, where he expressed admiration for Mexican Americans, with an angry speech in Arizona denouncing illegal immigration and reiterating his pledge to wall off the southern border. But for Mr. Trump, winning the presidency might be all but impossible without a reversal of fortune with black and Hispanic voters. While Republicans usually lose those constituencies by a wide margin, polls suggest Mr. Trump is on track for such a historic rout that he may be unable to make up the difference with white voters. Mr. Jackson weathered some criticism for inviting Mr. Trump, and his own parishioners were split on Mr. Trump’s visit, with several expressing support for Mr. Jackson’s decision despite their own negative feelings about Mr. Trump’s candidacy. Candice Smith, 31, of Detroit, said she had been attending the church for 20 years and considered it a welcoming environment. “We accept anybody,” said Ms. Smith, a cosmetologist. “We are kind of like an open church. Everybody is welcome to come. ” Jan Counts, 55, a computer designer, expressed skepticism of Mr. Trump’s intentions, and said it was too late for Mr. Trump to win his vote. “I think he’s using the church,” said Mr. Counts, a congregant since 1993. “You can’t just change everything that you have been saying before and say something else and want me to believe that. ” If Mr. Trump found himself in an atypical environment on Saturday, so, too, did his press corps. At many Trump rallies, supporters of the candidate often jeer at reporters, sometimes walking up to the enclosure for the traveling press to fling obscenities. On Saturday, a woman in the congregation approached the press corps in a different spirit. “I’m glad you’re here,” she said, proceeding to hug each reporter in sight.",0
7974,"A Bigger Economic Pie, but a Smaller Slice for Half of the U.S. - The New York Times","Even with all the setbacks from recessions, burst bubbles and vanishing industries, the United States has still pumped out breathtaking riches over the last three and half decades. The real economy more than doubled in size the government now uses a substantial share of that bounty to hand over as much as $5 trillion to help working families, older people, disabled and unemployed people pay for a home, visit a doctor and put their children through school. Yet for half of all Americans, their share of the total economic pie has shrunk significantly, new research has found. This group  —   the approximately 117 million adults stuck on the lower half of the income ladder  —   “has been completely shut off from economic growth since the 1970s,” the team of economists found. “Even after taxes and transfers, there has been close to zero growth for   adults in the bottom 50 percent. ” The new findings, by the economists Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, provide the most thoroughgoing analysis to date of how the income kitty  —   like paychecks,   fringe benefits and food stamps  —   is divided among the American population. Stagnant wages have sliced the share of income collected by the bottom half of the population to 12. 5 percent in 2014, from 20 percent of the total in 1980. Where did that money go? Essentially, to the top 1 percent, whose share of the nation’s income nearly doubled to more than 20 percent during that same   period. Inequality has been a defining national issue for nearly a decade, thanks in part to groundbreaking research done by Mr. Piketty at the Paris School of Economics and Mr. Saez at the University of California, Berkeley. But now a new administration in Washington is promising to reshape the government’s role in curbing the intense concentration of wealth at the top and improving the fortunes of those left behind. During his tenure in the White House, President Obama pushed to address income stagnation by shifting more of the tax burden from the middle class to the rich and expanding public programs like universal health insurance. Both strategies are now targeted by   Donald J. Trump and Republicans in Congress, led by House Speaker Paul Ryan. Like many conservatives, Mr. Ryan argues that aid to the poor is ultimately counterproductive because it undermines the incentive to work. Proposals put forward by Republican leaders, though short on details, make clear that they want to roll back benefits like Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, which primarily help the poor, and direct the largest tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans. About 30 percent of the country’s income is channeled to federal, state and local taxes. Apart from military spending and performing basic public services, much of that is distributed back to individuals through various programs and tax benefits in the form of Social Security checks, Medicare benefits and veterans’ benefits. But until now, no one has truly measured the full impact that tax payments, government spending, noncash benefits and nontaxable income together have on inequality. Abundant documentation of income inequality already exists, but it has been challenged as incomplete. Studies have excluded the impact of taxes and value of public benefits, skeptics complained, or failed to account for the smaller size of households over time. This latest project tries to address those earlier criticisms. What the trio of economists found is that the spectacular growth in incomes at the peak has so outpaced the small increase at the bottom from public programs intended to ameliorate poverty and inequality that the gap between the wealthiest and everyone else has continued to widen. Average incomes, adjusted for inflation, grew by 61 percent from 1980 to 2014. But nearly $7 out of every additional $10 went to those in the top tenth of the income scale. Inequality has soared over that period. In 1980, the researchers found, someone in the top 1 percent earned on average the equivalent of $428, 200 a year in 2014 dollars  —   about 27 times more than the typical person in the bottom half, whose annual income equaled $16, 000. By 2014, the average income of half of American adults had barely budged, remaining around $16, 000, while members of the top 1 percent brought home, on average, $1, 304, 800 or 81 times as much. That ratio, the authors point out, “is similar to the gap between the average income in the United States and the average income in the world’s poorest countries, the   Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic and Burundi. ” The growth of incomes has probably increased a bit since 2014, the latest year for which full data exists, said Mr. Zucman, who, like Mr. Saez, also teaches at the University of California, Berkeley. But it is “not enough to make any significant difference to our   finding, and in particular, to affect the   stagnation of    incomes. ” He was to present the findings at a   workshop at the City University of New York on Tuesday. Tax credits and programs like Medicare and disability payments have helped families at the lower half of the income scale. But they have just nipped at the heels of the underlying trend. “It confirms the surge in income at the top,” said Raj Chetty, an economist at Stanford unaffiliated with the project, who called the work “terrific and very important. And it shows government redistribution doesn’t really change the picture. ” Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard who also independently reviewed the research, agreed that the data underscored the inadequacies of programs that try to redress inequities after the fact. “It suggests that if you don’t do something earlier in the market, before distribution, through better education or greater bargaining power, it’s really tough to offset completely,” Mr. Katz said. “Countries with less inequality do some of both. ” Mr. Katz and Claudia Goldin, a Harvard economist, have argued that advances in technology, while crucial to improving productivity and generating economic growth, also have exacerbated inequality by driving down wages of   workers. The rewards of education are greater than they have ever been, but advancement nationwide has slowed and the system confers many of its favors on the children of the affluent. If there is a bright spot in the new comprehensive research, it is that after taxes and government spending, the middle class is in better shape than previous studies had shown. That earlier research had missed growth in nontaxable income like employee benefits. “The real income of the middle class is a bit better than we thought,” Mr. Katz said. As troubling as some may find inequality, it is not necessarily the fault of a rigged system, said N. Gregory Mankiw, an economist at Harvard who is familiar with the new research. He argues that large disparities in income more often than not accurately reflect widely varying economic contributions. “Inequality is a symptom of a variety of things,” Mr. Mankiw said. Technological progress may be a cause, but it benefits society over all, whereas the weakness of the educational system is clearly negative. Edward Conard, the author of “The Upside of Inequality” and a former business partner of Mitt Romney, agreed. “People say this is   game, and you’re taking money that would have gone to the other 50 percent,” he said. “That’s not what happened. ” Instead, Mr. Conard said, entrepreneurs in the United States have been willing to take big risks that have helped foster an infrastructure that promotes innovation, not just in Silicon Valley but in many other growing places around the country. “When rewards go up, people are more inclined to take risks,” he said. Some of those risks pay off and create wealth for everyone. The new research challenges that contention, at least in part. Mr. Piketty, Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman concluded that the main driver of wealth in recent years has been investment income at the top. That is a switch from the 1980s and 1990s, when gains in income were primarily generated by working. That divergence can slow innovation and further entrench inequities, said Heather Boushey, an economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. When labor income provides the primary route to riches, it creates incentives for people to improve their education and work harder, Ms. Boushey explained. But if getting ahead requires already having a stockpile of cash or inheriting a windfall from your parents, then it is much harder to work your way up. “If you’re closing off entryways, then you are basically shutting off avenues to competitiveness, innovation and growth,” Ms. Boushey said, “even if you don’t care about fairness. ”",0
7975,President Trump Demands Investigation After Nancy Pelosi Lies About 2010 Meeting With Russian Ambassador - Breitbart,"A photo published on the Politico website shows House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( ) meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in 2010  —   a direct contradiction to her telling reporters at the website she had not met with the diplomat. [After tweeting on Friday morning that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( . Y.) should be investigated for meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2003, President Donald Trump tweeted that a second investigation into Pelosi’s past should be launched.  I hereby demand a second investigation, after Schumer, of Pelosi for her close ties to Russia, and lying about it. https:  .   —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2017,  “I hereby demand a second investigation, after Schumer, of Pelosi for her close ties to Russia, and lying about it,” Trump tweeted on Friday. “Not with this Russian ambassador, no,” Pelosi told Politico’s Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer during a Playbook interview, when asked if she’d ever met with the Russian envoy. “But a file photo from Pelosi’s 2010 meeting with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev shows Kislyak at the table across from Pelosi  —   then House Speaker  —   and Rep. Steny Hoyer ( . ),” Politico reported. “Medvedev had been in the country for a meeting with President Barack Obama a day earlier and stopped in on Capitol Hill to meet with congressional leaders as well. ” “Asked to square Pelosi’s comments with the photo of the meeting, a spokesman said that Pelosi had simply meant she never had a solo meeting with Kislyak,” Politico reported. “Of course, that’s what she meant,” Pelosi’s spokesman Drew Hammill said. “She has never had a private    with him. ” Politico reported: Pelosi’s explanation is similar to one offered by Sen. Claire McCaskill Thursday, after she swiped at Attorney General Jeff Sessions for privately meeting with Kislyak in 2016 and failing to disclose it when asked about communications with Russians during his confirmation proceedings in January. Sessions has emphasized that meetings with ambassadors are common for lawmakers and that he met with Kislyak in his capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. McCaskill tweeted that in her 10 years serving on the Armed Services Committee she had never “ever” met with Kislyak, but walked back her comment by using the same reasoning as Pelosi, saying she had never met with him   .",0
7976,Samsung sales double in Pakistan after reports of exploding devices,"Samsung sales double in Pakistan after reports of exploding devices Posted on Tweet (Image via mirror.uk) 
Amidst reports of plummeting mobile phone sales, widespread losses, exploding Note 7s, J5s and washing machines, Samsung might have found a morally depressing silver lining. Our correspondent understands from his sources that Pakistani businessmen, investors, realtors and dealers have expressed interest to invest in faulty Samsung devices. 
One Pakistani businessman, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said, “Yeah, I am one of the biggest traders in my district. I’ve dealt with guns, grenades, IEDs, but never something as innovative as an exploding cell phone. You have no idea how tough it is to smuggle such goods through airports. As it is, our potential recruits are dumb enough to scan themselves , so forget the thought of taking weapons past the scanner. But if we manage to get to get a few phones, it will be revolutionary!” 
Another, an investor whose line of work involves making losses by financing suicide-bomb teachers and trainees, is glad that his colleagues are trying to use phones instead of the regular IEDs. “Teachers and trainees are less likely to die by the explosion of a single phone and I might have a chance of getting my money back,” he exclaimed, with an expression of delight on his face that is seen only when he looks at goats. 
Realtors of Pakistan (No, not the kind who sell land like in the rest of the world) are overjoyed by the thought of burying washing machines instead of landmines, which they claim are far less expensive and far more beautiful to look at. 
Sources also add that lobbies in Pakistan wanted their government to ink MoUs with Samsung to import their Note 7s and washing machines, but didn’t as they aren’t sure who’s running their government. 
Samsung hasn’t commented on the interest shown by Pakistanis yet. Indian sources expect that they will dignify Pakistan with a (non-)response the same way the United Nations responds to Nawaz Sharif for his ‘Mummy!-India-used-my-rubber’-type complaints.",0
7977,"Trump Begins Speech with Black History Month, Slams Antisemitism","President Donald Trump opened his highly anticipated address to a special joint session of Congress on Tuesday evening with a message of tolerance, reminding the country about Black History Month and condemning recent antisemitic attacks. [He said:  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and Citizens of America: Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our Nation’s path toward civil rights and the work that still remains.  Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week’s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a Nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms. [Applause] Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice  —    in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present. That torch is now in our hands.  And we will use it to light up the world.  I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. Both sides of the aisle rose to their feet as he condemned hate, evil, and antisemitism, though few Democrats applauded. Female Democrats wore white, an apparent reference to the suffragettes of a century ago (many of whom were Republicans).

7978,Mitch McConnell Won’t Rule Out Rescinding His Endorsement of Donald Trump - The New York Times,"The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, would not rule out the possibility of rescinding his endorsement of Donald J. Trump’s presidential bid down the road, and he described the candidate as lacking knowledge in a number of areas in an interview released on Friday. The comments from Mr. McConnell, in an interview with the “Masters in Politics” podcast on Bloomberg Politics, came as Republicans down the ballot continue to face questions about Mr. Trump’s criticism of the   federal judge overseeing a case against Trump University as “Mexican. ” Mr. McConnell has been pointed in his criticism of those remarks. It was the first time, though, that Mr. McConnell offered anything less than an ironclad response of sticking with Mr. Trump, despite the numerous controversies that the presumptive Republican nominee has instigated. Asked if there was a line that Mr. Trump could cross that would prompt Mr. McConnell to rescind his endorsement, Mr. McConnell demurred. “I’m not going to speculate about what he might say or what I might do,” said the senator from Kentucky. “But I think it’s pretty clear. I’ve been very clear publicly about how I think he ought to change directions, and I hope that’s what we’re going to see. ” This week, Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois, one of the most vulnerable Republicans in the Senate, withdrew his endorsement of Mr. Trump over the remarks about Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel. Senator Lindsey Graham, who has not endorsed Mr. Trump, urged other Republicans to follow Mr. Kirk’s lead. At another point, Mr. McConnell said that he was “comfortable” with supporting Mr. Trump at the moment, suggesting that the candidate would face checks and balances that could curtail him should he get elected. “For all of his obvious shortcomings, Donald Trump is certainly a different direction, and I think if he is in the White House he’ll have to respond to the    world which elected him, and the things that we believe in,” Mr. McConnell said. “So I’m comfortable supporting him. ” But he condemned Mr. Trump’s lack of preparedness, and said that he will need to factor that into his choice of running mate. “He needs someone highly experienced and very knowledgeable because it’s pretty obvious he doesn’t know a lot about the issues,” Mr. McConnell said. “You see that in the debates in which he’s participated. It’s why I have argued to him publicly and privately that he ought to use a script more often  —   there is nothing wrong with having prepared texts. ”",0
7979,Ex-Chief of VW Holds Firm During Grilling on Emissions Deception - The New York Times,"BERLIN  —   Volkswagen’s former chief executive, Martin Winterkorn, yielded no ground on Thursday during a polite grilling by German lawmakers over the carmaker’s   deception, but he astonished them by insisting that he had not heard the term “defeat device” before September 2015, when the scandal broke. Appearing in public for the first time since he resigned over the case, Mr. Winterkorn, who worked at the company for more than 35 years, contended, as he has all along, that he had not been aware of any wrongdoing. But his assertions are increasingly difficult to defend after Volkswagen pleaded guilty in the United States last week to criminal charges that included conspiracy to defraud the government, violations of the Clean Air Act and obstruction of justice. The company is paying $20 billion to resolve civil and criminal charges related to the scandal. Mr. Winterkorn, who has not been charged, was chief executive throughout the decade when, as Volkswagen now admits, employees devised software, known as a “defeat device,” that could hide excess pollutants during testing by regulators. The employees, including several   managers, covered up the wrongdoing for years. But in his comments on Thursday, Mr. Winterkorn reiterated that he had not known of the efforts to evade emissions rules. “How striving for perfection could end this way” mystified and preoccupied him, Mr. Winterkorn told a parliamentary committee charged with investigating the scandal and with determining if the German government had been aware of it before the news broke. “The unthinkable has happened and we must all deal with it. ” It was doubly difficult to imagine, Mr. Winterkorn said, because he had been in daily contact with employees and “never did I have the impression that anyone was afraid to speak an open word with me. ” Whether Mr. Winterkorn knew of the emissions cheating and   is a crucial question for Volkswagen, even though he no longer leads the company. Any culpability on his part would make the company more vulnerable to lawsuits by shareholders, who accuse the leadership of failing to properly disclose the risks it was taking. The lawsuits seek billions of dollars in damages. Volkswagen’s plea agreement with the Justice Department in Washington last week left no doubt that the fraud was the work of dozens, if not hundreds, of employees, rather than the result of a handful of rogue engineers as the company had first claimed. The settlement calls for the carmaker to pay $4. 3 billion in civil and criminal penalties to the American government. The company did not say in the plea agreement that a member of the management board had known of the emissions cheating and cover up. But several people indicted by American authorities last week had reported directly to Mr. Winterkorn, raising questions of what he had known. Those indicted last week are among company employees suspected of a     that included feeding reams of false data to federal and state regulators, who in 2014 began asking questions about emissions by diesel cars made by Volkswagen. When it became clear in   that accusations of fraud would soon be made public, a company lawyer prompted at least 40 employees to destroy potentially incriminating documents, according to the plea agreement. In 90 minutes of questioning on Thursday, Mr. Winterkorn provided details on a variety of issues related to Volkswagen’s business, but he was vague when asked about the emissions scandal and whom he had informed about it. In part, he was doing the German equivalent of invoking the Fifth Amendment in the United States, citing an investigation by state prosecutors in Braunschweig, a city close to the carmaker’s headquarters in Wolfsburg. The authorities in Braunschweig are considering pursuing a case against Mr. Winterkorn. But the former chief executive also repeatedly replied, “I am not aware,” or “I don’t know,” when asked about conversations with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Ferdinand Piëch, the chairman of Volkswagen’s supervisory board until late April 2015. Mr. Winterkorn said that he had informed Mr. Piëch in March 2015 about a recall in the United States of up to 500, 000 vehicles, a move consistent with his reputation for staying close to the chairman of the supervisory board. He added, however, that he had not known the exact reason for the recall, and that he therefore could not have relayed it to Mr. Piëch. Members of the parliamentary committee voiced surprise and disappointment over Mr. Winterkorn’s testimony. “He missed a really good chance to shed more light,” said Ulrich Lange, a Christian Social Union lawmaker. Herbert Behrens, the chairman of the parliamentary committee investigating the issue, described being incredulous when Mr. Winterkorn said he had not heard of the term “defeat device” before the scandal broke. There is some reason to doubt Mr. Winterkorn’s assertion. Mr. Gottweis, a Volkswagen executive who specialized in solving technical emergencies around the world, warned in a memo in May 2014 that American regulators were likely to investigate “whether Volkswagen implemented a test detection system in the engine control unit software (  defeat device). ” The memo was included in a stack of weekend reading given to Mr. Winterkorn at the time, but Volkswagen has said it was not clear if Mr. Winterkorn had read it. Mr. Gottweis reported directly to Mr. Winterkorn, however, and it is deemed unlikely that a warning from an executive known internally as “the fireman” would have been ignored.",0

7981,10 Free (or Cheap) Travel Apps Worth Downloading - The New York Times,"After a week of downloading and trying out various travel and navigation apps, I reached an unfortunate conclusion: Most of them are worthless  —   clunky, buggy, seemingly desultory efforts by developers rushing a poor product to market. There are a few, though, that provide elegant solutions to some of travel’s more common complications, doing what a good app should do: make life easier. Here are seven free travel apps that are worth your time, and three that are worth your money. Hotspot Shield VPN A VPN, or virtual private network, can be used to bolster online security as well as to access resources that might otherwise be  . I’ve found it particularly useful when I’m in countries that block certain websites. When I was in Bulgaria, for instance, the ticket resale website StubHub is blocked, as is Southwest Airlines. Why, I have no idea, but I had a Southwest reservation that I needed to manage. Using the VPN, I could circumvent the block by connecting with a server in a country that doesn’t have those restrictions. It’s not 100 percent reliable, and there are ads you’ll get better service and faster load times with a VPN that you pay for. (Hotspot Shield VPN does have an “Elite” option, with faster servers and no ads, that costs $29. 99 per year.) Memrise Are you going to become fluent in French before your trip to Paris? Of course not, but that doesn’t mean you can’t commit a few choice phrases to memory. Memrise, developed by the memory champ Ed Cooke and Greg Detre, a Princeton neuroscientist, makes learning languages fun and strangely addictive through its mix of flashcards and audiovisual games. Users of the free app can choose from among dozens of language courses, some of which are better   than others. The romance languages, including French and Spanish, are all very good. There’s also an entertaining option called “The Partial Polyglot,” which teaches you a few choice words and phrases in multiple languages. (Memrise offers a “Pro” option, with more features, for $59. 99 per year.) Avast Photo Space Many of us have faced the predicament of running out of room on our phones and have been forced to choose pictures to delete. Avast Photo Space is a new app that aims to eliminate this quandary by connecting to Dropbox or a Google Drive account and uploading the original,   photos for safekeeping. You’re left with a     copy of the picture on your phone. While Avast worked well for me  —   I was able to upload 100 photos and free up almost 200MB of space on my phone  —   there are complaints that the app is slow and buggy. An update was introduced on June 25 that clears up some of these issues, but you may want to wait another release or two before investing your time (and photos) in the app. Flight Stats Despite their popularity, you don’t ever need to pay for a flight status app. You can easily Google the information, and if you really need an app to do it for you, FlightStats is the only one you need. The last time I used it, it nailed the time of my flight’s departure, almost down to the minute. FlightStats allows you to search by flight number, airport and route, and provides basic    information at your departure and destination cities. Units Plus The interface is a little simplistic, but this is the best free currency and units converter that I’ve used. While the app is open, it downloads currency exchange rates every 15 minutes, keeping it remarkably   . It will also convert weight, volume, area, distance and nearly anything else you can think of. There is an   version available for $2. 99. 5 Every Day It’s a situation we all find ourselves in from time to time: You just want to be told where to go and what to do. Claire Evans and Jona Bechtolt of the indie band Yacht created an app that curates a list of five    path events, restaurants and activities in Los Angeles every day of the year. You’ll get suggestions for theatrical productions, hikes, a Chuck Klosterman reading or dive bars you didn’t know about. The app is simple and intuitive, and mines the city’s events calendar for interesting  . 5 Every Day is free, but allows for the unlimited “ ” of events (that is, saving them for later) for an additional $1. 99. It’s Los   for now, but hopefully will expand to other cities. Mobile Passport This app from Customs and Border Protection does away with the annoyance of that long customs form you get before arriving in the United States  —   you keep your passport information and answer all the customs questions on this app. Once you land, you submit your   to customs  —   no more paper slips (you will have to do this every time you   the United States, however). Best of all, you get to skip the line and use a dedicated mobile passport lane  —   at least at the airports where this is in place (about a dozen locations right now, including Kennedy, Newark Liberty and Chicago O’Hare, with plans for expansion). Touchnote If you’re no good at remembering to send postcards when you’re traveling, this app will do nearly all the work for you. Select any picture from your camera roll, and Touchnote will turn it into a postcard and mail it to any location in the world with a working postal service. You can add a personalized message on the back, just as you would on an actual postcard. It’s not perfect  —   a matte finish option would be nice  —   but that’s a minor complaint. It’s not as exciting as getting a stamp from a foreign country, but if you don’t have time to find a post office, or want to send a customized postcard, this app will do the trick. $1. 50 to $2. 99 per card. Packing Pro Do you like to get organized? Like, really organized? Then Packing Pro is the app for you. It breaks down your   routine in such a granular way it’s almost impossible to forget anything. Lists for clothes, accessories, medical needs and toiletries are all available, as well as the ability to set priorities, organize and even photograph clothing and other items you need to bring (or purchase before you leave). Lists can be reused, making it easy to get a solid travel organization regime down pat. $2. 99. Human Resource Machine If you’re anything like me, you occasionally need a puzzle game to get you through a particularly arduous flight or bus trip. Human Resource Machine is perfect for those who like logic puzzles  —   the game is essentially set up as a series of cartoony programming challenges, and you have to create progressively more complicated lines of “code” to complete them. This is not a   Candy   game, mind you  —   it demands brainpower. $4. 99 in the App store.",0
7982,"Donald Trump Assails His Accusers as Liars, and Unattractive - The New York Times","Donald J. Trump wielded his presidential candidacy on Friday as a weapon for savaging detractors and venting personal grievances, attacking the women who have accused him of sexual assault and unwelcome advances and railing against what he described as a vast conspiracy against him by the news media and Hillary Clinton’s campaign. With a campaign speech in North Carolina that whirled from one target to the next, Mr. Trump accelerated his shift away from courting swing voters or delivering a message aimed at the political mainstream. Instead, after weeks on the defensive, battered by disclosures about his treatment of women and about his business dealings, Mr. Trump appeared increasingly consumed with the idea that he has been wronged and bent on convincing his fans that sinister forces are to blame for his political decline. Mr. Trump told the restive crowd that his advisers wanted him to focus on his core economic message, but that he had no intention of allowing his critics to go unanswered. “My people always say: ‘Oh, don’t talk about it. Talk about jobs. Talk about the economy,’” Mr. Trump said. “But I feel I have to talk about them, because you have to dispute when somebody says something,” he added of the allegations against him. “Fortunately, we have the microphone. We’re able to dispute some people can’t. ” Even as two more women came forward on Friday to say he had groped them, Mr. Trump dismissed the mounting accusations as “total fiction” and “lies, lies, lies. ” He assailed the motives of the women speaking out against him, and seemed to mock two of them as not attractive enough to draw his interest. “Believe me, she would not be my first choice,” Mr. Trump said of Jessica Leeds, who said Mr. Trump groped her on an airplane in the 1980s. He referred to Ms. Leeds, now 74, as “that horrible woman. ” He was similarly dismissive of Natasha Stoynoff, a former writer for People magazine, who accused Mr. Trump of physically accosting her during an interview. “Check out her Facebook page, you’ll understand,” he said. Mr. Trump also ridiculed his opponent in the presidential race, Mrs. Clinton, for saying that he had crowded her physically during their last debate, and he seemed to offer an insult about her physique. When Mrs. Clinton walked in front of him, he told a crowd in Greensboro, N. C. “Believe me, I wasn’t impressed. ” And as he blasted the women who have made allegations against him as fabricators, Mr. Trump suggested that perhaps someone should make similar claims against President Obama next. “Why doesn’t some woman, maybe, come up and say what they say falsely about me  —   they could say it about him,” Mr. Trump said. Though Mr. Trump has said he will provide information to refute his accusers’ stories wholesale, he offered no such evidence in North Carolina. He has also loudly threatened to sue multiple publications for printing the stories of his accusers, but as of Friday evening no such suit had been filed. Mr. Trump made only passing reference to the newest accusations against him. In an interview with The Washington Post, a woman named Kristin Anderson said Mr. Trump had slipped his hand beneath her skirt and grabbed her genitals at a Manhattan nightclub in the early 1990s. Mr. Trump’s spokeswoman denied the account, and Mr. Trump said in his speech that certain details were implausible because he rarely sits alone at nightclubs. But The Post did not say Ms. Anderson had described Mr. Trump as being alone. A second woman, Summer Zervos, a Republican and a former contestant on “The Apprentice,” said at a news conference in Los Angeles that Mr. Trump had tried to seduce her over dinner at a hotel in 2007, grabbing her breasts and thrusting his pelvis into her body. Ms. Zervos, 41, appeared alongside Gloria Allred, the celebrity litigator and a Democrat who was a delegate for Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Trump denied in a statement several hours later that he ever had a meeting with Ms. Zervos at a hotel or “greeted her inappropriately. ” He again attacked the media and said he would “take my message directly to the American people. ” The claims against Mr. Trump have gained a momentum of their own since the revelation on Oct. 7 of a recording in which he boasted to a television host about sexually assaulting women. That tape led to the direct questioning of Mr. Trump, at Sunday’s debate, about whether he had ever actually done the things he described. Mr. Trump’s denial prompted Ms. Leeds to come forward in an interview with The New York Times Ms. Anderson said Ms. Leeds had inspired her to tell her story. After learning of Ms. Leeds’s story, Ms. Anderson told The Post, she decided: “Let me just back these girls up. ” By lashing out in multiple directions and presenting himself as the target of a corrupt plot, Mr. Trump may deepen his emotional bond with voters who have turned to him as a kind of political wrecking ball aimed at Washington. But it is an unlikely strategy for improving his standing with the majority of voters who say in polls that he is   to the presidency and biased against women and minorities. Democrats have called the charges women have made against Mr. Trump disqualifying. On Thursday in New Hampshire, Michelle Obama said she had been shaken by Mr. Trump’s cavalier bragging about assault. Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood and a prominent Clinton supporter, predicted women would revolt against Mr. Trump’s remarks in North Carolina. “If they weren’t already convinced, today proved to Americans that Donald Trump is an abusive and vindictive monster,” Ms. Richards said. “With every ugly and violent insult that comes out of his mouth, Trump loses a vote, and our country gains a feminist. ” Leading Republicans have already pulled back from his campaign, and new signs of distance emerged on Friday between Mr. Trump and the party he nominally leads. Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, who is seeking   released a television commercial saying he has “a lot of disagreements” with Mr. Trump. And in a closely fought congressional race in central New York, the National Republican Congressional Committee has an ad vowing that its candidate, Claudia Tenney, will “stand up to Hillary Clinton”  —   implying that Mrs. Clinton will be the next president. Paul D. Ryan, the speaker of the House, who announced this week that he would no longer defend Mr. Trump, ignored him entirely in a speech to college Republicans in Wisconsin. Mr. Ryan criticized Mrs. Clinton and Democratic policies, but made no case for his own party’s nominee. Mr. Trump, who has savaged Mr. Ryan repeatedly this week, declined to revisit their conflict on Friday afternoon. But Mr. Trump escalated his war on the news media, and unveiled a theory that The New York Times was attacking him at the behest of a Mexican billionaire, Carlos Slim, who is the largest individual holder of New York Times Company common shares. Reporters for the newspaper, Mr. Trump said, should be seen as “corporate lobbyists for Carlos Slim and Hillary Clinton. ” “No media is more corrupt than the failing New York Times,” he said. Mr. Trump’s bitter attacks on the news media, and Mr. Slim in particular, seem to echo the precise language used by two of his advisers, Stephen K. Bannon and Roger Stone, who have long cast Mr. Slim as an ominous presence in the American news media. In a statement, Arthur Sulzberger Jr. publisher of The Times, said Mr. Slim had no involvement in the paper’s news coverage. “Carlos Slim is an excellent shareholder who fully respects boundaries regarding the independence of our journalism,” Mr. Sulzberger said. “He has never sought to influence what we report. ” Mr. Trump has spoken in ever more apocalyptic tones in recent days as his poll numbers have fallen: describing Mrs. Clinton as deserving incarceration warning that the election will be rigged and suggesting that international bankers are colluding to bring about his defeat.

7985,Russia Could Invade Your Fridge Within 48 Hours,"0 Add Comment 
A NATO general has warned today that Russia could invade your fridge within 48 hours, stating that the majority of European homes currently have no real defence plan to repel the invasion. 
Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, former Prime Minister of Norway, claimed Russia could empty your fridge of food and cold beverages in the ‘blink of an eye’, leaving your entire family starving to death in the kitchen. 
“The Russians would probably start on the essential food produce like milk, butter and eggs first, before cracking into the items in the freezer,” claimed Stoltenberg, “Imagine waking up to find no milk for tea? Your whole day would be ruined. That’s Russia for you; they don’t care about your tea. They will invade your fridge and leave you with nothing”. 
The NATO chief warned that the failure of countries such as France, Germany and Italy to take the threat of Russian aggression seriously could lead to a future loss of breakfast, lunch and dinner in millions of homes. 
Speaking to several fridge owners on the street today, WWN asked whether families are prepared for an imminent Russian fridge invasion, and what they would do if such a terrible thing happened here. 
“I’d probably go to the shop and buy more food,” said one frightened woman we spoke to, who will probably purchase some kind of fridge locking mechanism later today, “I could think of worse things to happen, if I’m honest. It’s just a fridge, like”. 
Along with today’s fridge warning, NATO has also asked Eastern European countries to check under their beds every night for Russian invaders, and if there is any suspicious activity to contact one of the many local US military bases in the area.",0
7986,"THIS Test Will Tell If You Are An Indigo, A Crystal Or A Rainbow Child!","Many people believe that there has been a wave of individuals being born in order to change the old ‘Iron’ and industrial way of life to more ‘enlightened’ and spiritual. You’ve probably heard about ‘ Indigo Children ’ and ‘ Lightworkers ’ across the internet.

Lightworkers are just a consequence the ways of the modern world have brought to the human psyche.


A Lightworker is a person who can sense that there’s a lot of healing to be done on a large scale to the world. The modern ways of life are disharmonious and harmful to ourselves and Nature, which we are all a part of. This results in subconscious awareness that something needs to be done, especially in people who are born into the modern society.

Newer generations are unbound from ‘the chains’ people who were constructing the modern society have been imprisoned with. The chains I am referring to are actually their investment of energy, their mindset and character developed in a different era, with far less available information. These new generations can clearly see the bigger picture and what doesn’t work. That’s why they have a heightened sense to fix the world.

Just like there are popular terms in the science community addressing these new generations as ‘generation x’, ‘generation y’and ‘generation z’, there are terms in the spiritual movement addressing these generations as ‘ Indigo Children ’, ‘ Crystal Children ’ and ‘ Rainbow Children ’.


WHAT KIND OF LIGHTWORKER ARE YOU? 


Check what kind of lightworker you are. 

What aspect has most traits that describe you? 

INDIGO CHILDREN: 
Born between the 1960s and the 1990s; Rebellious and warrior in spirit; Despises the system; Loves to isolate; Fond to addictions; Stubborn; 
CRYSTAL CHILDREN: Born between 1980s and 2000s; Strong and pure hearted; Highly developed imagination and creativity; Extremely empathetic and emotional; Passionate about supernatural phenomena and superheroes; Easygoing; 
RAINBOW CHILDREN: Born after the new millennium; Positive and happy; Technologically advanced and easy in understanding new gadgets; Loving and hard to contain; Loves animals, Nature and possibly vegan; Free; 
THIS IS WHAT THESE LABELS MEAN: 

Indigo children are born between the 1960s and the 1990s really similar as the baby boomers of the generation x.

They are rebellious and unable to conform to dysfunctional situations at home, work, or school. They are warriors in spirit.

They want to rage against the corrupted system that governs society and this trait projected itself into the art, the music, the movies, the movements and the lifestyle of their youth.

They experimented with psychedelic substances, they forced their mind to be opened.

All of this resulted in creation of new businesses and inventions that changed the future forever, like the internet.


Crystal children are most likely to be the children of people from generation x. They are born around 1990s and 2000s slightly differing from generation y which addresses people born between 1980s and 2000s. However, the characteristics of crystal children and generation y individuals are almost exactly the same.

They are intuitive, spiritually aware and passionate about supernatural subjects. They have highly developed imagination and creativity. They understand things easily, they are extremely empathetic and very easy going. This contradictive schism between their emotions forces them to use drugs, to visit psychiatrists, feel high levels of anxiety, have panic attacks and sometimes even more serious issues with their mental health.

They are born in a transition time, in a period where humanity made its biggest leap with technological advancement which affected all areas of society. They grew up in times without internet and times when you cannot imagine how you lived without internet. This transition happened in only 10 years period, which is REALLY small amount of time for such great change. This affected their way of seeing the world. It’s like they were forced to raise their consciousness in an accelerated rate. But that’s ok because they are strong enough, like crystals. They always see the world with pure eyes, which additionally adds to their ‘crystal children’ description.

Because of their imagination, purity of heart and strength, they are attracted to the superhero phenomena. Their art, music, movies, businesses, even their lifestyles are inspired and driven by various superheroes they idolized while they were growing up.


Rainbow children are the newest generation of people, or generation z, born after the new millennium.

They are modern and more technologically advanced than generation x and y because they are raised in a period where humans are more connected than any time in the known human history. They had almost all of the information in the world available to them while they were growing up, only by pushing few buttons.

These kids are happy and positive. They are like a breath of fresh air. They are bringing happiness and joy to the whole world through various inventions, platforms and mediums that the generation x has developed and generation y perfected.

Their light and positivity makes them freer than any generation in modern history. They love traveling, they hate being tied up to one person and they cannot stand the old conformistic ways. It feel like prison to them. Think of them like light; they give warmth, life and cannot be captured. Their whole being is pure and that’s why most of these kids are vegan.


THE GREATEST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE 3 GENERATIONS IS THIS: 


The Indigos are here to destroy what’s not working and pave the way for a better world.

The crystal children are the ones who need to create, develop and build the new ways uniting the best from the old and the new.

The rainbow children are here to give life and fertilize the new and improved world that’s in harmony with Nature and the human potential.

All of these 3 spiritual archetypes need to work together so there will be a real change to the way humanity further develops.

However, it doesn’t mean that if you are an indigo you cannot be a crystal or a rainbow child. You can evolve through all of these 3 archetypes depending on your environment, understanding and purpose. And a lot of people do.

These are simply 3 different aspects of one larger program called being a ‘Lightworker’ which works to heal the world.

HERE IS HOW WE ARE ALL A PART OF THIS SPIRITUAL REVOLUTION: 

This spiritual revolution is a consequence of the collective human psyche. To understand this you must understand how we are all connected. You must grasp the fact that EVERYTHING connects to everything else, even our thoughts.

Émile Durkheim first introduced the collective conscious back in 1893 and described as the set of shared beliefs, ideas and moral attitudes which operate as a unifying force within society. However, just like our collective conscious Carl Jung called a phenomena ‘Collective Unconscious’ which is the subconscious mind shared by all of humanity.

This is how we are all connected. This is how all of us, unintentionally created the perfect environment for ‘Lightworkers’ to be developed and act as an antidote to the virus that could have destroyed us. Maybe that was the defensive mechanism of our collective subconsciounsess or a higher plan of our collective psyche to help us thrive together as species.

7987,"Ultra Runner Karl Meltzer Sets Appalachian Trail Record, Fueled by Beer and Candy - The New York Times","At a time when “endurance running” no longer means mere marathons  —   and even   races are attracting the masses  —   Karl Meltzer, a former   bartender, has proved he can suffer longer and faster than almost anyone else. When he staggered onto Springer Mountain in Georgia before dawn Sunday, Meltzer set a record for completing the Appalachian Trail. He covered the 2, 190 miles over 14 states in 45 days 22 hours 38 minutes. Meltzer, 48, is a little different from other titans of the newly booming   scene. He is six years older than Scott Jurek, who was featured in the   book about   endurance running, “Born to Run”  —   and who set the former Appalachian Trail record last year (46 days 8 hours 7 minutes). In a sport checkered with mantras like “clean living,” Jurek sustained his trek on a vegan diet. Staples of Meltzer’s diet, by contrast, included Red Bull and Tang. Jurek incurred a $500 fine and public outrage for opening champagne at the summit of Mount Katahdin in Maine during his record run. When Meltzer finished Sunday, he walked down the mountain, sat in a chair and sated himself with pepperoni pizza and a beer. It was the latest milestone in an unusual professional racing career. Meltzer moved to Utah to ski in 1989 and started running the next year. He came to   racing in his late 20s. Primarily a skier, he worked as a bartender at the Snowbird ski resort but took summers off to run. Now based in Sandy, Utah, he became an ultra runner in 1996 after completing a   race nearby in just over 28 hours. In a sport built on comparatives  —   faster, longer, more, more, more  —   his   trail race portfolio is formidable: He has won 38 of them, more than anyone else in the world. But the Appalachian Trail was a particular challenge. This was Meltzer’s third attempt at the record, and his first since Jurek set it last year. He tried once in 2008, finishing a week off the record in 2014 he dropped out with 600 miles left. This time, he capped each night with one or two beers and left from rest stops with   Spree candy, Three Musketeers chocolate bars and bacon in his pockets. To save time and keep his energy up, he typically slept less than seven hours a night and instead had an energy drink every 10 miles, downing about five a day. When on another day his support crew found him napping, they gave him a pint of ice cream for a boost. Though Meltzer averaged 50 miles in 15 hours of running a day, his pace faltered at times. At one point he slept on the trail instead of making it to his support van  —   and then he slept the next morning on the dirt again. But in the last two days, he gathered strength, running 83 miles nonstop in the final leg to finish Sunday morning at 3:38. His support crew said Meltzer was not available for an interview immediately after completing his run. He was sleeping.",0

7989,John Kerry Defends Iran Deal in San Francisco to Soros-Backed Group - Breitbart,"Former Secretary of State John Kerry defended the Iran nuclear deal on Monday evening at a gala dinner in San Francisco for the Ploughshares Fund, a George   group that was part of President Barack Obama’s “echo chamber” to sell the agreement to the public. [Kerry called the Iran deal’s monitoring processes a “system that’s working,” according to the San Francisco Chronicle, and criticized President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress for pushing for new sanctions against the Iranian regime.  “It doesn’t make sense, folks, to risk a step that gets us nothing,” Kerry said of proposed new sanctions on Iran’s ballistic missile program, according to the Chronicle. Kerry also blasted the Trump administration for withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accords, the Obama administration’s other major foreign policy legacy. He reportedly defended his 2014 remark that climate change was a “weapon of mass destruction” and a threat to national security. “Scientists, people whose life is invested in this are telling you, ‘This is growing in instability, and the threat is that whole parts of the ice sheet will break off. ’,” Kerry said, according to the Chronicle. As Breitbart News’ Aaron Klein reported a year ago, the Ploughshares Fund has been sponsoring national security coverage at National Public Radio (NPR) since 2005, as well as several think tanks that supported the Iran deal. It is also, Klein reported, funded in turn by George Soros’s Open Society Foundations. NPR’s ombudsman found it had not disclosed Ploughshares funding in reporting on the group and interviewing its president and sponsored experts. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

7990,‘Carrie’ Is Back. Like a Bloody Hand From the Grave. - The New York Times,"Released a few days after Halloween in 1976, it’s considered one of the great American horror films. A   hit with two Oscar nominations for acting, it contains one of the genre’s most memorable images and an ending that has been ripped off dozens of times. It also gave a career lift to a young novelist named Stephen King. Yet revisit “Carrie” 40 years later, as you can do on a new   version from Shout! Factory, and you might think, “This . .. is not that scary. ” A high school drama, yes. A resonant look at the emotional damage caused by bullying, yes. But a horror movie? Not so much. “I never really approached it as a horror movie,” said its director, Brian De Palma, who scored his first hit with the film. “It’s more of a character piece. She does go berserk after she gets hit with the bucket of blood, but until then, not really. What made this really good  —   both the book and the film  —   is that it capsulized everyone’s high school experience of being an outsider. ” Mr. King’s first published novel, “Carrie” (1974) focuses on the teenage daughter of a repressed religious mother. She is a loner, a victim of constant mockery and, oh yes, able to move things with her mind. Carrie has her first period in the school shower and is assaulted by classmates. After she goes to the senior prom with one of the most popular boys, then is doused with pig’s blood as a prank, she goes on a telekinetic rampage. Mr. King has written many doorstoppers, but “Carrie” is one of his shortest novels. “It’s really a simple story,” Mr. King said. “And people saw Carrie as an extreme case of what they went through in high school. ” Fresh out of college when he started the book, teaching high school English by day, Mr. King said he understood “it from both sides of the desk. There was a visceral sense that I was writing about something that I understood and felt deeply at the time. ” In the   few had heard of Mr. King, a teacher who had mainly published short stories in men’s magazines. Lawrence D. Cohen, then working for a movie producer in New York, had certainly never heard of him when he first came across the manuscript. He was later hired to write the screenplay after it was optioned by the producer Paul Monash. “I understood why critics were perplexed as to what genre ‘Carrie’ belonged to,” Mr. Cohen said. “Was it a high school movie, a   novel, a horror piece, a psychological thriller?” The film eventually landed at United Artists with Mr. De Palma as director. Holding joint auditions with George Lucas, who was then casting “Star Wars,” Mr. De Palma found a relatively   cast, including John Travolta, Betty Buckley, William Katt, Nancy Allen and Amy Irving. Though written in the novel as a “chunky girl” and a “frog among swans,” the screen Carrie was Sissy Spacek, who had starred in Terrence Malick’s first film, “Badlands” (1973). “The studio didn’t even want me to test Sissy,” Mr. De Palma said of Ms. Spacek, who had come to audition with Vaseline smeared in her hair to look greasy and unglamorous. “It’s probably the part she’ll be best remembered for even though she won an Oscar for another role. ” (Both Ms. Spacek and Piper Laurie, who played her mother, were nominated for “Carrie. ”) After decades of slasher flicks,   films and   movies, it’s surprising to see how much of “Carrie” is a naturalistic, compelling story about high school: shopping for prom clothes, cruising around town, serving detention, dancing first dances together. That bucket of blood doesn’t fall until the last 20 minutes. United Artists considered marketing it as a  . “They wanted to change the title to ‘Pray for Carrie,’ which is a very   title,” Mr. Cohen said. “And they ended up taking out an ad that was a poster of Carrie covered in blood, which was a spoiler before that word was used, but a clear way of selling the movie. I remember looking at it going, ‘They’ve lost their minds they’re giving away the whole movie. ’” In retrospect, the poster is a superb example of Alfred Hitchcock’s explanation of the difference between suspense and surprise  —   knowing a bomb will explode and tensing for it, versus having it blow up with no warning. Bloody Carrie is the bomb the audience saw before the movie even started. One reason “Carrie” is considered such an effective horror movie is its final two minutes, in which Ms. Irving’s good girl, Sue Snell, visits a grave and a hand shoots from the ground, sending audiences from the theater with one more scare. It was the last thing they remembered about the movie and the first thing they told friends. “What the ending did was establish Stephen King as a brand name for horror,” said Mr. Cohen, who also wrote a “Carrie” stage musical and the screenplay for the 2013 movie remake. The success of the original film boosted sales for the novel, and Mr. King’s next novel after the movie, “The Shining,” became his first hardcover best seller, and he was off. But Mr. King has never lost his view of high school as a place like the island in “Lord of the Flies. ” Those   hallways are the true dark corridors, and you don’t need to add too much to make it scarier than it already is. “I tell people, ‘If you look back on high school as the high point of your life,’” you’re one   American, Mr. King said, using rougher language. “Most of us look at high school as something we escaped. ”",0

Hillary Clinton released her tax records for 2015, showing that she and her husband paid an effective rate of 35 percent in federal taxes on income of $10. 6 million. The move increased pressure on Donald Trump to reveal his returns, the subject of political and financial speculation. Both candidates added details to their tax policies this week. Mr. Trump would ease business regulations and lower taxes for the wealthy, aiming to boost the economy. Mrs. Clinton would tax the wealthy more heavily and hold the rate for the bottom 95 percent steady. _____ 2. Mr. Trump said he was being sarcastic in labeling President Obama and Mrs. Clinton founders of the Islamic State, comments that appeared to play well at rallies but confused some conservatives. He held two more rallies in Pennsylvania, which has voted Democratic in the last six presidential elections but is crucial to his strategy. Above, Reince Priebus, the head of the Republican National Committee, introduced him in Erie. Our   podcast today features the   writer Thomas Friedman, discussing his column on Mr. Trump’s “Second Amendment” comment. _____ 3.

A merchant in the city described long lines for gas, bare shelves at groceries and hospitals crammed with wounded soldiers, militiamen and residents. “Hopefully there will be an end to the Syrian civilians’ misery,” a doctor said, “but we can’t see a light in the future. ” _____ 5. Vladimir Putin surprised   by dismissing his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov, above left, a trusted aide for over four decades. His replacement, Anton Vaino, fits with a recent pattern of younger loyalists displacing an older generation of Mr. Putin’s peers. The Russian president “does not need advice, he needs people who will carry out his orders with as little fuss as possible,” one analyst said. _____ 6. Fox News started rebuilding its leadership, naming two veteran executives as   three weeks after Roger Ailes was forced out over accusations of sexual harassment. One of them, Bill Shine, figured along with other executives in descriptions of a culture of intimidation given by women who accused Mr. Ailes of harassment.

7992,Fox Sports’ Shannon Sharpe Urges Patriots to Boycott White House Visit After Super Bowl LI Win - Breitbart,"Shannon Sharpe,   of Fox Sports’ “Skip and Shannon: Undisputed,” advised members of the New England Patriots to boycott the visit to the White House they earned by winning Super Bowl LI. [During his Wednesday broadcast, Sharpe and   Skip Bayless discussed the dilemma some members of the Patriots have expressed over their visit to Donald Trump’s White House. During the discussion Sharpe said that the entire team should unite with a boycott and send a message by breaking the Super Bowl championship tradition.  The hosts revealed that two members of the Patriots have already said they won’t be going to Washington both Martellus Bennett and Devin McCourty have announced their intention to skip the team’s White House visit. Sharpe said that McCourtney in particular had given “very sound, resonating ” reasons for his decision.  Sharpe excused his thought to turn the Super Bowl into a platform for Black Lives   politics, insisting that athletes don’t want to “stick to sports” any more. “Athletes in today’s time, we’re starting to see athletes saying ‘I do not only want athletic greatness, I want moral greatness as well.’ See, he’s thinking with his conscience and his heart,” Sharpe said. “A lot of the things going on, a lot of the policies being implemented doesn’t necessarily affect him directly,” Sharpe continued. “He’s financially secure, the NFL pays for his insurance. So currently, he’s really not affected by this  —   but these athletes of today’s time say ‘there’s something greater,’ there’s no more ‘just stick to sports.’ You hear that a lot, Skip. ‘Just stick to sports. ’” Sharpe claimed that many athletes are simply acting like “prudent human beings” and have decided what is going on in American society today is “not acceptable. ” And I cannot in good conscience, although we won this as a team  —   and I would love to share in this moment as a team  —   I cannot in good conscience go. Because what I think this president is standing for, what he’s saying, the policies he’s implementing are harming the minority communities. I am a minority. Whether it be black, the Latino community, the immigration ban, LGBT  —   whatever it may be, you’re starting to see athletes take a much more of a stance. Because in the past, if you had a brand, you were making money, you do not do anything to upset the   or the people that’s buying that product. You keep your mouth shut. Ultimately, Sharpe decided that being on the “wrong side of history” needs to be avoided. Now, with this president, President Trump, in office, he’s going to ask you to ask an honest question of yourself. ‘What side of history do you want to be on?’ Are you going to be on the side of history that’s a bridge and that’s trying to bring people together, or are you a part of the wall, that’s trying to tear people apart? That’s the question that athletes are asking themselves, and you’re starting to see more and more saying ‘you know what? I want to be on the side of history that’s positive, that’s bringing people together. ” Sharpe said that the members of the Patriots refusing to go to the White House “are to be commended. ” Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.",0
7993,Texas Open-Carry Laws Blurred Lines Between Suspects and Marchers - The New York Times,"DALLAS  —   As a demonstration against police shootings made its way downtown here on Thursday, it differed from others around the country in one startling way: Twenty to 30 of the marchers showed up with   and other types of   rifles and wore them openly, with the straps slung across their shoulders and backs. In Texas, it was not only legal. It was commonplace. The state has long been a bastion of   sentiment and the kind of place where both Democrats and Republicans openly talk about the guns they own and carry, on their person, in their vehicles, at their offices, at their homes and even in the halls of the Texas Capitol. And in recent years, as gun rights continued to expand, activists have exploited a   freedom to openly carry a rifle in public by showing up at demonstrations with their   long guns. Advocates have carried their rifles at the Alamo in San Antonio and outside mosques in the Dallas suburbs. But city and county leaders said the presence of armed protesters openly carrying rifles on Thursday through downtown Dallas had created confusion for the police as the attack unfolded, and in its immediate aftermath made it more difficult for officers to distinguish between suspects and marchers. Two men who were armed and a woman who was with them were detained, fueling an early, errant theory by the police that there was more than one gunman. Mayor Mike Rawlings of Dallas suggested in an interview on Sunday that, in the wake of the attack, he supported tightening the state’s gun laws to restrict the carrying of rifles and shotguns in public. “There should be some way to say I shouldn’t be bringing my shotgun to a Mavericks game or to a protest because something crazy should happen,” said Mr. Rawlings, a Democrat. “I just want to come back to common sense. ” The state’s   culture, the mayor said, had imperiled people on the streets of Dallas. “This is the first time  —   but a very concrete time  —   that I think a law can hurt citizens, police and not protect them,” he said, adding that he was not   and that he owned a shotgun himself. “I think it’s amazing when you think that there is a gunfight going on, and you are supposed to be able to sort who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. ” According to the authorities, Micah Johnson, 25, opened fire on police officers who were accompanying marchers protesting policing practices. Mr. Johnson, who had been in the Army Reserve, used a rifle to fire from a parking garage and while on foot on the streets below, killing five police officers. The Dallas police chief, David O. Brown, described to CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday the amount of confusion the armed protesters initially caused. He said the event had attracted “20 or 30 people” who “showed up with   rifles slung across their shoulder. ” “They were wearing gas masks,” Mr. Brown said. “They were wearing bulletproof vests and camo fatigues, for effect, for whatever reason. ” When the shooting started, “they began to run,” he said. And because they ran in the middle of the shooting, he said, the police on the scene viewed them as suspects. “Someone is shooting at you from a perched position, and people are running with   and camo gear and gas masks and bulletproof vests, they are suspects, until we eliminate that. ” “Doesn’t make sense to us, but that’s their right in Texas,” he said. He did not say whether he supported restricting the carrying of rifles on the streets. On Saturday, President Obama also told reporters that one of the challenges for the Dallas officers who were being shot at was that Texas was an   state. “Imagine if you’re a police officer and you’re trying to sort out who is shooting at you and there are a bunch of people who have got guns on them,” Mr. Obama said. One of the state’s most prominent   activists, C. J. Grisham, the founder and president of Open Carry Texas, disputed the extent of the confusion caused by marchers carrying rifles. In videos from the scene, he said, “you can see that police are walking right past people who are   rifles and it’s not a problem. So obviously it’s not that difficult to tell who the good guys and the bad guys are. ” It was unclear what effect the comments from Mr. Rawlings, Chief Brown and Mr. Obama would have on Texas gun laws.   Republicans control the governor’s office, the State Legislature and all but one of the nearly 30 statewide elected offices. Alejandro Garcia, a spokesman for Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, said that Mr. Patrick was “not surprised the president and   forces are once again attempting to use a shooting tragedy to score points for their own political agenda. ” The Rev. Terry Holcomb, an   leader and a pastor of the Crossroads Baptist Church in Oakhurst, Tex. said he and others would oppose any efforts to ban the open carrying of   long guns as a result of the Dallas attack. “You would expect something like this in New York or California, but it will not see the light of day in Texas,” Mr. Holcomb said. “Let’s just call it for what it is: The liberal left is   and  . ” Even Democrats said they were not optimistic that substantial changes to Texas gun laws were in store. “From my perspective, I don’t see anything changing in Texas,” said Representative Beto O’Rourke, a Democrat, who represents El Paso. The legality of carrying a rifle on the streets is just one element of a gun culture that continues to define and divide the state. It is not just that many Texans are armed. It is that many are allowed to display the fact that they are armed, and more now do so than at any point in modern Texas history. Beyond the carrying of rifles in public  —   a tactic used by a small group of   advocates  —   more than one million Texans have   permits to carry concealed handguns. Last year, the Legislature voted to give those with   licenses the option of carrying their weapons unconcealed, in holsters on their hips or on their shoulders. That law, which is now in effect, did not affect the carrying of rifles in public. Lawmakers also allowed students and faculty members at Texas’ public and private universities to carry concealed handguns into classrooms and other campus buildings. The law, which has drawn fierce opposition at many universities, takes effect on Aug. 1. Amid the confusion on the scene, the Dallas police on Thursday released a picture on social media of one of the armed marchers. The police called the man “a person of interest” and asked for the public’s help in identifying him. That man, Mark Hughes, turned himself in and was later released. The other armed man was not allowed to legally carry a gun, and the police arrested him on a misdemeanor charge. He appeared to still be in custody on Sunday. A woman who was with the two men and who was detained was later released. A lawyer for Mr. Hughes said that his client was simply exercising his rights in Texas when carrying his rifle at a demonstration. The lawyer, Michael C. Campbell Jr. said, “He’s within the parameters of the law. ”",0
7994,Jeff Sessions on Immigration Law: ’I’m Going to Follow The Laws Passed By Congress’ - Breitbart,"Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions told the Senate Tuesday morning that voters believe immigration policy should prioritize the needs of American workers. [Sessions’ remark came when Democratic Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin claimed Sessions would not support a “humane” rewrite of the nation’s immigration law. “There’s not a spot of evidence in your career to suggest that as Attorney General you would use the authority of that office to resolve the challenges of our broken immigration system in a fair and humane manner,” Durbin said to Sessions. “Tell me I’m wrong. ”  “Well, you are wrong, Senator Durbin,” Sessions replied, adding: I’m going to follow the laws passed by Congress. As a matter of policy, we disagreed on some of those issues. I do believe that if you continually go through a cycle of amnesty that you undermine the respect for the law and encourage more illegal immigration into America. I believe the American people spoke clearly in this election. I believe they agreed with my basic view. Throughout the 2016 election, the American people rejected multiple candidates who ran on a position of immigration amnesty in favor of a now   Donald Trump, whom Sessions endorsed and who was vocal about his desire to enforce U. S. immigration law. In addition, the American people have considered and rejected various amnesty proposals on multiple occasions, including in 2006, 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2014. Ken Palinkas, the former head of the nation’s immigration caseworkers —  Citizenship and Immigration Services —  has warned that the DREAM Act proposals to give amnesty to illegal aliens who allegedly came to the U. S. as minors, a policy which has been championed by Durbin, would expand birthright citizenship to include the   (today it is applied to the U. S.  children of illegal immigrants). Palinkas has explained that DREAMer amnesty “extend[s] birthright citizenship in the future to include the foreign citizens of other countries” and represents a promise of “perpetual amnesty. ” Palinkas has argued that the concept of DREAMers was intended to create a permanent loophole to U. S. borders. In other Western countries all foreign nationals illegally residing in the country are subject to immigration laws. In the United States, however, the   DREAMer population was created in order to effectively carve out a sector of the illegal alien population who are exempt from immigration law. During his Tuesday confirmation hearing, Sessions went on to tell the Committee that the American people are entitled to a lawful system of immigration that advances their best interests. “It’s a good view, a decent view, a solid legal view for the United States of America that we create a lawful system of immigration that allows people to apply to this country, and if they’re get accepted, they get in. If they’re not accepted, they don’t get it. And I believe that’s right, and just, and the American people are right to ask for it. We have not delivered that for them,” Sessions said. Sessions’ declaration is remarkably similar to prior statements made by civil rights champion and   Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, who argued in favor of immigration control and explained that, “credibility in immigration policy can be summed up in one sentence: Those who should get in, get in those who should be kept out, are kept out and those who should not be here will be required to leave. ” Throughout the hearing, Sessions’ emphasized that it is the role of Congress to implement policies supported by the American electorate. “The best thing for us to do,” Sessions said, “[is] let’s fix this system and then we can work together after this lawlessness has been ended and then we can ask the American people and enter into a dialogue about how to compassionately treat people who have been here a long time. ” “I had a responsibility as a member of this body to express my view and vote as I believed was correct on dealing with issues of immigration,” Sessions said. “That’s not the Attorney General’s role. The Attorney General’s role is to enforce the law. ”",0

7996,"‘What Is Aleppo?’ Gary Johnson Asks, in an Interview Stumble - The New York Times","Gary Johnson, the former New Mexico governor and Libertarian Party presidential nominee, revealed a surprising lack of foreign policy knowledge on Thursday that could rock his insurgent candidacy when he could not answer a basic question about the crisis in Aleppo, Syria. “What is Aleppo?” Mr. Johnson said when asked on MSNBC how, as president, he would address the refugee crisis in the   Syrian city. When pressed as to whether he was serious, Mr. Johnson indicated that he really was not aware of the city, which has been widely covered during the years that Syria has been engulfed in civil war. After Mike Barnicle, an MSNBC commentator who is often part of the “Morning Joe” program panel, explained that Aleppo was the center of Syria’s refugee crisis, Mr. Johnson struggled to recover. “O. K. got it,” he said, explaining that he thinks that the United States must partner with Russia to diplomatically improve the situation there. “With regard to Syria, I do think that it’s a mess. ” The stumble could be a serious blow to Mr. Johnson’s campaign, just as he is making a final push to improve his standing in the polls. His support needs to reach 15 percent in a series of major national polls to be included in the presidential debates. Mr. Johnson’s support has been hovering around 10 percent. He and his running mate, former Gov. Bill Weld of Massachusetts, have been aggressively making the case that they represent a viable alternative for voters who are not happy with the major party nominees, Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump. Mr. Johnson and Mr. Weld are both former   Republican governors who are socially liberal and fiscally conservative. While Libertarians are very   oriented, they are often criticized for being isolationist and lacking interest in foreign policy. Some leading Republicans who oppose Mr. Trump have said openly that they are giving the Libertarian ticket a serious look. On Wednesday night, Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, publicly called for Mr. Johnson and Mr. Weld to be included in the presidential debates. The stumble could derail such hopes and it was widely mocked on social media. On Twitter the question “What is Aleppo?” was trending, with many critics arguing that Mr. Johnson had disqualified himself from the presidency. Some even attributed the flub to Mr. Johnson’s acknowledged use of marijuana. He is a proponent of legalizing the drug and he was previously the chief executive of a business that marketed and sold recreational marijuana products. Even Hillary Clinton, Mr. Johnson’s Democratic opponent, had a laugh at his expense on Thursday. Asked about the Libertarian candidate’s lack of knowledge about Aleppo during a news conference, she joked, “You can look on the map and find Aleppo. ” Thursday was not the first time that Mr. Johnson has faced such a situation. After speaking at a Politico convention in June, he was being directed to a room that was named after Harriet Tubman, the former slave and abolitionist. According to a report in The New Yorker, Mr. Johnson asked, “Who’s Harriet Tubman?” Mr. Johnson expressed disappointment about the Aleppo lapse in a brief   interview that was broadcast on MSNBC and canceled some of his other scheduled interviews that had been planned for later in the day. “I’m incredibly frustrated with myself,” Mr. Johnson said. “I have to get smarter and that’s just part of the process. ” He also released a statement, explaining that he is “human” and that as president he would surround himself with experts and receive daily security briefings to fill any gaps in his knowledge. As for the impact the matter would have on his presidential prospects, Mr. Johnson said that would be up to the voters to decide. In a separate interview on ABC’s “The View” program, Mr. Johnson said that he was just trying to be as forthright about the situation as possible and made no excuses. “For those who believe this is a disqualifier, so be it,” he said.",0
7997,We told you so! The Zika virus is harmless,"In March we wrote: Reading About Zika May Hurt Your Brain . We listed 35 sensational ""news"" headlines about potential catastrophes related to a Zika epidemic. The common factor of those panic creating media wave - all those headlines included the miraculous little word may . The pieces were pure speculations with some quoting this or that ""expert"" who was hunting for research funds or lobbying for some pharmaceutical or pesticide conglomerate. In June we added: Zika Virus Does Not Cause Birth Defects - Fighting It Probably Does . New serious research found what some people in Brazil had suspected from the very start of the small and strictly locally limited jump in microencephaly cases in Brazil: [D]octors in the Zika affected areas in Brazil pointed out that the real cause of somewhat increased microcephaly in the region was probably the insecticide pyriproxyfen, used to kill mosquito larvae in drinking water: The Brazilian doctors noted that the areas of northeast Brazil that had witnessed the greatest number of microcephaly cases match with areas where pyriproxyfen is added to drinking water in an effort to combat Zika-carrying mosquitoes . Pyriproxyfen is reported to cause malformations in mosquito larvae, and has been added to drinking water in the region for the past 18 months. Pyriproxyfen is produced by a Sumitomo Chemical - an important Japanese poison giant. It was therefore unsurprising that the New York Times and others called the Brazilian doctors' report a ""conspiracy theory"" and trotted out some ""experts"" to debunk it. ... But [s]cientist at the New England Complex Systems Institute also researched the pyriproxyfen thesis. They found : Pyriproxifen is an analog of juvenile hormone, which corresponds in mammals to regulatory molecules including retinoic acid, a vitamin A metabolite, with which it has cross-reactivity and whose application during development causes microcephaly . ... [T]ests of pyriproxyfen by the manufacturer, Sumitomo, widely quoted as giving no evidence for developmental toxicity, actually found some evidence for such an effect , including low brain mass and arhinencephaly—incomplete formation of the anterior cerebral hemispheres—in rat pups. Finally, the pyriproxyfen use in Brazil is unprecedented—it has never before been applied to a water supply on such a scale. ... Given this combination of information we strongly recommend that the use of pyriproxyfen in Brazil be suspended pending further investigation. Today the Washington Post finally admits that the Zika virus does not cause birth defects: [T]o the great bewilderment of scientists, the epidemic has not produced the wave of fetal deformities so widely feared when the images of misshapen infants first emerged from Brazil. Instead, Zika has left a puzzling and distinctly uneven pattern of damage across the Americas. According to the latest U.N. figures, of the 2,175 babies born in the past year with undersize heads or other congenital neurological damage linked to Zika, more than 75 percent have been clustered in a single region: northeastern Brazil. The wide areas where the flue virus occurred outside of the small area in Brazil saw no increase in birth defect numbers. The number of (naturally occurring) microcephality cases stayed constant despite a very large increase in (harmless) Zika virus infections. The numbers in Brazil also turned out to be partially inflated because of a lack of standard diagnosis criteria and unreliable statistics. A factor we had pointed to in our very first piece. The WaPo piece today muses about several ""possible"" causes for the local increase in cases in northeastern Brazil that indeed happened. It quotes some of the very ""experts"", like from the pharmaceutical industry influenced CDC, that were wrong on the issue since the very first panic headline. It strenuously avoids to even mention the most likely cause - the excessive local use of an insecticide that is supposed to cause birth defects - in developing mosquitoes. Thus the reporting is still void of journalistic ethics and irresponsible in its conclusions. It did not take much effort to get this right. An hour or two of skimming through publicly available sources of good standing, some basic higher education and sound reasoning was enough. But instead of doing such basic inquiries ""journalists"" and media ""served"" panic and speculations by biased ""experts"". Keep this story in mind for the next sensationalist onslaught of panic headline. There surely will be some ""interests"" behind those; just don't expect unbiased facts and basic logic reasoning. Comment: And Zika -- like Ebola, SARS, bird flu, West Nile, etc. -- will fall down the memory hole...until the next scare comes along.",0
7998,Lawyer ’Robin Hood of Refugees’ Sentenced to 15 Months in Prison for Asylum Scam - Breitbart,"A federal judge sentenced an Illinois immigration lawyer who cheated the immigration system to make sure his clients were granted asylum in the U. S. to 15 months in prison Wednesday. [Prosecutors say Robert Dekelaita, who called himself “Robin Hood” for refugees, would forge the names of his clients seeking asylum on application papers and fabricate their life stories with horrific anecdotes of kidnappings, bombings, and religious persecution that were all false, drawing inspiration from news stories he collected, CBS Chicago reported.  U. S. District Judge Matthew Kennelly sentenced Dekelaita to 15 months in prison for conspiracy to commit asylum fraud a year after Dekelaita was convicted, noting that even if he broke the law with noble intentions, he would “have to be willing to pay the price for it. ” Kennelly encouraged Dekelaita, 54, of Glenview, to file a motion to remain free while he appeals his conviction. Dekelaita is an Assyrian Christian who immigrated to the United States from Iraq at    as his family fled persecution from the Baath regime, according to his lawyers. His lawyers argued during the trial that illegal immigrants fearing deportation lied to the U. S. government to help them build its case against Dekelaita. Federal prosecutors also say Dekelaita sent his clients a letter after his conviction saying that he “cheated no one and have not told anyone to lie. I have protected my clients as any good attorney should. ” His former clients now face deportation because of the fraud or their lives were ruined because they were forced to live out the lies he created for them, prosecutors say. Dekelaita chose not to make a statement in court and showed no reaction to the verdict during the two hour hearing, the Chicago Tribune reported. Prosecutors also charged two translators who worked for Dekelaita, Adam Benjamin and Yousif Yousif, for intentionally mistranslating answers given by clients and adding testimony they had not given to make sure they were granted asylum. Benjamin, 63, pleaded guilty in July 2015 to one count of fraud and was sentenced to six months in prison for his role in the conspiracy. Prosecutors agreed to defer Yousif’s prosecution so long as he stayed out of trouble, court records show.",0
7999,Supreme Court Justice Removes Brazil’s Senate Leader Amid Graft Case - The New York Times,"RIO DE JANEIRO  —   A justice on Brazil’s Supreme Court on Monday night removed the powerful head of the Senate from his post, as tensions have escalated between Congress and the judiciary over efforts by legislators to curb the power of prosecutors and judges overseeing corruption investigations. The justice, Marco Aurélio Mello, based his ruling on the fact that the Senate leader, Renan Calheiros, is going to stand trial in a graft case in which a lobbyist paid for the child support of a daughter Mr. Calheiros, 61, fathered in an extramarital affair. Mr. Mello’s ruling reflects how Brazil’s political tumult is intensifying once again, in a year in which President Dilma Rousseff was ousted and an orchestrator of her impeachment, Eduardo Cunha, the former speaker of the lower house, is now in jail on graft charges. The move by Mr. Mello also comes amid a tense standoff between Congress and the judiciary. Last week, the lower house held a marathon session in which its members gutted a   anticorruption bill. The legislation, which would erode the authority of prosecutors and judges guiding graft inquiries, then moved to the Senate, where Mr. Calheiros unsuccessfully tried to hold a vote on it. Thousands of Brazilians took to the streets on Sunday to protest the moves in Congress, venting their wrath especially against Mr. Calheiros. Even as he faces a loss of authority, Mr. Calheiros, from Alagoas State in Brazil’s northeast, is expected to keep his seat in the Senate. For many of the protesters on the streets of Brazilian cities, Mr. Calheiros came to symbolize impunity in the nation’s political system, resurrecting his career despite facing an array of scandals. (In 2007, he was forced to resign as head of the Senate over the same child support case.) It was not immediately clear if the Supreme Court would need to ratify or reject Mr. Mello’s ruling with a full vote of its members. The request for Mr. Calheiros’s ouster came from Sustainability Network, a political party in the opposition. Mr. Calheiros may be able to appeal the decision. “I applaud this ruling,” said Randolfe Rodrigues, a senator from Sustainability Network, which largely blends centrist and leftist ideas. He said that the decision built on previous votes by justices aiming at preventing politicians on trial in corruption cases from remaining in the presidential line of succession. Jorge Viana, a senator from Ms. Rousseff’s leftist Workers’ Party, is expected to ascend to the post as head of the Senate. Mr. Calheiros is a member of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, the same   centrist grouping led by President Michel Temer. Senators from the Workers’ Party said on Monday night that they would seek to delay voting in the Senate on a bill that would place a cap on federal spending, a cornerstone of Mr. Temer’s proposed austerity measures. The Senate already approved the bill in a first round of voting in November, with a second and final round scheduled for  . With some in Congress now also calling for Mr. Temer’s impeachment after a scandal involving his support for an ally in a property deal, Brazil’s political establishment is facing the prospect of renewed instability. But at least for now, few observers see Mr. Temer at imminent risk of falling, given his coalition’s control of Congress.",0
8000,In Defense of Moderate Drinking (Again) - The New York Times,"A few months ago, I wrote an article here on The Upshot discussing the potential health effects of alcohol. I pointed out that the scientific research said moderate drinking isn’t bad for you indeed, it might even offer some benefits. At the same time, I cautioned that this doesn’t mean I’d treat alcohol like medicine, or advise people to start drinking. The   message was that if you’re otherwise healthy, and enjoy no more than two drinks a day, you’re unlikely to suffer from it, and potentially might benefit. However, a new study has been published that is leading some people to write stories proclaiming that “alcohol may not be good for you after all. ” Is that the case? Like any good Bayesian, I use new data and evidence to update my priors. In this case, the recent publication isn’t a new trial or experiment. It’s a new systematic review and   that argues that it does a better job than prior work, by excluding a lot of research its authors declared was flawed. The main problem, they argue, is that a lot of prior work lumps people who used to drink but quit and no longer do so with people who never drank. They further assert that many of these people may actually have quit because they were sick, and were told to give up alcohol. This would mean that the sickest patients, who had been drinking alcohol, were being counted as if they were abstainers, which would bias results in a way to make drinking look healthier than not. They also only looked at studies that examined all death from all causes considered together. Of the 87 studies they found that met this criterion, only 13 strictly coded lifetime abstainers (and not quitters) as the reference group. When they looked at those studies and compared lifetime abstainers with everyday drinkers, there wasn’t a statistically significant difference. Only those who drank at least 65 grams of alcohol a day (about 4. 5 drinks) had an increased risk of death. The researchers refined their model further, excluding “lesser quality studies,” to consider only seven. The results were unchanged. They then excluded one more study that had results heavily favoring alcohol the remaining six studies suggested that people who drank two to three drinks a day had a slightly elevated risk of death. But those who drank one to two, or three to 4. 5 drinks, didn’t. When it comes to observational research, that’s a pretty weak finding. But that conclusion is somehow making headlines. If you look closely, it’s clear the authors excluded a lot of studies that seem to have already taken into account their concerns. For instance, one study I cited looked at   mortality for those 55 to 65 years old. It found that, after controlling for the prior drinkers, as well as other confounders, those who drank a moderate amount had a lower risk of death than abstainers as well as heavy drinkers. It also cited five different earlier studies (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) that accounted for the “former drinker” problem, yet still found the protective effect of    drinking against   mortality. It’s unclear to me why these studies didn’t factor in to the new analysis. That doesn’t mean the researchers did anything wrong. You’ve always got to make judgment calls about what to include in a  . But the researchers don’t clearly explain why they made the judgment calls they did in the text. That makes me concerned they might be  . It’s also important to recognize that this is only a study of   mortality. Many other outcomes exist. A 2011   for example, looked at mortality from a variety of cardiovascular causes. This analysis also performed a   of studies that classified former drinkers correctly. It found that  —   with or without this adjustment  —   active drinkers had both a lower incidence and mortality from a variety of cardiovascular disease. In the same vein, other studies have found associations with alcohol and better cognitive function and lower rates of diabetes. (The story for cancer is much more mixed.) On top of that, randomized controlled trials suggest that moderate drinking can help with diabetes, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. There’s even a   of 63 controlled trials showing alcohol’s positive effects on HDL (good) cholesterol. Authors of articles now declaring alcohol to be   will need to explain why they ignored those trials. At best then, this new study shows that for those drinking two or fewer drinks of alcohol a day, there’s no association with higher or lower risks of death. At worst, it’s leaving out trials that show a benefit. In others words, the study doesn’t make me think I should update my priors much at all. The evidence still says that a moderate amount of alcohol appears to be safe, and that it might even be healthy for many people. There’s nothing in this new analysis that would make me change my mind.",0
8001,Focus on Chief Justice as Supreme Court Hears Immigration Challenge - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. twice voted to save President Obama’s health care law, infuriating his usual allies on the right. Now, conservatives are nervous that the chief justice will disappoint them again in a challenge to another major Obama initiative, this one on immigration. The case, to be argued on Monday at the Supreme Court, presents fundamental questions about executive power against the backdrop of a wrenching national debate over Mr. Obama’s plan to spare millions of immigrants from deportation. But Chief Justice Roberts’s record suggests that he may avoid taking a position on such a divisive and partisan issue, focusing instead on the more technical question of whether the states challenging the Obama administration’s immigration plan have suffered the sort of direct and concrete injury that gives them standing to sue. That jurisprudential   would avoid a deadlock or a grand pronouncement from a   court on a politically charged issue in a presidential election year. And that may prove attractive to a chief justice who has said he does not want the Supreme Court to be viewed as a forum where “partisan matters would be worked out. ” A narrow ruling would in some ways echo Chief Justice Roberts’s 2012 opinion sustaining the central feature of the health care law on grounds so carefully calibrated that no other justice joined all of his opinion. And it would be consistent with his stated preference for achieving consensus by defining the legal question at issue in a case as narrowly as possible. Chief Justice Roberts, 61, is a patient man and a canny strategist, sometimes to the frustration of his conservative colleagues. In 2007, three years before the Citizens United decision, Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February, urged him to move faster in deregulating campaign finance law. In 2009, Chief Justice Roberts persuaded seven of his colleagues to duck a challenge to the Voting Rights Act on technical grounds and then used language from that opinion in 2013 to justify striking down the heart of the law in Shelby County v. Holder. David A. Strauss, a law professor at the University of Chicago, said an incremental step will appeal to Chief Justice Roberts all the more in the current political climate. “The chief justice, who has spoken recently about how the confirmation process might affect the court’s stature, may be especially troubled by a   split in this case,” Professor Strauss said. A ruling based on standing, he said, “would wipe the slate clean, so the program could be considered in the future by a full Supreme Court. ” Mr. Obama’s plan would allow more than four million unauthorized immigrants who are parents of citizens or lawful permanent residents to apply for a program shielding them from deportation and allowing them to work legally. In the short term, a ruling to dismiss the case on standing grounds would at least temporarily save the plan. A tie vote, on the other hand, would leave in place an injunction blocking the plan and probably deny Mr. Obama any chance of resurrecting it. The case, United States v. Texas, No.   was brought by Texas and 25 other states, which say the plan went beyond what Congress had authorized. Lower courts have sided with Texas. The trial judge ruled that the Obama administration should have given notice of the plan and sought public comments on its new program. The appeals court affirmed that ruling and added a broader one: The program, it said, also exceeded Mr. Obama’s statutory authority. The Supreme Court asked the parties to address the even broader question of whether Mr. Obama had violated his constitutional obligations to enforce the nation’s laws. But the court must first address whether Texas has suffered the sort of direct and concrete injury that gave it standing to sue in the first place. “Chief Justice Roberts will be very skeptical of Texas’s standing claims,” said Tara Leigh Grove, a professor of law at William  Mary and the author of an article on lawsuits by states against the federal government to be published next month in The Cornell Law Review. Ken Paxton, the attorney general of Texas, said his state had brought the case to settle fundamental questions about presidential power. “Our goal really was pretty basic: defend the Constitution and stop President Obama’s lawlessness,” he said. A White House spokeswoman declined to comment. In court papers, the administration has defended its plan as lawful, humane and valuable. A ruling based on standing would sidestep all of those issues. Even lawyers who believe that Texas has demonstrated that it has standing say they are not sure how the chief justice will vote. “It’s no secret that the chief justice is not a fan of expansive standing doctrine,” said Jonathan H. Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University who filed a brief supporting Texas on the standing issue. Professor Adler, who was an architect of a challenge to the Affordable Care Act’s nationwide tax subsidies that the Supreme Court rejected last year in a majority opinion from Chief Justice Roberts, added that there was a second reason to worry about the chief justice’s vote in the Texas case. “Ways of disposing of cases without addressing the merits do become more attractive on an   court,” he said. Texas says it has standing to sue based on the budget shortfalls it would sustain if many unauthorized immigrants applied for driver’s licenses. The state sets fees for driver’s licenses below what they cost and ties eligibility for them to federal determinations about who is lawfully present in the country. “Our standing argument is based on the cost of driver’s licenses, which is obviously not part of our budget at this point,” said Mr. Paxton. “The Legislature meets only every other year, and they put together a budget and all of the driver’s licenses come out of the budget, and there’s no money for it. So our standing is based on that cost. ” Experts on standing law have sharply differing views about whether the cost of driver’s licenses, a consequence of the state’s own choices about fees and eligibility, can confer standing. “Such   ‘injury’ has never provided a ticket to federal court,” Walter Dellinger, a former acting United States solicitor general in the Clinton administration, wrote in a supporting brief. Chief Justice Roberts cited Mr. Dellinger’s views on standing in an opinion in an earlier case. Ernest A. Young, a law professor at Duke who filed a supporting brief for Texas, said the state has plainly been injured. “All one has to accept for Texas to have standing,” he said, “is that governments have interests in administering their own legal regimes, and that because these legal regimes are intertwined with federal law in various ways, federal actions often do affect state public administration in a cognizable way. ” Chief Justice Roberts wrote a sharp dissent in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, a    decision in 2007 that said Massachusetts had standing to challenge the Bush administration’s decision not to regulate   emissions. Relaxing standing requirements “because asserted injuries are pressed by a state,” the chief justice wrote, “has no basis in our jurisprudence. ” The “true goal for this litigation may be more symbolic than anything else,” he wrote. “The constitutional role of the courts, however, is to decide concrete cases  —   not to serve as a convenient forum for policy debates. ” Standing is a neutral legal principle that applies to the right and left alike, he wrote in an influential 1993 law review article. “It restricts the right of conservative public interest groups to challenge liberal agency action or inaction,” he wrote, “just as it restricts the right of liberal public interest groups to challenge conservative agency action or inaction. ” Mr. Dellinger said a rigorous approach to standing was consistent with Chief Justice Roberts’s statement at his confirmation hearings that judges should aspire to be umpires, whose only job is to call balls and strikes. “Before any judge begins calling balls and strikes,” Mr. Dellinger said, “he must first make sure the batter at the plate is an actual player and not just a fan who ran on the field. ”",0
8002,‘Fake news is way better than real news’ insists Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg,"Tuesday 15 November 2016 by Gabe Faulkner ‘Fake news is way better than real news’ insists Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg 
Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has defended his company from criticism about the proliferation of ‘fake’ news stories on the social network, insisting that real news “absolutely sucks”. 
“Let’s face it, in the past year, the UK flushed itself down the toilet of global politics, an orange misogynist was elected leader of the free world, and Alan Rickman died. People really don’t want to hear about that stuff,” Mr Zuckerberg wrote in a statement published on his public newsfeed. 
“If everyone just accepted the news on Facebook without question, you’d be living in a world where Barack Obama has been re-elected for a third term, weed is legal everywhere, and democracy actually works. 
“The top story today in Facebook news is the release of the tenth Harry Potter book. You can live in that beautiful world. 
“Just let go of reality, and submit yourself unconditionally to my will.” 
Tech analyst Norman Greenfield commented, “Is Facebook reporting the story about ‘fake news’ on Facebook? If so, how do we know that this ‘fake news’ story isn’t fake? 
“This whole situation has to an infinitely escalating set of ‘fake news’ reports that I just can’t get my head around. I’m so tired.” 
Facebook users were quick to voice their support of Mr Zuckerberg. Angela Marmot from Wolverhampton commented, “If you like this, then you’ll LOVE our app for Asian hook-ups – click here”. Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE! There are currently ",0
8003,"Arthur Hiller, ‘Love Story’ Director and Box-Office Magnet, Dies at 92 - The New York Times","Arthur Hiller, an Academy   director whose long career began in live television and flourished in the movies in the 1970s with   like the phenomenally successful “Love Story,” died on Wednesday in Los Angeles. He was 92. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced his death. Mr. Hiller, who for a time was one of Hollywood’s most commercially potent directors, piloted nearly 70 feature films, television movies and series episodes in a wide range of genres, from the Holocaust drama “The Man in the Glass Booth” (1975) to the screwball comedy “The  ” (1979). He made two hit films from Neil Simon scripts  —   “   ” (1970) and “Plaza Suite” (1971)  —   and two with the popular comic team of Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder: “Silver Streak” (1976) and “See No Evil, Hear No Evil” (1989). But Mr. Hiller’s greatest commercial success was “Love Story” (1970) which grossed an imposing $106 million when it was released in 1970, the equivalent of about $665 million today. Based on a screenplay by Erich Segal, a Yale classics scholar (who turned it into a   novel that sold more than five million copies) the film portrayed the tragic romance of a wealthy Harvard law student (Ryan O’Neal) and a Radcliffe music major (Ali MacGraw) the product of a     family. In a time of bruising social upheaval, “Love Story” offered a strong, simple palliative, turning audiences   (though some found it sappy) and catapulting the careers of Mr. O’Neal and Ms. MacGraw. Writing about the movie after the novel was published, the critic Roger Ebert was as admiring of one as he was withering about the other. “The film of ‘Love Story’ is infinitely better than the book,” he wrote. “I think it has something to do with the quiet taste of Arthur Hiller, its director, who has put in all the things that Segal thought he was being clever to leave out. Things like color, character, personality, detail and background. ” Mr. Hiller’s emphatic, uncomplicated direction brought home the themes of class and generational reconciliation embedded in Mr. Segal’s story, while Francis Lai’s score took care of the sentiment. The Canadian critic Robert Fulford, writing in The National Post, saw the movie as a product of its time: “Its plot is a checklist of 1970 obsessions: furious generational conflict, a rich and guilty old man symbolizing the Establishment, and death claiming the young and the beautiful. It’s a Vietnam film in which Vietnam remains offscreen. ” Characteristically, Mr. Hiller brought in the production ahead of schedule and under budget, earning his sole Oscar nomination in the process. (Franklin J. Schaffner won the Oscar for “Patton,” that year’s   winner.) “Love Story” earned six other Academy Award nominations, including for best actor (Mr. O’Neal) and best actress (Ms. MacGraw). Mr. Lai’s score won an Oscar. Mr. Hiller’s personal favorite among his films, he often said, was “The Americanization of Emily,” a 1964 feature set in wartime London about the tentative love affair between a young war widow (Julie Andrews) and an American naval officer (James Garner) as   approaches. Written by Paddy Chayefsky, the film strikes an unusual, precarious balance between social comedy and psychological drama, and drew on Mr. Hiller’s wartime experience as a navigator for the Royal Canadian Air Force, based in Britain. Mr. Hiller teamed with Mr. Chayefsky again in 1971 for “The Hospital,” a   satire starring George C. Scott and Diana Rigg, set in a dysfunctional New York medical center. “It isn’t simply that he obtains excellent performances from his stars,” the critic Vincent Canby wrote of Mr. Hiller in The New York Times, “but he has perfectly cast the film down to roles that are so small, they depend  —   I suspect  —   as much on natural mannerism as on acting talent. ” Gentle and   and famous in later years for his nimbus of long, silver hair, Mr. Hiller was much liked in the film industry. He was president of the Directors Guild of America from 1989 to 1993 and president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences from 1993 to 1997. In 2002, he received the Academy’s Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for his philanthropic work. Mr. Hiller was born on Nov. 13, 1923, in Edmonton, Alberta, one of three children of Harry Hiller and the former Rose Garfin, Jewish immigrants from Poland. His father ran a secondhand musical instrument store in Edmonton. His first contact with show business came through his parents, who formed a community theater in Edmonton to present plays in Yiddish. He helped his parents build and paint sets, and made his acting debut at age 11. After high school, Arthur joined the Royal Canadian Air Force and navigated bombers over enemy territory in Europe during World War II. Returning from the war, he enrolled at the University of Toronto, where he studied law and psychology. The lure of the performing life proved irresistible, however, and one day Mr. Hiller walked into the Toronto offices of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and asked a receptionist where to apply for work. “Three weeks later I was directing talk shows,” he was quoted by Robert J. Emery in the 2002 book “The Directors: Take Two. ” Mr. Hiller began in radio but soon graduated to the new medium of television, where he specialized in the risky,   work of directing live drama. In 1956 he accepted a job and moved to the United States, where he joined an impressive group of young directors  —   including John Frankenheimer, Arthur Penn and Sidney Lumet  —   working on the CBS series “Playhouse 90. ” As live television evolved into filmed programming in the late 1950s, Mr. Hiller became a regular contributor to such series as “Gunsmoke,” “Alfred Hitchcock Presents” and “Route 66. ” His first theatrical film was the 1957 teenage romance “The Careless Years,” based on a script written under a pseudonym by John Howard Lawson and Mitch Lindemann, who were both blacklisted at the time. The tight shooting schedules and tighter budgets of television had taught Mr. Hiller the importance of careful preparation, and his reputation as a fast,   filmmaker spread quickly. By the   he was well established in Hollywood as a director of light comedies like “Promise Her Anything” (1965) with Warren Beatty and Leslie Caron, and “Penelope” (1966) with Natalie Wood. He went on to direct Alan Arkin in the sentimental comedy “Popi” (1969) and again in “The ” an extravagant farce written by Andrew Bergman. Mr. Arkin played a New York dentist and Peter Falk a loony government agent who enlists him in a plot to assassinate a South American dictator. Then came the Neil Simon films and the Richard Pryor comedies. In between were weightier projects, like the musical “Man of La Mancha” (1972) a troubled production on which he replaced Peter Glenville as director “The Man in the Glass Booth” (1975) for the American Film Theater subscription series, in which Maximilian Schell played a rich Jewish industrialist living in Manhattan who is arrested as a war criminal and “Making Love” (1982) one of the first Hollywood films to present a love affair between two men (Michael Ontkean and Harry Hamlin) in a positive light. Mr. Hiller is survived by his daughter, Erica Hiller Carpenter his son, Henryk and five grandchildren. His wife, Gwen Hiller, a social worker and librarian, died in June, also at 92. She was born in Edmonton 10 days before her husband. Their family has noted that when they were schoolmates, he proposed to her when they were 8 years old. Their marriage lasted 68 years.",0
8004,Looking for Love? Put On a Cat Sweater - The New York Times,"For those searching for a soul mate, the   website WikiHow offers an   plan that could be of help. It tells the lovelorn about fruitful places to look for a mate and instructs them to do things such as make a list of the traits sought in a partner and to “start looking. ” But here at The New York Times, we have a better plan, and ours has only two steps: 1. Put on a sweater emblazoned with a cat wearing a Santa hat on the front. (Any kind of cat  —   calico, Siamese, Abyssinian  —   will do.) 2. Stand next to an elevator. (It wouldn’t hurt to put on some perfume or cologne this plan needs all the help it can get.) Then, boom! Mr. or Ms. Right will pop up. We can’t swear by this, because our data is admittedly scant. But in two wedding stories published in The Times this year,     sweaters have led to love. And in three others, sightings in elevators led to marriages. O. K. we get it that the ugly Christmas sweater craze may have run its course. But you can’t argue with success, which is why these    couples lead the list of the most unusual    stories for 2016. The catless among us fared just as well, however. Here is our list: Cat People Our cat lovers are Caitlin Taylor Landy and Brandon Travis Ponder, who were married Aug. 27 in Rye, N. Y. and Sarah Callaway and John Rader, who were married July 23 in Birmingham, Ala. Mr. Ponder wore his Christmas cat sweater for the picture he posted on his Tinder profile in summer 2014, and Ms. Landy was intrigued by his sense of humor. Mr. Rader and Ms. Callaway met in December 2013 in Nashville when Mr. Rader and a friend (who was wearing a Christmas cat sweater) were hailing the same cab as Ms. Callaway (who was also wearing a cat sweater) and her friend. “Meow,” Mr. Rader’s friend said to Ms. Callaway, but she wound up with Mr. Rader. Asked recently to explain the romantic allure of   sweaters, Mr. Rader said a number of factors came into play. “But No. 1 would be the actual girl wearing the sweater,” he said. “In addition to her, it’s a celebration of the most beautiful and wonderful time of the year, and to have a cat wearing a Santa hat is just something that is friendly and welcoming and cheerful all wrapped into one. ” Which Floor for Love? Our elevator couples are Alyssa Carbone and Jeremy Kees, who married March 19 in Montclair, N. J. Nadia Gaya and Timothy Martin, who were married April 30 in Manhattan and Kaci Lindhorst and Adam Sokoloff, who were married June 18 in New York. Ms. Carbone remembered seeing her future husband in the elevator of their Philadelphia apartment building. “He looked charming, handsome and dapper in his nice suits,” she said. Then the two got the chance to chat when an   fire alarm rousted the pair and their fellow tenants and temporarily left them outside. Ms. Gaya recalls hitting the button on her elevator in her Brooklyn apartment building and out walked Mr. Martin. “I said to myself, ‘That’s the hottest guy I’ve ever seen. ’” They were introduced by the woman showing an apartment to Mr. Martin, but she did not get his last name. A few months later, they again met at the elevator and began to get better acquainted. Ms. Lindhorst did not actually spot Mr. Sokoloff in the elevator. But her roommate, a natural matchmaker, had. Ms. Lindhorst, with encouragement from her roommate, then sent a Facebook friend request to “the really attractive guy” she saw there. What is so enticing about an elevator? Jodi Hynes, communications manager of Otis Americas, the elevator company, has given it some thought. “You are instantly put into an intimate setting from the moment you step inside, then the doors close and you can’t help but make eye contact and start talking to the person standing next to you,” Ms. Hynes said. “Where that leads may not always be what you intend, but it forces you into an otherwise unexpected conversation. ” Loving the Wait Anh Tu Dang and Josh Mankiewicz, who were married May 16 in Los Angeles, met while engaged in the most frustrating of activities: waiting in an airport security line. When Mr. Mankiewicz saw Ms. Dang in 2008 at Los Angeles International Airport, suddenly the wait didn’t seem so long. “Standing ahead of me was this stunning woman,” Mr. Mankiewicz, a correspondent for “Dateline NBC,” recalled. “I was staring at her. She didn’t notice. Finally we started talking. Actually, I started talking and she responded. ” A Better View Kelly McKanna and David Hirsch, who were married July 30 in Palo Alto, Calif. had just met and had been chatting briefly at a San Francisco music festival in 2011 when he offered her a perch on his shoulders for a better view. She told him he should sit on hers instead. He hopped on, her back didn’t crumple, and love ensued. The Man Without a Face After Meegan Brooks connected online with Michael Kimiecik, she communicated with him for weeks on end without the benefit of seeing his face. His profile photo was sort of obscure. At one point, she asked him outright to post a more recent photo, and he sent a photo of himself wearing ski goggles and a hood that covered most of his face. She finally got the chance to see him up close when she flew to Michigan, and he picked her up at the airport  —   without anything covering his face. “He was incredibly handsome,” she said. They were married Aug. 6 in Carmel Valley, Calif. Love at First Shout The first time Akino Brown heard Dr. Dionne Hoskins, she was giving him a good   at a Big Lots store in Savannah, Ga. Sparks flew  —   but not good ones  —   when she overheard Mr. Brown and a   discussing the firing of another employee. Incensed by this breach in protocol, Dr. Hoskins proceeded to tell Mr. Brown just that. He was distracted, though: “All I heard was, ‘Blah blah blah,’” he said. “I drifted off, thinking about how good she looked. ” Rod Serling Would Approve Perhaps the most Twilight   of our 2016    involved Allison Gans and Brian Fischer, who were married Sept. 24 in Los Gatos, Calif. The two thought they had first met on JDate in 2013, but when Ms. Gans began looking through her future husband’s childhood photos, she discovered that they had both been in the same large group that had traveled to Israel in 1997 for bar and bat mitzvah ceremonies. More digging revealed a video had been taken of a   ceremony there in which a rabbi took a candle held by Ms. Gans and gave it to Mr. Fischer. The future bride and groom, though standing just inches apart, scarcely noticed each other.",0
8005,In or Out? EU Is Hot-Button Issue In French Vote,"PARIS (AFP)  —   Such is Marine Le Pen’s aversion to the European Union that the French right wing leader demanded the removal of its   flag from a TV studio before agreeing to a recent interview. [Her chief rival in the race for the French presidency, centrist Emmanuel Macron, pointedly waved an EU flag from the podium at a campaign rally the next day.  Love it or loathe it, the European Union has become a   issue in the election, fanning fears far beyond France in the wake of Britain’s Brexit vote that a “Frexit” could doom the    bloc. “Rarely has the European issue held such a   place on all the candidates’ platforms as in this electoral campaign,” said analyst Pierre Vimont of the Carnegie Europe think tank. In the five years since France’s last presidential vote, Europe has seen a massive migrant crisis and a rise in populism, both contributing to the Brexit vote. None of the four main French candidates can afford to be neutral on the EU, whether they portray it as the source of all woes or a guarantee of peace and stability. Like Macron, conservative candidate Francois Fillon is bullish on Brussels, highlighting the   leadership axis and defending the euro. Both candidates met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel during the campaign. Arrayed on the other side are Le Pen, who advocates leaving the EU immediately, and   candidate   Melenchon, who demands a renegotiation of key treaty provisions. “Positions have hardened,” said Manuel Lafont Rapnouil of the European Council on Foreign Relations. “Melenchon was very influenced by what happened to (Greek   party) Syriza,” which gave in to European demands after months of crisis. Syriza, the party of Greek premier Alexis Tsipras, endorsed Melenchon, saying he “represents hope for change for France and Europe”. Le Pen, on the other hand, “is riding the wave of Brexit” and Donald Trump’s surprise accession to the White House, he said. The ideological underpinnings of the two candidates’ eurosceptism are worlds apart, however.  —   ‘Dictatorship of banks’  —   Le Pen stresses economic, monetary and territorial “sovereignty” along with a “national preference” for French citizens in the workplace and the allocation of state benefits. Melenchon vows to end the “nightmare” of an EU that submits its members to “the dictatorship of the banks” and the austerity policies they impose. But both promise a showdown with Brussels and say they are certain to come out on top given the strength of France within the bloc. Le Pen says she will launch six months of talks aimed at withdrawing France from the   Schengen area, as well as from the euro, before calling a referendum on whether the French want to leave the EU  —   a   “Frexit”. For his part, Melenchon has a   approach summed up as “change the EU or leave it”: a Plan A by which France will renegotiate its membership terms and a Plan B for a unilateral Frexit. As for the single currency, a poll carried out in early March found that more than 70 percent of the French oppose quitting the eurozone. On the eve of Sunday’s first round, Melenchon has toned down his euroscepticism, saying that he would prefer for France to stay in the EU and the eurozone. Le Pen has also adjusted her rhetoric, focusing more on FN staple issues such as immigration and security  —   the latter question surging to the fore after Thursday’s jihadist killing of a policeman in the Champs Elysees. On the   side, Macron says he has “Europe at heart” wants to bolster the eurozone and is the only candidate who favours CETA, the   agreement between the EU and Canada that will provisionally come into force in a few weeks. Fillon, more protective of French sovereignty, wants a   of the balance of power between Brussels and EU members states.   Giuliani of the Robert Schuman Foundation said both Fillon and Macron are too complacent with the status quo, calling the EU planks of their platforms “unimaginative”. Candidates should talk about the EU’s renewal and how France needs to revitalise its role within it, Giuliani said.",0

8007,5 Unanswered Questions About ABC’s Cancellation of ’Last Man Standing’,"ABC’s decision to cancel its popular   comedy series Last Man Standing shocked fans, as it was one of the network’s   comedy series in its most recent sixth season. [The series stars (or starred) Tim Allen as Mike Baxter, the marketing director for sporting goods store Outdoor Man and a family man who splits time between work and managing his   household, which includes his wife Vanessa (Nancy Travis) and daughters Mandy (Molly Ephraim) Eve (Kaitlyn Dever) and Kristin (Amanda Fuller).  The series was unique in that it was one of the few (if not the only) broadcast network shows to explore the life of a politically conservative working man and his experience coming to terms with today’s   culture. So when ABC canceled the show last week, fans were quick to accuse the network of making the decision for political reasons. The show is   (though reportedly written by liberal writers) and star Allen is himself politically conservative and a supporter of President Donald Trump. ABC Entertainment President Channing Dungey held a press call Tuesday morning to discuss the network’s Fall   lineup, which, for the first time in six years, does not include its   rated comedy. While some reporters asked about Last Man‘s cancellation, the press call raised more questioned than it answered. Here are five questions that remain about the network’s decision to cancel the show.   1. Was the cancellation of the show motivated by politics in any way, either by the series’ own   worldview or by star Tim Allen’s own politics? Despite getting this exact question on the conference call, Dungey avoided answering it directly. “I cancelled Last Man Standing for the same business and scheduling reasons I cancelled The Real O’Neals, Dr. Ken, The Catch, American Crime,” Dungey said. “It was challenging because it was a steady performer but when we made the decision not to continue with comedies on Friday, that’s where it landed. ” The Real O’Neals, Dr. Ken and American Crime were ratings disasters (and none of them moved the cultural conversation much, with the exception of O’Neals, which appeared to exist solely to piss off Christians) so there’s no surprise in those cancellations. But Last Man Standing was a ratings highlight in its sixth season, which brings up the next puzzling question  …     2. If comedy “remains a priority” for the network, as it said on Tuesday’s call, why would it cancel its    comedy series? Last Man Standing was ABC’s    comedy only behind the critically adored (and decidedly progressive) Modern Family. The sixth season finale of LMS drew 6. 06 million viewers and a respectable 1. 1 rating in its March 31 broadcast, good enough to make it the   primetime program that night in a tie with CBS’ Blue Bloods. In fact, the entire sixth season averaged 6. 41 million viewers, down just five percent from its previous season, a rare feat for a show at this point in its run. When considering Last Man‘s Friday night time slot, that’s a downright miracle, considering Friday night is where broadcast network shows typically go to die a more prolonged death. For comparison, in its second season, Dr. Ken drew an average 4. 41 million viewers, down a steep 16. 3 percent from its first season. The Real O’Neals fared even worse in its sophomore season, drawing an average of 3. 07 million viewers, a drop of 22 percent. Those cancellations were obviously  . Which then begs the question  …    . 3. Why did ABC bring back the perpetually   Quantico when it draws   of Last Man Standing‘s viewership? If you haven’t seen the network’s government spy thriller Quantico, you’re hardly alone. The show’s second season averaged just 2. 8 million viewers per episode, down a whopping 35. 7 percent in viewership from its first season and an absolutely astonishing 45 percent in the key demo. So what to do when faced with these embarrassingly awful figures? Dungey confirmed Tuesday that ABC was bringing back Quantico for a third season, albeit with a smaller initial order of episodes. We’re “optimistic and excited about it,” Dungey said. She said the smaller episode order would allow the network to “see how it performs for us. ” Of course, there’s no way the renewal has anything to do with the show’s open hostility toward President Donald Trump and his supporters, right? Right? 4. Why would ABC move one of its   flagship series, Marvel’s Inhumans, to Friday night, traditionally a wasteland for unwanted shows? Dungey said on the call that the network wants to make Friday night a “destination” for   and fantasy fans. To achieve that, ABC set its     series Once Upon a Time at 8 p. m. Friday, followed by Marvel’s Inhumans, a superhero   and then once Inhumans finishes its run, the network will run Agents of S. H. I. E. L. D. in its place. Here’s the question: Inhumans is set to air its first two episodes in IMAX theaters for two weeks ahead of the show’s launch on TV. It’s ostensibly a   show for the network, and undoubtedly costs a ton of money to produce. Why would the network move this show to the 9 p. m. hour on Friday when it is traditionally the   time on television? And it isn’t just me who has asked this question: “Did ABC Already Doom Marvel’s Inhumans With Its Timeslot?” wondered CinemaBlend’s Mick Joest on Tuesday. Maybe the network just doesn’t believe it’s going to be very good. The move to Friday does make at least a little bit of sense for Once Upon a Time after a stellar first four seasons and a modest drop in Season 5 (and after the departure of most of its core cast members) the sixth season of the fantasy drama averaged just 3. 2 million viewers and a 0. 94 in the key demo, down 28. 3 percent and 31. 6 percent, respectively. Then again, the network just renewed Once for a total reboot in its seventh season. Why would ABC move its premiere family show from its comfortable Sunday night family slot to be a   for Inhumans? Instead, Sunday nights will begin with America’s Funniest Home Videos, then move to To Tell the Truth, then reality show Shark Tank, and then new Kyra Sedgwick drama Ten Days in the Valley. Which seems an odd sort of lineup for a traditional family TV night. 5. Is there any other show in history that has not only retained its audience but has beaten most other comedies of its type that has been cancelled as abruptly? Ever? Tim Allen broke his silence Tuesday to say he was “stunned and blindsided” by ABC’s decision. He likely joins many of the fans of his show (at least 138, 000) who now feel as if the only family entertainment they could enjoy has been taken off the air, for reasons that can’t possibly boil down to ratings and scheduling. A representative for ABC did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the article will be updated if we hear from them.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum ",0
8008,Trump to Interview 4 Candidates for National Security Adviser - The New York Times,"MELBOURNE, Fla.  —   President Trump will interview four candidates on Sunday to replace his dismissed national security adviser, three of them military veterans, but one of America’s most prominent retired generals, whose name had been floated, is not in the running. A White House spokesman said on Saturday that Mr. Trump would speak with Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, a prominent military strategist Lt. Gen. Robert L. Caslen Jr. the superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point and Keith Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general already serving as acting national security adviser. Mr. Trump, who is spending the weekend in Florida, will also interview John R. Bolton, who served as President George W. Bush’s ambassador to the United Nations and has previously been considered for deputy secretary of state. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, told reporters that “potentially others” might also be considered but that David H. Petraeus, the retired general and former C. I. A. director, was not a candidate. The national security adviser is a crucial figure in any White House, but Mr. Trump has struggled to find the right person to fill the post. His first national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, a retired lieutenant general, lasted only 24 days before Mr. Trump requested his resignation for misinforming Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of a conversation with Russia’s ambassador to the United States. The list of candidates now being considered reflects Mr. Trump’s continued interest in bringing top military officers into his administration. Other generals have served as national security adviser  —   notably Brent Scowcroft and Colin L. Powell  —   but the president seems reluctant to cast a net much wider than the officer corps. At a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he was comfortable dismissing Mr. Flynn in part because he had “somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position. ” He seemed to be referring to Robert S. Harward, a retired vice admiral and Navy SEAL, but Mr. Harward later turned down the job. The search for a new adviser has been complicated by uncertainty in the foreign policy world about the role of Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist, who has been given a seat on a   National Security Council committee. Mr. Harward was said to have expressed concern about how much autonomy he would have had. Mr. Petraeus was said to have similar concerns, although some close to Mr. Trump said he was never a serious candidate. A White House official, who like others insisted on anonymity to discuss the search more candidly, rejected reports that Mr. Harward had been concerned about a lack of autonomy in the role, insisting that he had been promised full personnel and structuring authority to clean house. Mr. Bannon was Mr. Harward’s biggest supporter in the West Wing for the national security adviser role, whisking him into a secret meeting with the president on Monday. On Saturday evening, a senior administration official described General McMaster and General Caslen as the leading candidates. The one candidate who has not emerged from the military is Mr. Bolton, an outspoken conservative respected by Mr. Bannon, although it is unclear if Mr. Bannon is supporting him for the national security job. Mr. Bolton does have support from two important donors to Mr. Trump, according to people briefed on the White House process: the casino magnate Sheldon G. Adelson and the philanthropist Rebekah Mercer. Mr. Bolton shares Mr. Trump’s strong antipathy toward the Iran nuclear deal negotiated by former President Barack Obama, and he would presumably continue the tough approach begun by Mr. Flynn of pressuring Tehran over its ballistic missile program and its sponsorship of terrorist groups. But Mr. Bolton has also taken a stronger position on Russia than Mr. Trump or Mr. Flynn. In a recent   article in The Wall Street Journal, he seemed to try to reconcile that by agreeing with Mr. Trump’s criticism of Mr. Obama’s New Start arms control treaty with Russia. Mr. Bolton is a favorite of conservatives but an adversary of Democrats, who blocked him for confirmation as ambassador to the United Nations. Mr. Bush used his recess appointment power to install him anyway, but came to regret it when Mr. Bolton, after leaving office, became a harsh critic for what he said was the president’s unwise willingness to negotiate with North Korea. General McMaster, a highly decorated Army officer, is considered one of the military’s leading intellectuals. He earned something of a cult status in the military as a young major for his influential 1997 book, “Dereliction of Duty,” an indictment of the military’s failure to stand up to Lyndon B. Johnson and other civilian leaders during the Vietnam War. But General McMaster has also proved himself in the field, leading a successful counterinsurgency effort in 2005 to secure Tal Afar in northern Iraq. He was critical of the way the Bush administration went to war in Iraq and became an important thinker behind the strategy change that helped turn the war around. Foreign Policy magazine called him “the brain behind Petraeus. ” General McMaster is now the director of the Army Capabilities Integration Center at Fort Eustis in Virginia. General Caslen, who was in the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001, and went back into the building after it was hit, served in key roles in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was commander of the 25th Infantry Division (Light) and commander of coalition forces in northern Iraq. A West Point graduate, he took command of the military academy in 2013. Mr. Bannon is a former naval officer, and his daughter graduated from West Point. Mr. Kellogg served for 36 years in the Army, including two tours in Vietnam, where he earned the Silver Star and other medals. He commanded the 82nd Airborne Division and was chief operating officer of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq before retiring in 2003. He advised Mr. Trump on foreign policy during his campaign and was named chief of staff at the National Security Council.",0
8009,The Israeli Trumpess,"WHAT WILL Donald Trump do if he loses the elections in a week and a half from now, as most polls indicate? 
He has already declared that he will recognize the results -- but only if he wins. 
That sounds like a joke. But it is far from being a joke. 
Trump has already announced that the election is rigged. The dead are voting (and all the dead vote for Hillary Clinton). The polling station committees are corrupt. The polling machines forge the results. 
No, that is not a joke. Not at all. - Advertisement - 
THIS IS not a joke, because Trump represents tens of millions of Americans, who belong to the lower strata of the white population, which the white elite used to call ""white trash."" In more polite language they are called ""blue collar workers,"" meaning manual workers, unlike the ""white collar workers"" who occupy the offices. 
If the tens of millions of blue collar voters refuse to recognize the election results, American democracy will be in danger. The United States may become a banana republic, like some of its southern neighbors, which have never enjoyed a stable democracy. 
This problem exists in all modern nation-states with a sizable national minority. The lowest strata of the ruling people hates the minority. Members of the minority push them out of the lower jobs. And more importantly: the lower strata of the ruling majority have nothing to be proud of except for their belonging to the ruling people. 
The German unemployed voted for Adolf Hitler, who promoted them to the ""Herrenvolk"" (master people) and the Aryan race. They gave him power, and Germany was razed to the ground. 
THE ONE and only Winston Churchill famously said that democracy is a bad system, but that all the other systems tried were worse. - Advertisement - 
As far as democracy is concerned, the United States was a model for the world. Already in its early days it attracted freedom-lovers everywhere. Almost 200 years ago, the French thinker, Alexis de Tocqueville, wrote a glowing report about the ""Democratie en Amerique."" 
My generation grew up in admiration of American democracy. We saw European democracy breaking down and sinking into the morass of fascism. We admired this young America, which saved Europe in two world wars, out of sheer idealism. The democratic America vanquished German Nazism and Japanese militarism, and later Soviet Bolshevism. 
Our childish attitude gave way to a more mature view. We learned about the genocide of the native Americans and about slavery. We saw how America is seized from time to time by an attack of craziness, such as the witch hunt of Salem and the era of Joe McCarthy, who discovered a Communist under every bed. 
But we also saw Martin Luther King, we saw the first black President, and now we are probably about to see the first female President. All because of this miracle: American democracy.",0
8010,Massive Increase Reported In Illegal Immigrants Coming Across Southern Border," 
Illegal immigrants are flooding across America’s southern border, driven in part by the looming presidential election .
A CBS News report from McAllen, Texas , noted that large numbers of illegal immigrants have crossed the border from Mexico and turned themselves in. They are released by the Border Patrol after being given ankle monitors while they file paperwork to be granted asylum so they can remain in the U.S.
Border Patrol Agent Chris Cabrera said the rush is triggered by politics.

After rattling off some of the atrocities committed by ISIS under   including beheading journalists, use of chemical weapons, employment of child soldiers, mass execution of Christians and declaration of a caliphate, Carlson pushed back against the characterization of Bannon. However, Mastio doubled down and insisted the visions of the two, which was a war underway between Islam and the West, were similar. “We’re at war with a psychotic death cult, a fringe of the Islamic world,” Mastio said. “Bannon agrees with Baghdadi that it is a war between Islam and the West.

8015,White Lives Matter Has Been Declared a Hate Group - The New York Times,"A white nationalist group called White Lives Matter, which calls itself an opponent of the Black Lives Matter movement, has been declared a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization that tracks extremist groups in the United States. “The White Lives Matter website says their movement is dedicated to the preservation of the white race. That tells you all you need to know,” said Heidi Beirich, the director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala. “They’re against integration, immigration. This is standard white supremacist stuff. ” The group, which grew out of a social media meme, argues that white Americans are victims of a genocide caused by factors like the immigration of nonwhite people and marriage between white Christians and nonwhites or Jews, Ms. Beirich said. The law center’s designation is meant to draw attention to and increase scrutiny of the group’s activities. Last week, its members held a protest outside the Houston office of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to demand that it denounce Black Lives Matter, according to video posted online by the group. The Houston Chronicle reported that some of the protesters carried assault rifles and Confederate flags. Researchers with the law center said White Lives Matter had been promoted by the Aryan Renaissance Society, a group in Texas that is a member of the United Aryan Front, a white nationalist coalition. Ms. Beirich said the center’s designation focused on one chapter of the group based in Nashville that is led by Rebecca Barnette, a leader of the Aryan Strikeforce, a skinhead group, and the National Socialist Movement, America’s largest   group. Ms. Barnette did not respond to an email seeking comment on Monday, but White Lives Matter posted several videos criticizing the Southern Poverty Law Center to its YouTube channel in the past two days. One video described White Lives Matter’s members as “just the guy next door. ” Ms. Beirich said the number of white supremacist groups in the United States had grown in the past year and attributed that to the racially charged rhetoric of the presidential campaign. There are 892 active hate groups in the country, the law center said. “Certainly we’ve got people who are much more energized in a way that didn’t exist before, and that’s all because of the presidential campaign,” Ms. Beirich said before specifying Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee “Trump has given these people hope they didn’t have before that they could influence politics or that they would at least be listened to. ” Ms. Barnette described herself as White Lives Matter’s   in her profile on Vk. com, a Russian social networking site preferred by white nationalists for its lenient approach to posts that contain racist content. She said the group’s name had “been picked up by several other groups who are doing their own things with it. ” Mark Pitcavage, a researcher at the   League, agreed that the phrase had spread beyond the group. “White Lives Matter is a concept around which you can organize an event without necessarily being a formal organization,” he said. “It is essentially the sum of the number of people who have done actions in the name of White Lives Matter. ” “For white supremacists, ‘White Lives Matter’ is an obvious meme, so they will use it,” he said. On Vk. com, Ms. Barnette defended the group, writing that its members were unfairly labeled ”domestic terrorists. ” In other posts she argued that white women represent “the elite of the human species. ” She also shared Nazi memes and frequently used racist,   and homophobic slurs. “We do not live by the code of the nonwhites,” she wrote in one post calling for her followers to take action against the federal government, Jews and  . “Our forefathers built the nation that is being allowed to be destroyed. ” Later she added, “I wish Hitler were here alive and well today. ”",0
8016,Turkey in Turmoil and Chaos Since Purge Aimed at Dissenters - The New York Times,"ISTANBUL  —   When Aynur Barkin became one of roughly 40, 000 teachers purged from Turkey’s education system after last year’s attempted coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, she was not immediately replaced. As a result, her   students were forced to join the third grade, tripling their original class size. “I could pay attention to each of them one by one,” said Ms. Barkin, 37, who was fired in February from a school west of Istanbul. “But their new teacher can’t do that. ” That is one example of the administrative upheaval and chaos caused by the government’s vast purge of Turkish institutions since the failed coup in  July  —   the backdrop for a referendum on Sunday to expand the president’s powers. Mr. Erdogan’s government has sought to root out any remaining dissent by targeting nearly every segment of society. It has also used the purge as cover for a crackdown on dissidents of all stripes, including leftists like Ms. Barkin. The numbers are extraordinary. The government has fired or suspended about 130, 000 people suspected of being dissidents from the public and private sectors. Most are accused of affiliations with the Gulen movement, the Islamic followers of Fethullah Gulen, the cleric accused of orchestrating the putsch. More than 8, 000 army officers, 8, 000 police officers, 5, 000 academics and 4, 000 judges and prosecutors have been forced out, according to estimates. The social cost has been significant. Watchdogs say that around 1, 200 schools, 50 hospitals and 15 universities have been closed. Affected schoolchildren have usually been able to find places in local state schools  —   but their purged parents have mostly been frozen out of the job market. Turkey has become “like an   prison,” said Sezgin Yurdakul, 40, who was fired from the Istanbul ferry system because his daughter attended a   school on a scholarship. Mr. Yurdakul’s name is blacklisted on a national database, so no employer has yet dared to give him a new job. He, like thousands of other purged employees of the state, is now living off his savings. The vacuum left by people like Mr. Yurdakul has prompted many Turks to question which individuals are permitted to fill the void  —   and which factions, if any, have benefited. Mr. Erdogan’s allies argue that a wide range of groups has filled the void. But some claim that the gaps have been largely plugged by members of other Islamic orders, or loyalists from the president’s Justice and Development Party, known as the A. K. P. “The A. K. P. ’s own cadres are filling the void,” said Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of the largest opposition party. “They want to establish a bureaucratic structure that accepts whatever the politicians say. ” Mustafa Karadag, the head of the judges’ union, says that gaps in the judiciary have often been filled by novices who can provide letters of accreditation from a legal guild with links to the A. K. P. “This has allowed access to the judicial and prosecutorial professions to those who receive lower marks but who have a closer relationship to the government, or who are able to procure references from them,” Mr. Karadag said. The government denies this. Ibrahim Kalin, the president’s official spokesman, said in a recent briefing with reporters that those let go had been “replaced by ordinary people” who had “all gone through very transparent, open examinations. ” But even some of the president’s critics say the situation is too chaotic, and the purges too widespread, for one faction alone to have benefited. To fill the holes in the bureaucracy and the political sphere, some say, Mr. Erdogan has had to rely on   nationalists,   nationalists, novices and recalled retirees, as well as party loyalists and Islamists. “The perception among Turks is that Erdogan rules everything, but that’s not the case,” said Orhan Gazi Ertekin, a judge who heads the Democratic Judicial Association, a liberal legal watchdog. “There are various groups, all different to each other, that previously plotted against each other, but are now in alliance” against the Gulenists. The most striking example may be that of Dogu Perincek, the leader of the tiny   Patriotic Party. He was jailed for plotting to overthrow Mr. Erdogan before his conviction was quashed in 2014. Upon his release, Mr. Perincek pledged to “demolish” Mr. Erdogan’s government, which he accuses of undermining Turkey’s secular system. Yet, in a recent interview, Mr. Perincek offered qualified approval of some of Mr. Erdogan’s recent policies. “There’s no reason for us to fight. We became side by side. They are now following our program,” he said, referring to Mr. Erdogan’s government. Mr. Erdogan also has the unlikely support of the Nationalist Movement Party, also known as the M. H. P. a   nationalist group whose votes helped him secure parliamentary backing for the referendum. In return, senior officials with the nationalist group privately say, they expect cabinet seats after the referendum. If they get what they want, it would constitute an unlikely   for a party whose leader once called Mr. Erdogan a “political disaster. ” In the military, the firings of thousands of officers have led to no obvious ideological victor. Mr. Erdogan raised eyebrows with the appointment last August of Adnan Tanriverdi, a former   general, as his new military adviser. Mr. Tanriverdi was expelled from the army in 1996 because of concerns over his religiosity. He has since run a group for other soldiers fired for similar reasons in the late 1990s, known as the Association of Justice Defenders. His appointment as Mr. Erdogan’s adviser prompted claims that the president had enlisted Mr. Tanriverdi to help install loyalists in the army. But Mr. Tanriverdi’s allies said that no other members of his association had been appointed to positions of significance. Other observers have concluded that a mix of factions has benefited from the purge of the military.   ultranationalists  —   known as Eurasianists and sometimes associated with Mr. Perincek  —   have profited at the expense of   officers, according to two military experts at Sabanci University in Istanbul. “It seems for now that the Eurasianists will hold on to their influence and ranks, but for how long remains a question,” Megan Gisclon and Metin Gurcan, a former officer in the Turkish special forces, wrote in a briefing last year. One former military prosecutor says such was the scale of undercover Gulenists’ infiltration over the last two decades that they are still the largest faction in the armed forces. “In the Turkish armed forces,” said Ahmet Zeki Ucok, who once led investigations into Gulenists in the military, “if there is a group that currently is influential, it’s still the Gulenists. ” In some parts of higher education, the vacuum has not been filled. At Ankara University, half of the 14 professors in the university’s human rights law department have been let go, and it has had to scrap more than half its courses. It will not admit new students during the next academic year. The remaining professors have had to triple the number of students in their care, and they have no ability to supervise new arrivals. “How can we write our dissertations?” asked Emine Ay, a master’s student who has been left without a supervisor. Her department head, Prof. Kerem Altiparmak, said: “If our professors are not reinstated, this program will end. These are the last students we will see in this program. ” Some wonder if this, in fact, is the goal: to dismantle one of the country’s liberal strongholds. In the judiciary, the number purged is   of Turkey’s 12, 000 judges and prosecutors. “If you purge 30 to 40 percent of the judiciary, in a sense you purge it all,” Judge Ertekin said. “There’s no tradition left and no knowledge left. ” Mr. Karadag, the head of the judges’ union, said the government was filling the vacancies with loyalists. Some say the situation is dangerous for Mr. Erdogan because it leaves him vulnerable to groups beyond his control, just as his relationship with the Gulenist network once did. “As long as he depends on these alliances,” Judge Ertekin said, “a new betrayal may be on the horizon, too. ” Mr. Erdogan’s newfound allies in Parliament, the M. H. P. offer a glimpse of this vulnerability. While the party’s leadership supports expanding the president’s powers, several of its lawmakers do not. Many in the party’s ultranationalist rank and file also have yet to be convinced. In the case of Mr. Perincek, the leader of the   party, his support for Mr. Erdogan goes only so far. While he applauds the president’s recent     policies, he says the president has eroded the country’s secular character. Significantly, he also vehemently opposes the expansion of Mr. Erdogan’s powers, and therefore opposes the referendum. “Turkey,” Mr. Perincek said, “is not going to carry Tayyip Erdogan on its shoulders. ”",0

How often does one of your Facebook friends just “disappear”, and then 3 days, a week, 3 weeks later they pop back up and tell you that they were in “ Facebook Jail “? I see it happening a lot, and am sure that you do as well. Many people, when deprived of the ability to post and interact with their global community, get anxious, depressed and experience genuine psychological trauma. Over the last 10 years, we have been retrained to think differently, act differently, and experience life through the filter of the cyber-world. There are gatekeepers who control that world, and when you violate one of their silly rules, you are locked out. This is, in essence, exactly how life will unfold under the Mark of the Beast system. 
How many of your social media friends who are frequent visitors of social media jail ever close thier accounts and stop the insanity? Almost none. They want the system, they need the system, and cannot live apart from the system. They rant, rave and rail against Facebook, and yet there they are. Addicted. No matter how often Facebook jails them, they come back.

Under the rule of Antichrist , in order to be included in the global community, you are required to take the Mark. If you refuse, swift, severe and fatal judgment will be issued and you will cease to exist. The Bible says that people refusing the Mark will be decapitated. There is no forgiveness from God for taking the Mark, but if you don’t take the Mark you can’t feed your babies, pay your bills, or interact with the global community. 
“And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.” Revelation 20:4 (KJV) 
Social media is training you to accept global rules in order to maintain membership in a global community. More people now connect to the web via hand-held devices than through desktop or laptop computers. Those devices control more and more of our daily lives. There are apps to regulate the air conditioning and heating in your home, open your garage door , deposit money to to your bank account , monitor your vital signs , or meet a date for Saturday night .

So the next time you try to login to one of your social media accounts, only to receive the dreaded warning of “Your account has been suspended for __ days for violation of our policies”, and you get first angry and then depressed, remember you’re part of the new global community. You have to live and play by global rules set to control the masses.

8018,Scientists Claim To Have Found 234 Alien Civilizations,"posted by Eddie It seems that the long wait to receive a signal from outer space has finally paid off because after years of silence two astronomers from the Laval University in Quebec claim to have found 234 signals from alien civilizations. Ermanno Borra and his graduate student Eric Trottier, the astronomers we mentioned, begun analyzing stars and galaxies in search of light emitted at regular intervals. After analyzing 2.5 million of them they found what they were looking for in234 stars which resemble our Sun in size. According to the researchers, the signals are emitted by alien civilizations. The team was focused on the light spectrum’s Fourier Transform (FT). For the uninformed, an FT is a mathematical device that helps scientists to find the origin of the signal’s components and how they came to be. For example, if the light is a muffin, using the FT formula will reveal the recipe, couldn’t be simpler than that. The FT analysis revealed periodic modulated components which the scientists believe are a result of the super quick light pulses (less than a trillionth of a second) sent by Extraterrestrial Intelligence (ETI). Their paper is published in the Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific and it reveals that the scientists discard any other possible explanation like instrumental effects, rotation of molecules, rapid stellar pulsations, and peculiar chemistry. They write: “ We find that the detected signals have exactly the shape of an ETI signal predicted in the previous publication and are therefore in agreement with this hypothesis . The fact that they are only found in a very small fraction of stars within a narrow spectral range centered near the spectral type of the Sun is also in agreement with the ETI hypothesis .” Only extremely powerful lasers, such as the one found at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , could generate these superfast pulses. Furthermore, Ermanno Borra has previously published articles where he states that this is the least explored area of astronomy. An inevitable question then arises: Why would these aliens choose such a complex and energy-consuming way to communicate? Surely they could have figured out a better way, after all they’re supposed to be millions of light years ahead of us in terms of technology and science. Although the team believes that the most logical explanation would be that aliens are trying to communicate with us, they are aware that further research is needed to confirm their findings. Breakthrough Listen , a Stephen Hawking-backed project will take up the task of further analyzing the 234 stars the team found, but the UC Berkeley team (the project’s science program base) encourages people to be skeptical regarding the findings, until further proof is available. The Breakthrough Listen team released a statement saying: “ The one in 10,000 objects with unusual spectra seen by Borra and Trottier are certainly worthy of additional study. However, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. It is too early to unequivocally attribute these purported signals to the activities of extraterrestrial civilizations .” Source:",0
8019,"Michael Phelps Puts His Game Face On, and What a Face It Is - The New York Times","The International Olympic Committee has tried to discourage   by the news media and others during the Rio Games  —   good luck with that  —   but this hasn’t stopped the people of the internet from spotting a good meme when they see one. Behold, #PhelpsFace. Phelps, the most successful and possibly the most scrutinized Olympian in history, was caught making a grimly determined face that only the internet could love as he prepped Monday for his semifinal in the   butterfly. What was Phelps thinking while wrapped in his   gear? Perhaps he was trying to telegraph a message to his rivals: “Don’t mess with my medal count, or I will destroy you. ” Such a telepathic challenge might have been meant especially for Chad le Clos of South Africa, who was dancing and jiggling just a few feet away like one of those deflated noodle men often found dancing in front of used car dealerships. In an interview with NBC after his heat, Phelps claimed he had been thinking about “nothing” as le Clos wriggled and shadowboxed in front of him. But the two swimmers have an interesting    history. At the 2012 Games in London, le Clos handed Phelps his first international defeat in a decade, in the   butterfly. Le Clos later said that watching Phelps collect a record eight gold medals in Beijing in 2008 had been a major source of inspiration as he developed his own program. “He was the reason I swam the butterfly,” le Clos told The New York Times recently. “It’s not a joke. ” Only hours old, images of Phelps’s face seemed to have the potential to go down in the history of ridiculous sports memes. (Somewhere, Michael Jordan is sighing with relief.) Fans even imagined what Phelps was listening to on his headphones: Could it be Eminem, Papa Roach or Alanis Morissette? Though the Games are only a few days in, followers of the United States swim team have been spoiled by a group of athletes who seem at home expressing themselves for the cameras. First, there was the car pool karaoke episode. Then Lilly King directed a   finger wag at one of her competitors, Yulia Efimova of Russia, who had failed a test for meldonium. King then made her most definitive statement in the pool, beating Efimova in the   breaststroke and setting an Olympic record. For his part, Phelps told NBC that he had been “trying to not really even look at” le Clos’s gyrating. “He does his thing, I do mine,” Phelps said. The rivals were facing each other Tuesday in the finals of the   butterfly. Expect   material.",0

8021,"For Charles Oakley and Knicks, a Long-Simmering Feud Boils Over - The New York Times","Charles Oakley has strong feelings about comped tickets. They are not freebies, he said in a recent interview. Instead, they are the vehicle through which teams show respect for former players. The Knicks have not offered Oakley free tickets for a long time. Worse, Oakley said, is the feeling that the organization has been scrubbing him from its history. This season, for example, the Knicks are celebrating their 70th anniversary, and Oakley has not been invited to participate in any of the events. It seems unlikely that any of that will change now. Mounting losses and a dysfunctional relationship between Carmelo Anthony and the team’s president, Phil Jackson, are no longer enough for the Knicks. On Wednesday night, a franchise with an addiction to needless drama raised the bar when Oakley, one of the franchise’s most beloved former players, was removed from Madison Square Garden in handcuffs after a fracas involving security personnel. If the episode was the product of years of festering animosity between Oakley and James L. Dolan, the team’s owner, then the fallout was swift, with the public and a number of prominent N. B. A. players quickly siding with Oakley. He was charged with three counts of   assault and one count of criminal trespass, all misdemeanors, and came out of the encounter more revered than ever among the team’s many frustrated fans. Even before the Knicks wrapped up their   loss to the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday night, the hashtag #FreeOakley began to circulate on social media. A police officer at the Manhattan precinct where Oakley was being processed stood on the steps and shouted, “Free Charles Oakley!” Passing motorists rolled down their windows and complained about how he had been treated. Several N. B. A. stars were quick to express their support for Oakley on social media. The Clippers’ Chris Paul, who was not at Wednesday’s game because of a thumb injury, bristled at the Knicks’ statement on Wednesday night that Oakley needed some sort of help, and Paul described him as “the realest person our league has seen. ” The Chicago Bulls’ Dwyane Wade and the Cleveland Cavaliers’ LeBron James posted photographs of Oakley from his playing days with the Knicks on their Instagram accounts. James called him a legend. And Reggie Miller, a former star with the Indiana Pacers and a player who had legendary playoff duels with Oakley’s Knicks in the 1990s, weighed in on Twitter with vehement criticism of the franchise. He questioned why any N. B. A. free agent would want to sign with the Knicks and “play for an owner who treats the past greats like this or a president who stabs star player in the back?” The latter part of the tweet was, of course, a reference to Jackson, whose efforts to force Anthony out of New York have been overshadowed by the Oakley episode  —   at least for the moment. The Knicks are, by any objective measure, a mess, and Miller may be right that they are taking on a toxic reputation around the league. The Knicks are even making the Nets, with their     record, look like the most stable basketball organization in New York City. Less clear, though, is what actually occurred Wednesday night that resulted in Oakley’s ejection. At the start of the game, Oakley was sitting with several friends, and they were not far from Dolan’s usual seat, which is in the front row in the corner of the court. Accounts of Oakley’s behavior at that point vary widely, with some fans saying they didn’t hear or see Oakley saying or doing anything inappropriate, or trying to provoke Dolan, and others suggesting he seemed somewhat combative. In any case, when security guards approached Oakley, he clearly became angry, unleashing a string of profanities and becoming physical with at least two of them. As he was then removed from the arena, the crowd chanted his name, a moment that may come to symbolize an increasingly disastrous season. Shortly after the encounter, the Knicks issued a statement that ended with the hope that Oakley would get “some help,’’ a suggestion that offended many people in addition to Paul. On Thursday, the Knicks issued a   statement in which they more explicitly stated that numerous Garden employees and New York City police officers had witnessed “abusive behavior’’ by Oakley as the episode unfolded. It dismissed his contention that he had done nothing wrong as “pure fiction. ’’ Madison Square Garden officials provided one employee’s description of the encounter to The New York Times, identifying her as a woman who was an “order taker’’ in the section in which Oakley was sitting. According to the statement by the woman, whom the Garden did not name, Oakley was agitated when he sat down, asking where Dolan was and why security guards were looking at him. She said she urged him to calm down, to no avail. Oakley played for the Knicks for 10 seasons and through much of the 1990s, when the Knicks were a tough, competitive team and Oakley’s determined physical presence near the basket epitomized everything the Knicks were about. Dolan did not become the chairman of the Garden until Oakley had already left the Knicks. Nevertheless, the two men have managed to become adversaries in the years that followed. In a recent interview, Oakley said that he tried to approach Dolan at the 2014 N. B. A.   Game in New Orleans but was rebuffed. Dolan, he said, refused to shake his hand. Oakley said that he was later told that he had said “something in the paper” that had infuriated Dolan. Oakley said he had no idea what he said to offend Dolan. Oakley has been a vocal critic of the team  —   and of Dolan, in particular  —   for years. His insistence that he does not know why the team treats him so poorly is, at the very least, disingenuous. He has been miffed that the Knicks did not offer him a coaching position. He has cursed Dolan through the news media, largely for Dolan’s refusal to meet with him. And he has continued to channel many fans’ frustrations by venting about the team’s poor play. Oakley is no stranger to confrontation. As a player, he once punched Charles Barkley in the face during a preseason game. He was the consummate enforcer in an era of physical play. It has become clear, through some of his actions in retirement, that his approach to the game was really who he is. And that has caused some problems. In 2010, he was involved in a scuffle at a Las Vegas casino that left him with a broken arm. More recently, after Game 7 of last season’s N. B. A. finals, Oakley screamed at security personnel in Oakland, Calif. who were trying to prevent him (with varying degrees of success) from entering the Cavaliers’ jubilant locker room. The Cavaliers had just won their first championship after defeating the Golden State Warriors, and Oakley, who grew up in Cleveland, wanted to join the celebration. “They was just mad they lost,” Oakley said in a recent interview, referring to the Warriors. Friends describe Oakley as loyal, generous and protective. But he is also sensitive to slights, perceived and real. Over lunch with this writer in November, he reflected on his playing days with the Knicks and lamented how the team, he thought, had refused to market anyone except Patrick Ewing. “They probably never sold my jersey in New York until I left,” he said. Oakley added that he still attended three or four Knicks games every season, always paying his own way. And every time, he said, he would be watched by security personnel. He said that Dolan was behind their actions. “Anytime I go into the Garden, they have to call him and tell him where I’m at,” he said. “They got to let him know, ‘Oakley is in the building. ’” He added: “It’s so disrespectful. I bought my tickets. And you’re going to tell someone he can’t walk around?” Oakley sounded most upset when he said that the Knicks had tarnished his relationships with many of his former teammates. Oakley recalled a game at the Garden last season when he bumped into a former teammate near the court. The teammate, Oakley said, apprehensively urged him to keep his voice down. “The guys I played with,” Oakley said, “they can’t even talk to me or be around me. ” On Thursday, in an interview on ESPN Radio, Oakley apologized for his role in Wednesday’s episode. “I feel sorry for the fans,” he said. The fans, in turn, seem to be on Oakley’s side. Welcome to the world of the Knicks.",0

8024,"Hillary Clintons E-Mails und die Muslimbruderschaft, von Thierry Meyssan","Hillary Clintons E-Mails und die Muslimbruderschaft von Thierry Meyssan Die Ermittlungen des FBI zu den privaten E-Mails von Hillary Clinton sind nicht gegen eine Vernachlässigung der Sicherheitsbestimmungen gerichtet, sondern gegen eine Verschwörung zu dem Zweck, jede Spur ihres Schriftverkehrs, der auf Bundes-Servern hätte archiviert werden müssen, beiseite zu schaffen. Sie könnte den Austausch von E-Mails über illegale Finanzmittelbeschaffungen oder Bestechungen umfassen oder auch über die Verbindungen des Ehepaars Clinton zu den Muslimbrüdern und den Dschihadisten.
Voltaire Netzwerk | Damaskus (Syrien) | 1. November 2016 ελληνικά English Español français Türkçe русский Hillary Clinton und ihre Kabinettschefin Huma Abedin. Die Wiederaufnahme der FBI-Ermittlungen zum privaten E-Mail-Verkehr von Hillary Clinton ist nicht mehr auf Sicherheitsfragen gerichtet, sondern auf Mauscheleien, die bis zum Hochverrat gehen könnten.
In technischer Hinsicht hatte die Außenministerin, statt einen gesicherten Server des Bundes zu benutzen, an ihrem Wohnsitz einen privaten Server einrichten lassen, um das Internet nutzen zu können, ohne auf einem Gerät der Bundesregierung Spuren zu hinterlassen. Frau Clintons privater Techniker hatte vor der Ankunft des FBI ihren Server bereinigt, sodass es nicht möglich war herauszufinden, warum sie diese Einrichtung hatte installieren lassen.
Im ersten Anlauf hatte das FBI festgestellt, dass der private Server nicht die Sicherheitsvorkehrungen des Servers des Außenministeriums aufwies. Frau Clinton hatte also nur einen Sicherheitsverstoß begangen. Im zweiten Schritt beschlagnahmte das FBI den Computer des ehemaligen Kongressmitglieds Anthony Weiner. Er ist der frühere Ehemann von Huma Abedin, der Kabinettschefin von Hillary. Dort sind E-Mails wiedergefunden worden, die von der Außenministerin stammen.
Anthony Weiner ist ein den Clintons sehr nahestehender jüdischer Politiker, der Bürgermeister von New York werden wollte. Nach einem sehr puritanischen Skandal musste er aufgeben: Er hatte erotische SMS an eine junge Frau geschickt, die nicht seine Ehefrau war. Offiziell trennte sich Huma Abedin während dieser Turbulenzen von ihm, in Wirklichkeit verließ sie ihn aber nicht.
Huma Abedin ist eine US-Amerikanerin, die in Saudi-Arabien aufgezogen wurde. Ihr Vater hat die Leitung einer akademischen Zeitschrift – für die sie jahrelang Redaktionsassistentin war –, die regelmäßig die Ansichten der Muslimbrüder wiedergab. Ihre Mutter hat den Vorsitz in der saudischen Vereinigung der weiblichen Mitglieder der Muslimbruderschaft und arbeitete mit der Ehefrau des ägyptischen Präsidenten Morsi zusammen. Ihr Bruder Hassan arbeitet auf Rechnung von Scheich Yusuf al-Qaradawi, dem Prediger der Muslimbrüder und spirituellen Berater von Al-Jazeera.
Anlässlich einer offiziellen Reise nach Saudi-Arabien besucht die Außenministerin in Begleitung der Vorsitzenden der Vereinigung der Muslimschwestern in der Bruderschaft, Saleha Abedin (Mutter der Kabinettschefin), das College Dar al-Hekma. Huma Abedin ist heute eine zentrale Persönlichkeit der Präsidentschaftskampagne Clintons an der Seite des Wahlkampfleiters John Podesta, dem ehemaligen Stabschef des Weißen Hauses in der Amtszeit Bill Clintons. Für die bescheidene Summe von 200.000 Dollar ist Podesta übrigens im Kongress der ständige Lobbyist des saudi-arabischen Königreichs. Am 12. Juni 2016 hatte Petra, die amtliche Presseagentur Jordaniens, ein Interview mit dem arabischen Kronprinzen Mohammed bin Salman veröffentlicht, in dem er die Modernität seiner Familie damit unter Beweis stellte, dass sie illegal zu 20 Prozent die Präsidentschaftskampagne Hillary Clintons finanziert habe, obwohl sie eine Frau ist. Am Tag nach dieser Veröffentlichung zog die Agentur die Meldung zurück und behauptete, ihre Webseite sei gehackt worden.
Laut der amtlichen jordanischen Presseagentur Petra vom 12. Juni 2016 hat die saudische königliche Familie illegal 20 Prozent der Präsidentschaftskampagne von Hillary Clinton finanziert. Frau Abedin ist nicht das einzige mit der Bruderschaft verbundene Mitglied der Obama-Regierung. Der Halbbruder des Präsidenten, Abon’go Malik Obama, ist Schatzmeister des Missionswerks der Bruderschaft im Sudan und Vorsitzender der Stiftung Barack H. Obama. Er ist dem sudanesischen Präsidenten Omar el-Bechir direkt unterstellt. Ein Muslimbruder ist Mitglied im Nationalen Sicherheitsrat, der obersten exekutiven Instanz der Vereinigten Staaten. Von 2009 bis 2012 war dies Mehdi K. Alhassani. Es ist nicht bekannt, wer sein Nachfolger war, aber das Weiße Haus leugnete, dass ein Muslimbruder im Sicherheitsrat sei, bis ein Beweis auftauchte. Auch der Botschafter der Vereinigten Staaten bei der Islamischen Konferenz, Rashad Hussain, ist Muslimbruder. Die anderen identifizierten Brüder besetzen weniger wichtige Ämter. Doch muss Louay M. Safi, zur Zeit Mitglied der Syrischen Nationalen Koalition und ehemaliger Pentagon-Berater, genannt werden.
Präsident Obama und sein Halbbruder Abon’go Malik Obama im Oval Office. Abon’go Malik ist Schatzmeister des Missionswerks der Muslimbrüder im Sudan. Im April 2009, zwei Monate vor seiner Kairoer Rede, hatte Präsident Obama heimlich eine Delegation der Bruderschaft im Oval Office empfangen. Bereits bei seiner Amtseinführung hatte er Ingrid Mattson, die Vorsitzende der Vereinigung der muslimischen Brüder und Schwestern in den Vereinigten Staaten, eingeladen.
Die Clinton-Stiftung hat ihrerseits als Verantwortlichen für ihr „Klima“-Projekt Gehad el-Haddad eingesetzt, einen der globalen Führer der Bruderschaft, der bis dahin Leiter einer Koran-TV-Sendung war. Sein Vater war 1951 einer der Mitbegründer der Bruderschaft bei ihrer Neubildung durch die CIA und den MI6. Gehad verließ die Stiftung 2012 zu dem Zeitpunkt, als er in Kairo Sprecher des Kandidaten Mohammed Morsi wurde, dann offizieller Sprecher der Muslimbrüder weltweit.
Wenn man weiß, dass die Gesamtheit der dschihadistischen Führer auf der Welt entweder aus der Bruderschaft oder aus dem Sufi-Orden der Naqchbandis – die beiden Bestandteile der islamischen Weltliga, der saudischen antinationalistischen arabischen Organisation – hervorgegangen ist, wüsste man gern mehr über die Beziehungen von Frau Clinton zu Saudi-Arabien und den Muslimbrüdern.
Nun befindet sich im Team ihres Herausforderers Donald Trump General Michael T. Flynn, der versucht hatte sich der Gründung des Kalifats durch das Weiße Haus entgegenzustellen und aus dem Vorstand der Defense Intelligence Agency (militärischer Nachrichtendienst) zurücktrat, um seine Missbilligung herauszustellen. Er kommt dort in Berührung mit Frank Gaffney, einem historischen „kalten Krieger“, der jetzt als „Verschwörungstheoretiker“ angeprangert wird, weil er die Anwesenheit der Bruderschaft im Föderalstaat aufgedeckt hat.
Es versteht sich von selbst, dass aus Sicht des FBI jede Unterstützung für die dschihadistischen Organisationen ein Verbrechen darstellt, unabhängig davon, wie die Politik der CIA aussieht. 1991 haben die Polizisten – und Senator John Kerry – den Zusammenbruch der pakistanischen Bank BCCI (obgleich auf den Kaiman-Inseln registriert) bewirkt, die von der CIA für alle Arten von Geheimoperationen mit den Muslimbrüdern und auch mit den Latino-Drogenkartellen benutzt wurde.

8025,"Coming soon, to a French neighborhood near you…7,000 MORE illegal alien Muslim invaders who set fire to their Calais jungle camp as the camp was being shut down","BNI Store Oct 26 2016 Coming soon, to a French neighborhood near you…7,000 MORE illegal alien Muslim invaders who set fire to their Calais jungle camp as the camp was being shut down Hey, where are all the women and children? Reuters French authorities said on Wednesday they had finished clearing the “Jungle”, a squalid shantytown outside Calais built by Muslim invaders who had hoped to make the passage to Britain but whose last inhabitants are now mostly dispersed around France. The operation passed off peacefully for the most part, though some migrants torched tents and shelters in a last act of defiance as their hopes of a new life in Britain evaporated. Some reports say that British anarchists set fire to the tents. “This is the end of the ‘Jungle’,” Calais regional prefect Fabienne Buccio said. “Mission accomplished.” Earlier in the day, riot police spread out around the camp, and fire trucks moved in to put out blazes that sent plumes of smoke into the sky. Muslim freeloaders from the Middle East, Asia and Africa congregated to Calais hoping to cross the short stretch of sea to Britain by leaping on trucks and trains, or even walking through the tunnel under the Channel. Britain refused to accept the vast majority of them – apart from a number of unaccompanied child migrants (who are actually adults in their 20’s and 30’s) now being processed separately – and high fences were built to keep them away from the port traffic, but still they came. Local opposition to the sprawling slum, along with growing criticism from right-wing politicians, finally stung the French government into action. The British referendum vote this year to quit the European Union was in large part driven by such worries, and stoked by scenes of the Calais migrants trying to force their way in. Hamid, 30, from Afghanistan, said he had been among those setting fire to shelters in the Jungle, and still hoped to cross the Channel to Britain. “We don’t care about problems that are to come after this. We did it because we don’t want to stay in France,” he said. “We want to go to England and England only. It doesn’t matter if I go to jail here.”",0
8026,If Catcalls Were Politically Correct...,"If Catcalls Were Politically Correct... 
October 29, 2016 we interrupt election coverage for this attempt to make you chuckle If men could grow up, what would they say they saw on the street? by Henry Makow Ph.D. ""Women are caught in a vice,"" I remarked to a friend. ""They are judged almost entirely on the basis of sex appeal. Nature is cruel."" He was telling me how he and a male friend had sat in a cafe rating the women that passed by. ""Aren't men pathetic?"" I said. ""Here we are in our sixties, and we still see women the same way we did when we were 20. We haven't grown up."" This got me thinking. What if we could grow up? What would we be saying about them? ""I can imagine having a conversation with that one"" ""She'd be a great mother for my children."" ""I can see her decorating our house, making it feel very comfortable and homelike."" ""Yes, she is attractive but what about her character, personality and talent? Can she cook?"" If these sentiments were vocalized, they would come under the category of mature catcalls. Catcalls range from vulgar to sweet. Women naturally find the vulgar ones extremely offensive. They are abusive...sexual harassment. But some women find nice catcalls flattering and miss the attention when they stop. Some men see them as compliments as well. They don't understand why women go to so much trouble to look attractive yet resent attention. It's usually the women who have been tainted by feminism who are most easily offended. They have been inverted and fear any kind of male attention. So I've devised some politically correct catcalls. ""Honey, I'd sure like to crash through the glass ceiling with you."" ""If you were a pilot, I'd fly with you!"" ""If you got a promotion in another city, I'd move for you and look after the kids!"" Got any comments or catcalls that fall into either of the above categories?",0
8027,Crack in Earth’s magnetic shield detected,"Crack in Earth’s magnetic shield detected 11/04/2016 
DNA INDIA 
The world’s largest and most sensitive cosmic ray monitor, located in India, has recorded a burst of galactic cosmic rays that indicates a crack in the Earth’s magnetic shield, according to scientists. 
The burst occurred when a giant cloud of plasma ejected from the solar corona struck Earth at a very high speed causing massive compression of the Earth’s magnetosphere and triggering a severe geomagnetic storm. 
The GRAPES-3 muon telescope located at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research’s Cosmic Ray Laboratory in Ooty in Tamil Nadu recorded a burst of galactic cosmic rays of about 20 GeV last year lasting for two hours. 
The burst occurred when a giant cloud of plasma ejected from the solar corona, and moving with a speed of about 2.5 million kilometres per hour struck our planet, causing a severe compression of Earth’s magnetosphere from 11 to 4 times the radius of Earth. 
It triggered a severe geomagnetic storm that generated aurora borealis and radio signal blackouts in many high latitude countries, according to the study published in the journal Physical Review Letters this week. 
Earth’s magnetosphere extends over a radius of a million kilometres, which acts as the first line of defence, shielding us from the continuous flow of solar and galactic cosmic rays, thus protecting life on our planet from these high intensity energetic radiations. 
Numerical simulations performed by the GRAPES-3 researchers, including Pravata K Mohanty, indicate that the Earth’s magnetic shield temporarily cracked due to the occurrence of magnetic reconnection, allowing the lower energy galactic cosmic ray particles to enter our atmosphere. 
Earth’s magnetic field bent these particles about 180 degree, from the day-side to the night-side of the Earth where it was detected as a burst by the GRAPES-3 muon telescope around mid-night on 22 June 2015. 
The data was analysed and interpreted through extensive simulation over several weeks by using the 1280-core computing farm that was built in-house by the GRAPES-3 team of physicists and engineers at the Cosmic Ray Laboratory in Ooty.

8028,"Hillary Clinton Has Clinched Democratic Nomination, Survey Reports - The New York Times","Hillary Clinton became the first woman to capture the presidential nomination of one of the country’s major political parties on Monday night, according to an Associated Press survey of Democratic superdelegates, securing enough of them to overcome a bruising challenge from Senator Bernie Sanders and turn to a brutal   campaign against Donald J. Trump. In a yearlong nomination fight full of surprise twists, from the popularity of Mr. Sanders to the success of Mr. Trump, the revelation that Mrs. Clinton had clinched the nomination was another startling development  —   especially coming on the eve of major primaries in California, New Jersey and other states. Mr. Sanders added to the drama by refusing to accept the A. P. survey and vowing to fight on, while Mr. Trump argued that he had done more for women than Mrs. Clinton. Mrs. Clinton was ebullient but also restrained as she received the news at an uncanny moment  —   almost eight years to the day after she ended her campaign against Barack Obama before a crowd of many teary women and girls. On Monday night, she shared the breakthrough with a jubilant audience at a campaign stop in Long Beach, Calif. “I got to tell you, according to the news, we are on the brink of a historic, historic, unprecedented moment, but we still have work to do, don’t we?” Mrs. Clinton said. “We have six elections tomorrow, and we’re going to fight hard for every single vote, especially right here in California. ” Like Mr. Obama eight years ago, Mrs. Clinton clinched the Democratic nomination with the support of hundreds of superdelegates  —   the party insiders, Democratic officials, members of Congress, major donors and others who help select the nominee. Under Democratic rules, these superdelegates  —   approximately 720 in all  —   are allowed to back any candidate they wish and can change their allegiance any time before the Democratic National Convention in July. Mrs. Clinton has had relationships with many of the superdelegates for years, and her campaign began seeking their support as soon as she entered the race last spring. Mr. Sanders, by contrast, has struggled to win their backing. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders competed most aggressively for   pledged delegates  —   the roughly 4, 000 delegates won through state primaries and caucuses. The A. P. declared Mrs. Clinton the presumptive nominee by reaching out to superdelegates who had not announced which candidate they were supporting, and confirming that enough were backing Mrs. Clinton to get her to the magic number of 2, 383. But her aides were reluctant to proclaim the race over, for fear of depressing turnout on Tuesday  —   especially in California, where the race remains close  —   or appearing to take the victory for granted. Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager, said the A. P.’s call was “an important milestone” but indicated Mrs. Clinton did not intend to declare victory until Tuesday night, when she “will clinch not only a win in the popular vote, but also the majority of pledged delegates. ” Advisers to Mr. Sanders took a dim view of the math. He previously said he would lobby Clinton superdelegates to shift their support to him by arguing that he is the party’s best chance to defeat Mr. Trump, and he particularly plans to target those superdelegates who represent states where Mr. Sanders won primaries and caucuses. The advisers, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Mr. Sanders was aiming to win the California primary on Tuesday to bolster his argument to superdelegates that he is the stronger and more popular candidate than Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Sanders, speaking on Monday night at a rally in San Francisco, did not acknowledge the news that Mrs. Clinton had clinched the nomination, and instead defiantly vowed to continue his candidacy to the convention. But he also made clear that Tuesday’s vote was make or break for the future of his campaign. “Tomorrow is the most important primary in the whole Democratic nominating process  —   we are going to win here in California,” Mr. Sanders said. He added that if he could win the Tuesday contests in California, North Dakota, South Dakota, New Mexico, Montana and do well in New Jersey, his campaign would be “going into that convention with enormous momentum. ” Moments before Mr. Sanders took the stage, former State Senator Nina Turner of Ohio led thousands of supporters in a chant shouting, “Fight on. Fight on. Fight on. ” It was a sentiment shared by many audience members like Alex Borja, 18, of Castro Valley, Calif. who said he was happy Mr. Sanders had not conceded to Mrs. Clinton and hoped he would remain in the race through the summer. “I don’t think it’s fair that they have basically coronated Hillary as the nominee from the beginning and, at this point, Bernie still has a chance to win the delegates needed to clinch the nomination at the convention,” Mr. Borja said. He added, however, that he would vote for Mrs. Clinton if she were the nominee. Mr. Sanders’s campaign spokesman, Michael Briggs, issued a sharply worded statement that refused to accept the A. P. survey. “It is unfortunate that the media, in a rush to judgment, are ignoring the Democratic National Committee’s clear statement that it is wrong to count the votes of superdelegates before they actually vote at the convention this summer,” Mr. Briggs said. Mr. Trump struck familiar notes on Monday night on Twitter, attacking Mrs. Clinton as unfit for the presidency, but he also put his own spin on making history during an interview with Fox News. “I was the one that really broke the glass ceiling on behalf of women, more than anybody, in the construction industry,” Mr. Trump said. For Mrs. Clinton, becoming her party’s presumptive nominee is the latest chapter in a remarkable career that has taken her from being the first lady to being one election away from returning to the White House as president. She planned a victory rally on Tuesday in Brooklyn, but by the time The A. P. had called the contest, she seemed to already be in a celebratory mood, ending a campaign slog that had been expected to come to a close after the early contests but dragged on to just before the final votes were tallied, at a “She’s With Us” concert at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles with John Legend, Christina Aguilera and Stevie Wonder. Mrs. Clinton had for weeks hardly hid her eagerness to put the primary contests against Mr. Sanders behind her and to turn her full focus to the presumptive Republican nominee, Mr. Trump. Talking to voters at the Hawkins House of Burgers in the Watts section of Los Angeles, Mrs. Clinton promised to take on Mr. Trump “all the time,” and, earlier that day, she urged Mr. Sanders’s supporters to consider the consequences if Mr. Trump captured the White House. “Anyone who’s supported me, anyone who has supported Senator Sanders has a lot at stake in this election in preventing Donald Trump from being our president, which I can barely say,” she told reporters on Monday. But Mrs. Clinton must also work in the coming weeks to improve her own standing with voters, both with Mr. Sanders’s hordes of young supporters and with a majority of registered voters who say they do not like or trust her. Still, many Democratic allies of Mrs. Clinton did not want to wait until Tuesday’s primaries to celebrate, writing Twitter posts and issuing statements hailing her as the nominee and trying to shift the Democratic Party’s focus and the national political conversation to take aim at Mr. Trump. Jennifer Granholm, the former Michigan governor who now advises a   “super PAC,” said in an email: “It’s beyond words incredibly moving for me personally  —   but premature. We don’t want to crush democracy. Still six states tomorrow whose votes must be counted. It’s crucial to encourage people to vote. ” At Mrs. Clinton’s rally on Monday evening in California, several voters expressed exhilaration at her historic victory. “It’s about time,” said Maria Garibay, a retired manufacturing analyst. But others also braced themselves for a final showdown with Mr. Sanders and ferocious fight against Mr. Trump. “I hope Bernie goes out gracefully,” said Helen Satorius, a retired high school counselor. “We need to beat Trump, completely and totally. So I think now he needs to just be willing to unite. ”",0

8030,The World Sees a Diminished America,"The World Sees a Diminished America November 13, 2016 
While there is hope that President Trump will end the bloody years of U.S. adventurism abroad, the initial shock from his victory could diminish America’s standing in the world, says ex-CIA analyst Paul R. Pillar. 
By Paul R. Pillar 
The impact of the election result on the standing of the United States in the world has too many aspects to encapsulate or even, in this early stage of shock, to comprehend. 
This is particularly so with a president-elect who will have to construct a foreign policy largely unguided by previous thinking on his part that exhibits consistency and coherence beyond a few themes such as discontent with free-loading allies, admiration for powerful autocrats, and conceiving of economic relations in zero-sum mercantilist terms. President Barack Obama delivers remarks during his address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York, N.Y., Sept. 23, 2013. (Official White House Photo by Amanda Lucidon) 
But we can already note some aspects of America’s global standing that are related to the election itself and the campaign that preceded it. These aspects involve damage that already has been done, and that the result of the election punctuates and extends. 
Some of the damage stems from the xenophobic content of Mr. Trump’s campaign, with the disparagement, or what many overseas will take to be disparagement, of major parts of humanity, including among others the nearly quarter of the world’s population that is Muslim. That such a campaign was a winning campaign reveals the underlying views to be held by much more of America than the president-elect himself. 
The extent to which those views are held by Americans who are deplorable or by Americans who are merely discontented and easy prey for such themes matters less to overseas observers than the content of the views themselves. 
This pattern hits the American image hard in a place where it hitherto has looked rather good. Many polls conducted overseas have yielded results that couple negative views of U.S. policies with positive feelings toward the American people. Perhaps the latter part of such results will start to become less pronounced. 
A Procedural Black Eye 
Then there is the presidential selection process itself. The election to the most powerful post in the world of someone who is, by temperament and experience, so manifestly unqualified to hold it will be taken by many as a failure of that process. Donald Trump and Mike Pence during Day Three of the Republican National Convention. (Photo credit: Grant Miller/RNC) 
And Mr. Trump himself provided voluminous rhetoric during the campaign about how the process is “rigged,” how he would not accept an unfavorable outcome, and how if he won he would incarcerate his opponent, amid references to “Second Amendment solutions” and the like. A casual foreign observer only needed to listen to Mr. Trump to conclude that America’s claim to having an admirable liberal democratic process for choosing its leaders is false. 
A more careful, less casual, foreign observer might discount Mr. Trump’s rhetoric as campaign bombast but would notice other disturbing things about the election. It appears that Mrs. Clinton won a plurality of the popular vote, making this the second out of the last five U.S. presidential elections in which the popular vote winner was denied the White House. 
Foreign observers might not appreciate the background to why the Electoral College exists, but the disconnect between votes cast and offices won is even more apparent with the routine and blatant gerrymandering, which has served as an incumbent protection device as well as enabling the Republican Party in recent years to hold a majority of seats in the House of Representatives even while losing in total votes to the Democrats. 
On top of that are the comparably blatant efforts by one party to gain or hold office not just by winning votes but by suppressing voting by citizens deemed more likely to support the other party. And on top of that in this election was the October surprise from the head of the top national law enforcement agency, a development that in an election this close could well have made a difference in the outcome. 
All of this is prime material for anyone overseas wanting to disparage American democracy. Regimes with that motivation have been having a field day. Iranian propaganda writers have had an easy time, merely encouraging people to follow the U.S. election campaign on television. Vladimir Putin didn’t need to interfere in the U.S. political process to diminish any image advantage it has over his own. 
The fact that the side that benefited from things such as voter suppression and Comey’s surprise won the U.S. political contest is what extends into the future the already inflicted damage to the image of American democracy. That is in addition to this election demonstrating that in America, a xenophobic campaign is a winner. A victory by Mrs. Clinton would have been seen overseas both as a repudiation of the xenophobia and as an overcoming by the political process of the irregularities. 
If there is any possible offsetting advantage regarding what American democracy in action displays to others, it is that we will be spared seeing Republicans doing everything possible to frustrate a President Clinton’s ability to govern. The foreshadowing of such a scenario, had the election result gone the other way, was obvious. There was much talk of impeachment, which is supposed to be a remedy for high crimes and misdemeanors committed in office, before the target even took office or won an election to the office. 
Victory for the Saboteurs 
Also, as columnist Richard Cohen observed , Congressman Jason Chaffetz, “the chairman of what amounts to the Permanent Committee to Investigate Hillary (actually, the House Oversight Committee),” was promising before the election to conduct investigations “until the end of time or Fox News loses interest, whichever comes first.” Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, appearing on CBS’“Face the Nation.” 
Perhaps most stunning were the promises, after Republican refusal all year even to consider President Obama’s nominee to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court, to block anyone a President Clinton nominated to the court during an entire four-year term. 
Such a position not only would have represented a new depth in governmental dysfunction but also a direct assault on the concept of an independent judiciary, which is one of the most important things that separate stable liberal democracies that operate with the rule of law from a lot of other less admirable countries that don’t. And this talk was coming not from Donald Trump but from the principal runner-up for the Republican nomination (Ted Cruz) and a previous   (John McCain). 
Of course, being “spared” sabotage and obstruction probably should not be considered an advantage when the alternative is to have the saboteurs running the whole show. 
The defacement of American democracy, as well as the xenophobia, both of which are already unavoidably associated with Donald Trump’s presidency before he even takes the oath of office, have multiple and significant consequences for U.S. overseas interests, however difficult it may be to limn precise effects that will appear over the next four years. 
The consequences will include degradation of any claim by the United States to leadership of inclusive, liberal democracies. They also will include weakening of political advantages — especially among disparaged or excluded populations and the governments that lead them — that the United States has traditionally enjoyed as an object of admiration and emulation. They include a reduction of confidence in, and support for, democracy itself. 
Anything that weakens, or threatens to weaken, Americans’ own stable, inclusive democracy ought to be a source of dismay regardless of the repercussions overseas. But those repercussions are an added reason for the dismay.

8031,Panama Papers: The Role of Western Secrecy Jurisdictions in Looting Africa,"Originally published at the Tax Justice Network 
This blog comes from Johannesburg, South Africa, where investigative journalists from 28 countries are sharing their work at the African Investigative Journalism Conference . One session looked at stories dug out from the Panama Papers leak from offshore law firm Mossack Fonseca and investigations which have revealed a colourful mix of characters involved in looting Africa. 
The stories uncovered include a mafia lawyer linked to the film The French Connection , an absentee landowning Russian oligarch , plus, of course, a former politician , and a “millionaire receptionist” who denies knowledge of having owned nine offshore companies registered in the British Virgin Islands. 
The common factor in all these stories is the role of offshore secrecy jurisdictions populated by western banks, western lawyers, western accounting firms, and protected by leading western nations like the United Kingdom, which even as I write is vigorously trying to protect its Crown Dependencies from attempts to crack down on offshore secrecy . 
Unsurprisingly the British Virgin Islands – a British overseas territory – feature heavily, as does Switzerland . 
The story of the “millionaire receptionist” Letitia Diergaardt, covered by The Namibian newspaper, provides fascinating insights into the duplicity of offshore secrecy. Diergaardt works as a receptionist/clerk in Windhoek, Namibia. Yet according to The Namibian she technically owns or owned nine offshore companies registered in the British Virgin Islands. However, as The Namibian reports, she denies all knowledge of owning these companies, which were registered in the BVI between 13th and 25th April 2007. 
Apparently unknown to her, Diergaardt’s identity was used to provide a nominee shareholder for all nine companies. As The Namibian dryly notes: “on face value, the use of her name in these companies is to represent hidden owners . . “ 
Secretive shell companies are a core part of the secrecy jurisdiction offer. They provide immunity from criminal investigation and prosecution. They are the ‘get-out-of-jail-free’ card for crooks and their enablers. Secretive shell companies allow nominee owners to front for those known as the ‘ultimate beneficial owners’, as The Namibian comments: 
“The secretive offshore industry relies on a network of individuals whose names are used on official records as directors, company secretaries and shareholders. Often, the real owners who call the shots remain invisible, hiding behind dummy directors, who are only owners of these companies on paper.” 
Yet despite all the evidence of abuse of offshore companies registered in Road Town, the British Virgin Islands government persists in blocking moves to make a registry of ultimate beneficial ownership available to public scrutiny. In Jersey, another British tax haven, the authorities refuse to make company ownership information available to investigative journalists by claiming that a public registry would “lead to fraud and cybercrime.” 
Let’s be frank. For all their pious words about wanting to crack down on corrupt practices, western governments remain deeply implicated in facilitating the looting of Africa . 
As Shinovene Immanuel from The Namibian told this blogger earlier today: 
“The West must help Africa by locking the doors through which the money flows, and the West must also pull up their socks to make these offshore companies more transparent. If Western countries want to help developing countries, they must stop standing in the way of investigating corrupt business practices.” 0 0 0 0 0 0",0
8032,Franklin Graham: Donald Trump Won Election by the ‘Hand of God’,"Celebrated evangelical Rev. Franklin Graham says that it was the “hand of God,” rather than Russian hackers, that determined the outcome of November’s presidential election. [“I think maybe God has allowed Donald Trump to win this election to protect this nation for the next few years by giving maybe an opportunity to have some good judges,” he said.  The son of renowned Baptist minister Billy Graham, the Rev. Franklin Graham has been invited by   Trump to be one of six clergy to offer the invocation, benediction, and several readings at his   ceremony on January 20. In an interview with Religion News Service Thursday, Graham said that beyond mere human factors, the mysterious hand of divine providence was at work in the elections. “All I know is Donald Trump was supposed to lose the election” according to all the polls, Graham said. “For these states to go the way they did, in my opinion, I think it was the hand of God,” he said. “It wasn’t hacking. It wasn’t   or whatever. It was God, in my opinion, and I believe his hand was at work, and I think he’s given Christians an opportunity. ” While never officially endorsing Trump, Rev. Graham has been a sharp critic of the Obama administration and a vocal opponent of Hillary Clinton, especially for her uncompromising support of   . Shortly before Election Day, Graham declared that the best choice for president “isn’t difficult to figure out if you are a Christian,” in evident reference to Republican candidate Donald Trump. “There’s two different pictures and two different visions for America,” Graham said in early November. “The Democratic Party has a vision, Hillary Clinton has a vision, Donald Trump has a totally different vision for this nation with the Republican Party. This isn’t difficult to figure out if you are a Christian. ” The evangelist acknowledged that for many, voting for Trump might not have been easy, but he insisted that it was, nonetheless, the better choice and that Trump was a “changed man. ” “You may have to hold your nose and vote,” Graham said. “I have people that say, ‘Well I don’t like Donald Trump, I don’t like what he says.’ Well I don’t like what he said either, I promise I don’t like it. But those are things that he said 11 years ago, not something that he said today. ” “I think Donald Trump has changed,” Graham added. “I think God is working on his heart and in his life. But people have to make up their own mind. ” In a Facebook post some weeks earlier, Graham had stated that “the difference between the candidates is night and day. ” “Some candidates have entire political ads talking about how they spent their career fighting for the rights of children,” he said. “Yet they spent their entire career fighting against the rights of unborn children!” Graham said Hillary Clinton’s progressive agenda was “godless” and could not be defended. Following WikiLeaks revelations, the preacher denounced the “depth of corruption” in Washington politics, calling for its eradication. “WikiLeaks is giving us a much clearer picture of the depth of the corruption that is thriving in our nation’s capital,” Graham wrote, calling it “a swamp that needs to be drained. ” “Our political system is broken, and it will take strong, tough leadership to begin fixing some of this,” Graham said. Regarding the inauguration ceremony, Graham says he still has not decided which Scripture passage to read. “I’m taking time just to pray and ask God to give me wisdom and guidance because it’s a responsibility that I take very seriously,” he said.

8033,Feds Indict 33 ’Thief-in-Law’ Members of Russian Syndicate,"  defendants associated with a Russian “  ” syndicate were arrested for a host of crimes. The arrests for alleged racketeering, extortion,    robbery, fraud, conspiracy, narcotics, and firearms spanned from Brighton Beach to Las Vegas, NYPD Commissioner James P. O’Neill said. [The acting U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Joon H. Kim, and officials with the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the New York City Police Department (NYPD) announced three indictments and one complaint charging the 33 defendants.  Acting Manhattan U. S. Attorney Joon Kim said in a statement: [W]e have charged 33 members and associates of a Russian organized crime syndicate allegedly engaging a panoply of crimes around the country. The indictments include charges against the alleged head of this national criminal enterprise, one of the first federal racketeering charges ever brought against a Russian ‘vor.’ The dizzying array of criminal schemes committed by this organized crime syndicate allegedly include a    conspiracy, a plot to rob victims by seducing and drugging them with chloroform, the theft of cargo shipments containing over 10, 000 pounds of chocolate, and a fraud on casino slot machines using electronic hacking devices. FBI Assistant    William F. Sweeney Jr. said, “The suspects in this case cast a wide net of criminal activity, aiming to make as much money as possible, all allegedly organized and run by a man who promised to protect them. But that protection didn’t include escaping justice and being arrested by the agents and detectives on the FBI New York Eurasian Organized Crime Task Force. ” Court documents obtained allege members of the “Shulaya Enterprise” operated a complicated conspiracy dealing in stolen cigarettes,    the illegal sale of firearms to known felons, gambling activities, illegal debt collection, extortion, and other violent activities. “Most members and associates of the Shulaya Enterprise were born in the former Soviet Union and many maintained substantial ties to Georgia, the Ukraine, and the Russian Federation, including regular travel to those countries, communication with associates in those countries, and the transfer of criminal proceeds to individuals in those countries,” prosecutors stated in a   indictment. “The Shulaya Enterprise was led principally by two individuals, Razhden Shulaya,    “Brother,”    “Roma,” and Zurab Dzhanashvili,    “Zura,” the defendants, who each coordinated and directed   members and associates of the Shulaya Enterprise. ” Many of the counts in the indictment unsealed earlier this week dealt with trafficking stolen cigarettes and the operation of illegal gambling houses. In one count, suspects Shulaya, Dzhanashvili, and Akaki Ubilava (   “Ako”) met in one of the establishments to divide about $70, 000 in proceeds from a poker game. Other counts dealt with members of the syndicate dealing in stolen credit cards and bank account information. In an unusual case, defendant Dzhanashvili allegedly arranged for the transportation and sale of approximately 10, 000 pounds of stolen chocolate confections to a confidential informant working with law enforcement officials. The informant in this case also allegedly negotiated the purchase of multiple firearms from the defendants despite their knowledge he is a convicted felon, ineligible to legally purchase a pistol. Another count in the indictment alleges the suspects’ involvement in the trafficking of cocaine and heroin. Acting CBP New York Director Leon Hayward said, “U. S. Customs and Border Protection is extremely proud to have assisted our federal partners in this operation.  It is through our interagency partnerships, and collaborative approaches like the one leading to today’s arrests, that law enforcement successfully combats modern criminal organizations. ” Acting U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York stated, “he dizzying array of criminal schemes committed by this organized crime syndicate allegedly include a    conspiracy, a plot to rob victims by seducing and drugging them with chloroform, the theft of cargo shipments containing over 10, 000 pounds of chocolate, and a fraud on casino slot machines using electronic hacking devices. Thanks to the remarkable interagency partnership of FBI, CBP, and NYPD, we have charged and arrested 33 defendants allegedly involved in this criminal enterprise. ” The Shulaya Enterprise operated what is referred to as a “vor v zakonei” or “vor. ” These are Russian phrases which translate to “  ” or “thief. ” New York Police Department Commissioner James O’Neil referenced the translated Russian phrase, stating on Wednesday, “The    allegedly established an extensive cross country criminal enterprise from Brighton Beach to Las Vegas that engaged in bribes, gambling, and murder for hire.

8035,Chris Matthews Sounds Alarm On Trump Presidency In Chilling Warning To Americans (VIDEO) – New Century Times,"Share on Facebook 
One of the biggest reasons Donald Trump was able to win enough votes to take over the White House was his relentless attacks of corruption against Hillary Clinton, all while the media virtually ignored the accusations of corruption against Donald Trump. In fact, it’s looking more and more likely that by his very first day in office, Donald Trump will be the most corrupt president ever. 
MSNBC’s Chris Matthews and MSNBC’s Chief Legal Analyst, Ari Melber are among several who are beginning to wake up to the reality that Trump plans on using the presidency in the very worst way possible, in a way that would have the Founding Fathers rolling in their graves. Our first self-described billionaire President Elect plans on using the presidency to make himself and his family even more wealthy. 
One of the biggest problems, as Matthew sees it, is that Trump wants to give his children national security clearance and everything that goes along with it, all while letting them take the reigns of the Trump fortune. This is illegal in so many ways. 
As Melber points out, hiring family was banned in an anti-nepotism law passed in 1967. Proponents of the law were especially concerned because a President should be free to fire staff and cabinet members, but that can be tough to do if staff or cabinet members are family. Trump’s workaround for the nepotism law, though, is to not give his family members official titles, but still, he hopes to include them in his decision making processes and let them sit in on critical meetings. 
Here’s the thought and anger provoking video: 
While Matthews’ and Melber’s discussion was mostly theoretical, there are already real-life consequences to Trump’s glaring conflicts of interests. 
The Washington Post on Friday reported that about 100 foreign diplomats are trying to curry favor with the Trump administration by booking rooms in Trump’s Washington DC hotel, sometimes at rates of up to $20,000 a night. If you recall, the Clinton Foundation was accused of offering access in exchange for donations. The evidence that that ever happened was weak, but still, it was something that Trump didn’t let go of during his entire campaign. The idea that Trump would be hosting diplomats, in his hotel, to profit his company, is way beyond anything Clinton is accused of. 
That’s not even the tip of the iceberg. While he did settle the Trump University fraud case, Trump apparently Underreported: 
Trump owes millions to Deutsche Bank

” target=”_blank”>owes millions to Deutsche Bank, a bank which is being fined by the Department of Justice. Will Trump drop the fines in exchange for Deutsche Bank dropping their claim? Perhaps Trump will uncharacteristically take the high road (doubtful), but no president should have that power to begin with. 
I’m sure as we turn over even more rocks, we’ll find far more conflicts of interest and evidence that Trump only ran for office for personal enrichment. 
There’s a reason elected officials are supposed to put all their assets into blind trusts (and handing them over to their kids is the exact opposite of a blind trust). Governments are not in the business of making money. Trump is. That’s a conflict of interest and it should be deemed unacceptable by all Americans. ",0
8036,"Aspartame Corporation Searle Created First Birth Control Pill: American Eugenics and Big Pharma, a History","Aspartame Corporation Searle Created First Birth Control Pill: American Eugenics and Big Pharma, a History   
( Era of Wisdom ) Did you know that Aspartame producing corporation Searle also manufactured the first birth control pill ? 
After Donald Rumsfeld was Secretary of Defense under Gerald Ford , he was the CEO of Searle , engineering their merger with Monsanto. A testament to his influence, he became Secretary of Defense again during the Bush Administration, participating in atrocious torture and war crimes such as the ones at Abu Ghraib. 
One of the most veracious proponents for forced sterilization of blacks , the poor, and “imbeciles,” Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger , was a main contributor to what would culminate into Searle’s manufacture of “Enovid”: the first hormonal birth control pill. This philosophy is commonly known as “ eugenics ,” sometimes referred to as “dysgenics” or “epi-eugenics.” 
Well summarized by the Embryo Project : “ Enovid was the first hormonal birth control pill. G.D. Searle and Company began marketing Enovid as a contraceptive in 1960. The technology was created by the joint efforts of many individuals and organizations, including Margaret Sanger, Katharine McCormick , Gregory Pincus, John Rock, Syntex , S.A. Laboratories, and G.D. Searle and Company Laboratories. Although there were many pieces and contributors to the final product, it was first conceived of and created by Gregory Pincus and Margaret Sanger through the Worcester Foundation in Worcester, Massachusetts, and was distributed by Searle, located in Chicago.” 
To illustrate historical ties between “big pharma” and eugenics, let’s take a look at the legacy of Dr. John Hurty, an early chemist at Prozac producer Eli Lilly and Company in the 1870’s. 
Hurty would go on to influence the passage of the United States’ first mandatory sterilization law, in 1907 Indiana . 
He was a tireless eugenicist , who believed that the poor, colored people , the disabled, ect. were a burden to the state and society, unfit for reproduction, and should be sterilized. 
Upwards of 60,000 Americans were involuntarily sterilized through to even the 1970’s , while Dr. John Hurty, Margaret Sanger, David Starr Jordan and others made major contributions. Reading from an article by renowned author Edwin Black : “Ultimately, eugenics practitioners coercively sterilized some 60,000 Americans, barred the marriage of thousands, forcibly segregated thousands in “colonies,” and persecuted untold numbers in ways we are just learning.” 
Dr. John Hurty, first president of Stanford David Starr Jordan, and Margaret Sanger were members of the scientific, academic class which birthed eugenics, and eventually the world we live in today where Searle had a hand in both birth control, and suspicious toxins such as Aspartame. 
Reading from this document, which is based on the 1946 book “ The Hoosier Health Officer: A Biography of Dr. John N. Hurty “ : “In 1873, John Newell Hurty went to work for Col. Eli Lilly in his newly established Eli Lilly and Company Pharmaceuticals in Indianapolis as his chief chemist. Then in 1879, Hurty opened his own drug store at the corner of Ohio and Pennsylvania streets. In the basement of that establishment, he set up one of the first analytical laboratories in the state. Among the variety of things he tested for purity was water for the Indianapolis Water Company. In 1884, Dr. Hurty established, and for a time taught at, the School of Pharmacy at Purdue University. In 1891, Hurty earned his medical degree from the Medical College of Indiana. In 1899, Dr. Hurty wrote a bill that became the first comprehensive food and drug legislation to be enacted in the United States. It was not only used as a model by other states, but the Federal Law of 1906 is taken almost word for word from Dr. Hurty’s bill.” 
This article/video seeks to pose the question: was birth control created as part of eugenics, population control, as part of something that goes beyond money or some alleged philanthropic agenda? Are certain chemicals or pharmaceuticals in circulation designed to fulfill an agenda that goes beyond money, an agenda perhaps that extends into eugenics? 
We are not suggesting people do one thing or another with their bodies, we are not asking you to make a decision about your health, but we are presenting you with historical info to better make decisions for yourself. 
We’re making the case that Searle profited from the eugenic ambitions of people such as Margaret Sanger: while it is unclear at this moment whether Searle cared about simply money or something deeper. This should raise suspicion about why they pushed so hard for the legalization of Aspartame after the FDA had already banned it , under the direction of powerful Donald Rumsfeld. 
Given all of this history, we would be wise to ask: could Aspartame possibly have roots in eugenics? Could certain pharmaceutical drugs have ties to eugenics? It is not a wild accusation or unreasonable question to ponder. 
To take it even further: FDA commissioner Margaret Hamburg is the daughter of not one, but two directors of the American Eugenics Society, which later was quietly renamed the “ The Society for Biodemography and Social Biology .”",0
8037,Only Making Matters Worse in Syria,"License DMCA 
Middle East policy has reached an inflexion point, a moment when Official Washington seems to be caught in the middle between escalation and retreat. 
On one hand, the rhetoric has not been more militant since Hillary Clinton's famous ""we came, we saw, he died"" moment in October 2011. With Barack Obama halfway out the door and Clinton all but crowned, Washington's laptop bombardiers are rejoicing that the half-measures are over and judgment day nearly at hand. 
Thus, The New York Times assures us that that the Middle East is ""desperate for American leadership"" while the Washington Post reports that ""the Republicans and Democrats who make up the foreign policy elite are laying the ground work for a more assertive American foreign policy."" 
Leading think tanks are publishing ""a flurry of reports"" urging stepped-up intervention, including U.S.-backed ""safe zones to protect moderate rebels from Syrian and Russian forces"" and even ""limited"" cruise-missile strikes. But while differing on the details, all agree something must be done. The time to act is now. 
As Vox puts it: ""The hot new policy idea in Washington is the hottest old idea: direct US military intervention in Syria's civil war."" - Advertisement - 
But reading between the lines, a very different picture emerges, a realization that the U.S. has painted itself into a corner and that there is little it can do after all. Thus, the Times observes that while the Middle East is clamoring for U.S. leadership, it is not clamoring for Bush-style intervention but for some mythical ""middle ground"" in between him and Obama. 
While reporting that pro-escalation sentiment is unanimous in Washington's vast foreign-policy establishment -- sometimes known as "" the blob "" -- the Washington Post notes that ""even pinprick cruise-missile strikes designed to hobble the Syrian air force or punish [President Bashar al-]Assad would risk a direct confrontation with Russian forces"" and wonders whether a war-weary public will support any intervention at all. 
""My concern is that we may be talking to each other and agreeing with each other,"" it quotes one expert as saying, ""but that these discussions are isolated from where the public may be right now."" 
Official Washington in a Bubble 
Thus, even the Establishment worries that it lives in a bubble. Washington wants war, it needs war, and yet it admits in practically the same breath that it can't have it. So what will it do? - Advertisement - 
Then there are the mild liberals over at Vox, the hip and successful Washington website founded by journalistic wunderkind Ezra Klein. Voxers pride themselves on being sharp and practical yet in the end they are sealed off as well. The poster boy for this tendency is Zack Beauchamp, a young writer who stars in a recent Vox video entitled, "" The crisis in Aleppo, explained in 4 minutes ."" 
As Beauchamp lectures away amid fancy graphics and cool background music, the video faithfully toes the Washington line, both the stirring gung-ho part and the downbeat refrain that inevitably follows. Thus, he describes the Syrian civil war as a ""story of flip-flops,"" with Assad seemingly on the ropes until Iran and Russia put him back on his feet, at which point the Saudis and Qataris put the rebels back on their feet so the game can continue. 
But the real turning point, he says, occurred in September 2015 when Russia stepped in with airstrikes that allowed the government to besiege the Salafists in eastern Aleppo. 
""A siege,"" Beauchamp then explains, ""involves trapping a group of people, civilians and fighters both, inside a certain territory and denying them supplies until they can no longer fight. Assad's strategy has a vicious logic to it. When you deprive people of food and you bomb them over and over again, they're likely to give in just to make the fighting stop.""",0
8038,"Woman, 88, Talks Man Out of Raping Her by Saying She Is HIV-Positive - Breitbart","An    woman says she was able to talk her way out of being raped after she lied to her   attacker and said she was  . [Helen Reynolds was in her apartment in Parkesburg, Pennsylvania Feb. 17 when a man dressed as an apartment complex worker forced his way inside her home and bound her mouth and hands with duct tape, the Daily Mail reported.  “He wrapped it all around my face and my nose and my eye glasses. He had a piece in my mouth,” Reynolds told WPVI. She said he took $40 from her purse and was about to rape her when she struck up a conversation with the man. Despite having duct tape in her mouth, she was able to talk the man out of raping her. “I said to him, ‘Well it’s like this,’” Reynolds recalled. “‘You might as well know the truth.’ I said, ‘I have HIV and my husband died from it,’ which is a lie. ” She said as soon as she told him that he walked out of the bedroom. “That’s the comment that saved my life,” she said. No suspects have been found yet in connection with the attack on Reynolds. Authorities say there have been a string of home invasions in Chester County, including a one that left a    woman assaulted, tied up, and locked in a closet for four days. Police arrested a    who had escaped from a nearby behavioral facility in that case. When WPVI asked Reynolds if she had anything to say to her attacker who’s still on the loose, she said she had “nothing good to say about him. ” “I have nothing good to say about him. Nothing at all. Put him in jail, and leave the sucker there,” Reynolds said.",0
8039,Report: Trump Signs Repeal of Obama’s Social Security Gun Ban - Breitbart,"On a day when legislation benefiting women and black colleges and universities was signed with much pomp and circumstance, President Trump quietly followed through on his pledge to defend the Second Amendment by signing the repeal of Barack Obama’s Social Security gun ban. [The U. S, House voted to repeal the ban on February 2 and the Senate voted to repeal it on February 15.  The ban was fashioned behind closed doors in the summer of 2015 and Breitbart News reported: The specific details of the ban are unknown, as it is being put together “outside of public view. ” But the LA Times reports that a ban on gun possession due to inability to handle finances would be sweeping that it would cover those who are unable to manage their own affairs for a multitude of reasons —  from “subnormal intelligence or mental illness” to “incompetency,” an unspecified “condition,” or “disease. ” The Times notes that the finances of roughly “4. 2 million” Social Security beneficiaries are handled by someone else. As bits and pieces of the ban continued to be revealed over the following months, it was evident that Social Security beneficiaries who required help managing their finances were in jeopardy of losing their Second Amendment rights. An overview of the ban —  provided by the Social Security Administration (SSA) —  showed it was structured so that persons under mental duress and requiring help with their finances could be investigated by the SSA, then turned over to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) to be barred from gun purchases. Page 19 of the SSA overview said: Under our representative payee policy, unless direct payment is prohibited, we presume that an adult beneficiary is capable of managing or directing the management of benefits. However, if we have information that the beneficiary has a mental or physical impairment that prevents him or her from managing or directing the management of benefits, we will develop the issue of capability. If a beneficiary has a mental impairment, we will develop the capability issue if there is an indication that the beneficiary may lack the ability to reason properly, is disoriented, has seriously impaired judgment, or is unable to communicate with others. Put simply, beneficiaries who caught the SSA’s attention by having someone help with finances could be investigated. The investigation would include a look at mental health and the findings could then serve to justify a prohibition against gun ownership. The Obama administration finalized the ban during the week prior to Christmas 2016, but concern over violations of the Due Process rights of Social Security beneficiaries had already taken center stage and calls for repealing the measure were legion. On February 28, CBS News White House correspondent Mark Knoller reported: Without ceremony, Pres Trump also signed bill nullifying Obama Admin rule providing Social Security info for gun buyer background checks.  —   Mark Knoller (@markknoller) February 28, 2017,  AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

8041,Pope Francis Takes 12 Refugees Back to Vatican After Trip to Greece - The New York Times,"MYTILENE, Greece  —   Pope Francis made an emotional visit into the heart of Europe’s migrant crisis on Saturday and took 12 Muslim refugees from Syria, including six children, with him back to Rome aboard the papal plane. The action punctuated the pope’s pleas for sympathy to the crisis confronting the refugees just as European attitudes are hardening against them. Those taken to Rome were three families  —   two from Damascus and one from Deir    —   whose homes had been bombed in the Syrian war, the Vatican said in a statement as the pope departed the Greek island of Lesbos, where he had visited the Moria refugee camp. “The pope has desired to make a gesture of welcome regarding refugees,” the statement said. The announcement capped a brief trip by the pope to Greece that again placed the plight of migrants at the center of his papacy. “We have come to call the attention of the world to this grave humanitarian crisis and to plead for its resolution,” Francis said during a lunchtime visit to the Moria camp, where leaders of Eastern Orthodox Christian churches joined him. “As people of faith, we wish to join our voices to speak out on your behalf,” Francis continued. “We hope that the world will heed these scenes of tragic and indeed desperate need, and respond in a way worthy of our common humanity. ” While the announcement had the appearance of a surprise, Francis told reporters on the plane ride home that the relocation of the refugees had involved planning and paperwork by the governments of the Vatican, Italy and Greece. In Rome, the Catholic charitable association Sant’Egidio will help care for the families and try to find them work. The pope did not explain how the families had been chosen, but said: “They are guests of the Vatican. ” Francis also showed reporters two drawings given to him by children in the Moria camp. One showed children drowning in the sea. The other showed the sun crying. “The children have these things in their minds, and it will take time before these memories go away,” the pope said. “If the sun is able to cry, so can we. A tear will do us good. ” While papal visits to refugee camps are not new, religious scholars said Francis’ rescue of the 12 Syrians sent an important signal that reflected his long history of affinity with the world’s most vulnerable, dating to his roots as a Jesuit priest in Argentina. “Welcoming the stranger is the heart of the Christian message,” said Charles Camosy, a professor of Christian ethics at Fordham University in New York. While Francis is often seen as a progressive pope, Mr. Camosy said, he also is “pushing a more traditional understanding of what Christianity is all about. ” Francis’ first papal trip in 2013 was to the Italian island of Lampedusa, to call attention to the refugees who were arriving there from Libya  —   or drowning before they reached shore. During his February visit to Mexico, Francis prayed beneath a large cross erected in Ciudad Juárez, just footsteps from the border with the United States, and then celebrated Mass nearby, where he spoke about immigrants. Upon landing in Lesbos on Saturday, Francis held a brief private meeting with Greece’s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, before traveling across the island to the detention center in Moria, where people are held as they await rulings on their asylum applications  —   or as they wait to be deported under a recent agreement struck between the European Union and Turkey to curb migration. Beginning last summer, hundreds of thousands of migrants, mostly from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, have poured into Lesbos after paying smugglers to make the short sea journey from Turkey. The procession through Greece and the Balkans toward Germany plunged the European Union into a political crisis and eventually led several countries to restrict or close their borders. The deal with Turkey includes a provision under which migrants arriving in Greece can be swiftly deported back to Turkey. Since the deal took effect last month, the number of migrants arriving in Lesbos has dropped sharply (even as the numbers arriving in Italy are steadily rising). Critics say the agreement has trampled on the civil rights of refugees fleeing war and betrayed the ideals of the European Union. At the migrants camp, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual leader of the world’s Eastern Orthodox Christians, reminded Europeans and their leaders that Christians and others are judged on how they treat the powerless. “The world will be judged by the way it has treated you,” Bartholomew told the refugees. “And we will all be accountable for the way we respond to the crisis and conflict in the regions that you come from. The Mediterranean Sea should not be a tomb. ” Thousands of migrants have drowned in the Mediterranean, including a young child whose limp body washed ashore last year on the Turkish coast. A photograph of the child became a searing icon of the refugee crisis. “I hope that we never see children washing up on the shores of the Aegean Sea,” said Archbishop Ieronymos II, the leader of the Greek Orthodox Church, who called for a greater response by the United Nations. “I hope to soon see them there, untroubled, enjoying life. ” At the Moria center, Francis slowly walked down a line of migrants, many of them Muslims, greeting people as some waved handwritten signs with slogans like “Freedom of Movement. ” Others propped their children above their shoulders or held out smartphones to photograph the pope. Inside a large white tent, Francis greeted a woman in a head scarf as she cradled her baby, as well as other refugee families. A small boy stepped forward and handed him a picture drawn with crayons. An Iraqi mother asked Francis to help her find medical care for her child’s bone cancer. At one point, a man began wailing as Francis placed his hands on the man’s head. “Please, Father, bless me!” the man shouted. “Please, Father, bless me!” Francis and the other religious leaders offered special praise on Saturday for ordinary Greeks who have welcomed refugees, taken some into their homes or provided food and clothing, even as they endure hardship amid the country’s   financial crisis. Mr. Tsipras and other Greek leaders have called on the European Union to provide more help to the country as it has borne the brunt of the migrant crisis. Across Europe, the mood has soured in recent months, as many countries have closed or restricted their borders amid mounting public anxiety over the chaotic influx of more than a million refugees last year. The recent terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels have also darkened public attitudes and stirred   sentiment in some areas, even as many refugees say they are trying to escape extremist violence.     parties have seized on the crisis to make gains, most recently in regional elections in Germany. By appearing with the two Orthodox Christian leaders, Francis also took another small step in healing the breach between the Eastern and Western branches of Christianity. Francis has made ecumenical outreach a priority and in February became the first pope to meet with the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church. Carlo Pioppi, a professor of church history at Santa Croce University in Rome, said the appearance by the three leaders showed they could put aside doctrinal and theological differences to highlight their shared concern about refugees. The three men described the refugee influx as one of Europe’s most serious crises since the end of World War II. “Regular people will understand the sign these three religious leaders are sending,” Professor Pioppi said in an interview on Friday. “To see them have lunch with refugees, all together, is a strong message of humanity. ” The British charity Oxfam released a statement on Friday calling for a moratorium on deportations of refugees from Greece to Turkey until the authorities can guarantee that asylum processes are followed. The group also raised questions about new “fast track” processes to review asylum cases that the Greek Parliament recently approved under pressure from the European Union. “Thousands are being held in squalid detention centers on the Greek Islands  —   this is the state of Europe in 2016,” Farah Karimi, the executive director of Oxfam Novib, the Dutch affiliate of Oxfam, said in the statement. “Shame on the E. U. for prioritizing detention and deportation over people’s rights to safety and dignity. ”",0

8044,"AT&T-Time Warner Merger To Expand Corporate, State Control Of Media","World Socialist Web Site 
AT&T, the telecommunications and cable TV colossus, announced Saturday that it has struck a deal to acquire the pay TV and entertainment giant Time Warner. The merger, if approved by the Justice Department and US regulatory agencies under the next administration, will create a corporate entity with unprecedented control over both the distribution and content of news and entertainment. It will also mark an even more direct integration of the media and the telecomm industry with the state. 
AT&T, the largest US telecom group by market value, already controls huge segments of the telephone, pay-TV and wireless markets. Its $48.5 billion purchase of the satellite provider DirecTV last year made it the biggest pay-TV provider in the country, ahead of Comcast. It is the second-largest wireless provider, behind Verizon. 
Time Warner is the parent company of such cable TV staples as HBO, Cinemax, CNN and the other Turner System channels: TBS, TNT and Turner Sports. It also owns the Warner Brothers film and TV studio. 
The Washington Post on Sunday characterized the deal as a “seismic shift” in the “media and technology world,” one that “could turn the legacy carrier [AT&T] into a media titan the likes of which the United States has never seen.” The newspaper cited Craig Moffett, an industry analyst at Moffett-Nathanson, as saying there was no precedent for a telecom company the size of AT&T seeking to acquire a content company such as Time Warner. 
“A [telecom company] owning content is something that was expressly prohibited for a century” by the government, Moffett told the Post . 
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, in keeping with his anti-establishment pose, said Saturday that the merger would lead to “too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,” and that, if elected, he would block it. 
The Clinton campaign declined to comment on Saturday. Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Kaine, speaking on the NBC News program “Meet the Press” on Sunday, said he had “concerns” about the merger, but he declined to take a clear position, saying he had not seen the details. 
AT&T, like the other major telecom and Internet companies, has collaborated with the National Security Agency (NSA) in its blanket, illegal surveillance of telephone and electronic communications. NSA documents released last year by Edward Snowden show that AT&T has played a particularly reactionary role. 
As the New York Times put it in an August 15, 2015 article reporting the Snowden leaks: “The National Security Agency’s ability to spy on vast quantities of Internet traffic passing through the United States has relied on its extraordinary, decades-long partnership with a single company: the telecom giant AT&T.” 
The article went on to cite an NSA document describing the relationship between AT&T and the spy agency as “highly collaborative,” and quoted other documents praising the company’s “extreme willingness to help” and calling their mutual dealings “a partnership, not a contractual relationship.” 
The Times noted that AT&T installed surveillance equipment in at least 17 of its Internet hubs based in the US, provided technical assistance enabling the NSA to wiretap all Internet communications at the United Nations headquarters, a client of AT&T, and gave the NSA access to billions of emails. 
If the merger goes through, this quasi-state entity will be in a position to directly control the content of much of the news and entertainment accessed by the public via television, the movies and smart phones. The announcement of the merger agreement is itself an intensification of a process of telecom and media convergence and consolidation that has been underway for years, and has accelerated under the Obama administration. 
In 2009, the cable provider Comcast announced its acquisition for $30 billion of the entertainment conglomerate NBCUniversal, which owns both the National Broadcasting Company network and Universal Studios. The Obama Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission ultimately approved the merger. 
Other recent mergers involving telecoms and content producers include, in addition to AT&T’s 2015 purchase of DirecTV: Verizon Communications’ acquisition of the Huffington Post , Yahoo and AOL; Lionsgate’s deal to buy the pay-TV channel Starz; Verizon’s agreement announced in the spring to buy DreamWorks Animation; and Charter Communications’ acquisition of the cable provider Time Warner Cable, approved this year. 
The AT&T-Time Warner announcement will itself trigger a further restructuring and consolidation of the industry, as rival corporate giants scramble to compete within a changing environment that has seen the growth of digital and streaming companies such as Netflix and Hulu at the expense of the traditional cable and satellite providers. 
The Financial Times wrote on Saturday that “the mooted deal could fire the starting gun on a round of media and technology consolidation.” Referring to a new series of mergers and acquisitions, the Wall Street Journal on Sunday quoted a “top media executive” as saying that an AT&T-Time Warner deal would “certainly kick off the dance.” 
The scale of the buyout agreed unanimously by the boards of both companies is massive. AT&T is to pay Time Warner a reported $85.4 billion in cash and stocks, at a price of $107.50 per Time Warner share. This is significantly higher than the current market price of Time Warner shares, which rose 8 percent to more than $89 Friday on rumors of the merger deal. 
In addition, AT&T is to take on Time Warner’s debt, pushing the actual cost of the deal to more than $107 billion. The merged company would have a total debt of $150 billion, making inevitable a campaign of cost-cutting and job reduction. 
The unprecedented degree of monopolization of the telecom and media industries is the outcome of the policy of deregulation, launched in the late 1970s by the Democratic Carter administration and intensified by every administration, Republican or Democratic, since then. In 1982, the original AT&T, colloquially known as “Ma Bell,” was broken up into seven separate and competing regional “Baby Bell” companies. 
This was sold to the public as a means of ending the tightly regulated AT&T monopoly over telephone service and unleashing the “competitive forces” of the market, where increased competition would supposedly lower consumer prices and improve service. What ensued was a protracted process of mergers and disinvestments involving the destruction of hundreds of thousands of jobs, which drove up stock prices at the expense of both employees and the consuming public. 
Dallas-based Southwestern Bell was among the most aggressive of the “Baby Bells” in expanding by means of acquisitions and ruthless cost-cutting, eventually evolving into the new AT&T. Now, the outcome of deregulation has revealed itself to be a degree of monopolization and concentrated economic power beyond anything previously seen.",0
8045,ISIS Is a Paper Tiger,"By Eric Margolis October 28, 2016 
As a former soldier and war correspondent who has covered 14 conflicts, I look at all the media hoopla over tightening siege of Mosul, Iraq and shake my head. This western-organized “liberation” of Mosul is one of the bigger pieces of political-military theater that I’ve seen. 
Islamic State(IS), the defender of Mosul, is a paper tiger, blown out of all proportion by western media. IS is, as this writer has been saying for years, an armed mob made up of 20-something malcontents, religious fanatics, and modern-day anarchists. At its top is a cadre of former Iraqi Army officers with military experience. 
These former officers of Saddam Hussain are bent on revenge for the US destruction of their nation and the lynching of its late leader. But IS rank and file has no military training, little discipline, degraded communications, and ragged logistics. 
In fact, today’s Islamic State is what the Ottoman Empire used to term, ‘bashi-bazouks,” a collection of irregular cut-throats and scum of the gutter sent to punish and terrorize enemies by means of torture, rapine, looting, and arson. 
What has amazed me about the faux western war against ISIS is its leisurely nature, lack of élan, and hesitancy. In my view, ISIS was mostly created by the US and its allies as a weapon to be used against Syria’s government – just as the Afghan mujahadin were used by the US and the Saudis to overthrow the Soviet-backed Afghan government. Israel tried the same tactics by helping create Hamas in Palestine and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Both were cultivated to split the PLO. 
ISIS is an ad hoc movement that wants to punish the West and the Saudis for the gross carnage they have inflicted on the Arab world. 
Western and Kurdish auxiliary forces have been sitting 1.5 hours drive from Mosul and the IS town of Raqqa for over a year. Instead, western – mainly US – warplanes have been gingerly bombing around these targets in what may be an effort to convince breakaway ISIS to rejoin US-led forces fight the Damascus regime. 
Note that ISIS does not appear to have ever attacked Israel though it is playing an important role in the destruction of Syria. Some reports say Israel is providing logistic and medical support for IS. 
The siege of Mosul is being played up by western media as a heroic second Stalingrad. Don’t be fooled. IS has only 3-5,000 lightly armed fighters in Mosul and Raqqa, maybe even less. The leaders of IS are likely long gone. IS has few heavy weapons, no air cover at all, and poor communications. Its rag-tag fighters will run out of ammunitions and explosives very quickly. 
Encircling Mosul are at least 50,000 western-led soldiers, backed by heavy artillery, rocket batteries, tanks, armored vehicles and awesome air power 
The western imperial forces are composed of tough Kurdish peshmerga fighters, Iraqi army and special forces, some Syrian Kurds, Iranian ‘volunteers’ irregular forces and at least 5,000 US combat troops called “advisors”, plus small numbers of French, Canadian and British special forces. Hovering in the background are some thousands of Turkish troops, supported by armor and artillery ready to ‘liberate’ Iraq – which was once part of the Ottoman Empire. 
For the US, current military operations in Syria and Iraq are the realization of an imperialist’s fondest dream: native troops led by white officers, the model of the old British Indian Raj. Washington arms, trained, equips and financed all its native auxiliaries. 
The IS is caught in a dangerous dilemma. To be a political movement, it was delighted to control Iraq’s second largest city. But as a guerilla force, it should not have holed up in an urban area where it was highly vulnerable to concentrated air attack and being surrounded. This is what’s happening right now. 
In the mostly flat Fertile Crescent with too few trees, ground forces are totally vulnerable to air power, as the recent 1967, 1973 Israel-Arab wars and 2003 Iraq wars have shown. Dispersion and guerilla tactics are the only hope for those that lack air cover. 
IS forces would best advise to disperse across the region and continue their hit-and-run attacks. Otherwise, they risk being destroyed. But being mostly bloody-minded young fanatics, IS may not heed military logic and precedent in favor of making a last stand in the ruins of Mosul and Raqqa. 
When this happens, western leaders will compete to claim authorship of the faux crusade against the paper tiger of ISIS. The Best of Eric Margolis Tags:",0

Nation Throws Off Tyrannical Yoke Of Moderate Respect For Women WASHINGTON—Political experts are hailing Donald Trump’s historic presidential victory early Wednesday as a resounding declaration that the nation is finally ready to cast off the tyrannical yoke of moderate respect for women that has suffocated the citizens of this country for generations.

8047,Media Was Silent When Obama Adopted Defense Proposals from Pro-Soviet Think Tank,"TEL AVIV  —   Amid the flurry of reports about the Trump administration and Russia  —   largely innuendo that has yielded no documented connections between the two sides  —   it may be instrumental to review the largely unknown history of how President Obama’s administration adopted defense budget recommendations   by the Institute for Policy Studies, a radical organization known for its close associations with the Soviets during the Cold War. [In fact, throughout the Cold War, the Institute for Policy Studies, or IPS, was repeatedly accused of holding   positions that undermined U. S. national security and serving as a de facto Soviet propaganda institution.  Yet that same group   and contributed to an annual report titled “Unified Security Budget for the United States,” an extensive yearly list of U. S. military defense spending recommendations compiled by progressive think tanks. The report seeks to   the Defense Department to “strengthen our capacity to prevent and resolve conflict by   means,” according to one IPS description of the report. A 2011 report on the IPS’s taskforce for the “Unified Security Budget” reveals how previous Unified reports influenced Obama administration defense proposals: The Unified Security Budget project has contributed to this debate by outlining a set of cuts in unneeded military programs that formed the core of a proposal by the Sustainable Defense Task Force for $1 trillion in cuts over 10 years. A majority, though not a supermajority, of the members of the President’s Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform adopted the annualized figure of $100 billion, and many of the recommendations from this proposal. The IPS’s influence over Obama administration military proposals remains largely unreported except for previous investigations by this reporter. The annual Unified Security Budget was   several times by the Center for American Progress, which was founded by John Podesta, who served as counselor to President Obama and later chairman of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. A sampling of the IPS’s defense spending recommending can be seen in its 2012 “Unified Security Budget” report. That extensive report was previously summarized by this reporter: The 2012 budget, reviewed in full by (this reporter) called on Obama to use the U. S. Armed Forces in part to combat “global warming,” fight global poverty, remedy “injustice,” bolster the United Nations and increase “peacekeeping” forces worldwide. The budget called for massive,   slashes to the military budget. The savings are to be used to invest in “sustainable energy” and in fighting worldwide climate change. The report makes clear the stated objective of transforming the U. S. Armed Forces to stress conflict resolution and diplomacy. The report takes issue with the use of forces on the ground in various countries to secure or influence the   strategic position of other nations. It recommends scaling back all U. S. ground forces by 20 percent and reducing the Navy’s surface fleet by 20 percent, including two carriers and carrier combat air wings. It also calls for reducing the Air Force by two combat air wings while cutting standing peacetime overseas deployments in Europe and East Asia by up to 50, 000 troops at a time. The budget’s authors strongly argue for the reduction of the U. S. nuclear arsenal to no more than 292 deployed nuclear weapons and the complete elimination of the Trident II nuclear missile. It’s a process Obama already initiated in April 2010 when he signed a deal with Russia reducing stocks of   plutonium. The report further recommended the U. S. cease all missile defense development, among other cut backs. Here is more of my previous summary: The report goes through a list of current missile defense programs, including   Midcourse Defense, Airborne Laser, Kinetic Energy Interceptors and a number of others, pushing for all programs to be cut. “It is unwise to fund more advanced systems for missile defense while current ones have yet to be proven effective against their targeted threats,” complains the report. The military’s vital Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation program is to be cut by $10 billion across the board. Next on the chopping block is the complete cancellation of the second   Virginia Class submarine. While the Unified Security Budget describes the new model as “unnecessary to address any of the threats facing the United States today” and “a weapon looking for an enemy,” the   is designed for covert collection of intelligence, transportation of special operations teams and launching of tactical Tomahawk missiles  —   flexible capabilities tailored to rapid responses required by the  ’s conflicts with irregular combatants. Similarly targeted for cancellation are the   Osprey helicopter and the Navy and Marine Corps versions of the   Joint Strike Fighter. A closer look at IPS, which influenced Obama administration policy, is warranted. The organization was founded in 1963 by former government workers Marcus Raskin and Richard Barnet, both of whom were known for their ties to   groups and activism on behalf of communist regimes. Discover the Networks relates that after the group was founded, “IPS headquarters quickly became a resource center for national reporters and a place for KGB agents from the nearby Soviet embassy to convene and strategize. ” Indeed, Ladislav Bittman, a former KGB agent, claimed in his book, The KGB and Soviet Disinformation: An Insider’s View that the IPS worked as a de facto Soviet disinformation operation. Harvey Klehr, professor of politics and history at Emory University, documented the close links between the IPS and Soviet ideology in his 1988 book, Far Left of Center: The American Radical Left Today. During the Cold War, IPS fellows “consistently maintained that the Soviet threat is largely   and a product of the   complex in the United States,” he wrote. Just like their 2009 defense budget recommendations, the IPS during the Cold War pressed for the U. S. to “dangerously” downsize its military, Klehr related. He wrote: This view encouraged the IPS to demand dangerously steep cuts in American defense efforts and to claim that they would represent no danger to American security. At the request of   congressmen, IPS made a study of the federal budget in 1977. In addition to recommendations for a socialist housing program and health system, and altering capitalist control over the educational system, the IPS suggested a fifty percent cut in defense spending, an end to the American role in the Middle East, and withdrawal from NATO. Klehr further documented numerous IPS links to alleged Soviet front groups. IPS signed an agreement in 1982 with the Soviet’s Institute of the USA and Canada, headed by Georgiy Arbatov, for exchanges on peace and disarmament. Since then IPS has sponsored an annual meeting of American experts and Soviet officials. Although portrayed by the Soviets as an “independent”   “think tank,” the Institute of the USA and Canada has been widely identified as an instrument of Soviet foreign policy influence. Located in Moscow, the IUSAC is nominally under the direction of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. In practice, however, it operates under the direction of the International Department of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee. According to the testimony of John McMahon, then deputy director of Central Intelligence (during the House Selected Committee on Intelligence Hearings on Soviet Active Measures in 1982) the International Department “directs Western dialogue activities of Soviet organizations such as the   Institute” with a view toward influencing Western perceptions of peace and disarmament. In his book, Shadow World: Resurgent Russia, The Global New Left, and Radical Islam, author Robert Chandler further documents FBI memos describing the IPS as a   nerve center. The FBI produced thousands of documents on IPS’s activities. Some are available to the public through the Freedom of Information Act. The FBI withheld hundreds of documents. The documents collected by the FBI described IPS as a   “Think Factory,” which “helped train extremists who incite violence in the United States and whose educational research serves as a cover for intrigue and political agitation” (FBI file  ) or “the Rand Corporation of the Left,” and “IPS apparently exercises considerable influence in the New Left Movement and may have as its goal the destruction of the United States Government. ” In this context, the mainstream media described the IPS in the 1970s and 1980s as follows: Wall Street Journal  —   “A funnel for disinformation,” Forbes  —   “A radical Washington propaganda mill,” National Review  —   “The perfect intellectual front for Soviet activities which would be resisted if they were to originate openly from the KGB. ” This reporter previously documented the Cold     activities of the IPS. The IPS has been implicated in   activity. The Center for Security Studies was a 1974 IPS   and strove to compromise the effectiveness of U. S. intelligence agencies, according to Discover the Networks. The mastheads of two   and   publications, Counterspy and the Covert Action Information Bulletin, were heavy with IPS members. Further, the group’s former director, Robert Borosage, penned a book shortly out of college attacking the CIA and ran the   CIA watchdog, Center for National Security Studies. The group has been particularly concerned with researching U. S. defense industries and arms sales policies.  Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

8048,Regular Milk May Beat Low Fat for Kids - The New York Times,"  milk may not be the best option for kids, though many experts recommend it to fight obesity for children over 2. Canadian researchers collected height and weight data on 2, 745 healthy children ages 1 to 6 years. They took blood samples, and their parents reported how much skim, 1 percent, 2 percent and whole milk the children drank. After controlling for age, sex, outdoor play and other factors that affect both vitamin D levels and weight, they found that children who drank one cup of whole milk per day had a vitamin D level comparable to that of children who drank 2. 9 cups of 1 percent milk, but their body mass index was lower by 0. 79 points. The higher the fat content of the milk they drank, the lower the children’s B. M. I. and the higher their vitamin D levels. The study is in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. Why this happens is unknown, but the senior author, Dr. Jonathon L. Maguire, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Toronto, suggested that vitamin D is better absorbed with fat, and drinking   milk may leave a child hungrier for more   food. “These two things together may make it a double whammy for   milk,” he said. “But this is a small piece of the puzzle. We really need to do the research to answer these very basic questions. ”",0
8049,NEO – RT’s Bank Accounts Closed – It’s Nothing to Do With Syria,"By Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor on October 28, 2016 Russian money by Seth Ferris , …with New Eastern Outlook , Moscow Battle of Trafalgar [ Editor’s note : What on earth are the English doing, and why should anybody care? Well, we must and do care, because on English soil stands one leg of the NWO Triad. I recall reading that it was at the Battle of Trafalgar when twenty-seven British ships led by Admiral Nelson, defeated thirty-three French and Spanish ships, capturing 22 Franco-Spanish vessels without losing a single British ship. This decisive naval battle of the war stopped French plans for invading England and graphically illustrated English resolve. One of VT’s standard bearers of analytical thinking, Seth Ferris presents a lucid explanation of what went on this month when His Holiness Kirill, Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia, visited Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace. Parts of Europe, particularly Rome, must have been keenly interested. As Seth Ferris notes, Patriarch Kirill is far from being an apologist for Russian politics, but it is his church’s potential to destabilize the state, given “the potential willingness of members of the officially Anglican Royal Family to embrace” the Orthodox Church, that comes under scrutiny. And to further translate this into an American dialect, Queen Elizabeth II is currently the “Supreme Governor of the Church of England and her role is largely ceremonial.” Yet, the Queen occupies a special pulpit in the fabric of English life, and the preferences of the Queen’s family subtly influence English hearts and minds. It is the similarities between the Church of England and the Orthodox Church that has the NWO and Rome on high alert, rather than the differences, because if the NWO is to seat a One-World One-Religion Ruler, such as the Bishop of Rome, then it will need to firmly discourage any alternatives. And, under the Orthodox Church, the Bishop of Rome’s authority is no greater or less than any of his fellow Bishops in the church, so he does not have primacy in the Orthodox Church. And, before the pope could have jurisdiction within Orthodoxy, the papacy would need to be reformed in accordance with Orthodoxy. One of the stumbling blocks is that, in the Orthodox Church, papal infallibility is rejected because it is believed that the Holy Spirit acts to guide the church into truth — for instance, via ecumenical councils. Without further ado, VT presents another fine article by Seth Ferris. You will find his exceptional analysis only on VT and New Eastern Outlook … Jim W. Dean and Erica P. Wissinger ] – First published … October 26, 2016 – 
As the world now knows, British bank NatWest, part of the Royal Bank of Scotland group, has told Russian media outlet RT that it should take its business elsewhere. 
Initially it was reported that the bank had “frozen” RT’s accounts, meaning it had impounded the money, but it now says that the accounts have merely been closed, meaning that RT can withdraw its money – provided it then takes it to another bank. 
NatWest, and the rest of the Royal Bank of Scotland group, are effectively owned by the British government, which acquired the majority share in 2008 to prevent it collapsing. As RT is also state-owned, it has been inferred that this is another form of sanction. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson denies this, but he also denies several of his children, several parts of his ancestry and practically everything else he has ever written or been recorded saying. 
It has also been suggested that this move, which came without warning, was connected with potential fines against the bank for holding money considered “dirty” by association with Russia – though the government fining itself to pay itself seems unlikely. It may therefore be simply a publicity stunt – the UK has to be seen to be acting against Russia as part of the sanctions regime, and may be perfectly happy for RT to take its business to a private UK bank, or even another publicly-owned one, having done its bit of public posturing. However the real reason for this move is not sanctions against the Russian state. It is because a seemingly unimportant event has the potential to shake the foundations of the United Kingdom – and those in the corridors of power have just woken up to it. 
The closing of RT’s accounts, if it finally happens, may simply be a symbolic gesture, but it may be the precursor to a more serious crisis, which no one thought they would ever see again. The subtext beneath the subtext The Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia, Kirill, holds a service in London’s Cathedral of the Dormition of the Mother of God and All Saints in a visit to London, marking the 300th anniversary of the Russian Orthodox Church’s presence there. ( © Sergey Pyatakov) 
From October 15-18 Kyril, Patriarch of Moscow , visited the United Kingdom. There is a growing Orthodox diaspora in the UK, as there is in all Western countries, and also a small but well-established British-born Orthodox community and a number of majority British, English-language parishes. 
However, Orthodoxy is still a very small religion there – though figures are hard to come by, no more than 7% of the population would currently identify themselves as Orthodox, despite the large Greek Cypriot community which owns the plurality of the UK’s Orthodox churches. 
The Church of England adheres to a doctrine called Branch Theory – the idea that various different Christian “denominations”, as they call them, are branches of the same basic church. Consequently religious leaders in general are treated with respect, even if people greatly disagree with their faith. 
When Pope John Paul II visited the UK in 1982 he was treated as a pop star, despite a few insignificant protests by Protestant or far-right groups. No particular fuss is made when leaders of other faiths enter the country from abroad, despite the hysteria surrounding so-called “Muslim hate preachers” who are no more radical than the Bible-bashers who have the greatest objection to them. 
But how was Patriarch Kyril treated? With respect by those who met him – but not by the media or the political class. 
When Archbishop Makarios, who had been a politician in public office contrary to the Canons of the Church, visited the UK in the 1970s, he was shown entering churches and attracting crowds who cheered him so hard they damaged the buildings. Patriarch Kyril was presented as an apologist for Vladimir Putin and Russia’s alleged actions in Syria, who had been sent on a propaganda mission. Queen Elizabeth II has held an historic meeting with Kirill, the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia, during his official visit to the UK to mark the 300th anniversary of the Russian Orthodox Church’s presence there. The meeting was held behind closed doors in Buckingham Palace, and lasted for about a half-hour, according to the Patriarch’s secretary 
The Patriarch was not in the UK to talk politics , and there is no suggestion that he actually did so. The focus of his visit was to finally consecrate the Russian cathedral at Ennismore Gardens, London, a former Anglican church which the Russian church has been using since the 1950s. 
But the thing which most upset certain commentators was the fact that he was due to have an audience with the Queen, as visiting dignitaries usually do. 
The implication of the widespread concern about the Queen agreeing to this private meeting was that she was sympathetic to Russia’s position on Syria. The UK has a constitutional monarchy, and consequently the Queen does not dictate government policy. 
If the Queen has a personal position on anything she will only make it public if she feels her government is making a serious error and will not listen to reason – which has happened only once during her 64-year reign, when she famously let it be known that she felt Margaret Thatcher’s policies were damaging the social fabric of the country. 
So why should the press and politicians be so outraged about the possibility of Patriarch Kyril giving the Queen opinions she can read on the internet, or in some of the hundreds of letters she receives daily from disgruntled citizens? 
It is because they are trying to disguise the real reason for their fear. It has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with the Orthodox Church, which happens to be the majority religion in Russia. No one minds ordinary citizens taking an interest in Orthodoxy. But the Royal Family? That’s a different question entirely. The invisible heart of the state The politically entrenched Church of England ~ Salisbury Cathedral 
The Queen is not only a monarch but the head of the Church of England. Though it seems anomalous to others that a church is run by a secular ruler, who could not even be ordained a bishop in that church if she wanted to, this is the way it has been since Henry VIII broke with Rome in 1534 so he could get a divorce. 
The state that became the UK was built on the Anglican faith and the political assumptions that went with that, despite the non-Anglican majorities in Scotland, Wales and Ireland. For three hundred and fifty years the “Catholic Powers” were seen as national enemies in the same way the “Iron Curtain” countries were in the second half of the twentieth century. Consequently each member of the Royal Family is also obliged to uphold the primacy of the Church of England, whether they are religious or not. From time to time, this has created problems. The Abdication Crisis of 1936 was caused by the King of England wanting to marry a twice-divorced woman, which the church considered a no-no at the time. 
Similarly, Tony Blair only announced his conversion to Roman Catholicism after he had resigned as Prime Minister, because the PM is included in the line of succession to the throne, and could be an atheist but not a Papist in that role. 
The question of whether the Church of England accepts divorce and remarriage – which is not at all clear cut – has reared its head several times in recent years due to the marital problems of the Royal Family. Prince Charles and Princess Anne have divorced and remarried, each time conducting their second marriages outside the Church of England. If Charles does eventually succeed to the throne, the question of whether he can be head of the Church of England whilst divorced and remarried outside it will come back to the forefront. Above the altar – Orthodox church 
In 1977, a story went round the press that Charles was about to marry Princess Marie Astrid of Luxembourg. According to sources close to the action a marriage had actually been arranged behind the scenes, but did not proceed because the princess refused to give up her Roman Catholic faith, as she would be obliged to do to marry the future king under the Act of Succession of 1701. 
However Buckingham Palace responded to the reports by saying that Charles didn’t even know the princess, a ridiculous assertion, as all Europe’s royals are related and attend functions where they meet each other. This demonstrates how deep the fear of rocking the constitutional boat by not supporting the C of E runs. Putin and Patriarch Kirill exhibition 
The Queen’s husband, Prince Philip , was born and baptised Orthodox, as a Prince of Greece. He renounced his Faith to marry Princess Elizabeth, as she then was, and regularly attends Anglican services with the rest of the family. 
However it is an open secret that he has returned to Orthodoxy privately. He is known to make very generous donations to Orthodox churches and causes and is a patron of the Institute for Orthodox Christian Studies in Cambridge. 
Prince Charles also has a longstanding interest in Orthodoxy: amongst other expressions of it, he has refused to join the Freemasons, despite this being expected of members of the British upper class. 
When the Queen met the Pope on his 1982 visit, it caused some comment, but nothing like the controversy provoked by her meeting Patriarch Kyril. 
If the UK ever started to support Putin’s position on anything, it would not be the end of civilization as we know it. 
If the heir to the throne converted to his father’s ancestral faith, and the link between the state and the Church of England was forcibly broken, it would call the whole political basis of the UK into question. That is a can of worms no one dares open – for which RT is now being made the scapegoat, because no one is prepared to publicly discuss just how big a question this seemingly abstruse point really is. Foreign is the new cancer Are Russian and Syrian air power crushing the NATO-supported rebel attacks? 
British banks are entitled to freeze accounts under certain circumstances. If an account contains the proceeds of crime, these can now be impounded by the courts. Similarly it is a criminal offence in the UK, under the Terrorism Act 2000, to provide financial or any other support to terrorists, regardless of what the UK government itself does. 
Banks are terrified of this law, and interpret it with a strictness which is itself illegal. There have been many instances of ethnic minority community organisations being unable to open bank accounts unless they sack their officers and appoint British people, on the grounds that simply by being run by foreigners they might be laundering money for terrorists. 
If there is any hint of impropriety about an organisation run by a foreign state, they will naturally review that information to protect themselves. But it is usually the courts who impound the proceeds of crime. The arbitrary closure of RT’s accounts, without explanation, therefore implies that it is being accused of sponsoring terrorism. 
Theresa May’s response that “it is for them [the bank] to decide who they offer services to based on their own risk appetite” suggests that this is exactly what the government wants to accuse it of. Who said anything about risk being the reason, and how does the government know about the decisions the bank makes on individual accounts and the reasons for them? So the assumption that this is about Syria suits the narrative we have heard to date. But if so, why now? Has the bank only just become nervous of being fined by its own owners? Is it only now aware of the sanctions regime, or the British government’s position on this conflict? 
The Church of England, the pillar on which the British state was built, has long had ostensibly good relations with the Orthodox communities in the UK. Many Orthodox parishes worship in former or still-functioning Anglican churches, and successive Archbishops of Canterbury have expressed their respect for Orthodoxy. Until, that is, the Church stops being a weird foreign sect. Then it becomes a threat which has to be dealt with, and always is. Methodios Fouyias 
In 1988, the head of the Greek Orthodox Church in the UK, Archbishop Methodios, was deposed for “coveting other thrones”, whatever that may mean. It was widely believed that the real reason was because the Church of England objected to him receiving a number of its priests and many ordinary parishioners. 
He was replaced by Archbishop Gregorios, who began by stating publicly many times that he did not encourage people to convert to the Church he served. 
A student in Greece wrote a thesis about the deposition of Archbishop Methodios, which the university not only refused to publish but used as an excuse to kick him out of university. The website of the Greek Archdiocese in the UK makes no mention of why Methodios ceased to be bishop, or what he did subsequently, despite the fact he lived another eighteen years as a titular bishop. 
Now the head of another Orthodox national jurisdiction has visited the UK and been vilified in a way unprecendented for a religious leader since Catholics were allowed back into the country. Rather than being met with protests from angry Britishers, he was received with the traditional courtesy of religious leaders. 
His potential to destabilise the state does not derive from his connections but from the potential willingness of members of the officially Anglican Royal Family to embrace his Faith. So that Faith must be presented as politically dangerous, its hierarchs as political stooges, to scare people, and their Royal Family, away from it. 
RT has been inundated with messages of support from UK citizens. Most of these assume that the bank’s decision is politically motivated. 
Indeed it is – but it is the identity of the UK and its institutions, rather than whether you think Assad is a terrorist, which is the political issue driving it.

8050,"‘Making It on My Own,’ With Mary Tyler Moore as a Guide - The New York Times","Can I finally admit that my role model was a sitcom character? Mary Richards  —   played to perfection by the beloved Mary Tyler Moore  —   was more than a role model, she was a template. Even in fashion and home décor  —   my choices mimicked hers. Mary Tyler Moore had shown up just when everything about women’s lives was about to change. Her show debuted in 1970, when I was 19, still in college and not imagining a career in television  —   or a career in anything. But two years after Mary first joyfully threw her tam hat up in the air and joined   in Minneapolis, I began my television career in a city also ending in ’apolis. That part is coincidental, of course  —   but my home? Mary lived in a studio apartment with a pullout sofa bed, and not coincidentally so did I. And if my apartment was not quite so charming, it wasn’t for lack of copying. I didn’t yet have a style of my own, so whenever possible I borrowed Mary’s. A few years later, when to outward appearances, I was making it on my own, I was on the cover of Chicago Tribune magazine holding a   find  —   a large gold number “5”  —   for Channel 5, my new broadcast home. But in truth, the inspiration was Mary. She had a big   “M. ” It was affixed to the wall, part of the furniture, just like her highboy chest of drawers. I also had one of those. In Chicago, I moved up into a   condo in a high rise. Mary had also moved out of her studio and into a condo where she gives herself a housewarming. Her parties  —   this was a running gag  —   were always dull. Sitting alone on the floor after her last guest has left, she surveys her modern new home and says, “I HATE IT. ” I loved her for that. The ’70s were my formative years, and when my career got way out ahead of me, I still had Mary to fill in some gaps. We viewers were never given a peek inside her   closet, but Mary would walk out of it in one cute outfit after another usually a smart knit. I gravitated in that direction, too  —   if not with the same effect. For my farewell show in Chicago, on the eve of my debut on the “Today” show, I chose a knit ensemble in alternating wide stripes of brown, orange and white  —   possibly inspired by the colorations of a clown fish. I was thinking of Mary. Not long after, Tom Brokaw looked at me across the anchor desk one morning and said, “Burn the dress. ” Not Mary’s fault. I’m sometimes described as a “pioneer” in broadcast journalism  —   which is preposterous. The chair I settled into in 1976 had been recently vacated by the real thing, Barbara Walters. Barbara was indisputably the   woman in television news at that time, but she was not the best known or most beloved. That distinction belonged to “Mary. ” “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” started several years before two words, “and women,” were inserted into an F. C. C. affirmative action clause pertaining to television station hiring. That might have helped women like me get a job, but Mary Richards may already have opened as many doors she had made a woman in the newsroom seem normal. Mary was ahead of her time, but not too far. She was not superwoman she was someone you could be. She was someone you wanted to be. Mary was plucky, but not driven. When starting a new life in Minneapolis, she was just looking for a job, not a career. And though uncommonly beautiful, Mary made it O. K. to be dateless on a Saturday night  —   which I often was. (I wasn’t alone. On Saturday nights, as Oprah recalled, she would put the conditioner in her hair during “The Bob Newhart Show” and rinse it out before “Mary. ”) Mary Tyler Moore, was “our Mary. ” She was the right woman at the right time. And I loved her for it.",0
8051,49ers Fans Care More About Victories Than Kaepernick,"49ers Fans Care More About Victories Than Kaepernick Elliott Almond, Mercury News, October 24, 2016 
Colin Kaepernick’s first home start in a year didn’t stop the pessimism that has left red-jerseyed 49ers’ patrons in a football funk. 
Thousands of empty red seats at Levi’s Stadium underscored San Francisco’s freefall that continued unabated Sunday in a 34-17 defeat to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
Few were thinking about Kaepernick’s season-long activism in which he again kneeled during the national anthem to protest oppression against minorities. These days, fans just want to see their team win a game after six consecutive defeats. 
{snip} 
After leading the 49ers to a promising 14-0 first-quarter lead, Kaepernick and the offense sputtered. He completed just 16 of 34 passes for 134 yards with one touchdown and one interception. 
Kaepernick’s scrambling–he led the team with 84 rushing yards on nine carries–and occasional flashes of accurate downfield passing, weren’t enough, even with the 49ers firmly in the game midway through the fourth quarter. 
{snip} 
Kaepernick donned a T-shirt Sunday paying tribute to the Black Panther Party, an Oakland activist group that celebrated its 50th anniversary this weekend. The quarterback said the shirt was a gift from his girlfriend, MTV host Nessa Diab. 
Last week, he wore a shirt with Muhammad Ali’s face before the game at Buffalo. 
Kaepernick’s protest against police shootings of unarmed African Americans has been divisive because some say it is disrespectful to veterans. A recent survey by Yahoo Sports and YouGov found that a decline in NFL ratings partially is attributed to the quarterback’s action. 
“I don’t know much about ratings and how they are affected,” he said in a postgame interview. “But I don’t understand why ratings would go down fighting for justice for people, to try to stop oppression, especially in the league that is predominately black.”

8053,"Blame government, not markets for monopoly","Blame government, not markets for monopoly Corporate mergers and “hostile” takeovers can promote economic efficiency By Ron Paul - November 1, 2016 
When Time-Warner announced it planned to merge with another major communications firm, many feared the new company would exercise near-total monopoly power. These concerns led some to call for government action to block the merger in order to protect both Time-Warner’s competitors and consumers. 
No, I am not talking about Time-Warner’s recent announced plan to merge with AT&T, but the reaction to Time-Warner’s merger with (then) Internet giant AOL in 2000. Far from creating an untouchable leviathan crushing all competitors, the AOL-Time-Warner merger fell apart in under a decade. 
The failure of AOL-Time-Warner demonstrates that even the biggest companies are vulnerable to competition if there is open entry into the marketplace. AOL-Time-Warner failed because consumers left them for competitors offering lower prices and/or better quality. 
Corporate mergers and “hostile” takeovers can promote economic efficiency by removing inefficient management and boards of directors. These managers and board members often work together to promote their own interests instead of generating maximum returns for investors by providing consumers with affordable, quality products. Thus, laws making it difficult to launch a “hostile” takeover promote inefficient use of resources and harm investors, workers, and consumers. 
Monopolies and cartels are creations of government, not markets. For example, the reason the media is dominated by a few large companies is that no one can operate a television or radio station unless they obtain federal approval and pay federal licensing fees. Similarly, anyone wishing to operate a cable company must not only comply with federal regulations, they must sign a “franchise” agreement with their local government. Fortunately, the Internet has given Americans greater access to news and ideas shut out by the government-licensed lapdogs of the “mainstream” media. This may be why so many politicians are anxious to regulate the web. 
Government taxes and regulations are effective means of limiting competition in an industry. Large companies can afford the costs of complying with government regulations, costs which cripple their smaller competitors. Big business can also afford to hire lobbyists to ensure that new laws and regulations favor big business. 
Examples of regulations that benefit large corporations include the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) regulations that raise costs of developing a new drug, as well as limit consumers ability to learn about natural alternatives to pharmaceuticals. Another example is the Dodd-Frank legislation, which has strengthened large financial intuitions while harming their weaker competitors. 
Legislation forcing consumers to pay out-of-state sales tax on their online purchases is a classic case of business seeking to use government to harm less politically-powerful competitors. This legislation is being pushed by large brick-and-mortar stores and Internet retailers who are seeking a government-granted advantage over smaller competitors. 
Many failed mergers and acquisitions result from the distorted signals sent to business and investors by the Federal Reserve’s inflationary monetary policy. Perhaps the most famous example of this is the AOL-Time-Warner fiasco, which was a direct result of the Fed-created dot.com bubble. 
In a free market, mergers between businesses enable consumers to benefit from new products and reduced prices. Any businesses that charge high prices or offer substandard products will soon face competition from businesses offering consumers lower prices and/or higher quality. Monopolies only exist when government tilts the playing field in favor of well-connected crony capitalists. Therefore those concerned about excessive corporate power should join supporters of the free market in repudiating the regulations, taxes, and subsides that benefit politically-powerful businesses. The most important step is to end the boom-bust business cycle by ending the Federal Reserve.",0

Via Breitbart : 
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was rushed offstage at a Reno, Nevada campaign rally as a protester in the audience was involved in an extended incident near the stage. 
It was not immediately clear what was occurring in the crowd, but several members of what appeared to be law enforcement or U.S. Secret Service jumped down into the area where the protester was, as could be seen on Right Side Broadcasting Network’s video livestream of the event. 
Video of Trump being rushed off stage was posted online: 
In the video it appears Trump pauses to look out into the crowd for the event disrupter. Two U.S. Secret Service agents can be seen rushing in to remove Trump from the stage and two other agents also facilitate his removal. 
During his absence someone announced to the crowd that Trump would return. The protester was eventually seen being removed from the crowd, although there appeared to be a struggle with several law enforcement or Secret Service agents to secure the protester’s removal. It was several minutes before Trump was able to take the stage again. 
As Trump returned to the stage, he thanked the crowd, which cheered him back. 
“Nobody said it was going to be easy for us, but we will never be stopped, never ever be stopped,” said Trump. Here is the man in question, in handcuffs, being searched by officers after he was escorted out of the rally area. pic.twitter.com/pjoMCtM39K",0

[On April 13 Breitbart News reported that Pompey brought his handgun into New Jersey while visiting from Virginia. Following an altercation at a nightclub, one of Pompey’s friends retrieved the gun and was arrested. Pompey was also arrested because the gun was not registered in the state of New Jersey.  ABC 7 reported that Pompey did “three tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan for which he received medals for bravery. ” He was a military police sergeant who now has a wife and young children at home. Until Christie intervened on Friday, Pompey was preparing to surrender to authorities for what would have been a minimum   sentence for possession of an unregistered firearm. When news of the commuted sentence reached Pompey, he responded by making sure it was not a joke. Pompey said, “Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, this isn’t April Fools, right? I don’t know how to react. I’m grateful, grateful. ” Pompey’s wife said, “I just said, from the bottom of my heart, thank you. It’s like you’ve given us our life back. ” Christie’s decision to commute Pompey’s sentence does not expunge the arrest from his record, it simply removes the punishment that resulted from the arrest. In April 2015, Christie pardoned Pennsylvania mother Shaneen Allen, who was arrested in October 2013 for carrying a legally owned handgun in her car. Allen had a Pennsylvania permit to carry, but New Jersey does not recognize Pennsylvania’s permit. And on December 23, 2015, Christie pardoned U. S. Marine Joshua Velez, a Massachusetts concealed carry permit holder who was arrested over a year earlier for bringing his 9mm handgun into the state of New Jersey.

8056,Hope Solo Takes Aim at Sweden After U.S. Women Are Ousted - The New York Times,"RIO DE JANEIRO  —   Hope Solo stood in front of the American net on Friday afternoon, desperately needing to block a shot. She had been the target of derision from Brazilian fans from the moment the Olympics tournament began, and now she needed to rescue her teammates, who had quickly fallen behind in a penalty shootout against Sweden in a quarterfinals match in Brasília. And Solo did step up. Guessing correctly on Sweden’s third shot, she leapt to her right to swat away the ball. Now the Americans were even. Moments later, Solo nearly blocked another shot, which would have put the United States ahead. But when that ball just eluded her outstretched left hand, it became one of the last bits of agony in a disastrous afternoon for the Americans. Christen Press missed the next shot for the United States, Lisa Dahlkvist converted for Sweden and, just like that, the United States was out of an Olympics tournament it had captured the last three times it was staged. It was a stunning ending for the American women, who only a year ago had captured the World Cup to great acclaim and then been honored with a   parade in Manhattan. On Friday, they dominated play against a team no one thought was their match, and yet, after 90 minutes of regulation and 30 minutes of overtime, all they could show for their efforts was a   tie. Then came the shootout, and the Americans were done. Or just beginning, depending on who was doing the talking after the game. Solo, whose flippant Twitter posts last month about the Zika virus had led to the jeers she encountered here, had trouble containing herself when she spoke to reporters. After praising her teammates for tying the game in the 75th minute, saying it ”showed a lot of heart,’’ she ripped into the Swedes, saying they had played like “a bunch of cowards. ’’ “The best team did not win today,’’ she added. “I strongly and firmly believe that. ’’ Solo’s gripe was that Sweden, under the guidance of Pia Sundhage, had sat back for much of the game, content to let the Americans push the action. But Sundhage had good reason to take that approach. She had coached the American team through the 2012 Olympics, knew that it was faster and generally more talented than her group and that it would be best for her players to defend, be patient and look for a chance to counterattack. That opportunity came in the 61st minute when a clever series of passes created a breakaway for Sweden’s Stina Blackstenius, who drove the ball past Solo and into the right corner of the net for a   lead. With the pressure now building on the Americans, Coach Jill Ellis summoned Megan Rapinoe, the astute playmaker, who had sat out for eight months after ripping up her knee before finally playing 30 minutes on Monday against Colombia. But Rapinoe could contribute little. And when the United States finally did tie the score, it was with a bit of luck, with a pass from Tobin Heath striking a Swedish defender in the face and bouncing right toward Alex Morgan, who quickly drilled it home. Then came overtime, and in the 115th minute Carli Lloyd, so often the American hero in recent years, headed the ball past Swedish goalie Hedvig Lindahl for what looked to be the  . Offside, said the referees. A minute later, Lotta Schelin scored for Sweden. Offside was the ruling again. Neither ruling may have been correct, but they had the effect of canceling each other out. The shootout quickly followed. Morgan, going first for the United States, had her shot blocked. Lindsey Horan, Lloyd and Morgan Brian all beat Lindahl, but Press faltered, floating the ball over the net. Which left Solo to figure out a way to block one more shot, and keep the shootout going. A year ago, in the World Cup semifinal against Germany, Solo had stalled before a penalty kick, hoping to unsettle the German player who was taking the shot. When the shot was eventually taken, it went wide, and the Americans went on to win.’ ”Now Solo tried to stall again. She fiddled with her gloves and then changed them. She took her time, making Dahlkvist wait. But as with everything else with the American team, what seemed to work in 2015 didn’t on Friday. Dahlkvist beat Solo easily and it was over.” ’“I’m incredibly disappointed,” Ellis said. “I told the players that there is no way to remove the pain they are feeling, but that there will always be a next game. ” Which left Sundhage to offer her thoughts. So many key Americans  —   Solo, Lloyd, Morgan, Rapinoe  —   had prospered under her. Solo had been her goalie in previous shootouts with everything on the line. They had celebrated and suffered together, though Sundhage had told The New York Times in 2015 that Solo was one of the most challenging players to coach because of her tendency to create trouble for herself off the field. Now, a year later, Solo was essentially accusing her old coach of cowardice. The unflappable Sundhage took it in stride. “It’s O. K. to be a coward if you win,’’ she said. “They played more attacking football than we did. We defended very well. ’’ And when the game finally went to a shootout, she added, she looked at her players and was confident they would prevail. “I’m so happy,’’ she said, words that will linger as the Americans go home.",0

8058,Минобороны РФ: Видеокадры последствий удара по школе в Идлибе - монтаж,"0 комментариев 0 поделились Фото: AP 
Видеокадры, которыми подкрепляется эта информация, представляют собой видеомонтаж, склеенный из 10 разных видеоотрезков, снятых, к тому же, в разное время суток и с разным разрешением. Об этом заявил официальный представитель Минобороны генерал-майор Игорь Конашенков. 
По данным ведомства, для проверки информации ЮНИСЕФ российское военное ведомство тщательно проанализировало данные всех средств объективного контроля воздушной обстановки северной части Сирии. 
""Мы проанализировали фото и видеокадры якобы ""свидетельств"" разрушения школы. Опубликованные в ряде зарубежных СМИ видеокадры якобы нанесения удара по н. п. Хасс являются склейкой более 10 смонтированных отрезков, снятых с различным разрешением в разное время суток... В среду 26 октября ни один самолет ВКС России в данный район не заходил"", - сказал Конашенков. 
На опубликованной зарубежными СМИ фотографии видно, что повреждена только одна торцевая стена здания, причем все парты в классе стоят на своих местах, отметил он, а через пролом в стене отчетливо видно совершенно целое, без следов осколочных повреждений, ограждение розоватого цвета напротив, что невозможно при взрыве авиационного боеприпаса. 
""Ограда и все стены здания в этом случае должны были быть разрушены и посечены осколками, а мебель сметена ударной волной"", - пояснил Конашенков. 
Для подтверждения этой информации в четверг утром в район Хасса был направлен российский беспилотник. Аэрофотосъемка ВКС РФ, проведенная в районе якобы авиаудара по школе, установила отсутствие характерных повреждений для воздушных бомбардировок. 
""Как видно на фотографии с российского БПЛА, никаких повреждений крыши школы или воронок от взрыва авиабомб в прилегающем к школе районе нет... Кстати, аналогичные сведения могут быть запрошены у наших американских коллег"", - отметил представитель Минобороны. 
В это время в данном районе российскими средствами контроля воздушного пространства сопровождался американский разведывательно-ударный БПЛА MQ-1B Predator, отметил Конашенков. 
Напомним, как сообщала Правда.Ру, 26 октября в сирийской провинции Идлиб в результате авиаудара, который был нанесен по школе, погибли 22 ребенка и 6 учителей. 
«Это трагедия. Если это было сделано намеренно, то это - военное преступление»,- приводит AFP слова директора ЮНИСЕФ Энтони Лейка. До этого правозащитники сообщали, что «военные самолеты или российские, или сирийские нанесли шесть ударов» по деревне Хасс Лэйк отметил, что произошедшее является трагедией или военным преступлением. 
Официальный представитель МИД РФ Мария Захарова, заявила, что Россия не имеет никакого отношения к атаке на школу в сирийском Идлибе, и все международные институты должны срочно подключиться к расследованию этой трагедии. 
Чем ближе взятие Алеппо, тем яростнее будут обвинения в адрес России , считает сотрудник Центра анализа стратегий и технологий Максим Шеповаленко. Информационные вбросы, подобные истории об российском ударе по школе в провинции Идлиб , будут продолжаться до конца войны. ""Все пошло враздрай: никаких мирных переговоров, вступил в силу План Б - по вооружению боевиков. Значит, информационная война в самом разгаре"" - сказал аналитик в беседе с Pravda.Ru

8060,J.P. Morgan Chase Pulls Ads from NBC News over Megyn Kelly Interview with Alex Jones,"J. P. Morgan Chase has removed its television and digital ads from NBC News following controversy sparked by anchor Megyn Kelly’s upcoming interview with InfoWars founder and radio host Alex Jones, according to a report. [The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that the bank has requested the network remove all of its advertising from Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly and from other news programs ahead of the anchor’s scheduled Father’s Day interview.  Kelly  —   who left Fox News earlier this year to lead two news programs at NBC, including Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly  —   shared a preview of her interview with Jones on her Twitter account Sunday. In the clip, Jones takes exception to being called “the most paranoid man in the world” and reiterates his position that   was an “inside job. ” Next Sunday, I sit down with conservative radio host @RealAlexJones to discuss controversies and conspiracies #SundayNight June 18 on NBC pic. twitter.   —   Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) June 11, 2017,  As Breitbart News previously reported, the preview clip stirred outrage on social media, including from relatives of victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary massacre. Jones has previously said he believes the Sandy Hook attack was a hoax. Twitter users called for a boycott of NBC News’ advertisers and urged others to tune out the interview when it airs June 18. Kristin Lemkau, chief marketing officer for J. P. Morgan Chase, tweeted Monday that she was “repulsed” that NBC News would give Jones a platform on its network. As an advertiser, I’m repulsed that @megynkelly would give a second of airtime to someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes. Why? https:  .   —   Kristin Lemkau (@KLemkau) June 12, 2017,  According to the Journal‘s report, the bank could reinstate its advertising after the interview airs June 18. The company reportedly does not want its ads appearing next to promotional material for the interview. Kelly defended her   with Jones in a tweet Sunday, saying President Donald Trump’s appearance on Jones’ show during the presidential campaign made the media figure newsworthy: “Many don’t know him our job is 2 shine a light,” she tweeted. Sunday’s episode of Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly will be the third broadcast of the new magazine show. Kelly kicked off her program earlier this month with a highly contentious interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The anchor is expected to begin hosting a 9 a. m. news show under NBC’s Today banner in September.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum",0
8061,Ex-Cuomo Aides Charged in Federal Corruption Inquiry - The New York Times,"Federal corruption charges were announced on Thursday against two former close aides to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a senior state official and six other people, in a blow to the governor’s innermost circle and a repudiation of the way his prized upstate economic development programs were managed. The charges against the former aides, Joseph Percoco and Todd R. Howe, and the state official, Alain Kaloyeros, were the culmination of a   federal investigation into the Cuomo administration’s efforts to lure jobs and businesses to upstate New York’s limping economy by furnishing billions of dollars in state funds to developers from Buffalo to Albany. In doing so, says a   criminal complaint unsealed on Thursday, Mr. Percoco and Mr. Howe sought to enrich themselves through bribes, using their positions to help particular companies receive “hundreds of millions of dollars in state contracts and other official state benefits. ” The charges mark the second major inquiry of the Cuomo administration by the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan eight months ago, after investigating Mr. Cuomo’s handling of an anticorruption panel that he had created and abruptly shut down, Mr. Bharara said there was “insufficient evidence to prove a federal crime. ” At a news conference at which he announced the charges, Mr. Bharara was asked if he would essentially give Mr. Cuomo a “clean bill of health” again. “There are no allegations of any wrongdoing or misconduct by the governor, anywhere in this complaint,” Mr. Bharara replied. “That’s all I’m going to say. ” If the charges did not hit Mr. Cuomo directly, they did hit him in a peripheral and personal manner: Mr. Percoco and Mr. Howe were both loyalists of Mr. Cuomo and his father, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, for whom they had also worked. Andrew Cuomo once referred to Mr. Percoco as “my father’s third son, who I sometimes think he loved the most. ” Mr. Cuomo had also spoken highly of Dr. Kaloyeros, depicting him as a visionary in the field of nanotechnology, which Mr. Cuomo has heralded as a potential boon for the state economy. Mr. Bharara’s office and F. B. I. agents in Buffalo had been examining whether state officials awarded lucrative projects to a few favored developers who had donated to the political campaigns of Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat. One major area of interest was the administration’s plan to inject $1 billion in state funds into   factories, research facilities and other projects, known together as the Buffalo Billion. The resulting investigation yielded a rich narrative of three trusted counselors to Mr. Cuomo conspiring to help the favored contractors, rigging bids and doling out other favorable treatment. The complaint also portrayed the defendants as trying to conceal the schemes, sometimes in unusual ways. In emails and other correspondence, Mr. Percoco and Mr. Howe referred to bribe money as “ziti,” a term used in “The Sopranos,” the complaint says. Mr. Percoco, Mr. Howe and others also called one another “Herb” as a term of endearment, while discussing the arrangement. Mr. Bharara said at a news conference on Thursday that he hoped the case would go to trial “so that all New Yorkers can see, in gory detail, what their state government has been up to. ” Mr. Percoco, who had served as Mr. Cuomo’s executive deputy secretary, is accused of soliciting and taking more than $315, 000 in bribes from 2012 to 2016 from two companies: Competitive Power Ventures, an energy company that was seeking state approval to build a power plant in the Hudson Valley, and COR Development, a major developer in the Syracuse area that ended up with several large   economic development projects. The bribes were arranged by Mr. Howe, who counted both companies among his clients, the complaint said. Mr. Howe is cooperating with the investigation, prosecutors said, and pleaded guilty this week to extortion, wire fraud and related conspiracy charges. His lawyer, Richard J. Morvillo, would say only that his client “has accepted responsibility for his actions and will testify truthfully if called upon. ” In one instance cited in the complaint, prosecutors say Mr. Howe sent an email to Dr. Kaloyeros saying he had “vitals for Buffalo and Syracuse friends. ” He was working with a prominent corporate donor, LPCiminelli, a builder based in Buffalo, to create a request for proposals that effectively made LPCiminelli the only eligible bidder. Neither the energy company nor the developers in Buffalo and Syracuse are named in the complaint, but several defendants charged are among the companies’ top officials. They include Peter Galbraith Kelly Jr. who oversaw lobbying and public relations for Competitive Power Ventures, which is based in Maryland and Massachusetts Steven Aiello, the president of COR Development and Joseph Gerardi, another executive at COR. The complaint also charges Louis Ciminelli, the founder of LPCiminelli and Michael Laipple and Kevin Schuler, two other LPCiminelli executives. Mr. Kelly is accused of offering and paying Mr. Percoco more than $287, 000 in bribes in exchange for Mr. Percoco’s help. The payments were made to Lisa   Mr. Percoco’s wife, who was ostensibly employed as a consultant to Competitive Power Ventures’s educational outreach arm starting in 2012. Competitive Power Ventures wanted Mr. Percoco’s help obtaining a state contract worth approximately $100 million to finance its power plant in the Hudson Valley, as well as millions of dollars in energy credits for a power plant it was building in New Jersey. The COR executives, Mr. Aiello and Mr. Gerardi, were accused of giving Mr. Percoco about $35, 000 in bribes to use his position in the governor’s office to promote the company’s economic development projects. According to the complaint, they sought Mr. Percoco’s help in reversing a decision by the state’s economic development agency that would have forced COR  —   Mr. Cuomo’s largest donor in central New York  —   to make an expensive labor peace agreement pushing the state to release payments that it owed to COR and getting a $5, 000 raise for Mr. Aiello’s son, who worked for Mr. Percoco at the governor’s office. The charges in the complaint included bribery, extortion under color of official right, and wire fraud and honest services fraud conspiracies. The defendants appeared in federal courts in Manhattan, Syracuse and Buffalo on Thursday and were ordered released on bond. The expected charges against Mr. Percoco were first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Percoco’s lawyer, Barry A. Bohrer, characterized the prosecution as “an overreach of classic proportions,” adding that a Supreme Court decision in June that overturned the corruption conviction of former Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia established that his client’s conduct was lawful. “Mr. Percoco performed services honestly and within the bounds of the law at all times,” Mr. Bohrer said. A lawyer for Mr. Aiello and Mr. Gerardi declined to comment. Mr. Kelly’s lawyer, Daniel M. Gitner, said his client was innocent and “will be exonerated. ” LPCiminelli, citing its three executives named in the complaint, said it was “confident that all company officials acted appropriately and legally” and would be vindicated. Virtually all the   projects were shaped under the umbrella of the State University of New York Polytechnic Institute and its subsidiaries. The institute is headed by Dr. Kaloyeros, a physicist who has become something of an economic development guru in Albany. Dr. Kaloyeros had been given free rein by Mr. Cuomo to conceive of   economic development projects that could create jobs across the state. Michael C. Miller, a lawyer for Dr. Kaloyeros, said his client was innocent and “looks forward to being exonerated. ” Dr. Kaloyeros also was hit with separate charges on Thursday filed by the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman. Dr. Kaloyeros and Joseph Nicolla of Columbia Development, an   firm, were accused of colluding to make sure Columbia was awarded contracts to build multiple SUNY Polytechnic projects. Mr. Cuomo said Dr. Kaloyeros had been suspended without pay. When news of the investigation into the governor’s former aides broke in April, his office quickly cut ties to both men and ordered its own internal investigation. The results of that inquiry have not been released. Mr. Cuomo said in a statement on Thursday that if the allegations were true, he would be “saddened and profoundly disappointed. ” “I hold my administration to the highest level of integrity. I have zero tolerance for abuse of the public trust from anyone,” he said. “If anything, a friend should be held to an even higher standard. ”",0
8062,Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton Set for Clash on Gun Control - The New York Times,"If more people were armed, Donald J. Trump says at rallies, mass shootings like those in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif. would be less deadly. If you have a permit to carry a concealed weapon, he wants to make it valid in all 50 states, as simple as a driver’s license. And Mr. Trump himself has a permit to carry a concealed handgun, which he is not shy about mentioning. “Somebody attacks me, oh, they’re gonna be shocked,” he warned last year. Mr. Trump, who promises to “totally protect” the Second Amendment, is scheduled to speak on Friday at the annual convention of the National Rifle Association, on the cusp of a general election in which gun issues are expected to be more prominent than in recent presidential races. His address should signal how far he is likely to go in pressing gun rights to energize the Republican base in the fall campaign. Whereas President Obama   gun control in both his national runs, Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, is signaling a greater appetite to clash with Mr. Trump on the issue. In a Twitter message last week, Mrs. Clinton said that Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, would force schools “to allow guns in classrooms on his first day in office. ” “This issue is at a tipping point,” said Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, citing Mrs. Clinton’s politically effective framing of gun issues that put Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on the defensive in the Democratic primary campaign. “You’re going to hear about it as differentiator for the first time in decades” in the general election, Mr. Gross said. Mrs. Clinton’s appearances in black churches, where she cited the grim statistics of gun violence and surrounded herself with families of victims, helped her win crucial   voters. She relentlessly criticized Mr. Sanders for his votes against gun control in the Senate. On the other hand, Mrs. Clinton avoided speaking about gun control in rural white regions of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, whose   voters will be desperately fought for by any Democratic nominee against Mr. Trump. A disparaging comment by Mr. Obama in 2008, who said that these voters cling to guns and religion, did much damage. As Mrs. Clinton turns to the general election, she plans to highlight the issue in swing districts like Northern Virginia and the Philadelphia suburbs, a campaign official said, where changing demographics are tipping support for gun control, especially among women. Mr. Trump’s naming of 11 potential Supreme Court justices on Wednesday seemed no coincidence: On the eve of the N. R. A. ’s meeting, the group’s concern for the court’s conservative tilt is likely to outweigh any hesitations about Mr. Trump’s reversal from earlier liberal positions on gun control. A statement on gun rights was one of the first detailed policy papers Mr. Trump issued last year after announcing his candidacy. He accused Mrs. Clinton this month of seeking to “abolish the Second Amendment. ” And just as he argues that casualties from the terrorist attacks in Paris last year would have been lower if civilians had been armed, he has proposed abolishing   zones at military bases and at schools. “I will get rid of   zones on schools, and  —   you have to  —   and on military bases,” Mr. Trump said on the campaign trail in January. “My first day, it gets signed, O. K.? My first day. There’s no more   zones. ” A federal law from the 1990s established   school zones. It could not be reversed by executive order, as Mr. Trump seems to imply. (His campaign did not respond to a request for comment about his gun policies.) “Trump would not be able to eliminate   zones by executive order,” said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and an expert on the Second Amendment. “That law can only be repealed by Congress. ” Mr. Trump opposes almost all recent actions aimed at reducing gun violence proposed by Mr. Obama and Democrats in Congress, who have sought gun regulations after horrific shootings in recent years. Each has failed in the face of Republican opposition. The measures included expanding background checks to people buying firearms at gun shows and online limiting the capacity of magazines and banning assault weapons. “Gun and magazine bans are a total failure,” Mr. Trump wrote in his position paper. “The government has no business dictating what types of firearms good, honest people are allowed to own. ” Those positions represent a reversal from where he stood about 15 years ago when he first contemplated a run for president. In a 2000 book, Mr. Trump supported a ban on assault weapons and a “slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun. ” He also criticized the power of the gun lobby. “The Republicans walk the N. R. A. line and refuse even limited restrictions,” he wrote. Bob Barr, an N. R. A. board member, said that despite Mr. Trump’s inconsistencies, he was preferable to Mrs. Clinton, who has said that a 2008 Supreme Court ruling overturning a handgun ban in Washington was wrongly decided. “We’re all very familiar with the fact Mr. Trump does change his positions over time, sometimes over a very short period of time,” said Mr. Barr, a former Georgia congressman. “The most important question in my mind is would he be better than Hillary Clinton, and the answer is absolutely yes. ” In polls, a majority of voters align with Democrats’ positions on gun control, though political strategists often say that only opponents care passionately enough about the issue to guide their vote. A New York   News poll in January found that 57 percent of respondents wanted stricter laws governing gun sales, and 88 percent favored background checks for all purchases. Mr. Trump goes against that grain. “What we don’t need to do is expand a broken system,” he wrote in his policy paper. One area in which Mr. Trump does part ways with gun rights activists is on preventing people on the government’s terrorist watch list from buying weapons. “If somebody is on a watch list and an enemy of state and we know it’s an enemy of state, I would keep them away, absolutely,” he said in an interview with ABC News last year. Senate Democrats pushed for such a bill, which many of Mr. Trump’s Republican rivals opposed. As a lifelong resident of New York City, which has some of the strictest gun laws on the books, Mr. Trump is an unlikely supporter of gun rights in a party that usually aligns with the cause because of libertarianism or roots in rural hunting. In addition to Mr. Trump’s permit to carry a handgun, his two sons are hunters. Photographs of the two men from a   hunting trip in Africa resurfaced last year, stirring criticism from animal rights activists for their poses with exotic animal conquests, including an elephant, a crocodile and a leopard. At the N. R. A. convention a year ago, Mr. Trump brought out his sons, Eric and Donald Jr. “These are our people,” Donald Trump Jr. said. “These are things we do on the weekends, in our free time. ”",0
8063,Peacemaking Goes Awry as Donald Trump Lashes Out at G.O.P. Senators - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   A peacemaking summit meeting between Republican lawmakers and their renegade presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump, descended on Thursday into an extraordinary series of acrid exchanges, punctuated by Mr. Trump’s threatening one Republican senator and deriding another as a “loser. ” Mr. Trump arrived in the capital with hopes of courting skeptical House and Senate Republicans and mending his relationship with Senator Ted Cruz, his former rival for the nomination, in a blitz of    meetings. But the friendly atmosphere turned fraught when Mr. Trump lashed out in the face of direct criticism. The tension reflects the lingering fissures in a Republican Party that continues to grapple with Mr. Trump as its   and underscores Mr. Trump’s limitations when it comes to unifying the party and moving beyond political grudges. He has disappointed some members of the party who have hoped his campaign would become more disciplined, but instead have seen him dwell on and even repeat his own missteps rather than maintaining a focused offensive against Hillary Clinton. His private meeting Thursday with 41 Senate Republicans, including some who have publicly criticized him repeatedly, grew acidly contentious, according to multiple lawmakers and other people present who insisted on anonymity to candidly recount the proceedings. Mr. Trump at one point jabbed at Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who has openly called for a   candidate to thwart Mr. Trump’s chances, asking Mr. Sasse rhetorically if he preferred to have Mrs. Clinton as president. Mr. Sasse did not respond in kind  —   but Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona did. Mr. Flake, of Arizona, told him that he wanted to support Mr. Trump, but could not because of Mr. Trump’s statements about   and attacks on a federal judge over his Hispanic descent. Mr. Trump responded by saying that he had been going easy on Mr. Flake so far, but that he would ensure that Mr. Flake lost his   bid this year if the senator did not change his tune. Dumbstruck, Mr. Flake informed Mr. Trump that he was not up for   this year. (After the meeting, Mr. Sasse said through a spokesman that he still believed that, “with these two candidates, this election remains a Dumpster fire. ”) Mr. Trump even aimed vitriol at a senator who did not show up, according to people who attended the meeting: Senator Mark S. Kirk of Illinois, who recently withdrew his support for Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump called Mr. Kirk “dishonest” and a “loser” and suggested that Mr. Kirk really wanted to support Mr. Trump but was refusing to for political reasons, the attendees said. Mr. Kirk is among the most embattled incumbent Republican senators seeking   in November. Two aides to Mr. Trump, who insisted on anonymity to discuss the meeting, insisted Mr. Trump never used the word “loser” and that Mr. Trump never threatened to harm Mr. Flake’s electoral chances. Yet Mike Huckabee, a top supporter of Mr. Trump’s, issued an even broader threat on Fox News, saying that should Mr. Trump win the White House, “When Jeff Flake needs something for Arizona, he ain’t going to get it. ” In an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Kirk shot back at Mr. Trump, calling him an “Eastern, privileged, wealthy bully. ” “Our bullies are made of better stuff in Illinois,” he said. “We’re much more practical and polite. ” Despite the tense exchanges, Mr. Trump’s visit was not for naught. He met and managed to reach an accommodation with Mr. Cruz, whom he had not seen since their ugly nomination battle ended in   and personal insults in early May. The two were joined by Mr. Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner, along with Mr. Cruz’s aides and Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman. While there was no talk of an endorsement yet, Mr. Trump invited Mr. Cruz to speak at the party’s national convention in Cleveland and, according to Mr. Cruz’s spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, Mr. Cruz accepted. Mr. Cruz also agreed to counsel Mr. Trump on future judicial nominations, Ms. Frazier said. A senior aide to Mr. Trump said that as part of an agreement to give Mr. Cruz a prominent speaking slot, Mr. Cruz would not disrupt the proceedings of the nomination and the campaign would be able to review the speech before it is delivered. Some senators who attended the meeting said that it was largely cordial and thoughtful and played down Mr. Trump’s occasionally gruff tone. “He didn’t defeat 16 opponents by parroting Republican establishment talking points,” said Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, one of Mr. Trump’s most stalwart supporters. The broader meeting with Republican senators followed a more upbeat session with more than 200 Republican House members at the Capitol Hill Club. According to two lawmakers in attendance, the conversation was fairly subdued and focused on border security, the need to protect the Second Amendment and the high costs associated with the Affordable Care Act, the health law that Mr. Trump wants to repeal and replace. Mr. Trump also insisted that he could be trusted to pick conservative judges for the Supreme Court, thanks to the advice of the Heritage Foundation’s Jim DeMint, and warned about the fate of the bench in the hands of Hillary Clinton, the lawmakers said. As he did in a speech in Cincinnati on Wednesday, Mr. Trump complained about the tough news coverage he has faced, particularly reports of his saying that he admired Saddam Hussein, and he bragged of his impressive performance in the primary elections. Despite the recent protectionist tenor of his campaign, Mr. Trump insisted that he was a devoted free trader and that he wanted to renegotiate deals with other countries so that they favor the United States. Although the House members did not confront Mr. Trump about his policies, one did ask him how he could help the party maintain control of the Senate and the House, suggesting some concern about Republican losses in the House in the November elections. Representative John Mica, Republican of Florida, emerged from the meeting saying Mr. Trump had been greeted favorably by House Republicans, who gave him “two or three” standing ovations while he was present. Speaker Paul D. Ryan said the meeting was “great” during his weekly news conference and declined to discuss the controversy over Mr. Trump’s recent Twitter post of  a Star of David shape in an image suggesting that Mrs. Clinton is corrupt. There were also signs of skepticism. Representative Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois, said he could sense some hesitation in the room, his own included. Mr. Kinzinger, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, said Mr. Trump’s recent remarks about Saddam Hussein were not helpful. “I’m not a Never Trump guy, I’m a Republican  —   I want to support him,” he said. “But things like saying the Saddam Hussein comment are not helping me to get there. ” Resistance to Mr. Trump was also on display outside of the meetings. As the meeting with House Republicans was going on during a sweltering summer morning, a small cadre of protesters chanted “Dump Donald Trump!” from across the street. They waved signs with enlarged images of several lawmakers edited to wear Mr. Trump’s “Make America Great Again” caps. Among the photos, labeled the “Party of Trump” by the demonstrators, were Senators Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Rob Portman of Ohio  —   vulnerable Republicans facing tough   fights who have been cautious about being tied too closely to their party’s polarizing presidential nominee. Asked if Republicans were becoming frustrated with Mr. Trump’s meetings and speeches ending in controversy despite venues that should be friendly, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee paused and looked at the sky. “They end up being memorable,” he said.",0
8064,CNN Got Complete List of Questions for Trump Interview from DNC,"
CNN asked the Democratic National Committee to prepare questions for Wolf Blitzer’s interview with Donald Trump, according to emails released by Wikileaks.
In an April 25 email entitled “Trump Questions for CNN,” the DNC’s Lauren Dillon asked fellow Democrats for questions Blitzer could ask Trump.
“Wolf Blitzer is interviewing Trump on Tues ahead of his foreign policy address on Wed,” she wrote. “Please send me thoughts by 10:30 AM tomorrow. Thanks!”
The DNC came up with a lengthy set of questions for CNN :
– Who helped you write the foreign policy speech you’re giving tomorrow? Which advisors specifically did you talk to? What advice did they give you? Did they give you any advice that you chose not to take?
– CIA Director Brennan and former CIA Director Hayden have both said that our military and intelligence officers might refuse to follow some of your orders if you were president. What would you do if the military refused to listen to you? Should they be court-martialed if they refuse to follow orders?
– You’ve said you look to Ambassador John Bolton for military advice and called him “terrific,” but he was one of the architects of the Iraq war. How do you explain your praise for Bolton if you also claim the war was a mistake? What advice have you taken from him?
You can read the rest here , but there’s a few other gems:
– Do you think American victims of 9/11 should be able to sue Saudi Arabia in court? What role, if any, do you think Saudi Arabia had in the 9/11 attacks?
– You’ve said we should have bombed the “right people” after 9/11 and have suggested that the government has evidence Saudi Arabia was involved. Do you think we should have instead bombed Saudi Arabia?
This is smoking gun, undeniable proof that CNN is in the tank for Hillary Clinton – and the rest of the mainstream media is no different.
In fact, the Clinton campaign is acting as an assignment editor for the establishment media by telling reporters what to cover – and what to bury from public view that would otherwise hurt Hillary.
Previous Wikileaks emails revealed that campaign staffers are directly working with mainstream “journalists” to develop news stories favorable to the campaign – before they’re published!
“Huffington Post is doing a piece on our treasurer Jose Villareal — will likely focus at least partially on him sitting on the Walmart board,” said campaign communications staffer Jesse Lehrich in a 2015 email , which reads like a reporter assignment list at a major newspaper. “Other outstanding stories include: [Buzzfeed correspondent] Ruby Cramer on our grassroots organizing, Anita Kumar (McClatchy) on where we have organizers and how we’ve spent our money during Q2, and [Washington Post reporter] Phil Rucker on HRC talking about gun violence prevention.”

8065,"Amid Tide of Red on Electoral Map, West Coast Stays Defiantly Blue - The New York Times","SAN FRANCISCO  —   The West Coast has long prided itself as an engine for reinvention and progressive ideals, distinct from the rest of the country. But after Tuesday’s election, the states bordering the Pacific Ocean feel increasingly like an island unto its own. While large parts of the American electoral map, particularly in the industrial Rust Belt, turned more Republican in Tuesday’s election, California went more Democratic, with 61. 5 percent of voters choosing Hillary Clinton, the highest percentage for a Democratic presidential nominee since the   of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936. On social policies, the election made the Rockies look more like a border than a mountain range. In a raft of ballot measures, voters embraced causes like bilingual education, stricter gun control and taxes on sugary drinks. Amid Donald J. Trump’s promises to slash taxes, voters in the West decided the opposite, raising taxes and voting to pour billions of dollars into schools and transportation. And the entire West Coast has legalized marijuana, now that California joined Washington and Oregon. While there have been gestures of conciliation in Washington toward Mr. Trump, political leaders in the West were defiant. Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor of California, said the election inspired him to team up with “enlightened” leaders in the West to “push back aggressively” against policies on immigration and the environment from the future Trump administration. “We are a nation state,” Mr. Newsom said, referring to the state’s diversity and vast, dynamic economy. “In so many ways, we are America,” he said. “But we are just ahead of the curve. ” The election of Mr. Trump prompted street protesters in the liberal bastions of California to call for secession from the union  —   and a promise from Shervin Pishevar, a Silicon Valley investor, to fund a #calexit campaign, as it has become known on social media. A petition for Oregon to secede was filed with the Oregon secretary of state’s office on Thursday, allowing backers to start gathering signatures. The notion of West Coast states leaving the United States is fanciful and often   . But it reflects a sentiment here that after Mr. Trump’s unexpected victory on Tuesday, the West increasingly sees itself as separate  —   a place of innovation, economic dynamism and a belief that government can be an agent of change. Abby Ginzberg, a documentary filmmaker who lives in Albany, Calif. said she felt both deflated by the result but somewhat insulated from its consequences. “Right now, I am depressed and upset and aware we live in a bubble,” she said. “Thank god for the bubble!” In Oregon and Washington, Mrs. Clinton’s margin of victory was close to President Obama’s four years ago. She received about 73 percent of the vote in Oregon’s biggest urban county, Multnomah, which includes the Portland area  —   with most of the votes counted in an   election. In Washington, the concentrations of blue intensified from the last presidential election. In King County, which includes Seattle and is the most populous in the state, Mrs. Clinton did better than Mr. Obama, with nearly three out of four residents voting for her, compared with 69 percent for Mr. Obama in 2012. Mayor Ed Murray of Seattle, a Democrat, described his city in recent days as almost like a fortress under siege, scanning for attack on the ramparts. Fighting, he said  —   in defense or offense  —   seems inevitable. “This country has elected a president who, during the campaign, demonstrated outright misogyny, homophobia, xenophobia, nationalism, racism and authoritarian tendencies,” he said. “We also have to challenge what we believe is wrong. ” Mr. Murray, the city’s first openly gay mayor, said he believed Mr. Trump, based on his comments as a candidate, could also aim to “trim back” gains that places like Seattle have made in gay rights. “Let me tell you, this city is committed that we will not lose the things that we have gained, the rings that we wear on our fingers,” the mayor said. Not every result was so liberal. Californians voted to keep the death penalty, and some inland counties clearly supported the Trump candidacy. Still, one reason Mr. Trump’s populist revolt bypassed the West is that the economic landscape did not reflect decades of decay and job losses. Yes, there are areas of anger and strain, from the   ranches of eastern Oregon to coal towns in northwestern Colorado to strawberry farms in the Central Valley of California to steel towns struggling to reinvent themselves. But there are also new solar and wind farms,   tourist towns and cities from Denver to San Jose, Calif. to Seattle that are buzzing with businesses, construction cranes and swarms of new residents. “Places like Colorado, we have a robust economy,” said Representative Diana DeGette, a Democrat who represents the Denver area. “What you see in the West is the development of a new economy that they’re not seeing the Midwest and the South. ” Over all, Colorado sided narrowly with the Democrats on Tuesday, but the state embraced liberal ballot measures like a rise in minimum wage and a law allowing medical assistance in dying for terminally ill people. Voters rejected a   health care system, however. Like states across the nation, California is unsure to what extent Mr. Trump’s promises to slash government programs such as the Affordable Care Act will be carried out. Willie Brown, the former mayor of San Francisco and for decades a major player in state Democratic Party politics, said he did not believe California would be singled out for its support of Mrs. Clinton. “I don’t think there will be a Trump jihad on California,” he said. “He’s not so much into policy. He’s into saying what he thinks people want to hear. ” Kevin de León, Senate president pro tem of California, said that his staff was not taking any chances and had begun a “comprehensive review” of all federal programs that had an impact on California, and that it was looking at the impact that “draconian cuts” would have. Kamala Harris, California’s newly elected senator and a Democrat, said on Thursday that she would fight to protect immigrants and push back against Mr. Trump’s proposed policies. Some mayors in the West vowed to push ahead with plans to protect salmon, to limit greenhouse gases, to feed undocumented immigrants and to outlaw discrimination against gay and transgender residents. “Our agenda here in Colorado, our agenda here in Denver, does not change,” said Michael B. Hancock, the mayor of Denver. “We’re trying to design policies that are more inclusive. States like Colorado, cities like Denver, are ahead of the curve. We’re trying to forge a future where we say, ‘How do we not leave people behind? ’” Other West Coast political leaders said they did not necessarily envision a war with the Trump administration and its allies but more a kind of competition for hearts and minds. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat who was elected to her first term in Congress on Tuesday representing part of Seattle, said that whispers of what might be called West Coast values  —   particularly a higher minimum wage  —   found echoes on Tuesday in states like Arizona that also voted for Mr. Trump. West Coast states, she said, should look for those allies and cultivate them. Voters in Colorado, Maine and Washington State also voted to raise their minimum wages. “I absolutely believe that we can pull people toward this model,” said Ms. Jayapal, the first   woman to serve in Congress. “I think we are showing how to do things  —   we passed gun control legislation for the second time in three years on the ballot. We passed a statewide   increase, the highest in the country. ” On Thursday, as Mr. Trump visited the White House for the first time as   city officials in Portland, Ore. and environmental activists met to discuss a restriction on export terminals for coal, oil and other fossil fuels. “Regardless of whether we have climate deniers in charge at the national government, it doesn’t change the facts,” said Mayor Charlie Hales of Portland. He said he was “heartsick” over the election, calling it a “national catastrophe. ” “Rivers flood. Droughts persist. We don’t have the luxury of living in an ideological bubble on this,” he said. The Obama years had given Portland a close partner in Washington. That relationship could be upended if Mr. Trump follows through on promises to cut off all federal funding for cities deemed to be “sanctuary cities” for undocumented immigrants. Federal money flows to everything from rail lines to crime fighting to school lunch programs for poor children. “We’ve built a better place, and the world is beating a path to our door,” Mr. Hales said. “We’ll figure out how to feed people with or without the federal government’s help. ” In other liberal towns across the West, students joined protests against Mr. Trump, chanting what has now become a familiar motto, “Not Our President. ” In Portland, some of the protests turned violent on Thursday night. In Boulder, Colo. Mrs. Clinton had a bigger win than Mr. Obama four years earlier. High school students streamed out of classes on Wednesday afternoon there to protest the election results, as they have in a several secondary schools across the West. On the pedestrian Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Heidi Ames, 41, kept a lonely vigil with a sign that said, “Trump Is Not My President. ” “There are a lot of shocked and depressed people right now,” she said. “I wanted to show other liberal people I’m doing something. I’m not just talking on Facebook. ” On the day after the election, Mr. de León, of the California Senate, sent out a statement written with a colleague in the Legislature that said the victory of Mr. Trump made them feel like “strangers in a foreign land. ” In an interview on Thursday, Mr. de León said he felt a mix of disillusionment and defiance. “California has long set an example for other states to follow,” he said. “We are not going to allow one election to reverse generations of progress. ”",0
8066,‘They Will Kill Us’: Afghan Translators Plead for Delayed U.S. Visas - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Zar Mohammad Stanikzai remembers the promise made to him when he became a translator supporting the United States military in 2012: Help us, and we will keep you safe. Four years later, his fear of Taliban reprisals has made him a prisoner in his Afghan home, he said, and he is still waiting for the Americans to honor their commitment. Instead, Congress is bickering over the program meant to be his deliverance. Republican infighting, infused with nativist tones, has left in question whether a special visa program for translators and interpreters who assisted the military during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq will be renewed, a potentially devastating blow to approximately 12, 000 Afghans whose immigration applications are in limbo. “We’ve really been trying to reinforce the fact to Afghans that we are committed to you, and this gives the enemy some propaganda to say, ‘Hey, these people really aren’t committed to you,’ ” said Brig. Gen. Charles H. Cleveland, spokesman for the American command in Afghanistan. “It’s our credibility that is on the line,” he added. Senator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a longtime champion of the visa program, was blunt. “People are going to die,” Mr. McCain said on the Senate floor, challenging a fellow Republican who was blocking more visas. “Don’t you understand the gravity of that?” For more than eight years, the State Department has offered a visa program designated for many of those who face an “ongoing serious threat” as a result of having provided critical linguistic support  —   whether in oral interpretation or written translation  —   in Afghanistan and Iraq. In the last two and a half years, officials say, they have issued visas to more than 8, 000 Afghans and their immediate families through the program, which members of the armed services, military officials and lawmakers from both parties have hailed as indispensable to national security. Congress has responded to the State Department’s program parsimoniously, allocating the special visas piecemeal through its annual defense policy bill. Since the end of 2014, lawmakers have set aside about 7, 000 visas for Afghan translators and interpreters. As of July 10, fewer than 3, 000 of those visas remained, but about 12, 000 individuals have at least started the application process, according to the State Department. Applicants must apply by Dec. 31 in order to be considered. Then this year, something changed: A few Republicans said no, asking whether more visas were necessary when the State Department still had visas from previous years that could be distributed. Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  —   which has jurisdiction over immigration matters  —   also questioned the cost of adding the 4, 000 visas that the Obama administration requested this year, pointing to a Congressional Budget Office estimate of $446 million over the next 10 years. After Congress failed to approve more visas in the House and Senate defense bills, a bipartisan group of senators tried again last month with a compromise that would have added 2, 500 visas  —   only to be blocked by Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, who said his quarrel was not with the visa program but rather with the fact that it was getting a vote while one of his own, unrelated measures was not. Mr. McCain responded by accusing Mr. Lee of “signing the death warrants” of people who had put their lives on the line to help the United States. Mr. Stanikzai would agree. Now 24, he first applied in 2013 for one of the visas, writing to American officials later that year that an imam had warned his father that his son must stop working for the Americans or be killed. He then described how he came under fire as he drove home from his mosque, his car hit by three rounds from an   he said. If the Taliban find him  —   or any of the Afghans hoping the United States will grant them visas  —   “they will kill us,” he said in an interview. Yet with neither the House nor the Senate approving more visas in their competing defense policy bills, lawmakers hashing out a compromise this fall may be unlikely to step in. Much of the resistance seems to stem from a growing discomfort with immigrants, said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire and one of the visa program’s most active supporters. One Republican counterproposal this year would have offset each special visa by deducting one   visa from the 50, 000 allocated every year to ordinary immigrants. “What that said to me is that the issue here is not really the special immigrant visas for our interpreters,” she said. “It was, ‘How do we keep from allowing more people into the United States?’ ” In an election year in which many voters have cheered Donald J. Trump’s call to keep out migrants from Muslim countries, Ryan C. Crocker, who served as ambassador to Afghanistan and Iraq, saw more troubling motivations. “I haven’t heard members say that openly, but I sometimes wonder if behind a reluctance to move in a positive fashion lurks that   sentiment,” he said. John Kirby, the State Department’s spokesman, said the vetting of applicants included fingerprint and facial recognition checks as part of a full counterterrorism screening. The government has struggled to keep pace with the influx of Afghan and Iraqi applications for special visas and changes to the eligibility rules made by lawmakers, mistakenly disqualifying some applicants and trapping others in a holding pattern that lasts months or even years. That is time, several translators and interpreters said, that the applicants cannot afford to waste as they face serious threats to their lives every day. As the Obama administration works out those problems, congressional inaction would turn off the spigot at the end of the year and shut out any new applications. That has horrified program supporters, including many military officers. Gen. David H. Petraeus and Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, former commanders of the United States forces in Afghanistan, as well as Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr. the current commander, have pressed Congress to renew the program. Simply debating whether to help those who helped the United States is damaging, Mr. Crocker said, because it leaves people wondering, as he put it, “What kind of people are those Americans?” Mohammad Nasim Hashimyar, 29, said he worked with the American Special Forces in Afghanistan for a little more than a year, but his visa was rejected because of a “lack of faithful and valuable service,” according to the letter he received from the American Embassy. He kept it along with a handful of certificates of appreciation and letters of recommendation from soldiers he helped, including one who wrote that Mr. Hashimyar was “the key to success” in many of their efforts. He has appealed his rejection. Facing threats to him and his family, he said he avoided leaving his home when possible, and he carried a gun. “I wish I have never worked with them,” he said. “I destroyed my life. ”",0
8067,Gawker Is Said to Be Sold to Univision in a $135 Million Bid - The New York Times,"Gawker Media, whose fierce independence afforded it an unsparing approach to web journalism that influenced news organizations across the internet and the wider media world, was sold to Univision at auction on Tuesday, giving the freewheeling company an outside owner for the first time since its founding 14 years ago. Univision bid $135 million to beat out the digital media publisher Ziff Davis, according to three people with direct knowledge of the deal who spoke on condition of anonymity because the price had not been made public. A bankruptcy judge is to officially approve the sale at a hearing later this week. The sale came two months after Gawker filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, a concession to the financial pressure the company faces from a $140 million legal judgment in an    lawsuit by the former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, whose real name is Terry G. Bollea. Making matters worse for Gawker was Peter Thiel, the billionaire Silicon Valley entrepreneur, who acknowledged after the Hogan trial that he had funded the lawsuit and was providing financial support for other legal cases against the company. Univision will not assume the $140 million judgment. Univision, best known for its   television network, has recently moved aggressively to expand its online portfolio, and adding Gawker’s sites fits with its plans to extend its reach beyond   viewers. Univision bought a large stake in The Onion this year and acquired full control of Fusion, the news site and cable channel that it started with the Walt Disney Company in 2013. Univision also owns other digital media companies, including The Root, a site focused on   issues. In a statement, Nick Denton, Gawker’s founder and chief executive, said: “I am pleased that our employees are protected and will continue their work under new ownership  —   disentangled from the legal campaign against the company. We could not have picked an acquirer more devoted to vibrant journalism. ” Univision declined to comment. For Gawker, the sale is the end of an era. Founded in 2002 by Mr. Denton, a former journalist for The Financial Times, the site attracted young journalists who took on articles that traditional media organizations were sometimes reluctant to pursue. The company had its critics, who said its sites skirted the boundaries of good taste. It initially had only two sites  —   Gawker, a news and gossip site that largely covered New York media and society, and Gizmodo, a gadgets and technology blog. What journalists initially lacked in monetary compensation, they made up for in a kind of industry cachet. Employees went on to found influential sites like The Awl and work at publications like The New Yorker and Time. “One thing that has always been true about Gawker is that it was an amazing incubator of talent,” said Adam Moss, the editor in chief of New York magazine, which has hired many former Gawker journalists. He added, “To a large extent, the voice that they worked out at the beginning became a kind of template for the way people talk on the web. ” Mr. Denton was known for saying that journalists too often share the most interesting stories they know only with each other at the bar after work, and the company held the value of entertaining readers seemingly above all else. Over the years, Gawker Media espoused a gossipy, wry tone that often made much of the traditional media seem  . The company blogs now include Jezebel, which is aimed at women, and Deadspin, the sports site. But Gawker’s    approach has also been to its detriment. Mr. Bollea sued Gawker Media in 2012 over its publication of a video that showed him having sex with the wife of a friend. He has been unable to collect from Gawker on the $140 million judgment because of its bankruptcy filing. Mr. Denton, who is personally liable for $10 million and jointly liable for $115 million, filed for bankruptcy this month, listing $10 million to $50 million in assets and $100 million to $500 million in liabilities. Gawker had revenue of $17. 8 million for the year through July 21, according to filings in connection with the bankruptcy. It reported $48. 7 million in revenue in 2015 and $43. 8 million in 2014. Mr. Thiel’s battle with the company began in 2007, when Valleywag, one of Gawker’s   blogs, wrote a post saying he was gay. “I had begun coming out to people I knew, and I planned to continue on my own terms,” Mr. Thiel wrote in an   in The New York Times that was published online on Monday. “Instead, Gawker violated my privacy and cashed in on it. ” He wrote that he was “proud to have contributed financial support” to Mr. Bollea’s case and would continue to support him “until his final victory. ” Last summer, after Gawker published and then removed an article about a married male media executive who sought to hire a gay escort, the company was thrown into turmoil over disagreement about whether the post should have been taken down. Two top editors resigned, and Mr. Denton vowed to make the site nicer. Since the verdict in the Hogan case was handed down by a Florida jury in March, Gawker’s typical defiance has been tinged with resignation. During a party in July at The Box, a burlesque club in Lower Manhattan, the drinks flowed freely, and so did cheeky jokes about Mr. Thiel and the company’s bankruptcy. Last week, at its offices near Union Square, Gawker held its final party as an independent company. It was billed as a   affair  —   the wine and beer were gone by 8 p. m.  —   and the mood was somewhere between reunion and Irish wake. “We have shown with our backs against the wall the kind of character and determination and verve and style that I think we can absolutely be proud of,” Mr. Denton told a crowd that had assembled on the large    area that has become the company’s default gathering place. “In a week, we’re going to know the identity of the company’s new owner, and I’m hopeful and confident that the parent company that the sites will be under will allow them to thrive. ” In a note to employees, Vivek Shah, the chief executive of Ziff Davis, said his company had withdrawn from the auction “once we felt the price and terms exceeded our threshold. ” When Gawker filed for bankruptcy, Ziff Davis submitted a $90 million offer for the company. A   stalking horse bidder, Ziff Davis would have assumed ownership of Gawker if no other bidder had emerged. As part of its agreement for being the first bidder, Ziff Davis will collect a $2. 475 million breakup fee. It was not clear what the sale would mean for Mr. Denton. Whether he stays on at Univision may not be up to him, and there have been indications that he may be ready to step away. In the last year, Heather Dietrick, Gawker Media’s president and general counsel, has taken on more of a leadership role. It was also not clear whether Univision would hold on to Gawker. com, the flagship site that was at the center of the Hogan suit. Under Univision, Gawker will become a relatively small part of a large company. That could work in Gawker’s favor if it is allowed to operate on its own, without too much oversight from its new parent. But Univision, which has indicated in the past that it planned to go public, could also reshape Gawker in its own image. Gawker’s   business was also a draw for Univision. Univision and Gawker had been in discussions about a potential investment before the Hogan trial, but those talks collapsed.",0
8068,"Roger Wilkins, Champion of Civil Rights, Dies at 85 - The New York Times","Roger Wilkins, who championed civil rights for black Americans for five decades as an official in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, a foundation executive, a journalist, an author and a university professor, died on Sunday in Kensington, Md. He was 85. His daughter Elizabeth confirmed his death, at a care facility. The cause was complications of dementia. A black lawyer in the corridors of power, Mr. Wilkins was an assistant United States attorney general, ran domestic programs for the Ford Foundation, wrote editorials for The Washington Post and The New York Times, taught history at George Mason University for nearly 20 years and was close to leading lights of literature, music, politics, journalism and civil rights. Roy Wilkins, who led the N. A. A. C. P. from 1955 to 1977, was his uncle. Roger Wilkins’s early mentor was Thurgood Marshall, the renowned civil rights lawyer who became the Supreme Court’s first black associate justice. And he organized Nelson Mandela’s triumphant   visit to the United States in 1990 as millions turned out to see that living symbol of resistance to apartheid after his release from 27 years in prison in South Africa. Beyond attending a segregated elementary school as a boy and being arrested once in a protest against apartheid, Mr. Wilkins had little personal experience with discrimination. He waged war against racism from above the barricades  —   with political influence, jawboning, court injunctions, philanthropic grants, legislative proposals, and commentaries on radio and television and in newspapers, magazines and books. Outwardly, he was a successful, popular black man with more white acquaintances than black friends. The second of his three wives was white. A lean, intense,   intellectual, he grew up in a genteel   family. The customs, attitudes and social currencies of everyday black life “evolved away from me,” he said in a memoir. “I didn’t know how to talk, to banter, to move my body,” he said. It mattered. As he rose to prominence, he came to regard himself as a token black in institutions and social circles that were overwhelmingly white and privileged. It troubled him deeply. In the memoir, “A Man’s Life: An Autobiography” (1982) he cited struggles with depression, suicidal thoughts and drinking problems, and acknowledged years of unease with his blackness, of trying to live up to the expectations of whites. “Instead of standing with my nose pressed to the window, I often found myself inside rooms with people whose names were Mailer, Vidal, Javits, Kennedy or Bernstein,” he wrote. He was surrounded at work by   white men, while “my night world was virtually ” he added. “It was as if, by entering that world at night, I was betraying everything I told myself I stood for during the day. ” A University of Michigan Law School graduate, Mr. Wilkins went to Washington on a wave of New Frontier fervor in 1962 to join the Kennedy administration. He became special assistant to the head of the Agency for International Development. He was soon spotted as a savvy, if outspoken, Democratic asset, and joined campaigns for passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson named him the administration’s chief troubleshooter on urban racial issues. He became an assistant attorney general, ostensibly to calm the unrest racking cities. He spoke dutifully against violence and met mayors and community leaders, but did not see his principal task as the suppression of disturbances. “I am a firm believer in the view that the riots are not the real problem,” Mr. Wilkins said, calling for more jobs, housing and help for the poor. “The real threat to American life is our inattention to the really depressed and anguished conditions of the minority group people who live in the ghettos of this country. ” In 1966, he and a Justice Department colleague went to Chicago to see the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. As he admitted later, Mr. Wilkins harbored suspicions that Dr. King might be an opportunist, Louis Menand wrote in The New Yorker in 2013. The visitors found Dr. King in an airless railroad flat in a slum, talking to 40 or 50 young gang members about nonviolence. “For hours this went on,” Mr. Wilkins was quoted as saying. “There were no photographers there, no newsmen. There was no glory in it. He also kept two assistant attorneys general of the United States waiting for hours while he did this. ” It was 4 a. m. when Dr. King finished. He woke his wife, Coretta, and she made coffee. “We sat and we talked,” Mr. Wilkins said. “He was a great man, a great man. ” When Richard M. Nixon became president in early 1969, Mr. Wilkins detected a “turning away from the paths of cultural decency” and left government to join the Ford Foundation in New York. For three years, he oversaw funding for job training, education, drug rehabilitation and other programs. But he was powerless to support many projects he considered worthy and became disillusioned with the work. In 1972 he began a new career in journalism, writing editorials for The Washington Post. He also began to put aside what he called his “desperate search for white approval. ” His editorials on the Watergate scandal that drove Nixon from the presidency, along with reporting by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein and cartoons by Herbert Block, helped The Post win the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service in 1973. Mr. Wilkins joined The Times editorial board in 1974 and later became an   page columnist. In 1977, he and other minority journalists accused The Times in a federal lawsuit of racial discrimination in hiring and promotions the case was settled for cash and pledges of improvements. He left the newspaper in 1979 and was an associate editor and columnist for The Washington Star in 1980 and 1981. From 1979 to 1989 he was a member of the board that awarded journalism’s Pulitzer Prizes. He was also on an advisory panel that recommended Janet Cooke of The Washington Post for a   Pulitzer in 1981, for her article on an    heroin addict. It was exposed as a fabrication after she won the prize. He said the episode had harmed “blacks in newsrooms all over the country. ” Ms. Cooke, who returned the prize and resigned, is black. From 1982 to 1992, Mr. Wilkins was a senior fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, a Washington think tank. From 1988 until his retirement in 2007, he was the Clarence J. Robinson professor in history and American culture at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. During his teaching years, he wrote for newspapers and magazines and was a frequent commentator on radio and television. Roger Wilkins was born in Kansas City, Mo. on March 25, 1932, to Earl and Helen Jackson Wilkins. Some of his ancestors were slaves in Virginia. His father was a journalist and his mother was the first black national president of the Y. W. C. A. she helped desegregate the organization in the 1960s. In Kansas City, Roger attended the   Crispus Attucks School, founded in 1893 and named for a slave killed by the British in the Boston Massacre of 1770. After his father died in 1941, the boy and his mother joined relatives in Harlem, and three years later settled in Grand Rapids, Mich. where he graduated from high school. At the University of Michigan, he earned a bachelor’s degree in 1953 and a law degree in 1956. He tried social work in Cleveland briefly, practiced law in New York City for several years, then joined the Kennedy administration. Mr. Wilkins had a home in Washington. His marriages to Eve Tyler and Mary Myers ended in divorce. His third wife, Patricia A. King, a law professor at Georgetown University, survives him. Besides her and his daughter Elizabeth, from his third marriage, he is survived by another daughter, Amy Wilkins, and a son, David, both from his first marriage two half sisters, Sharon Peters and Judith Claytor and two grandsons. Mr. Wilkins wrote “Jefferson’s Pillow: The Founding Fathers and the Dilemma of Black Patriotism” (2001). He produced and narrated two PBS documentaries, “Keeping the Faith” (1987) about black churches, and “Throwaway People” (1990) about a poor black neighborhood. “In a sense,” Mr. Wilkins wrote in his memoir, “I have been an explorer, and I sailed as far out into the white world as a black man of my generation could sail. ”",0

8070,Nicolas Sarkozy Ordered to Stand Trial Over Campaign Finances - The New York Times,"PARIS  —   Former President Nicolas Sarkozy has been ordered by a judge to stand trial on charges of illegally financing his failed 2012   campaign, the Paris prosecutor’s office said on Tuesday, the latest impediment for a politician who not long ago was hoping for a comeback. Mr. Sarkozy, 62, a mercurial   politician who was president of France from 2007 to 2012, has denied any wrongdoing. His lawyer said he would appeal the decision, after which the case would be referred to another court for a final ruling. Mr. Sarkozy, who could face up to a year in prison and a fine of 3, 750 euros, or about $4, 000, is out of the running for presidential elections this spring after a poor showing in a November primary for the center and right candidates, and he no longer leads the   Republican Party. His diminished role in French politics would limit the fallout from a trial, but the judge’s decision comes amid growing anger against the political establishment and reflects increased scrutiny of its financial and personal arrangements. Mr. Sarkozy would be the second French president since 1958 to go on trial for a financial scandal. Jacques Chirac, who was president from 1995 to 2007, was given a suspended sentence in 2011 after being convicted of embezzlement and misuse of public funds when he was mayor of Paris. More recently, Christine Lagarde, a former economy minister for Mr. Sarkozy who went on to head the International Monetary Fund, was convicted in December of negligence for misusing public funds, but the court did not impose a fine or a sentence. François Fillon, Mr. Sarkozy’s former prime minister and the Republican presidential candidate, is bearing the brunt of the current outrage after revelations that he used taxpayer money to pay family members for parliamentary work that might not have been genuine. In Mr. Sarkozy’s case, the prosecution asserts that he knowingly authorized his 2012 campaign to surpass the strict spending limits set by French law. At the time, the limit for presidential campaigns was about $18. 6 million per candidate in the first round of the elections, and about $5 million on top of that in the second round for the two top   who included Mr. Sarkozy. The Paris prosecutor’s office said on Tuesday that Mr. Sarkozy was suspected of spending at least $45 million, nearly twice the limit, and that he had ignored warnings from his campaign accountants. The case against Mr. Sarkozy is part of what is known as the Bygmalion affair, named for the public relations company suspected of issuing false invoices to Mr. Sarkozy’s party in 2012 for events that were actually for his presidential campaign. The prosecution asserts that the goal of the fraud was to hide the overspending by Mr. Sarkozy’s campaign from the electoral authorities. Mr. Sarkozy has repeatedly denied being aware of any false billing, and the prosecutors have not charged him with wrongdoing in that regard. Instead, the charges of illegal campaign financing relate only to the overspending, for which he has already paid a fine. Thirteen other people  —   including former party officials, aides close to Mr. Sarkozy and former executives at Bygmalion  —   were also ordered to stand trial on charges of involvement in the fraud, the prosecutor’s office said on Tuesday. Thierry Herzog, Mr. Sarkozy’s lawyer, noted in a statement that the decision was signed by only one of the two judges investigating the case, a potential sign of uncertainty about the evidence. “The clear disagreement between the two magistrates in charge of the matter is such a rare event that it is worth underlining,” he said, “as it illustrates the inanity of the decision. ” Mr. Sarkozy tried a political comeback last year, steering his presidential primary campaign rightward and hoping that the French electorate would look past his legal entanglements. But he was knocked out of   presidential primaries in November. Mr. Fillon was recently embroiled in legal problems of his own, after revelations in the French news media that he used taxpayer money to put his wife and children on the payroll, ostensibly as parliamentary aides. The revelations are especially damaging for Mr. Fillon because he has portrayed himself as a virtuous politician, who, unlike his opponents  —   Mr. Sarkozy primarily  —   was untainted by legal scandals. “There is no point in talking about authority when you are not yourself irreproachable,” Mr. Fillon said in August during the primary campaign. “Who can imagine for a single moment General de Gaulle placed under formal investigation?” he added, a clear swipe against Mr. Sarkozy. Mr. Fillon has denied any wrongdoing and has vowed to stay in the presidential race, despite opinion polls showing that he is no longer the favorite and might not advance to the second round of the elections.",0
8071,Arctic’s Winter Sea Ice Drops to Its Lowest Recorded Level - The New York Times,"After a season that saw temperatures soar at the North Pole, the Arctic has less sea ice at winter’s end than ever before in nearly four decades of satellite measurements. The extent of ice cover  —   a record low for the third straight year  —   is another indicator of the effects of global warming on the Arctic, a region that is among the hardest hit by climate change, scientists said. “This is just another exclamation point on the overall loss of Arctic sea ice coverage that we’ve been seeing,” said Mark Serreze, the director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, a   research agency in Boulder, Colo. “We’re heading for summers with no sea ice coverage at all. ” Dr. Serreze said that such a situation, which would leave nothing but open ocean in summer until fall   begins, could occur by 2030, although many scientists say it may not happen for a decade or two after that. The melting of sea ice does not raise sea levels, but loss of ice coverage can disrupt ecosystems. For example, it can affect the timing of blooms of phytoplankton, the microscopic organisms at the bottom of the ocean food chain. Less ice coverage also means that there is more dark ocean to absorb more of the sun’s energy, which leads to more warming and melting in a feedback loop called Arctic amplification. The data center said on Wednesday that sea ice in the Arctic had reached maximum extent, of about 5. 5 million square miles, on March 7. That is an area nearly twice the size of Australia, but about 470, 000 square miles less than the average maximum from 1981 to 2010. Much of the ice also appears to be thinner than normal, Dr. Serreze said, another result of the unusually warm temperatures in the Arctic this winter. Late last fall, parts of the Arctic were more than 35 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than observed averages, and at the pole itself, mean temperatures for November were 23 degrees above normal. There were similar temperature spikes in December and this year. “The Arctic Ocean was extremely warm over the winter, and there was a very impressive series of heat waves,” Dr. Serreze said. “I’ve never seen anything like this before. ” Less coverage and thinner ice mean that this summer’s minimum, which is expected to occur in September, is likely to be low. But there is no direct link between the maximum in March and the minimum after the melting season, said Walt Meier, a research scientist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Cryospheric Sciences Laboratory. “Just because it’s a record low maximum, there’s no prediction it will be a record low minimum in September,” Dr. Meier said. “But while a lot can happen in the summer, when you start out at such a low level, you’re not going to get a very high minimum. ” Dr. Meier said that in addition to the low overall ice extent, some parts of the Arctic were almost completely devoid of ice this winter, including the Barents Sea off Norway and Russia. “We haven’t seen much there at all,” he said, “and what there is will melt very quickly. ”",0

TODDLERS have expanded into their spherical outdoor forms for the winter months.

Paediatrician Dr Carolyn Ryan said: “It’s a protection mechanism which both insulates them from the cold and prevents any injuries from slipping on ice. 
“Their stubby legs still protrude from the bottom so they can waddle along and their hands can still just about clutch a plastic dinosaur, but otherwise they’re perfect spheres until the onset of spring.”

8074,Strange Silence of Neo-Con Trolls as Mikheil Saakashvili Stabs His Patron Poroshenko in the Back,"Written by Mark Almond   The sudden resignation of Mikheil Saakashvili as Governor of Odessa and his accompanying tirade of accusations of corruption and treason against the Ukrainian President, Petro Poroshenko and his coterie in Kiev came as a bombshell for the Western media on 7th November. But it was a strangely bland bombshell. Yes, the voices of the West - the BBC, CNN, the New York Times, Wall St. Journal, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty – mentioned that the former Georgian President, who had been brought in to combat corruption in Ukraine’s key port and one of its major Russian-speaking cities, had resigned, even that he criticised his patron and old university chum, Poroshenko, for being on the take. But the reportage has been strangely opaque. Remember both Saakashvili and Poroshenko had been routinely characterised as the epitome of anti-corruption campaigners by Western neo-con voices whose echo-chamber is the supposedly liberal media, CNN, NBC in the USA and BBC and Channel Four News in the UK. No mention of Poroshenko’s past service to the “notoriously corrupt” regimes in Ukraine before 2014 is permitted, nor reference to his alleged business dealings with pariahs like Iran before he came on board for the regime-change of the decade in February, 2014. As for the reality that to most Georgians their ex-president, President, Mikheil Saakashvili, was the personification of a brutal, loud-mouthed demagogue that too was passed over in silence by those who boast that “they tell truth to power” from the editorial suites of Western newsrooms and newspapers. Saakashvili’s own people remember how it was exactly nine years ago on 7th November, 2007, that his Western equipped para-military police smashed demonstrations against him in Tbilisi with a mixture of high-tech ultra-low frequency disorientation weapons and swagger sticks and jackboots. The anniversary of Lenin’s seizure of power ninety-nine years ago has strange fascination for Saakashvili as his day for decisive coups. After his fall from power in Georgia four years ago, Saakashvili had become a kind of post-Communist Flying Dutchman albeit inverted. Abandoned by his Dutch wife after revelations of the crudest kind of tax-payer-funded infidelities, he roamed the West trying to find sanctuary. Even the USA quietly but firmly denied him a haven as revelations that underneath his glass-fronted police stations – much-vaunted in the Guardian and Transitions online as model reforms - secret dungeons housed torture and sexual abuse against his opponents have shattered his reputation at home and were known to insiders abroad. Saakashvili has of course embarrassed his US sponsors before by launching unilateral action without consulting them and getting full permission in advance. Remember how in August, 2008, he thought he could overrun South Ossetia before Russia could react and would earn the plaudits of the neo-cons in the West for his “courageous leadership”. Instead, he provoked a Russian backlash and the disintegration of his army. In a grand strategy worthy of Mussolini’s placement of his best troops in Ethiopia before invading Greece and Libya with badly equipped conscripts, Saakashvili had sent his 6,000 US-trained troops to do garrison duty in Iraq for his American sponsors when he decided to provoke Russia in 2008. The worthless adventure shattered Saakashvili’s value to the West less than a year after it had ignored his brutal suppression of opposition and had endorsed yet another rigged presidential election in his favour. Ousted by even some of his ex-cronies after 2012, it was his old university contemporary, Petro Poroshenko, who threw a lifeline to the ex-Georgian President and a slew of his ex-enforcers from Georgia. Rather as the old Soviet Communist Party had deployed loyal apparatchiks from outside each republic to enforce the Kremlin’s will on the multi-ethnic population of the USSR, so Washington now backed a strategy of parachuting outsiders from other ex-Soviet republics and of course the children of Nazi-era emigres from Ukraine itself into key positions to control the Ukrainian people themselves in case they took it into their heads to take democracy seriously. The Americans often overlooked the internal contradictions of this parody of Comintern tactics. Saakashvili was notoriously anti-Armenian in power in Georgia, when he bulldozed scores of ancient Armenian buildings in Tbilisi to make way for his Reichstag-look-alike presidential palace. So it wasn’t by chance that he got into a brawl with the ethnic Armenian interior minister of “independent” Ukraine last year. Saakashvili’s arrival in largely-Russian-speaking Odesa was a red rag to the locals. They resisted his attempt to massage local elections in favour of his preferred candidates for mayor and so on as he had done back home in Georgia. He denounced the opposition as corrupt but at best this was the pot calling the kettle black. Saakashvili’s own tarnished reputation went before him across the Black Sea even if seminars in Oxford or Harvard took his credentials as “Mr Clean” at face value. Now his wrestling match with the Ukrainian mafia and his attempt to impose his own Georgian clan in Odessa has come into the open. The publication of the Panama Papers was supposed to tarnish Vladimir Putin but in reality the dirt spewed out of Poroshenko for his murky Caribbean cash pile. Just as the revelation of David Cameron’s family ties to offshore accounts fatally undermined his standing in the run-up to the Brexit referendum. Poroshenko’s claims to represent Westernization for Ukraine were not without an ironic plausibility. Then to compound Poroshenko’s credibility gap as an anti-corruption campaigner, an MP of Soros-sponsored Afghan Communist background got a bill passed with American backing requiring politicians and officials to publish declarations of their wealth. The published amounts commonly enraged ordinary, poverty-stricken Ukrainians even if they were often a shadow of the real wealth stashed away by the representatives of the people. Having come to power by decrying Viktor Yanukovich’s alleged “orgy of corruption”, the Poroshenko crew looked odiously bloated with inexplicable wealth. Into the scandal stepped the unpopular, alien governor Odessa. Despite being appointed by the President, Saakashvili chose to denounce him personally for betraying the Ukrainian people, Western values and the anti-mafia crusade which Saakashvili claimed to personify. Western media express surprise at the ferocity of Saakashvili’s attacks on the integrity of his old university friend, Poroshenko, who had rescued him from exile and given him his new lease of political life in Odessa. Don’t these hacks remember how Saakashvili had been raised up by Georgia’s Eduard Shevardnadze, who became godfather to his protégé’s son, Eduard, while he was Minister of [In]Justice in that cruelly corrupt regime, before Saakashvili turned on his patron and ousted him in the so-called “Rose Revolution” in November, 2003? Now thirteen unlucky years later, Saakashvili has bitten the hand that fed him in Ukraine. Part of the Western media’s amnesia is of course that until yesterday both Saakashvili and Poroshenko were portrayed as model reformers, anti-corruption campaigners and so on. Suddenly, one paragon of civic virtue smears the other. CNN, BBC and Wall St. Journal can’t compute it. Clearly, no-one in the Central Information Agency had distributed the script in advance of this crisis – so unlike the well-signalled abandonment of a Western darling like Shevardnadze in 2003 or the preparations for the Maidan uprising in 2013-14. Then of course, the Amanpours et al. were on hand with the moniker and mood music to encapsulate the propaganda line. Yesterday’s hero was now a villain but forget about Shevardnadze or Kuchma, here comes an English-speaking motor-mouth spewing out all the New World Order guff about civil society, anti-corruption and, of course, Russophobia. The Saakashvili-Porodshenko spat not only casts a garish light on the sleazy reality of Western-backed regime change on either side of the Black Sea – Georgia as well as Ukraine – but more importantly it illustrates the dangerous tailspin into which the casual promotion of corrupt and unstable post-Soviet politicians as paragons of civic virtue has plunged Western policy in Eastern Europe. The recent uptick in sabre-rattling by NATO reflects the bankruptcy of the political options promoted by the Euro-Atlantic regime-changers. Having toppled and re-toppled post-Communist regimes, promoting and then pulling down successive corrupt and brutal “heroes of the street”, the West now faces the grim reality that its reputation is as tarnished by this sleazy process as much as its former local heroes. Maybe one of the youthful Najibullahs of Kiev will be pushed to fill the void. But don’t underrate the ability of Ukraine’s oligarchs to navigate the storms of post-Communist politics and never ending flow of embarrassing revelations of hypocrisy and corruption which the Dnieper can never wash away. Saakashvili has declared war in a most Hobbesian environment on the most powerful and odious characters in the country. Above all, he has denigrated the President of Ukraine himself whose authority cannot survive allowing his former protégé to abuse him with impunity. This cannot end well for both men. No-one should be surprised if Saakashvili and Poroshenko are suddenly reconciled, but any embrace of these two old comrades from the Komsomol can only follow Lenin’s dictum: put your arms around the enemy’s shoulders so you get your hands closer to his throat. Saakashvili may be counting on the Americans to save his bacon. He seems to have forgotten what President Sarkozy told him in August, 2008: “The Seventh Cavalry is not coming over the hill to rescue you.” Ultimately, even the global nation par excellence does not believe that a Georgian political clan can takeover Ukraine and rule it for Washington against the will of the Ukraine’s own mafias. Saakashvili’s impulsive detonation of this crisis might lead other Ukrainians to pose as champions of probity against Poroshenko, but the West’s international brigade of reformers who failed at home sent in to transform Ukraine have had their day. Some slink back home to the Baltic States or Chicago, but Saakashvili has no homeland anymore. With his Georgian citizenship revoked, and Tbilisi demanding his extradition for a host of alleged crimes in office from 2003 until 2012, Saakashvili has few places to run to. Remember the USA wouldn’t give him permanent residence which was why he jumped at the chance to serve Poroshenko’s bogus anti-corruption but very real anti-Russian drive in Odessa. With the boss-of-bosses’ backing in Kiev, Saakashvili could find himself facing extradition back to Georgia – or even to Russia which accused him of genocide for killing so many civilians in his madcap invasion of South Ossetia in August, 2008. The West can afford to throw away Saakashvili. Poroshenko and his prime minister, Groysman – godson of Poroshenko’s father – have been Washington’s key allies in Kiev. If they were to fall, or, if fearing Washington was about to push them, they jumped ship back to their old comrades in Moscow, the neo-cons’ house of cards in Eastern Europe could collapse. Maybe the strange silence of the West’s normally vocal media analysts about Saakashvili’s bombshell reflects their bewilderment that the best-laid plans for domination in the East are beginning to crumble like one of the stale cookies handed out in Kiev by that pin-up for regime-change, Victoria Neuland. After all the hullaballoo about Donald Trump being the cat’s paw of pro-Russian interests who had backed Viktor Yanukovich in the swirling crisis in Ukraine three years ago, that none of the hacks decrying his “hidden Kremlin links” have explained how Saaki and Porky Poroshenko fell out so spectacularly or what it means for Western grand strategy. Their silence is very revealing. Even Google’s Orwellian approach to news-management has rarely been so crude: the story was a bombshell, headlined with “live updates” – but not anymore. Amnesia not analysis is increasingly the Western media elite’s response to the crisis besetting its most cherished policies. Does this silence imply retreat or will the West lash out after Tuesday’s US Presidential election? Maybe Saakashvili’s tantrum will set the Seventh Cavalry in motion, not to rescue him today any more than in 2008, but to mask the failure of regime-change with open war in the East. Now that is something the Western media has been talking about a lot recently. Reprinted with permission from author's website . Related",0

8076,NYT: Trump Roars Again on Trade -- a Victory for White House Economic Nationalists,"Mark Landler writes in the New York Times that President Trump’s latest trade initiatives mark a return to the populist policies of the campaign and a victory for Steve Bannon and the economic nationalist wing of the Trump administration. [From the New York Times:  From Mr. Trump’s “buy American, hire American” rallying cry in Wisconsin this week to Vice President Mike Pence’s warnings to Japan and South Korea about the need to rewrite trade deals, the Trump administration is moving against free trade on multiple fronts. A senior White House official said there would be two   events a week for the next few weeks. “He’s manically focused on these trade issues,” said Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist. The flurry of activity amounts to a comeback by nationalists like Mr. Bannon, who views trade as crucial to Mr. Trump’s populist appeal but whose star has dimmed after clashes with   aides like Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s    and Gary D. Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs banker and lifelong Democrat who is head of the National Economic Council. The outcome of the debate between nationalists and globalists remains far from settled. Last week the globalists appeared to be winning when the administration decided not to formally designate China a currency manipulator, despite Mr. Trump’s vow to do so during the campaign. Mr. Trump also offered President Xi Jinping of China other concessions on his trade agenda in return for China’s help in curbing North Korea’s nuclear program. Read the rest here.",0

8078,Obama's Departure is One Reason to Feel Optimism for Trump's Arrival,"2016 elections by Danny Haiphong 
Fears of Trump should not obscure the fact that Barack Obama’s reign was a disaster. “Black America is in a worse condition than before, working class people as a whole have lost ground to a low-wage economy, and the world is closer to a World War III scenario than at any point prior.” The struggle continues, but “it is important to ensure that the protests against Trump are not allowed to be channeled back into the Democratic Party graveyard.” Obama's Departure is One Reason to Feel Optimism for Trump's Arrival by Danny Haiphong 
“Only gridlock saved Social Security and Medicare from being privatized during his Presidency.” 
Thousands have taken to the streets across the country to protest Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 elections. The protests have mainly centered on Trump's racism, sexism, and anti-LGBTQ rhetoric spewed during his campaign. Protesters have yet to wrestle with Trump's positions on foreign policy and trade that made him a pariah to the majority of the ruling class. The struggle against capitalism and imperialism in the US remains immature even in the midst of positive growth in the movement against police brutality and racism in recent years. While Trump's overt bigotry gives cause for protest, there is one benefit of the Trump moment that should not be understated. That benefit is the much needed conclusion of the Obama era. 
Democrats across the US are in a state of mourning over the departure of Obama. Democrats heralded Obama as the quintessential professional and consummate politician. His celebrity was peppered by the appearance of intelligence and rationality in the face of so-called Republican ""obstructionism."" Obama's rule was advertised as a victory for the Black Freedom movement. His Administration possessed a vast marketing apparatus that defended him as the lesser-evil alternative to the racist vitriol of the White Man's Republican Party. 
“Obama's rule was advertised as a victory for the Black Freedom movement.” 
Black Agenda Report was one of the few on the left that warned of the dangers of Obama in 2008. Once elected, Obama became virtually untouchable. Criticisms of his policies were condemned as racist and insensitive to the needs of Black America. The needs of Black America and the entire left for that matter suddenly became aligned with whatever Obama did. Obama moved forward to protect the banks, escalate war, and erect the largest national security state ever assembled. He instantly became the austerity President, waging a war of privatization on public education with the expressed plans to do the same to Social Security. Only gridlock saved Social Security and Medicare from being privatized during his Presidency. 
The full scope of Obama's legacy has been discussed in earlier issues and will not be analyzed here. What is important is that the left will no longer have Obama to defend its alignment with US imperialism. No longer will the left be able to fall back on the first Black President to sanitize his record. Obama's immigration policies deported nearly 3 million undocumented immigrants with little protest. His Administration painted itself as a friend of women and LGBTQ identified people despite the fact that his policy of proxy and drone warfare murdered tens of thousands of women and children in Yemen, Syria, Libya, and Honduras. 
“The left will no longer have Obama to defend its alignment with US imperialism.” 
Obama was able to conduct a greater assault on oppressed people than the prior Bush Administration, making him the most effective evil Wall Street could buy. Obama took over as President in a period where the US was mired in two unpopular occupations abroad and an economic crisis at home. These conditions prompted the ruling class to choose Obama as the required form of counterinsurgency necessary to crush resistance before it started. After making a number of promises to end ""dumb wars"" and institute a single payer healthcare system, Obama entered office ready to the bidding of the ruling class. Eight years later, Black America is in a worse condition than before, working class people as a whole have lost ground to a low-wage economy , and the world is closer to a World War III scenario than at any point prior. 
The massive protests to Trump's victory are in part a release of popular energy brought on by the departure of Obama. Unrest began with the formation of the Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter movements. However, neither of these movements articulated Obama's role in creating the conditions for social insurgency and movement. The 2016 elections changed the landscape dramatically. The Sanders and Trump campaigns set millions into motion in protest of the two-party establishment. Obama's departure will be another breath of fresh air into the internal rot of the imperialist system. It is thus important to ensure that the protests against Trump are not allowed to be channeled back into the Democratic Party graveyard. 
“After making a number of promises to end ""dumb wars"" and institute a single payer healthcare system, Obama entered office ready to the bidding of the ruling class.” 
Obama will leave Trump a set of conditions that he cannot possibly maintain without popular unrest. Obama departs office only inches from World War III with Russia and China. Poverty and wealth inequality worsened under his administration . Not even clever distortions of statistics could hide the large number of workers currently unemployed or underemployed in the low-wage economy. School closures, food stamp cuts, and bank bailouts have unleashed the neo-liberal wasteland that Trump spoke about in his campaign. 
It appears early on that the left has rejected the viability of Trump's calls to regulate the banks and renegotiate trade deals in favor of working people. Many have ignored Trump’s “populist” rhetoric and have focused all the energy of resistance on his white supremacist proposals to ban Muslims and deport millions of undocumented people. However, this moment is just as much about Obama's departure as it is Trump's arrival. The US imperialist system is facing multiple crises that relate directly back to the economic stagnation of global capitalism. It would be a mistake not to demand Trump stay true to his “populism” just as it was a mistake when the left failed to demand Obama stay true to his promises. Whatever the case, the departure of Obama is a welcome site, and the left should use the room afforded by it to wage an intensified effort to build the organizational basis for social revolution in our time.

8079,Can the Oligarchy Still Steal the Presidential Election?,"  
The election was set up to be stolen from Trump. That was the purpose of the polls rigged by overweighting Hillary supporters in the samples. After weeks of hearing poll results that Hillary was in the lead, the public would discount a theft claim. Electronic voting makes elections easy to steal, and I have posted explanations by election fraud experts of how it is done. 
Clearly the Oligarchy does not want Donald Trump in the White House as they are unsure that they could control him, and Hillary is their agent. 
With the reopening of the FBI investigation of Hillary and related scandals exploding all around her, election theft is not only more risky but also less likely to serve the Oligarchy’s own interests. 
Image as well as money is part of Oligarchic power. The image of America takes a big hit if the American people elect a president who is currently under felony investigation. 
Moreover, a President Hillary would be under investigation for years. With so much spotlight on her, she would not be able to serve the Oligarchy’s interests. She would be worthless to them, and, indeed, investigations that unearthed various connections between Hillary and oligarchs could damage the oligarchs. 
In other words, for the Oligarchy Hillary has moved from an asset to a liability. 
A Hillary presidency could put our country into chaos. I doubt the oligarchs are sufficiently stupid to think that once she is sworn in, Hillary can fire FBI Director Comey and shut down the investigation. The last president that tried that was Richard Nixon, and look where that got him. 
Moreover, the Republicans in the House and Senate would not stand for it. House Committee on oversight and Government Reform chairman Jason Chaffetz has already declared Hillary to be “a target-rich environment. Even before we get to day one, we’ve got two years worth of material already lined up.” House Speaker Paul Ryan said investigation will follow the evidence. 
If you were an oligarch, would you want your agent under this kind of scrutiny? If you were Hillary, would you want to be under this kind of pressure? 
What happens if the FBI recommends the indictment of the president? Even insouciant Americans would see the cover-up if the attorney general refused to prosecute the case. Americans would lose all confidence in the government. Chaos would rule. Chaos can be revolutionary, and that is not good for oligarchs. 
Moreover, if reports can be believed, salacious scandals appear to be waiting their time on stage. For example, last May Fox News reported: 
“Former President Bill Clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offender’s infamous jet than previously reported, with flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the “Lolita Express” — even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights, according to records obtained by FoxNews.com. 
“Clinton’s presence aboard Jeffrey Epstein’s Boeing 727 on 11 occasions has been reported, but flight logs show the number is more than double that, and trips between 2001 and 2003 included extended junkets around the world with Epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names, including “Tatiana.” The tricked-out jet earned its Nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls.” 
Fox News reports that Epstein served time in prison for “solicitation and procurement of minors for prostitution. He allegedly had a team of traffickers who procured girls as young as 12 to service his friends on ‘Orgy Island,’ an estate on Epstein’s 72-acre island, called Little St. James, in the U.S. Virgin Islands.” http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/05/13/flight-logs-show-bill-clinton-flew-on-sex-offenders-jet-much-more-than-previously-known.html Some Internet sites, the credibility of which is unknown to me, have linked Hillary to these flights. http://truepundit.com/breaking-bombshell-nypd-blows-whistle-on-new-hillary-emails-money-laundering-sex-crimes-with-children-child-exploitation-pay-to-play-perjury/ 
This kind of behavior seems reckless even for Bill and Hillary, who are accustomed to getting away with everything. Nevertheless, if you are an oligarch already worried about the reopened Hillary email case and additional FBI investigations, such as the one into the Clinton Foundation, and concerned about what else might emerge from the 650,000 emails on former US Rep. Weiner’s computer and the NYPD pedophile investigation, putting Hillary in the Oval Office doesn’t look like a good decision. 
At this point, I would think that the Oligarchy would prefer to steal the election for Trump, instead of from him, rather than allow insouciant Americans to destroy America’s reputation by choosing a person under felony investigations for president of the United States. 
Being the “exceptional nation” takes on new meaning when there is a criminal at the helm. (Reprinted from PaulCraigRoberts.org by permission of author or representative)",0

No surprise here. From Israels POV ,” what’s not to like” about her. She’s there biggest supporter. The darling of the neo-con warmongers. The favorite of both the Democrat and “Republican” establishment elites (hence McCain in the video). I did have to gag a little at the praise about her moral,principled,leadership qualities though. And especially with Peres talking about her knowing that “peace” required time to accomplish. The Israelis know a “thing or two” about the “time issue”.They’ve stalled any moves for peace for over 60 years already. And will for another 60 if they can. Reply - Share",0
8081,The Protocols of the Elders of Zion — Probably Wrote by the Rothschilds,"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion — Probably Wrote by the Rothschilds Lucifer Triumphant, Mankind Enslaved Many people think "" The Protocols of the Elders of Zion ... http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/the-protocols-of-elders-of-zion.html Lucifer Triumphant, Mankind Enslaved Many people think "" The Protocols of the Elders of Zion "" is anti Semitic ""hate literature"" and a fraud. Nobel Prize winner Alexander Solzhenitsyn wrote that the book exhibits ""the mind of genius."" This is pretty unusual for a fraud. Solzhenitsyn said it exhibits, ""great strength of thought and insight...Its design...(increasing freedom and liberalism, which is terminated in social cataclysm)...is well above the abilities of an ordinary mind...It is more complicated than a nuclear bomb."" I'm afraid Protocols may be genuine They are lectures addressed to Jewish Luciferians ( Illuminati , Freemasons ) detailing an incredible plan to overthrow western civilization, subjugate mankind, and concentrate, ""all the wealth of the world... in our hands."" The book , typical of similar Illuminati documents, was leaked to the Czarist Secret police and published in Russia in 1905. The issue of anti Semitism diverts attention from this plot which has been unfolding for over 200 years and is behind world government, September 11, Iraq, Homeland Security and the bogus ""War on Terror."" FAIT ACCOMPLI. The plotters control the world's wealth. Their multinational corporations have Freemason symbols for logos. Shell and Citibank have the rising sun; Exxon the double cross, CBS and Time Warner the eye of Horus; Alcan and AOL, the circle in the triangle. The mass media, education and politics all create an illusion of democracy in order to control and defraud humanity. The Great Seal of the United States reflects the unhappy truth. It is also a Freemason symbol and bears the inscription ""We have achieved New World Order ."" Almost all American Presidents including George W. Bush are Freemasons or Illuminati. Israel's Star of David (interlaced triangles) is the Masonic symbol for the double divinity, Adonai and Lucifer. The issue of anti Semitism is irrelevant because Jewish and non-Jewish Luciferians have intermarried. (See Milan Martin, Lucifer's Children p.74) The elite now consists of humanity-haters of all stripes. No wonder corruption is endemic. As the Greeks say, the fish rots from the head. ROTHSCHILD — Meyer Amschel Rothschild (1744-1812) played a key role in advancing this monstrous conspiracy. He was a follower of the occult Cabbalism (or Lucifer worship) that is the basis of Illuminism and Freemasonry. (See Albert Pike, Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry ) Researchers have speculated that Adam Weishaupt or Asher Ginzberg penned Protocols. I think it may have been Rothschild himself. I came to this conclusion after reading Protocols 20-23 , the ""financial program... the crowning and the decisive point of our plans."" These lectures require considerable knowledge of banking and finance. Moreover the author states that all power ultimately will reside in the ""King of the Jews,"" which is how Rothschild was known. THE SOURCE OF POWER The author makes clear that whoever creates money is sovereign. He ridicules the goyim kings for forfeiting this power and says he doesn't intend to repeat this mistake. ""When we come into our Kingdom,"" the government will change from being ""a payer of tribute by loan operations...into a lender at a profit."" ""This measure will stop the stagnation of money, parasitic profits, and idleness which were useful for us among the goyim so long as they were independent but are not desirable under our rule."" The Protocols is full of Talmudic contempt for non-Jews. ""How clear is the undeveloped power of thought of the purely brute brains of the goyim... What could have been simpler than to take the money they wanted from their own people? ""... We ""will put an end to those abuses to which we owe our mastery over the goyim, but which cannot be allowed in our Kingdom."" (I am using the L. Fry edition of The Protocols, entitled Waters Flowing Eastward, available from gsgbooks@mindspring.com) COMMUNISM, SOCIALISM, LIBERALISM, FEMINISM Similarly the bankers have financed intellectuals and politicians to promote a mania for, ""senseless utopian principles"" like ""collectivism,"" ""freedom of conscience, equality and the like."" They are designed to bring down the Old Order but will have no place in the New. ""We have set them on the hobbyhorse of an idea about the absorption of individuality by ... collectivism... ""They have never yet and they never will reflect that this hobbyhorse is a manifest violation of the most important law of nature, which has established from the very creation of the world one unit unlike another and precisely for the purpose of instituting individuality..."" ""The purely brute mind of the goyim is incapable of analysis and observation...Their eyes are open but see nothing before them..."" ""Everything in this world is in a state of submission... to what is stronger. And so shall we be this something stronger for the sake of good."" THE BOLSHEVIK REVOLUTION Estonian journalist Juri Lina has examined the recently opened Soviet archives and documented the connection between the Bolshevik Revolution and Jewish Illuminism in his book "" Under the Sign of the Scorpion ."" (1994) I will probably devote a separate column to this book. Suffice to say here that Communism was the outcome of the plan outlined in Protocols. No wonder this book was banned in the USSR on pain of death! Its informal ban in America is a measure of our condition. Karl Marx, Lenin and Trotsky, were all Jewish Freemasons, dysfunctional losers who were employed by the Illuminist bankers to hoodwink the masses. Lenin for example had been an unsuccessful lawyer who had only six cases in which he defended shoplifters. He lost all six cases. A week later he gave up the law to become a highly paid revolutionary. Lenin declared: ""Peace means quite simply the domination of Communism over the entire world."" His reign of terror caused nine million deaths but you never see him compared with Hitler. The secret police, the Cheka, dominated by Jews, published the names of 1.7 million people they murdered in 1918-1919, including 300,000 priests. ""A river of blood flowed through Russia,"" Lina writes. ""According to official Soviet Reports, 1,695,904 people were executed from January 1921 to April 1922. Among these victims were bishops, professors, doctors, officers, policemen, lawyers, civil servants, writers... Their crime was 'anti social thinking'"" CONCLUSION Jews will never understand anti Semitism until they realize it is not always based on irrational prejudice. In 1920, Winston Churchill made a distinction between national and ""International Jews."" He said the latter have been behind, ""a worldwide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilization and the reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development, of envious malevolence, and impossible equality... ""It played ... a part in the tragedy of the French Revolution. It has been the mainspring of every subversive movement during the Nineteenth Century; and now at last this band... have gripped the Russian people by the hair and have become practically the undisputed masters of that enormous empire."" ( Ref. ) Our culture, not The Protocols , is a fraud. Communist Jews set an example for the Nazis . Luciferians like Rothschild, Lenin and Hitler still control the planet and are determined to enslave humanity. I'm afraid that this will become increasingly evident. I pray I am wrong.

8082,None of Them Have Ever Been My President,"2016 presidential campaign by BAR executive editor Glen Ford 
Tens of thousands have demonstrated against the election of Donald Trump. Some are activists, continuing the struggle. Others are Democrats that are just “mad.” “The Black movement against police terror didn’t need a Donald Trump waiting in the vestibule of the White House to get “mad.” For those who fear Trump’s “fascism,” the threat level “depends on how he uses the arsenal of repressive tools bequeathed to him by the Obama administration.” None of Them Have Ever Been My President by BAR executive editor Glen Ford 
“You can’t scare people with a specter if they have already been in combat with the real thing.” 
As a revolutionary Black nationalist whose socialism predates my facial hairs, I have no problem saying Donald Trump is not my president. Neither is the current occupant of the White House, nor were any of the Democrats, Republicans and Whigs that preceded him. 
On a chilly November day in 2009 a newly-created coalition, of which I was a co-founder, marched on the White House to denounce and renounce Barack Obama as a tool of white supremacy and the imperial war machine. “Obama, Obama, you can’t hide – We charge you with genocide,” we shouted, indicting the First Black President for the crimes he was busily committing in service to his masters on Wall Street. The Black is Back Coalition for Social Justice, Peace and Reparations had been formed less than two months before, largely to demonstrate that not all Black people were bamboozled by the slick corporate politician from Chicago, elected one year earlier in the nation’s first billion dollar presidential campaign. As the Coalition’s founding press release stated : 
“Black and Brown people continue to suffer the brunt of un/under-employment and predatory loan scandal crises. Military spending under Obama has increased as have the warfare this nation continues to export to Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Venezuela and Colombia. Mass incarceration, police brutality and political imprisonment remain rampant...” 
The Black is Back Coalition warned of the “traps set by Obama’s so-called ‘post-racial’ politics that perpetuates the same oppressive militarist agenda well known during the Bush regime.” 
To paraphrase Fidel Castro, history has vindicated us. 
“Obama joined George Bush and Bill Clinton in perpetuating the 20 year-long slaughter in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has claimed more than six million lives.” 
Obama mobilized NATO air forces and jihadist proxies to destroy Libya, which had previously enjoyed the highest living standard in Africa. He redeployed these same al Qaida terrorists to Syria, killing 400,000 people, displacing half the surviving population and bringing the U.S. to the very brink of nuclear war with Russia. This so-called “Son of Africa” has effectively occupied most of the continent through a U.S. Military Command (AFRICOM) that was less than a year old when Obama was sworn into office. The African Union provides diplomatic cover for the CIA-run “peace keeping” mission in Somalia, while U.S. conventional forces have infiltrated the militaries of all but two African nations. The holdouts, Eritrea and Zimbabwe, are under constant threat of regime change. Obama joined George Bush and Bill Clinton in perpetuating the 20 year-long slaughter in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has claimed more than six million lives, the worst genocide since World War Two (“Obama, Obama, you can’t hide, We charge you with genocide!”) 
With the eager assistance of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Obama baldly abetted a Nazi-spearheaded coup against the elected government in Ukraine -- and then blamed Moscow when Russian-speaking Ukrainians resisted, provoking a “New Cold War” that could turn hot in an instant. At the same time, Obama “pivoted” to militarily confront China, whose economy is already, by some measures, larger than the U.S. The jihadist war in Syria should also be seen as a theater of imperialism’s last ditch offensive to encircle “Eurasia” in hopes of preserving U.S.-based multinational corporate domination of a “rigged” system of dollar-based world trade. 
Just as the Black is Back Coalition warned, Barack Obama was the Black face of imperialism -- a change of color without a difference. He tried to hand off the controls to Hillary Clinton, who got six million votes less than he did, and lost. 
Back in 2007, when Obama and Clinton were pretending to be ideological opponents -- as cookie-cutter corporate Democrats often do -- we at Black Agenda Report wrote that “ There’s not a dime’s worth of difference ” between the two. Every decent, peace-loving person on Earth should be glad to be rid of both of them. Humanity would probably not survive another year of either one. 
“Barack Obama was the Black face of imperialism -- a change of color without a difference.” 
Donald Trump is also a danger to humanity, like every other U.S. chief executive since Truman nuked Hiroshima and Nagasaki. If words mean anything, Trump starts off posing less of a doomsday international menace, since he claims to want to establish talking, rather than shouting, threatening, nuke-rattling relations with Russia and China, while Clinton’s version of “reset” was an armed confrontation with Russia over the skies of Syria. Of course, all that could quickly change. Trump may be a “party of one” among Republicans in Congress and even in his own cabinet. 
For those who fear Trump’s “fascism,” the threat level depends on how he uses the arsenal of repressive tools bequeathed to him by the Obama administration. These legal, infrastructural and technological instruments of the national security state are fascist in their intent; they were made for the purpose of tracking, disorganizing, neutralizing and locking up dissidents, and disinforming the public at large. Thus, President Obama and his predecessors were fascist- minded , whether you call their administrations operatively fascist or not. The Obama administration would not have pushed a bill through Congress allowing the U.S. military to detain American citizens without trial or charge if he had not anticipating using it. He would not have feverishly upgraded an omnipresent national and global surveillance apparatus if he did not anticipate putting it to the task of martial rule. Fascist-minded is all that can be said of Trump, at this point, as well. 
Black Lives Matter activists have been under FBI surveillance since day one. Ever since Ferguson, the federal government has taken the lead in over-charging “rioters” in rebellious cities. New York City cops have used social media surveillance as the basis for conspiracy charges against groups of more than 100 young Black people in separate sweeps in Manhattan and The Bronx. The “fascism” that correctly described Jim Crow rule in the pre-Civil Rights South lives on at the core of the mass Black incarceration regime put in place with the crushing of the Black Liberation Movement, two generations ago. The current movement against police terror, which ultimately demands Black community control of the police, put activists in direct confrontation with the coercive arm of the State. There is no retreat from this response to the demands of Black people “on the street,” who bear the daily brunt of repression and are also among the most effective organizers. 
“Obama would not have feverishly upgraded an omnipresent national and global surveillance apparatus if he did not anticipate putting it to the task of martial rule.” 
The Black movement against police terror didn’t need a Donald Trump waiting in the vestibule of the White House to get “mad.” The movement has already crossed the Rubicon of confrontation with the State. The moment occurred in the second term of the First Black President, when a new generation learned that liberation cannot be vicariously experienced. The 21 st century Black movement emerged with the knowledge that Black corporate Democrats are not their allies, nor are Black police chiefs, or Black preachers whose real loyalties are to the Democratic Party and its Wall Street patrons. 
If the Black movement were afraid of the likes of Donald Trump, it never would have gone up against the militarized police that occupy Black communities. You can’t scare people with a specter if they have already been in combat with the real thing. 
To the extent that electoral activity is useful to the movement, it should be employed with special vigilance close at hand, against misleaders like the 32 members of the Congressional Black Caucus who failed to support the Grayson Amendment that would have halted Pentagon transfers of weapons and equipment to local police departments. These “ Treasonous 32 ”, comprising 80 percent of full-voting Black Democrats in the House, cast their shameful votes in June, 2014, just two months before Michael Brown was shot down in Ferguson, Missouri. (Rep. William “Lacy” Clay, representing Michael Brown’s district, was among the 32.) If the movement is to have any special targets for electoral vengeance, it is these homegrown enemies, who turn Black people’s votes against themselves. 
Trump or no Trump, the Black movement must continue to press and refine its demands -- or Power will concede nothing. On November 6, after their annual march on the White House, the organizations of the Black is Back Coalition ratified a 19-point document that puts self-determination at the heart of the broadest range of issues confronting Black America: “Every central demand, every strategy of struggle, must be formulated with the goal of self-determination in mind. Otherwise, the movement will allow itself to be drowned in reformist schemes and projects that bind Black people even more tightly to structures of outside control.” The points range from “Black Community Control of Police,” to “Halting Gentrification,” to “Nationalization of the Banks.” 
The points were compiled during Barack Obama’s time in the White House, and they will remain relevant under a President Donald Trump.

8083,PressTV-'I can't punch Trump now he's president',"Politics US actor Robert De Niro (Photo by AFP) 
Hollywood actor Robert De Niro, who had criticized Americans for putting an “idiot” like Donald Trump in a position where he might become the US president, now says he respects him because he is the president-elect of the United States. 
Before the November 8 presidential election, De Niro had been enlisted along with several other actors to speak in a non-partisan video encouraging Americans to vote in. But the 73-year-old actor defied script and delivered a scathing rebuke of Trump. 
“He's so blatantly stupid. He's a punk, he's a dog, he's a pig [...] a mutt who [...] doesn't do his homework, doesn't care. He's an idiot. Colin Powell said it best: He's a national disaster. He's an embarrassment to this country,” the Raging Bull actor said. 
“It makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this fool, this bozo, has wound up where he has,” he stated. 
“He talks how he wants to punch people in the face? Well, I'd like to punch him in the face,” De Niro said. 
But after the Republican presidential nominee was declared the 45th president-elect on Wednesday, De Niro clarified that he would no longer like to punch Trump because the man was elected to the highest seat in political office. 
The veteran actor, however, told Jimmy Kimmel on his late-night show on ABC News that he is “not feeling good” after Trump’s victory, which caused protests and student walkouts across the country. 
Protesters on Wednesday slammed Trump’s divisive campaign rhetoric against immigrants, refugees, Muslims and ethnic minorities. 
De Niro said he has to respect Trump because of his new position - which means no punching. 
“Are you still going to punch Donald Trump in the face?” Kimmel asked the actor, “because you could now get arrested for that, I think."" 
“I can’t do that now, he’s the President,” replied De Niro. “And I have to respect that position, although we all know what he… We have to see what he’s gonna do and how he’s really gonna follow through on certain things. As we can see now in a lot of cities, a lot of people are getting very upset and protesting.” 
Many renowned figures, including some heads of states and other high-ranking officials, had publicly denounced Trump -- some even used abusive language against him -- in the run-up to the November 8 presidential election. But several of them have now softened their stance and some even sent messages of congratulations to the president-elect. Loading ...",0
8084,4 New Polls Suggest That Republicans Are On The Cusp Of A Total Election Disaster,"According to Quinnipiac University : Four-way races which list both presidential and vice-presidential candidates, except Georgia and North Carolina, where Green Party candidate Jill Stein is not on the ballot, show: 
Georgia: Trump at 44 percent to Clinton’s 43 percent, with 8 percent for Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson. This compares to a 47 – 40 percent Trump lead September 22; 
Iowa: A 44 – 44 percent Clinton-Trump tie, with 4 percent for Johnson and 1 percent for Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Trump led Clinton 44 – 37 percent September 22; 
North Carolina: Clinton edges Trump 47 – 43 percent, with 5 percent for Johnson. On October 3, Clinton had 46 percent to Trump’s 43 percent; 
Virginia: Clinton tops Trump 50 – 38 percent, with 4 percent for Johnson and 2 percent for Stein. Clinton was up 45 – 39 percent September 22. 
Contrary to some Republican hopes, Donald Trump’s slide has not stopped. Trump continues to lose support with men in Iowa and Georgia. North Carolina appears to be slipping away from Trump, and the Republican nominee has blown his leads in Iowa and Georgia. 
The Trump campaign has gone as far as to admit that if they lose Florida, they will lose the election, but the signs are evident in the polling that the Republican Party is much closer to experiencing a landslide than they are to winning the White House in November. 
A Trump landslide defeat could trigger a disaster for Republicans that leads to additional Democratic Senate pickups beyond the four seats needed to take back the majority. Republicans could see their current record House majority gutted in a Clinton landslide. 
The election is not getting better for Republicans. The landscape is getting worse. If this polling continues for another week at the state level, Democrats could be looking at their best case scenario of a Democratic White House, House and Senate being in play.",0

8086,Freedom Rider: Russophobia: War Party Propaganda,"Tweet Widget b y BAR editor and senior columnist Margaret Kimberley 
The world’s most reactionary regime, the head-chopping, terror-sponsoring Saudi Arabian kleptocracy, was awarded the chair of the UN Human Rights Council, while Russia has been kicked out. The travesty was engineered by the Superpower of Lies to punish Moscow for resisting the U.S.-led war of sectarian massacre and regime change in Syria. The War Party is on the march, to the cheers of corporate media – and Hillary hasn’t even been elected yet. Freedom Rider : Russophobia: War Party Propaganda b y BAR editor and senior columnist Margaret Kimberley 
“ All attempts to stop the fighting were rejected by the U.S. and NATO and sealed the fate of the Syrian people.” 
Did Russia invade Iraq and kill one million people? Does Russia have a greater percentage of its population behind bars than any other country in the world? Did Russia occupy Haiti after kidnapping its president? Are Russian police allowed to shoot children to death without fear of repercussion? Is Russia entering its 20 th year of a terror war against the people of Somalia? All of these crimes take place in or at the direction of the United States. Yet the full force of propaganda and influence on world opinion is directed against Russia, which whatever its shortcomings cannot hold a candle to America in violating human rights. 
The dangers presented by a Hillary Clinton presidency cannot be overstated. She and the war party have been steadily working towards a goal that defies logic and risks all life on earth. Regime change is once again their modus operandi and they hope to make it a reality against Russia. 
Nearly every claim of Russian evil doing is a lie, a ruse meant to put Americans in a fighting mood and lose their fear of nuclear conflagration. It isn’t clear if Clinton and the rest of the would-be warriors actually realize they are risking mushroom clouds. Perhaps they believe that Vladimir Putin will be easily pushed around when all evidence points to the contrary. 
“ Regime change is once again their modus operandi and they hope to make it a reality against Russia.” 
The unproven allegations of interference in the presidential election and casting blame on Russia as the sole cause of suffering in Syria are meant to desensitize the public. It is an age old ploy which makes war not just acceptable but deemed a necessity. The usual suspects are helping out eagerly. The corporate media, led by newspapers like the New York Times and Washington Post , are front and center in pushing tales of Russian villainy. Human Rights Watch and other organizations who care nothing about abuses committed by the United States and its allies are also playing their usual role of choosing the next regime change victim. 
Russia lost its seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council in part because of American pressure and public relations assistance from the human rights industrial complex. The UNHRC is now chaired by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy that funds the jihadist terrorist groups who caused 500,000 Syrian deaths. The Saudis are causing dislocation, death and starvation in Yemen, too, but they are American allies, so there is little opposition to their misdeeds. 
The openly bigoted Donald Trump has been the perfect foil for Hillary Clinton. That is why she and the rest of the Democratic Party leadership preferred him as their rival. He made the case for the discredited lesser evilism argument and his sensible statements about avoiding enmity with Russia made him even more useful. 
“ Newspapers like the New York Times and Washington Post, are front and center in pushing tales of Russian villainy.” 
The United States and its allies are the cause of Syria’s destruction. Their effort to overthrow president Assad created a humanitarian disaster complete with ISIS and al Nusra fighters who love to chop off heads for entertainment. Far from being the cause of the catastrophe Russia left its ally to fight alone for four years. They even made overtures to negotiate Assad’s fate with the United States. All attempts to stop the fighting were rejected by the U.S. and NATO and sealed the fate of the Syrian people. The people of east Aleppo are being shelled by American allies but one wouldn’t know that by reading what passes for journalism in newspapers and on television. The American role in the slaughter is barely mentioned or is excused as an effort to protect the civilian population. The bloodshed was made in the U.S. and could end if this government wanted it to. 
The anti-Russian propaganda effort has worked to perfection. NATO is massing troops on Russia’s borders in a clear provocation yet Putin is labeled the bad guy. He is said to be menacing the countries that join in threatening his nation. The United States makes phony claims of Russian war crimes despite having blood on its hands. The latest Human Rights Watch canards about prosecuting Assad come straight from the White House and State Department and have nothing to do with concern for Syrians living in their fifth year of hell. 
“Donald Trump has been the perfect foil for Hillary Clinton.” 
There is no lesser evil between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. She is fully supported by the war party in her desire for a more “muscular” foreign policy. That bizarre term means death and starvation for millions more people if Clinton wins in a landslide. She must be denied a victory of that magnitude and any opportunity to claim a mandate. Peace loving people must give their votes to the Green Party ticket of Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka. They are alone in rejecting the premise of an imperialist country and its endless wars. 
The United States is the most dangerous country in the world. If it has a reckless and war loving president the threat becomes existential. That is the prospect we face with a Hillary Clinton presidency. If the role of villain is cast on the world stage she is the star of the show.

8087,"Corn Pone, Rebooted: Country’s New Humor - The New York Times","NASHVILLE  —   “The Bobby Bones Show” is the biggest thing in country radio, on nearly 100 stations five mornings a week, and its ringleader, Mr. Bones, 36, likes to take credit for hastening the breakthroughs of a number of acts. Lately, he’s been shining a light on a trend that he helped cultivate  —   a resurgence of humor in country music, which has made modest hits of albums that let mainstream and alternative country fans feel as if they’re in on the joke. For one week in February, “Redneck ____” by Wheeler Walker Jr. a provocative creation of the comedian Ben Hoffman, was both the No. 1 comedy album and the No. 9 country album. Granger Smith’s “Remington” arrived a month later, featuring jokey numbers by his outsized alter ego, Earl Dibbles Jr. And Mr. Bones’s own band, the Raging Idiots, a jocular duo that also features his show producer Eddie Garcia, recently released its first   album, “The Critics Give It Five Stars,” which not only made its debut atop Billboard’s comedy albums chart but landed at No. 4 on the country chart. Country music has never been devoid of comedy: The Grand Ole Opry once featured the winking, rustic humor of Minnie Pearl, Grandpa Jones and Stringbean the Statler Brothers cultivated the rube alter egos Lester Roadhog Moran  the Cadillac Cowboys and Alan Jackson cast the comic Jeff Foxworthy in a music video. But at least from an outside perspective, the flirtatious party jams dominating the format in recent years seemed to repel humor. Now country is generating new, knowing ways of poking fun at itself in song. Mike Dungan, the chairman and chief executive of Universal Music Group Nashville, noted that every country songwriting era has had wits like Roger Miller and Tom T. Hall. Brad Paisley has parlayed his drollness into a   gig as a host of the Country Music Association Awards and a new one as M. C. for the Wild West Comedy Festival in Nashville. “I think it’s always been there,” Mr. Dungan said. “However, I do believe that in tough times, people want to feel better. I think these types of songs are a really great   to what’s going on in your life. ” Mr. Smith, 36, enlarged his audience by capitalizing on the contrast between Granger Smith, a country centrist with a temperate, conversational vocal style, and Earl Dibbles Jr. who packs his bottom lip with tobacco and spins vigorous, nonsensical yarns. The Dibbles persona struck viral gold with a string of YouTube videos. In gentle selections like “Tractor” and “Tailgate Town,” Mr. Smith sentimentalizes sturdy agrarian values. “That’s probably the real Granger, if you will,” he said. The deliberate exaggeration of the Dibbles material is best exemplified by “’Merica,” with its   combination of Mötley   riffs, banjo rolls and absurd patriotic bluster: “We’re    undefeated world war   take a cup, raise it up for my Uncle Sam. ” Mr. Bones’s fans have come to expect a similarly affectionate strain of irreverence. Growing up in rural Arkansas, he enjoyed the downhome clowning of Jerry Clower and Ray Stevens, but also liked Adam Sandler’s sophomoric ditties. On the Raging Idiots album, he accentuated his own vocal limitations with guest performances from Carrie Underwood and Mr. Paisley. “I don’t want people to think I’m trying to win best male vocalist at the C. M. A. s,” Mr. Bones said, referring to the Country Music Association Awards. “I can sing just good enough to be funny. ” After spending the first decade of his career in other radio formats and doing   comedy on the side, Mr. Bones’s shift to anchoring a Nashville country station generated some skepticism. He and his   crew broke with the customary respectful strolls through   talking points. “People didn’t want to do the show, because they didn’t know what I would ask,” he said. Occasionally, Mr. Bones would encourage musicians to participate in daft parodies of their hits Florida Georgia Line and Dierks Bentley were among the many acts that obliged. As the show’s ratings surged, Mr. Garcia and Mr. Bones brought their musical act to charity events. “We said if we hit a million bucks, we’d try to do a comedy record,” Mr. Bones said. They raised well past that. Wheeler Walker Jr. who draws an entirely different audience, has an origin story that positions him as a    outsider. To hear him tell it, he’s been chewed up and spat out by every label in Nashville, ultimately recording a batch of obscene   and Southern rock numbers, the lyrics of each and every one unprintable. “Some of them, this is just me spouting off bad words,” he said, “but sometimes I use my brain a little bit more. ” (The character borrows choice autobiographical details  —   like hailing from Kentucky  —   from his creator, Mr. Hoffman, 41, who had a Comedy Central sketch show.) Having Dave Cobb, the Academy of Country Music’s 2016 Producer of the Year, produce “Redneck ____” lent the project weight. Still, it required an unorthodox marketing plan, including partnering with a pornography site to preview the music. Wheeler Walker Jr. who gives interview in character, credited the album’s theatrical bravado to his “  aggression. ” When he recorded it, he said, he was fed up with “my love life, my work life, my family life, and I just let it all out. “A lot of people are having those problems too,” he continued, “and they can listen to my album and it kind of gets it all out of their system. If you’ve got those problems, Florida Georgia Line ain’t gonna help,” he added, referring to the duo who epitomize the “bro country” trend. By far the wittiest critique of bro country came from female voices striving for a mainstream hearing in 2014, when the   duo Maddie  Tae teasingly inverted bro country tropes with their debut single, “Girl in a Country Song. ” “I think that’s what made the whole song, was the humor,” Maddie Marlow said. “We didn’t want people to think, ‘Oh, they’re just whining.’ We want our point to get across, but also we want people to have fun and relate to it and laugh too. ” These days, cheekiness like Maddie  Tae’s  —   which resurfaced in their singles “Shut Up and Fish” and “Sierra”  —   is much more common in country than outright comedy is. Luke Bryan is not only country’s most popular entertainer but its biggest target for impersonations by other artists, thanks to his   grin and dance moves that play up the silly side of his sex appeal. “He recognizes that as part of what he does, he’s going to draw a little bit of jabbing here and there,” Mr. Dungan said. “Yes, there is a smile to almost everything he does, and I think that’s why he resonates so well. ” The Raging Idiots have a bit called “Fake Luke Bryan,” in which Mr. Garcia apes Mr. Bryan’s unflagging enthusiasm and glottal delivery. But Mr. Bones brushed off the notion that they would have sought the star’s blessing before recording the shtick: “I’ve worked in alternative and pop and sports and  . This is by far the nicest,      format I’ve been in. ”",0
8088,Mississippi Law Protecting Opponents of Gay Marriage Is Blocked - The New York Times,"A federal judge blocked  —   shortly before it was to take effect  —   a Mississippi law that would have given special protections to those who opposed   marriage. In a   ruling, Judge Carlton W. Reeves of Federal District Court said the law created “a vehicle for   discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. ” By setting aside particular beliefs for protection as opposed to religious convictions in general, the law unconstitutionally “put its thumb on the scale to favor some religious beliefs over others. ” He concluded by issuing a preliminary injunction preventing the law from taking effect. Rob McDuff, a lawyer who argued against the law along with the Mississippi Center for Justice, said in a statement that “the federal court’s decision recognizes that religious freedom can be preserved along with equal rights for all people regardless of race, religion, or sexual orientation. ” Some of Mississippi’s political leaders, who had staunchly defended the law, pledged to appeal. “The law simply provides religious accommodations granted by many other states and federal law,” Gov. Phil Bryant, a Republican, said in a statement. “I am disappointed Judge Reeves did not recognize that reality. I look forward to an aggressive appeal. ” But not all the officials who were named defendants in the lawsuits agreed. Jim Hood, the state attorney general, a Democrat, said in a statement he would have to “think long and hard about spending taxpayer money” on an appeal, given the likely costs and the strength of the ruling. He said “the churchgoing public was duped” into believing that the law protected religious freedoms. “I hate to see politicians continue to prey on people who pray, go to church, follow the law and help their fellow man. ” Though state legislatures across the country considered laws this year to explicitly protect those who object to   marriage, Mississippi’s law, known as H. B. 1523, was the most definitive one to pass, according to the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group. The measure, which would have taken effect at 12:01 a. m. on Friday, is not a version of a traditional religious freedom act, which gives legal backing to those who argue that a given law infringes on their beliefs. Mississippi already has such a law on the books. Instead, it would create an array of protections specifically for those who believe that marriage is only for   couples, that sexual relations are reserved for marriage and that gender identity is determined immutably by anatomy at birth. Under the law, those who act according to these beliefs in foster care, counseling, school administration, facility rentals and wedding services would have been fully shielded from a host of potential government actions involving such things as hiring or firing decisions, fees or the issuing of state contracts. The law would have also allowed court clerks to refuse to grant wedding licenses to   couples as long as accommodations were made for the applicants to receive their licenses anyway. Judge Reeves struck down that element in a separate ruling on Monday, saying that while state officials were free to disagree, the Supreme Court ruling on   marriage is the law of the land. In a footnote in his ruling on Thursday night  —   Judge Reeves, who was appointed by President Obama and is the second   federal judge in Mississippi  —   compared Mr. Bryant’s remarks on a state’s “right to  ” when it comes to gay marriage to former Gov. Ross Barnett’s 1962 speech before the Legislature in which he invoked states’ rights to oppose the integration of the University of Mississippi. Mississippi’s law was condemned by civil rights activists, business groups and a number of the state’s mayors, particularly along the   Gulf Coast. But given its lack of Fortune 500 headquarters and its uncontested conservative political landscape, Mississippi did not face the same broad backlash as North Carolina did after passing a law restricting bathroom access for transgender people. There have been multiple legal challenges with a wide array of plaintiffs: gay and straight, transgender and not. Lawyers in the case, which arose from suits filed by the Mississippi Center for Justice and the Campaign for Southern Equality, argued that the law was motivated by animus toward gay and transgender people and that it unconstitutionally endorsed and provided exclusive protection for “certain narrow religious beliefs. ” Lawyers for the state responded that the law did not affect the rights of gay or transgender people and that it would not favor a particular religious doctrine any more than conscientious objector laws do. “Protection of free conscience and the free exercise of religion are legitimate and compelling governmental interests,” lawyers for the state said in a motion. It is reasonable to protect the convictions outlined in the law, they continued, “even though plaintiffs disagree with those beliefs and find them ‘offensive.’ ” But Judge Reeves countered that there were already laws in Mississippi that protect religious beliefs from government interference. The difference, he said, is that those laws protect all beliefs and not specific ones, which the judge ruled would violate the First Amendment’s establishment clause. “If three specific beliefs are ‘protected by this act,’ it follows that every other religious belief a citizen holds is not protected by the act,” he wrote, saying that Christians who hold different views would “become   Christians” in Mississippi. Judge Reeves also said the law would establish “a   system by which L. G. B. T. persons and unmarried persons can be subjected to differential treatment based solely on their status. ”",0

8090,"The President Has Much Power Over Immigration, but How Much? - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   President Trump’s executive order on immigration has prompted a constitutional showdown that could leave a mark on the law for generations and seems likely to end in a landmark Supreme Court decision. A ruling by the court on Mr. Trump’s travel ban on seven predominantly Muslim countries could help answer some crucial legal questions: How much independent constitutional authority does the president have over immigration, and how much power has Congress given him? The likely answer to both questions: a lot. But other parts of the Constitution may temper or defeat that power. Among them are the due process and equal protection clauses and the First Amendment’s ban on government establishment of religion. Here is a look at the leading arguments in the case. Many trial judges around the country have blocked aspects of Mr. Trump’s executive order. But none have issued an order as broad as the one by Judge James Robart, a federal judge in Seattle, who blocked the key parts of  the executive order, which had suspended travel from the seven countries and limited the nation’s refugee program. The case is now before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco. That court on Saturday declined to issue an immediate stay of Judge Robart’s order, but it indicated that it would weigh in soon after additional briefs were filed, with the last one due Monday afternoon. After it rules, an appeal to the Supreme Court seems likely. Judge Robart’s brisk ruling contained almost no reasoning. By contrast, Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton, of the Federal District Court in Boston, issued a   decision on Friday refusing to block the program and discussing the legal arguments in detail. Judge Gorton also sketched out the broader picture. “The rich immigrant history of the United States has long been a source of strength and pride in this country,” Judge Gorton wrote. “Conversely, the public interest in safety and security in this   dangerous world is strong as well. ” The balance, he wrote, tipped in favor of Mr. Trump. Article II of the Constitution confers authority on the president, the Supreme Court has said, to conduct foreign affairs and address immigration. In their brief to Judge Robart, lawyers for Washington State, one of the two plaintiffs, along with the State of Minnesota, said there were constitutional checks on these powers. “While courts generally give more latitude to the political branches in the immigration context, this does not mean that the political branches can act with impunity,” the brief said. “Federal courts,” the brief said, “have no more sacred role than protecting marginalized groups against irrational, discriminatory conduct. ” In the Ninth Circuit, the Trump administration said judges were   to decide cases involving national security. “Unlike the president,” the administration’s brief said, “courts do not have access to classified information about the threat posed by terrorist organizations operating in particular nations, the efforts of those organizations to infiltrate the United States, or gaps in the vetting process. ” Noah G. Purcell, the solicitor general of Washington State, appeared to concede in court that there were areas in which Mr. Trump was entitled to act. But he asked the court to protect people whose lives had been changed by Mr. Trump’s order in a flash. “The focus of our claim,” he said, “is on people who have been here and have, overnight, lost the right to travel, lost the right to visit their families, lost the right to go perform research, lost the right to go speak at conferences around the world. And also people who had lived here for a long time and happened to be overseas at the time of this order, which came with no warning whatsoever, and suddenly lost the right to return to the United States. ” On Friday, defending Mr. Trump’s executive order in a Seattle courtroom, Michelle Bennett, a Justice Department lawyer, cited Youngstown Sheet  Tube Co. v. Sawyer, a 1952 decision in which the Supreme Court rejected President Harry S. Truman’s assertion that he had the authority to seize steel mills during the Korean War. The most famous part of the decision is a concurrence from Justice Robert H. Jackson, which set out a framework for considering clashes between presidential power and congressional authority. The president has the most power when he acts with congressional authorization, Justice Jackson said, and an intermediate amount when Congress is silent. The president’s power is at its “lowest ebb,” Justice Jackson wrote, when Congress has forbidden a particular action. Truman’s actions fell into the third category, Justice Jackson wrote. Ms. Bennett, by contrast, said Mr. Trump’s order was in the first category. “Here we have the president acting pursuant to power that Congress gave him, which means, under the Youngstown steel seizure case, he’s acting at the apex of his power,” she said. A key part of immigration law does give the president broad power. It says, “Whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. ” But another part of the law forbids discrimination “because of the person’s race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence,” but only “in the issuance of an immigrant visa. ” The Trump administration argues that the power to bar entry, the subject of the first law, is broader than the limits on issuing visas. Lawyers for Washington State have said that the executive order violates the First Amendment’s prohibition against government establishment of religion because its provisions on the refugee program favor minority religions. “President Trump and his advisers have made clear that the very purpose of this order is to tilt the scales in favor of Christian refugees at the expense of Muslims,” they wrote in their brief to Judge Robart. The Trump administration urged the Ninth Circuit to reject arguments based on religious discrimination, even though Mr. Trump has said he meant to favor Christian refugees. Judicial consideration of the president’s motives, the brief said, would violate the separation of powers. “The more searching inquiry envisioned by the states would create substantial    problems, by permitting probing of the president’s subjective motive in issuing the order,” the brief said. The states challenging the order face the initial hurdle of demonstrating that they have suffered the sort of direct and concrete harm that gives them standing to sue. Judge Robart ruled that they did, relying on a decision from the federal appeals court in New Orleans, which said Texas could sue to challenge President Barack Obama’s plan to defer the deportation of millions of unauthorized immigrants and allow them to work. “The executive order adversely affects the states’ residents in areas of employment, education, business, family relations and freedom to travel,” Judge Robart wrote. He said the states had been hurt because the order affected their public universities and their tax bases. In its Ninth Circuit brief, the Trump administration called the states’ asserted injuries “attenuated and speculative” and did not address the Texas decision. In court in Seattle on Friday, Ms. Bennett said the government disagreed with the Texas ruling.",0
8091,Trump’s S.E.C. Nominee Disclosure Offers Rare Glimpse of Clients and Conflicts - The New York Times,"After spending years cultivating an elite roster of Wall Street and corporate clients, Jay Clayton will now be responsible for policing some of those same types of companies. Mr. Clayton, a longtime partner at the law firm Sullivan  Cromwell who is President Trump’s pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, has represented big banks like Goldman Sachs and Barclays as well as prominent hedge funds and corporate executives, according to a financial disclosure form made public on Wednesday by the Office of Government Ethics. Some of the clients were listed on Sullivan  Cromwell’s website  —   and Mr. Clayton kept nine others confidential  —   but the filing reveals a number of previously unadvertised assignments, including work he has done for companies facing intense government scrutiny: Deutsche Bank, UBS and Volkswagen. Other   clients represented by Mr. Clayton, whose given name is Walter, include the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, the film studio the Weinstein Company, Reid Hoffman, a founder of LinkedIn, and William C. Erbey, former head of the mortgage firm Ocwen. In the hedge fund sector, Mr. Clayton, 50, has represented William A. Ackman’s Pershing Square as well as Paul Tudor Jones. He has also represented Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, a company in which Mr. Ackman is a major investor and which is being investigated by the S. E. C. over potential accounting irregularities. Mr. Clayton, who says he will recuse himself from certain cases involving former clients, has also personally invested in a number of hedge funds and private equity firms through special Sullivan  Cromwell investment vehicles, according to the filing. He earned $7. 6 million from Sullivan  Cromwell over the past year or so and has investments in portfolios managed by Apollo Global Management, Bain Capital, J. C. Flowers and Perry Partners. His wife, Gretchen, who works at Goldman Sachs, has a number of investments in   funds as well as a small amount, described in his filing as being less than $1, 001, with a retirement account once managed by Omega Advisors, a hedge fund now fighting S. E. C. charges. Mr. Clayton’s disclosures offer a rare glimpse into his client list and family wealth  —   a sum of at least $50 million, his filing shows  —   and may reinforce a view among consumer groups and Democratic lawmakers that he could have conflicting interests as a Wall Street regulator. Although he is expected to broadly support the agency’s enforcement efforts, he has made statements suggesting that he will probably move to ease at least some of the   regulations weighing on Wall Street clients. Some of those clients are well represented in the new administration, perhaps none more than Goldman. The Trump administration has become a virtual magnet for former Goldman executives: Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary Gary D. Cohn, the chairman of the national economic council, and Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, have all worked at Goldman. The addition of Mr. Clayton, who represented Goldman during the 2008 financial crisis, will most likely fuel concerns that the bank has outsize influence in the administration. But one Democrat is scrutinizing more than just Mr. Clayton’s ties to Wall Street. In a previously unreported letter, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, Democrat of Nevada and one of the newest members of the Senate Banking Committee, questioned him on his representation of the Nordic telecommunications company TeliaSonera. The letter, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times, notes that TeliaSonera has had business ties to Russia and Iran. One of the deals Mr. Clayton worked on for TeliaSonera, for example, involved another company controlled by a Russian oligarch. “I am particularly concerned about your involvement with TeliaSonera,” Ms. Cortez Masto writes in the letter, in which she asks that he clarify “the precise nature of your representation. ” A spokesman for Mr. Clayton said, “In both business and litigation, Jay has been on the opposite side of Russia in resolving disputes. ” Mr. Clayton, whose nomination must clear the banking committee and then the full Senate, is expected to be confirmed. A committee hearing is scheduled for March 23. One former colleague said in an   article that while “the natural tendency of Democrats will be to criticize this pick as a ‘Wall Street insider,’” in fact “the good guys should have nothing to worry about and the bad guys should be concerned. ” And in a statement, Cyrus R. Vance Jr. the Manhattan district attorney and a Democrat, said, “Jay will be a balanced and thoughtful leader at the S. E. C. with great experience in the agency’s regulatory and enforcement practices. ” Mr. Vance added, “Jay will call it as he sees it, will have no bias in his new role either for business or against it. ” Still, Mr. Clayton’s client list highlights a practical challenge that awaits him. When top corporate lawyers take over the S. E. C. they must recuse themselves from certain matters involving former clients to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. In addition to disclosing his client list and law firm wealth, Mr. Clayton filed an ethics letter providing a broad explanation of how he plans to navigate such potential conflicts. While his recusal plan is in line with other similar nominees, it appears to offer him leeway in handling Wall Street cases. In the letter, he promises not to participate “personally and substantially” in a matter involving a former client for a period of one year “after I last provided service to that client, unless I am first authorized to participate. ” The same   restriction, which complies with federal ethics rules, will also apply more broadly to Sullivan  Cromwell clients, he writes. In the letter, Mr. Clayton says he would divest himself of his interest in some 175 investment funds and stock holdings that either he or his wife hold. . The challenge of recusals is not unique to Mr. Clayton. His predecessor, Mary Jo White, had been a partner at the law firm Debevoise  Plimpton, a relationship that forced her to step away from a number of important cases. If confirmed, Mr. Clayton would be the latest millionaire to join the Trump administration. And his ties to Wall Street underscore how Mr. Trump, despite campaigning against the wealthy global elite, has stocked his administration with Wall Street lawyers and bankers, particularly from Goldman. At the height of the financial crisis, Mr. Clayton advised Goldman on a $5 billion investment by Warren E. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, a critical deal for the bank. Mr. Clayton’s wife works as a   adviser at Goldman, though she will resign once he is confirmed, the ethics letter says. And Mr. Clayton is just one of many Sullivan  Cromwell lawyers who have done work for Goldman. For Democrats, Mr. Clayton’s relationship with TeliaSonera could raise its own concerns. On his Sullivan  Cromwell bio, Mr. Clayton has said he represented TeliaSonera in “various transactions. ” Those deals include one in which the company, among other things, combined its ownership interests in MegaFon, a Russian mobile phone operator, with another Russian company, Altimo, that has long been controlled by a Russian billionaire, Mikhail Fridman. It is not unusual for United States law firms to advise corporate clients doing business in Russia, and Mr. Clayton is not thought to have any ties to the Russian companies. Yet, as investigations into the Trump campaign’s dealings with Russia dominate the early days of Mr. Trump’s presidency, the TeliaSonera deals could provide Democrats with some ammunition. Ms. Cortez Masto, the Nevada Democrat, also points in her letter to TeliaSonera’s ties to Iran, which stem from the company’s stake in Turkcell, a Turkish mobile phone provider. And last year, she notes, the company disclosed that it had received an offer from authorities in the United States and the Netherlands to settle investigations into bribery accusations for $1. 4 billion. That case, which Mr. Clayton did not have a role in, involves potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a crucial component of the S. E. C. ’s enforcement arsenal. Mr. Clayton spoke out against the bribery law in a  2011 report by a New York City Bar Association he led as “unilateral and zealous enforcement of the F. C. P. A” that may “exacerbate the problem of overseas corruption. ” Ms. Cortez Masto also noted in her letter that “four of your clients have been charged with violations of S. E. C. rules in the last five years,” including the giant hedge fund   Capital Management. The hedge fund’s African unit pleaded guilty to bribery charges in September, with the firm paying a $413 million fine as part of a deferred prosecution agreement to settle both criminal and civil charges. Mr. Clayton’s wife’s modest investment in the Omega fund could also raise questions. The S. E. C last year filed an insider trading complaint against the hedge fund’s founder, the billionaire investor Leon Cooperman. Omega had managed the investment for Goldman’s retirement plan, and the Wall Street bank pulled its employees’ $300 million from the account in October, several months after the S. E. C. filed its suit. Mr. Cooperman, 73, is fighting the S. E. C. charges, saying that he is “not going to let these people destroy my legacy. ”",0

8094,Donald Trump Reaffirms Support for Warmer Relations With Putin - The New York Times,"MECHANICSBURG, Pa.  —   Donald J. Trump unabashedly trumpeted his support for warmer relations with Russia at a campaign rally here on Monday night, acidly mocking opponents who say he is too friendly to Vladimir V. Putin, the country’s strongman president. Mr. Trump, who has been under fire from Democrats and some conservative national security leaders for his accommodating stance toward Mr. Putin, cast his supportive remarks as a matter of practical necessity. By aligning itself with Russia, he said, the United States could more easily take on the Islamic State and other terrorist groups. “If we could get Russia to help us get rid of ISIS  —   if we could actually be friendly with Russia  —   wouldn’t that be a good thing?” Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, said. Repeating the question moments later, he won loud applause from the crowd: “If we could get along with Russia, wouldn’t that be a good thing, instead of a bad thing?” Noting that Mr. Putin had made laudatory comments about him, Mr. Trump teased political rivals, including Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, who have criticized his friendliness with the Russian leader. “They say, ‘Putin likes Trump,’” Mr. Trump began. He continued the mimicry: “How dare he like Putin? How dare he?” Mr. Trump also reiterated his view that NATO, the security alliance formed as a bulwark against the Soviet Union, was “obsolete. ” Both Mrs. Clinton and her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, have chastised Mr. Trump for praising Mr. Putin, and Mr. Trump has raised concerns among defense experts for repeated comments that appear to signal tolerance of Russia’s aggression in Eastern Europe. In an appearance on “This Week” on ABC News over the weekend, Mr. Trump declined to express disapproval of Russia for its annexation of the Ukrainian territory of Crimea in 2014. On the contrary, Mr. Trump suggested that the people there might be happier under Russian rule. And the Republican nominee said in an interview with The New York Times in July that he would not necessarily come to the defense of NATO states in the event of invasion, and would decide based on whether the country in question had paid its dues to the alliance. Mr. Trump also touched off an uproar during the Democratic National Convention last week when he said in a news conference that he hoped Russian hackers would infiltrate Mrs. Clinton’s email. He later said he was being sarcastic. With his appearance in Pennsylvania on Monday, Mr. Trump showed no intention of abandoning his embrace of Mr. Putin and his country. He professed disbelief that political opponents have said he should swear off Mr. Putin. “He said nice things about me,” Mr. Trump said. “Why would I disavow it? Why?” He derided Mrs. Clinton at length and accused her Democratic primary opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, of having made a “deal with the devil” to support her in the general election. “She’s the devil,” Mr. Trump said of Mrs. Clinton.",0
8095,"Janice Crouch, ‘Gospel of Prosperity’ Disciple, Dies at 78 - The New York Times","Janice Crouch, who founded the Trinity Broadcasting Network with her husband, Paul, and preached a “gospel of prosperity” with him on TBN programs, reaching millions of viewers around the world, died on Tuesday. She was 78. Her death was confirmed in a family statement on TBN’s website. The network said she had been hospitalized on May 25 after a stroke, but gave no other details. At her death, the network and members of her family were fighting in court over multiple lawsuits, including one involving an accusation of rape and a   and another claiming financial improprieties. Mrs. Crouch was a convivial and colorful presence on the air, typically appearing in a bouffant frosted pink or champagne. Speaking with a singsong lilt, she referred to herself as Mama as she delivered an uplifting version of Scripture that included personal encounters with the divine and linked spirituality to material success. A donation to their church, the Crouches said, would be repaid with divinely ordained riches. Mrs. Crouch and her husband were the longtime hosts of TBN’s talk show “Praise the Lord. ” She was also TBN’s vice president and director of network programming, helping to develop many of its popular shows. The Crouches started their network as a single station, now called   40, in Santa Ana, Calif. in 1973 with the help of the televangelists Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, who went on to found their own hugely popular televised ministry in South Carolina. In time, Mr. Crouch said, a vision inspired him to invest in satellite distribution, which became the foundation of TBN’s global broadcasting empire. TBN, which calls itself the world’s most watched religious broadcaster, now has programming 24 hours a day, providing Bible study, religious movies and soap operas, and Christian rock videos. Evangelists like Pat Robertson, Billy Graham and Robert H. Schuller have appeared on the network. The network says its shows are translated into many languages and appear on more than 80 satellite channels and more than 5, 000 television stations. TBN’s parent company listed $799, 244, 556 in total assets and received $52, 905, 172 in contributions and grants in its tax filings for 2014, the most recent year available. Twice a year, the Crouches held “ ”   drives in which they appealed for donations to keep programs like “Praise the Lord” on the air. The Crouches were criticized for using those donations to finance a luxurious lifestyle, including the use of private jets. The family was reported to have multiple homes, among them    mansions in Newport Beach, Calif. In 2007, TBN purchased Holy Land Experience, a religious theme park in Orlando, Fla. for $37 million. Mrs. Crouch became Holy Land’s president and creative director and began a major remodeling of the park, renting adjacent rooms in a luxury hotel for nearly two years. One was used to house clothing and her two Maltese dogs, which otherwise occupied a motor home. The family controversies made headlines in 2004, when The Los Angeles Times reported that Mr. Crouch had paid a former employee, Enoch Lonnie Ford, $425, 000 in 1998 after Mr. Ford threatened to sue TBN for unjustly firing him. As part of the settlement, the newspaper said, Mr. Ford agreed not to publicize his claim that he had had a sexual encounter with Mr. Crouch. But Mr. Ford later threatened to publish a manuscript that discussed the matter. Mr. Crouch denied Mr. Ford’s claims, and the case was settled by a private arbitrator. In 2012, The Orange County Register reported that a granddaughter, Carra Crouch, had sued the network that year, alleging that she was raped by a TBN employee in 2006, when she was 13, and that the Crouch family had covered up the assault. The suit contended that when Carra Crouch told her grandmother about the assault, Mrs. Crouch “became furious” and screamed at her granddaughter, saying, “It is your fault. ” That suit has not yet been resolved, according to documents in Orange County Superior Court. In another lawsuit filed around the same time, another granddaughter, Brittany Koper, who was TBN’s finance director, accused the network of misusing donated money. Ms. Koper and her husband, Michael, were fired and accused by the network of stealing $1. 3 million. TBN has since filed multiple suits against the Kopers. Paul Crouch Jr. Mrs. Crouch’s son and Ms. Koper’s father, was forced off TBN’s staff and quit its board because of the acrimony. Janice Wendell Bethany was born in New Brockton, Ala. on March 14, 1938. She grew up in Columbus, Ga. as a pastor’s daughter raised in the Assemblies of God, a Pentecostal denomination. She graduated from high school and attended Evangel College (now Evangel University) in Springfield, Mo. before she met Paul Crouch in 1956. They married a year later and began to preach. Mr. Crouch also worked in radio and television, and in 1965, they moved to California to pursue their career in religious television. Mr. Crouch died in 2013. Mrs. Crouch is survived by Paul Jr. and another son, Matthew, who is TBN’s chairman a sister, Dorothy Casoria several grandchildren and a  .",0
8096,"Donald Trump Budget Spends Big on Military and the Wall Cuts Foreign Aid, EPA, and Public Broadcasting","President Donald Trump released his budget blueprint on Thursday, an effort to prioritize safety and security for the American people while dramatically cutting other agencies considered sacred cows by the left. [“To keep Americans safe, we have made tough choices that have been put off for too long,” Trump wrote in a message to Congress. “But we have also made necessary investments that are long overdue. ”  The outline increases defense spending by $54 billion and increases funding for immigration enforcement as well as $4. 1 billion investment for his promised wall on the southern border. “We must ensure that our courageous servicemen and women have the tools they need to deter war, and when called upon to fight, do only one thing: Win. ” Trump wrote. The budget includes Trump’s promises to veterans, as the Department of Veterans Affairs gets a 10 percent increase in spending. Trump cut funding for several agencies, including a 28 percent cut in the State Department, mostly because of cuts in foreign aid programs. The EPA also experiences a 31 percent cut, the biggest loser in the budget. The Department of Agriculture gets a 29 percent cut and the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Labor are also cut by over 20 percent. Although there are over 13 percent cuts in the Department of Education, Trump’s budget proposes $168 million for charter school programs and $250 million for a   choice program, according to the Washington Post. The Budget calls for the elimination of funds for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as well as the endowments for the Arts and the Humanities. “We are going to do more with less, and make the Government lean and accountable to the people,” read Trump’s message to Congress. The budget outlines Trump’s spending priorities, but a more detailed document is expected to be released by the White House in May.",0
8097,Re: It Is Mathematically Impossible To Pay Off All Of Our Debt,"It Is Mathematically Impossible To Pay Off All Of Our Debt   May 21st, 2015 
Did you know that if you took every single penny away from everyone in the United States that it still would not be enough to pay off the national debt? Today, the debt of   exceeds $145,000 per household, and it is getting worse with each passing year. Many believe that if we paid it off a little bit at a time that we could eventually pay it all off, but as you will see below that isn’t going to work either. It has been projected that “mandatory” federal spending on programs such as Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare plus interest on the national debt will exceed total federal revenue by the year 2025. That is before a single dollar is spent on the U.S. military, homeland security, paying federal workers or building any roads and bridges. So no, we aren’t going to be “paying down” our debt any time in the foreseeable future. And of course it isn’t just our 18 trillion dollar national debt that we need to be concerned about. Overall, Americans are a total of 58 trillion dollars in debt. 35 years ago, that number was sitting at just 4.3 trillion dollars. There is no way in the world that all of that debt can ever be repaid. The only thing that we can hope for now is for this debt bubble to last   before it finally explodes. 
It shocks many people to learn that our debt is far larger than the total amount of money in existence. So let’s take a few moments and go through some of the numbers. 
When most people think of “money”, they think of coins, paper money and checking accounts. All of those are contained in one of the most basic measures of money known as M1 . The following definition of M1 comes from Investopedia … 
A measure of the money supply that includes all physical money, such as coins and currency, as well as demand deposits, checking accounts and Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) accounts. M1 measures the most liquid components of the money supply, as it contains cash and assets that can quickly be converted to currency. 
As you can see from the chart below, M1 has really grown in recent years thanks to rampant quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve. At the moment it is sitting just shy of 3 trillion dollars… 
So if you gathered up all coins, all paper currency and all money in everyone’s checking accounts, would that even make much of a dent in our debt? 
Nope. 
We’ll have to find more “money” to grab. 
M2 is a broader definition of money than M1 is, because it includes more things. The following definition of M2 comes from Investopedia … 
A measure of money supply that includes cash and checking deposits (M1) as well as near money. “Near money” in M2 includes savings deposits, money market mutual funds and other time deposits, which are less liquid and not as suitable as exchange mediums but can be quickly converted into cash or checking deposits. 
As you can see from the chart below, M2 is sitting just short of 12 trillion dollars right now… 
That is a lot more “money”, but it still wouldn’t pay off our national debt, much less our total debt of 58 trillion dollars. 
So is there anything else that we could grab? 
Well, the broadest definition of “money” that is commonly used is M3 . The following definition of M3 comes from Investopedia … 
A measure of money supply that includes M2 as well as large time deposits, institutional money market funds, short-term repurchase agreements and other larger liquid assets. The M3 measurement includes assets that are less liquid than other components of the money supply, and are more closely related to the finances of larger financial institutions and corporations than to those of businesses and individuals. These types of assets are referred to as “near, near money.” 
The Federal Reserve no longer provides charts for M3, but according to John Williams of shadowstats.com , M3 is currently sitting somewhere in the neighborhood of 17 trillion dollars. 
So even with the broadest possible definition of “money”, we simply cannot come up with enough to pay off the debt of  , much less the rest of our debts. 
That is not good news at all. 
Alternatively, could we just start spending less than we bring in and start paying down the national debt a little bit at a time? 
Perhaps that may have been true at one time, but now we are really up against a wall. Our rapidly aging population is going to put an enormous amount of stress on our national finances in the years ahead. 
According to U.S. Representative Frank Wolf , interest on the national debt plus “mandatory” spending on programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will surpass the total amount of federal revenue by the year 2025. That is before a single penny is spent on homeland security, national defense, paying federal workers, etc. 
But even now things are a giant mess. We are told that “deficits are under control”, but that is a massive hoax that is based on accounting gimmicks. During fiscal year 2014, the U.S. national debt increased by more than a trillion dollars . That is not “under control”– that is a raging national crisis. 
Many believe that that we could improve the situation by raising taxes. And yes, a little bit more could probably be squeezed out of us, but the impact on government finances would be negligible. Since the end of World War II, the amount of tax revenue taken in by   has fluctuated in a range between 15 and 20 percent of GDP no matter what tax rates have been. I believe that it is possible to get up into the low twenties, but that would also be very damaging to our economy and the American public would probably throw a huge temper tantrum. 
The real problem, of course, is our out of control spending. 
During the past two decades, spending by   has grown 63 percent more rapidly than inflation, and “mandatory” spending on programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid has actually doubled after you adjust for inflation. 
We simply cannot afford to keep spending money like this. 
And then there is the matter of interest on the national debt. For the moment, the rest of the world is lending us gigantic mountains of money at ridiculously low interest rates. However, if the average rate of interest on U.S. government debt was just to return to the long-term average, we would be spending more than a trillion dollars a year just in interest on the national debt. 
So the best possible environment for “paying down our debt” that we are ever going to see is happening right now. The only place that interest rates on U.S. government debt have to go is up, and our population is going to just keep getting older and more dependent on government programs. 
Meanwhile, our overall debt continues to spiral out of control as well. According to CNBC , the total amount of debt that Americans owe has reached a staggering 58.7 trillion dollars… 
As the nation entered the 1980s, there was comparatively little debt—just about $4.3 trillion. That was only about 1.5 times the size of gross GDP. Then a funny thing happened. 
The gap began to widen during the decade, and then became basically parabolic through the ’90s and into the early part of the 21st century. 
Though debt took a brief decline in 2009 as the country limped its way out of the financial crisis, it has climbed again and is now, at $58.7 trillion, 3.3 times the size of GDP and about 13 times what it was in 1980, according to data from the Federal Reserve’s St. Louis branch. (The total debt measure is not to be confused with the $18.2 trillion national debt, which is 102 percent of GDP and is a subset of the total figure.) 
As I discussed above, there isn’t enough money in our entire system to even pay off a significant chunk of that debt. 
So what happens when the total amount of debt in a society vastly exceeds the total amount of money? 
Is there any way out other than collapse?

You’ve probably heard that power corrupts. I read in a psychology book an idea called the metamorphic effect of power. The idea is whenever someone successfully influences another person it changes the powerholder’s psyche. We the powerholder develops a contempt for the person they perceive they have power over. The greater the power the more contempt. Eventually the powerholder thinks the people under their influence as non-human being insects who can be killed or squashed without any moral consequence. gts58

fortunato, you stated –“…After all what can we the people do about it? Nothing. Absolutely nothing…”. 
Actually, Governments do as they do, as long as the mass of the people let it be. As long as the people do not have the will and the courage to demand the change they want. 
However, people are kept under “control” by using various means to divide and distract them. The major Media Networks and the Educational system are the two main non-violent “arm” the Ruling Class use to “control” the masses. AND, where the non-violent “arm” fail, then the violent “arm” (i.e. the Army and Police) is used accordingly. 
So it takes UNITY and a lot of COURAGE for the masses to have the change we want, and we CAN do something, but it begins with having the WILL to do what we wish to do.. 
Don’t forget the corporate toxic food chain which leads to the mass addiction to pharma mafia given the dis-ease/obesity epidemic that fuels medical costs….everything IS connected to ‘dummy’ down the masses. gts58 
Your second paragraph says it all. Thomas Keith 
You don’t care how much debt your government racks up? Fool, it’s you and the rest of the citizenry who the world will look to for repayment. The world honors the US’s request for more credit (for no. at least) because of the US government’s ability to tax its peoples. Keeping your head in the sand won’t save you. _aleph_ Catman 
This is why the politicians have no plan to do deal with the national debt: it cannot be fixed. They already know what you so well explain. The economies of the world depend on more debt through fractional reserve banking and treasury bond purchases to create more money to pay the interest and keep from sliding into a depression. This will not end with a fiscal policy. There is no brake on this rig. I recently had a dream where I was driving a car on which the brakes did not work. Very frustrating. Well, I have no debt, but perhaps it speaks to the sense of being carried along with little recourse other than to just keep the car in the middle of the road and try not to hit anything or anyone. I think a lot of us feel like that in life: we have no control, we can’t get off the roller coaster, and one way or the other we’re all in this together. Christoph Weise

Are you playing coy or just being ignorant? I’m sure someone will enlighten you. Nemnor 
df NJ, a “…small group of sadist European bankers …” (as you put it) are only a symptom of a much wider and more fundamental cause of the issues facing the USA. 
The main root cause of the worsening socioeconomic issues in the USA (and the World), is – the Capitalist system itself – which has became decadent, is at a “dead end” and is NOT able to generate long-term recovery by economic means alone . 
The world-wide Capitalist system became decadent as it reached a level of general over-production . With over-production, it became harder and harder for the Capitalist to sell their products/services, for even what the Capitalist consider a reasonable profit. 
Hence, the reason the Capitalists (irrationally) engage more and more in “Share Repurchase”/”Stock Buyback” (to ARTIFICIALLY raise the value of a company’s stock), and/or invest in “financial bubbles”, “derivatives” and other exotic “financial instruments” ( even lend money to people that are not credit worthy ), and with many of these “investments” having little or not relations to the real economy!!! 
There is NO going back to the “good ole days” of the USA, or going back to “real”/”pure”/”free market” Capitalism , because Capitalist USA already passed it’s progressive stage and is now at a “dead end”. 
The real solution can only be with a fundamental change away from Capitalism , as no amount of “reforms” could ever fix Capitalist USA. HeyAHuman

We have long passed the point at which repayment of debt could have been possible. Maybe it was never possible. I have heard that there is always more debt in the system than money to repay it. That is the nature of the fractional reserve system. Central banks world wide have decided 2009 not to bother about racking up debt. They are printing money and providing it to financial institutions as needed. We have now two different circulation systems. One is the old system. It comprises of individuals and corporations. The traditional debt limits apply. Bankruptcy and insolvency are possible. Than we have the newly created second circulation system. It comprises of central banks and systematically important lenders. These organisations can not bankrupt or become insolvent. They have escaped from the ordinary circulation system and are eternal. De facto we are faced now with a two class system. This is the departure from market economy. And it is problematic in many aspects. Some of them: (1) The change to our system has never been properly explained and is kept as a secret (2) The political bodies never made a decision on this change (and thus it is illegal and because of its illegality central banks are engaged in criminal activity) (3) Before the law all people should be equal. This principle is violated by the introduction of the principle of eternal economic life and could only be trumped by the introduction of eternal biological life for a limited set of individuals. The question arises if the second circulation system is indeed eternal. There may be limits but I never saw a comprehensive discussion of the topic. I presume it would take a single global currency to avoid a systemic default. But I am not sure. It looks like the can kicking strategy has a very long life. GSOB

Ironically, Every dollar in your Wallet had to be loaned into existence for you to have it, it represents Debt not Wealth and it belongs to the Banking Cartel. You could take that dollar back to the Club FED to extinguish that loan, but you have to pay the Interest on that Dollar. Where do you get the Money from to pay back the Interest on that Dollar, the Club FED of Course. And then you’d have to pay the Interest on that as well. By all definitions of a Ponzi Scheme, the Club FED is a Ponzi Scheme where you pay one debt by creating another debt to infinity. This ensures that nobody can never own more than the Banking Cartel. It’s an absolute brilliant scam, and it’s been going on for 100 years, with one re-invention for Gold-Standard and another time for Credit Cards to overcome the 45 year limit on Fiat Money. Richard

Actually Michael is wrong: it’s perfectly possible to pay off the entire debt in less than 5 years. All they need to do is to cut all welfare and military funds and eliminate all tax discounts. But that will never happen. nekksys 
This idea doesn’t account for paying off PERSONAL debt as opposed to GOVERNMENT debt. 
And, as someone already pointed out, when the first $11T is paid back, the “money” it represents disappears, therefore a vast amount of the M1 will vanish into thin air leaving only the hard currency which can not be distributed sufficiently throughout the population to effect an further debt payments. 
In other words, no matter how you slice it, we’re all pretty much F’d in the A thanks to the recklessness of our government and the banksters. nobody 
So a bunch of banks will go under – more power to the big ones, you lose, they win. Actually it won’t disappear since it has never existed to begin with and it will just be created elsewhere. BTW your hard currency has stopped having any power a long time ago, now it’s just a bunch of paper and it’s worth only what the issuing bank says it’s worth. And no, gold by itself isn’t worth anything since it can be taken from you at the whim of the government. nekksys 
Hard Currency = Paper and Coin… I wasn’t referencing buying power either. I was referring to the ACTUAL M1. 
Please try to keep up. nobody 
Actually that’s incorrect: a hard currency is a means of payment (usually a currency but it can also be a commodity) that is well and widely trusted and used for savings. Also called safe-heaven currency. Please use the correct terms from now on. nekksys 
Typical… When folks like yourself start losing the debate, you shift and try to muddy the waters. Nice try, though! Considering your previous statement “BTW your hard currency has stopped having any power a long time ago” in light of your most recent redefinition of “hard currency,” I guess that means all commodities in my possession are worthless as well? Last I checked, a pound of iron was still a pound of iron and still possesses the same value. 
Again, the M1 was what I was referencing. The M1 is the actual, hard currency in circulation. M1 doesn’t consider commodities as part of the equation. 
Please, if you choose to redefine something, make sure you haven’t used the same term previously… And do keep up with the conversation. nobody 
No, a pound of iron is an asset, that has it’s own value. No, M1 isn’t a representation of hard currency, it’s just an index detailing the total amount of money in an economy – which includes absolutely everything, even those that exist only as electronic vapour. Please try to keep up, or at least get a basic economy/banking course at your local free college. nekksys 
Awww… Look! It can read (a little)… Again, judging by the current value of the M1, there’s no way it includes everything you claim. 
Furthermore, you are still forgetting that once debt is repaid, ALL the currency it represents (whether real or “electronic vapour”) vanishes. Once the repayment process is underway, the available currency supply continues to diminish eventually leading to a ZERO currency state WITH remaining debt… nobody 
And you know there’s no way because a little birdy told you so, right? Let’s be real, M1 is a government decided value and you will never have a say on it. Wrong again, it doesn’t disappear, it goes into the bank’s accounts as an asset, which is in turn used to create even more money by lending it/investing it at least twice its value. The problem appears when they no longer have legit ways to invest it so they invent things like the derivatives to absorb the surplus of money they have created. Yes you can, you can claim it will be used to make 1000 knives and sell derivatives on that in excess of $1k on it. For everybody that $1 lump of iron will now be worth $1k – and this procedure is entirely legal and legit. We’re not talking about honesty here, remember. alan

And to quote Michael’s “The real problem, of course, is our out of control spending” yet we have one of our greatest termites in the form of John McCain and the others who want to increase defense spending because the Russian’s and primarily the Chinese are building up their defense spending, with our money. Insane. I was kind of hoping for a gradual collapse due mainly to money printing and inflation, but I’m afraid things are speeding up as the symptoms of impending crisis are being overlooked and exacerbated by our moronic president and termitic Congress.

I could buy more at a grocery store with a $20 bill 25 years ago then I can get today with that c-note. Crazy. Tranqual 
Money masters know what they are doing.“Inflation has now been institutionalized at a fairly constant 5% per year. This has been determined to be the optimum level for generating the most revenue without causing public alarm. A 5% devaluation applies, not only to the money earned this year, but to all that is left over from previous years. 
“At the end of the first year, a dollar is worth 95 cents. At the end of the second year, the 95 cents is reduced again by 5%, leaving its worth at 90 cents, and so on. By the time a person has worked 20 years, the government will have confiscated 64% of every dollar he saved over those years. By the time he has worked 45 years, the hidden tax will be 90%. The government will take virtually everything a person saves over a lifetime.”

This is a technique which has been practiced by financial manipulators ever since, and it is fully utilized by those who operate the Federal Reserve System today.” 
– G. Edward Griffin 
“[The] abandonment of the gold standard made it possible for the welfare statists to use the banking system as a means to an unlimited expansion of credit…. In the absence of the gold standard, there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation. There is no safe store of value. If there were, the government would have to make its holdings illegal, as was done in the case of gold…. The financial policy of the welfare state requires that there be no way for the owners of wealth to protect themselves…. [This] is the shabby secret of the welfare statist’s tirades against gold. Deficit spending is simply a scheme for the ‘hidden’ confiscation of wealth. Gold stands in the way of this insidious process. It stands as a protector of property rights.”- Alan Greenspan in an article he wrote in 1966. 
And then Greenspan went over to the dark side and worked for the Fed. 
“By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method, they not only confiscate, but they confiscate arbitrarily; and, while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some. The sight of this arbitrary rearrangement of riches strikes not only at security, but at confidence in the equity of the existing distribution of wealth. Those to whom the system brings windfalls . . . become ‘profiteers’, who are the object of the hatred of the bourgeoisie, whom the inflationism has impoverished not less than the proletariat. As the inflation proceeds . . . all permanent relations between debtors and creditors, which form the ultimate foundation of capitalism, become so utterly disordered as to be almost meaningless.”– From pages 220-233 of The Economic Consequences of the Peace (1919), by John Maynard Keynes.

personally I don’t think there’s anything we can do. Ultimately it’s God’s judgment. When Jackson killed the central bank they just crashed the economy. It would take a miracle for most people to even understand the screw job. If any leader came on the scene and tried to kill the Fed the bankers would just constrict the money supply crash the economy. Frankly I believe we are in the end game. Only repentance and revival would give us more time as a nation. Sadly I’m not optimistic about that either. We are already seeing the birthing of the apostate church. Trusting God will take care of the faithful remnant. Not looking forward to the days ahead. I wish Christians would have their eyes opened. We may be able to take part in a great harvest after America goes down. Maybe then people will listen…to the GOOD NEWS!!

1971. We went off the Gold Standard. What happened next was utterly predictable. A dollar today is worth a fifth of a 1971 dollar. Nixon was the One! Preparequickly Dwain Dibley 
The legal tender dollar is worth exactly the same as it has always been worth, 100 cents. Now, the bankster’s “Credit Dollar” is another matter, it’s only worth 4 cents (excluding Wall Street and shadow banking system generated credit). But because people are too stupid and lazy to discern the difference, they equate the two as being one in the same and are apparently willing to die economically, firmly holding onto that erroneous belief.

Nixon was just following orders. The price of being president. They are all sock puppets. Obama, McConnell and Boehner all spooning together are the latest screw job is a perfect example.

It seems that the USA is using the Roman Template of self destruction. Over spend on your military and run up large debts. What next? Well Rome turned on its own people for cash which has happened many times in different societies. This leads to less freedoms and economic totalitarianism or they will take you to war to divert the issue. I think by the end of the year the average US citizen will begin to see how your government will treat you. I myself find this whole situation a little funny because I left my country of birth because of economic mismanagement of the state, that used laws to limit my freedom. I immigrated to the UK only to find myself facing the same situation. The UK has debts that they can never pay back and it will be interesting to see how they deal with it here. The honest way is to default. It is a bit sad when you have to keep moving countries just to survive. Genada 
Only choices on debts that can not be payed is either to default or to inflate them away. 
You can pay off the debt anytime you wish, it doesn’t mean it will be worth anything tho. df NJ 
It’s not going to end well. Hank Sullivan 
Michael, the kicker is that each dollar that, because the entire currency supply is borrowed into existence, when one of those dollars gets paid back to the original issuer, which is your goal, that dollar ceases to exist. And so once $11 trillion, M2, is paid off to the original issuer, THERE’S NO MORE CURRENCY IN CIRCULATION TO RUN THE ECONOMY. Like the Germans during the Battle of the Bulge, the economy would completely run out of fuel. And we would still have $49 trillion left to pay. HedgeHog 
Read Modern Money Mechanics, and part of the picture becomes clear, think of it this way, and it becomes crystal; if you and I are talking, and I ask to borrow a dollar, and there is no other money in existence, and you want to charge me 10 cents of interest, if I give you back the dollar to pay off the debt, where am I going to get the 10 cents? because every monetary instrument in circulation has debt attached to it, is the reason why the debt can never be repaid. Put the power to take care of the money supply back in the hands of congress, dissolve the fed, and several other adjustments that need to be made, and we might have a chance of coming out of this relatively unharmed.

Anyone heard of Beppe Grillo? He’s a comedian/politician in Italy whose rants against debt and the EU have made him a hero to many Italians. He did a semi-serious bit years ago in which he explained Italy’s debt problems and discussed how to solve them. Here’s some of what he said: If there’s a borrower, there is supposed to be a lender, correct? Who do we owe this money to? TO OURSELVES! Fine, I owe it to myself. I claim it is nothing anymore and we’re square. Go to Hell!” Right? It’s a debt system, this is an awful system!– They issue money, but to whom does it belong? We are the state, so it belongs to us, don’t you agree? If the money belongs to us, then why do they lend it to us? There’s something not adding up, right? Once we used to have gold coins, they were ours. We had some gold and it was ours. Now we have a note that says 1000 Lira. Who does it belong to? On the bill it says “Bank of Italy” and “Payable to the Bearer on Demand.” If I go to the bank to demand that money, they won’t give me anything!– The bank of Italy is a private joint-stock company…we wil never know who they are. They issue money out of thin air and lend it to us. It’s the state that is supposed to issue it. The state should keep money circulation stable, keep prices stable. Yet, our money is issued by a joint-stock company. Money shouldn’t look like that! It shouldn’t say Bank of Italy, it should say Republic of Italy! It shouldn’t be signed by the governor of the Bank of Italy, it should be signed by the President! That would bring satisfaction to us all!–

Simple question. Why does the gov’t have to borrow from a private financial institution, aka “the Fed”, in order to spend more than it takes in in taxes and thereby place this debt’s liability on future generations?

I’m not sure who has a better deal in this day and age-the prudent man who has no debt, or the debtor who totally throws caution to the wind and goes into hock up to his ears and takes out credit cards on his cat’s name, too. When the house of cards collapses, the prudent man with the bank account full of savings will probably see his money seized to pay for the emergency, while the debtor will probably be bailed out by the government using the prudent man’s money. What a Country! wheel 
Ain’t that the truth. Just like all the bailouts from the housing collapse with homeowners and speculators just walking away and leaving the taxpayer to pick up the pieces. 
The fact is if we could time it and know exactly when the collapse would happen I would recommend going hog wild on the spending and borrowing and give them all the finger when I declared bankruptcy. Gay Veteran 
the banksters gave out loans to people they knew could not pay, we should have let the banksters go bankrupt. we need banks, not any particular bank Nemnor 
The ‘banksters’ felt “compelled” to (IRRATIONALLY) “invest” as they do, not so much so because they are greedy or stupid, but rather, it is more so because of the Capitalist system in the USA (and the World) that has became DECADENT . 
This decadent Capitalist system is often labeled as –“corporatism”, or “socialism” or “crony capitalism” or “communism” or “fascism” or “welfare(ism)”, etc.. But regardless to the label, for the past 500 years or so, the the economic system in the World firmly remained Capitalism (in it’s ESSENTIAL form) . 
The Capitalist system became decadent as it reached a stage of general over-production . With over-production, it became harder and harder for the Capitalist to sell their products/services, for even what the Capitalist consider a reasonable profit. 
Hence, the reason the Capitalists (irrationally) engage more and more in “Share Repurchase”/”Stock Buyback” (to ARTIFICIALLY raise the value of a company’s stock), and/or invest in “financial bubbles”, “derivatives” and other exotic “financial instruments” ( even lend money to people that are not credit worthy ), and with many of these “investments” having little or not relations to the real economy !!! 
Once one becomes aware that the main root cause of the major socioeconomic issues facing the USA and the World is – Capitalism itself – which had became DECADENT (but labeled as “corporatism”, “socialism”, “fascism”, etc.), and that there is NO “real”/”pure”/”free market” Capitalism to go back to (because Capitalism ALREADY passed it’s progressive stage), then it becomes clear that any REAL/effective solution MUST include a fundamental change away from Capitalism (as no amount of “reforms” can ever fix Capitalism – which is now at a “dead end”).

For the LORD God is a sun and shield; The LORD gives grace and glory; No good thing does He withhold from those who walk uprightly. O LORD of hosts, How blessed is the man who trusts in You! 

Praise to God for a Living Hope 
Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade. 
This inheritance is kept in heaven for you, who through faith are shielded by God’s power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time. 
In all this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials. 
These have come so that the proven genuineness of your faith — of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire — may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed. 
Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy, for you are receiving the end result of your faith, the salvation of your souls.",0
8098,"On Anniversary of Pulse Jihadi Attack, Media Replaces Radical Ideology with Generic ’Hate’ - Breitbart","On Monday, thousands are remembering the lives lost during the deadliest mass shooting in United States history, the Pulse nightclub massacre, a jihadist attack by an Islamic State sympathizer targeting the Orlando club’s “Latin Night. ”[Omar Mateen opened fire on innocent patrons of the club, killing 49 people and injuring scores of others. Mateen pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State during the shooting before police shot him dead.  The media has made little to no mention of the fact that a jihadist, influenced by a radical Islamic ideology, was behind this crime. Instead, most of the stories in the press have painted the incident as a generic form of “hate. ” An article in the New Yorker about the graveyard caretaker who looks after the plots of the victims of the massacre does not mention Mateen. USA Today similarly makes no mention of Mateen’s radical motivations or his allegiance to a group hellbent on spreading an Islamic caliphate throughout the world. CNN ran an article highlighting five people who were either related to the victims of the Pulse massacre or survived the atrocity. CNN also failed to address the radical Islamic ideology behind the attacks. While they did mention the word “terror,” they chose quotes to highlight the views of those who believe in stricter gun laws, and one that blamed the incident squarely on “hate. ” The one person CNN quoted who believes in gun ownership as a form of protection as a result of what she survived said she does not believe in God. “It’s hard to say that I am here because of God because, I’m sorry, I don’t believe that God would take those people the way that they were taken,” Jeannette McCoy told CNN. “There’s nothing proud about being a survivor. Not for me. ” The Washington Post also failed to make any mention of Mateen’s radical influence. As the Washington Free Beacon pointed out, “Despite the Post‘s piece clocking in at over a thousand words, the words ‘terrorism,’ ‘terror,’ ‘ISIS,’ ‘Islam,’ ‘Muslim,’ and ‘ ’ never appeared once. The sole reference to ‘Islamic State’ occurs in a photo caption, and never in the body of the piece. ” Breitbart News previously reported that Mateen said, “I pledge allegiance to [Islamic State leader] Abu Bakr   may God protect him, on behalf of the Islamic State,” during a 911 call about his assault. In that same piece, Breitbart News detailed how the media worked to “portray Mr. Mateen as a scorned, mentally ill, repressed homosexual,” but the reports on the incident “reveal one crucial point: Omar Mateen ranted at the police about America’s fight against the Islamic State, mentioning the war and air strikes at least 20 times in total. ” Several other news outlets also failed to mention the keywords that the Washington Free Beacon mentioned their sole reference to Mateen pledging allegiance to the Islamic State. They include a Toronto,   news site, CP24 and the Associated Press. However, last year, the AP ran a headine with a quote from Mateen’s imam who said the Pulse massacre “Has Nothing To Do With ISIS” and instead blamed it on mental illness. On Monday, the City of Orlando participated in what they have called “Orlando United Day  —   A Day of Love and Kindness” to honor the lives lost one year ago today. In addition to a series of events taking place in the city and throughout other cities across North America, an event at Pulse nightclub called “Reflections and Remembrance” began at 11 a. m. At 7 p. m. a memorial event called “Orlando Love: Remembering Our Angels” will take place at Lake Eola Park. The park is located at  512 East Washington Street.

8099,Stoke-on-Trent Imam ’Told Congregation to Support Islamic State’,"A    Imam is in court accused of telling his congregation to support Islamic State and carry out acts of terrorism. [“Influential” preacher Kamran Sabir Hussain faces eight   offenses in connection with his work leading a mosque on Tunstall high street in the northern town.  He is charged with two counts of addressing the mosque with the intent of “encourage support for a proscribed organisation, namely Islamic State, or to further its activities” the Stoke Sentinel reports. The other six counts relate to “publishing a statement” in the form of giving a sermon to a congregation, in which he “intended or was reckless as to whether members of the public would be, directly or indirectly encouraged or otherwise induced by the statement to commit, prepare or instigate acts of terrorism”. All of the charges relate to a   period between the 24th of June and 16th of September 2016. At a brief hearing, the   ’s defense lawyer Matt Foot said Mr. Hussain would plead not guilty to the two counts of addressing a meeting at the mosque and six counts publishing statements.

8100,Breaking: FBI Reopens Investigation Into Hillary Email Scandal As New Emails Were Found,"The FBI recently decided to reopen their investigation of Hillary Clinton after more emails from her private email server during her time as head of the State Department were leaked.
Senior news editor and writer for NBC Bradd Jaffy , among others, just tweeted the document hours ago, showing the letter to members of Congress and outlining how the FBI is investigating additional emails.
“In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation,” Comey wrote to the chairmen. “I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.” 
You can read the full letter here .
 

The FBI still has yet to assess the importance of the material to see if any classified material was leaked, and if so, how significant it was.
Comey has also been criticized by lawmakers and others who are saying that the investigation has been downplayed and mishandled.
There are also some other strange allegations emerging. According to a report by the Wall Street Journal , Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe sent more than half a million dollars in campaign funds and material support to the wife of an FBI official who was a part of the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s personal email server. It was recently revealed that Clinton performed all of her business as Secretary of State from this server, including sharing classified information.
You can read more about that here .
Why Does This Matter? With all the information that has come out recently exposing the truth behind Western politics, it’s shedding light on the fact we are being misled and that there are extreme amounts of corruption in politics. Politicians are being used by big corporations and banks to push elitist agendas.
This is a time for reflection for us all as the external happenings of our world show us what is really going on. As things become more obvious it gives us a chance to see it VERY clearly -it’s happening for a reason. Is it time to discuss taking a different approach to our world? I think so.
This is a great quote that fits perfectly here:
“The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society . Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of.” 
– Edward Bernays, The Father of Public Relations, Propaganda , 1928 
What Are We Focusing On? Every four years we turn our attention to the presidential race, while the fact remains, as Bernie Sanders told us earlier in the year, that “no matter who is elected to be president, that person will not be able to address the enormous problems facing the working families of our country. They will not be able to succeed because of the power of corporate America, the power of Wall Street, and the power of campaign donors is so great that no president alone can stand up to them.” ( source )
Instead of “standing up to them,” they simply do what they are told. One example would be the transcripts of Hillary Clinton’s paid speeches to Goldman Sachs .
Politicians seem to now function as mere frontmen for these corporations, the ones to answer our questions, alleviate our fears, and ultimately, bear the brunt of our anger.
But at the end of the day there is something we must not forget:
“ a power has risen up in the government greater than the people themselves, consisting of many, and various, and powerful interests, combined into one mass, and held together by the cohesive power of the vast surplus in the banks.” John C. Calhoun ( source )
Shadow Government It’s no longer a secret that the global consolidation of power lies in the hands of very few — a small group of people and the corporations they run, all held together by the world of finance — or that this few controls every aspect of our lives.
Below is a great clip from the Thrive documentary by Foster Gamble, heir to the Proctor Gamble corporation. He was groomed for the establishment, but chose a different path.
These are the ones we need to shed more light on if we are going to turn things around. The power these corporations and banks have is unacceptable, and politics, at the end of the day, although a good tool that can be used to wake up the masses, is a distraction and waste of time.
It takes the power out of our hands, and places it in the hands of others — while we watch what they do with it and hope it benefits us.
Awareness! This is about awareness. Awareness so we can begin having discussions about what to do next and pulling our consciousness away from the illusion that is before. It is becoming more and more obvious so we can let it go.
It’s fitting to leave you with this last quote from Theodore Roosevelt. Combined with all of the evidence, it’s interesting to think about.
“Political parties exist to secure responsible government and to execute the will of the people.
From these great tasks both of the old parties have turned aside. Instead of instruments to promote the general welfare, they have become the tools of corrupt interests which use them impartially to serve their selfish purposes. Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government, owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people.
To destroy this invisible government, to dissolve the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day.” ( source )

8101,"Report: Donald Trump’s 2016 TV Ads Promised Policies, Clinton’s Ads Were Personal Attacks - Breitbart","Donald Trump’s 2016 TV campaign  were far more focused on promised policies than were the ads run by Hillary Clinton’s team, which were far more numerous, negative and narrowly focused on personality claims, says a new report. [“Over 60 percent of ads supporting Clinton were solely about candidate characteristics, while only about 25 percent were focused on policy,” said the report, titled “Political Advertising in 2016: The Presidential Election as Outlier?”   “This is a huge difference from Trump’s advertising, over 70 percent of which was focused on policy,” said the report, released March 6. “These strategic differences may have meant that Clinton was more prone to voter backlash and did nothing to overcome the media’s lack of focus on Clinton’s policy knowledge, especially for residents of Michigan and Wisconsin, in particular, who were receiving   (and specifically  ) messaging from Trump. ” “Clinton’s message was devoid of policy discussions in a way not seen in the previous four presidential contests, “ said the report, which was prepared by the Wesleyan Media Project.  The report debunks much of the establishment media’s narrative, which portrayed Trump’s campaign as a   chaotic scramble, saying: For all of the talk of the unusual advertising campaign that Trump ran in 2016, his message strategy was more traditionally  . Ironically, it was the Clinton campaign that deviated sharply from the conventional playbook when it came to messaging despite following conventional norms in terms of volume, placement and targeting of ads. Indeed, only one in four Clinton campaign ads focused on policy, which is by far the lowest percentage we have seen since data from Kantar   have been available. The media narrative also ignored Clinton’s far greater expenditure on TV advertising. In prior presidential campaigns, coverage by the establishment media has often bemoaned the scale and negativity of the campaign advertising, but according to the report: Hillary Clinton’s campaign (alone and with her allies) spent vastly more on campaign advertising than did Donald Trump’s. And yet Trump won the election   …     The Clinton campaign aired just under 200, 000 ads at an estimated cost of just under $120 million during the last 9 weeks of the campaign, dwarfing the Trump campaign’s 76, 000 ads at a cost of $66 million. Clinton’s advantage becomes even more stark when one adds in the almost 50, 000 spots aired by Priorities USA Action, a   super PAC. There was some outside group spending on behalf of Trump, including the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, which aired about 10, 000 ads on broadcast during the general election period   …     Clinton’s campaign also bought almost 300, 000 ads on local broadcast and national cable outlets, plus almost 700, 000 ads on local cable channels. In contrast, Trump’s campaign funded less than 100, 000 ads in both categories combined.  So Clinton’s campaign and her allies ran at least 1. 25 million TV ads, compared to Trump’s score of 186, 000 ads.  Overall, said the report: There was a huge imbalance in advertising at the presidential level in 2016, with Clinton and her allies pummeling Trump and his allies in almost every media market in the country.   advertising dominated on local broadcast, national cable and even local cable television. Decades of research (e. g. Zaller 1992) suggests that in the face of such imbalanced message flows, the advantaged candidate should benefit at the polls. And yet in spite of those advantages, Hillary Clinton lost many of the states that saw the most political advertising.  However, Trump media strategy put more attention on Wisconsin, which Clinton’s team almost entirely ignored until the last two weeks. The report includes a map showing how Clinton’s   TV ads were far more numerous in nearly all media markets than were Trump’s   ads.  Trump’s use of Twitter may have canceled out Clinton’s huge advantage in campaign funds, the report said, saying “perhaps the intense media coverage in 2016 was driven less by the messages of political advertising as it has been in the past and more by Donald Trump’s Twitter account. ” Read the entire report here.",0

8103,How Obamacare Was Designed to Fail and Hillary Clinton Knew It All Along,"If you signed up for Obamacare, you’ve been screwed. 
If you didn’t sign up and opted to pay the penalties , you’ve been screwed. 
If you didn’t sign up, didn’t pay penalties, and stuck with your original insurance company, you’ve been screwed. 
If you didn’t sign up, didn’t pay penalties, and paid cash for medical care, you’ve been screwed. 
Every person in America has been affected, regardless of what you did or did not do. 
That’s because the Affordable Care Act irrevocably ruined our access to medical care at an affordable price in this country. In the mere span of 4 years, the prices have skyrocketed and many families have to pay more in monthly premiums than they pay on their mortgages. Meanwhile, medical costs have been driven up to astronomical prices, making it nearly impossible to pay out-of-pocket for care. 
And these premiums? They are for the crappiest coverage you can imagine. Some families pay $1500-2000 a month for 60% coverage after they pay the $5000 deductible. That’s nearly $20,000 per year before Obamacare pays for a penny of their costs. 
And now…now that insurance companies have gone belly up when they were forced to become a part of the “exchange,” medical costs are skyrocketing, doctors won’t see patients who aren’t “covered,” employers stopped offering insurance as a benefit, and people lost their jobs due to Obamacare costs… 
The whole thing is failing. Even President Obama has admitted it . And now we have proof that it was planned that way. 
But that isn’t the worst of it. The worst of it is that this program was designed to fail and steer us into single payer healthcare, where a government entity can decide what procedures will or will not be covered. They’ll decide who is deserving of cancer treatment and who is not. They’ll mandate things like flu shots and childhood vaccines. 
One of the recent Wikileaks shows that Hillary Clinton knew this and was complicit. 
Melissa Dykes of The Daily Sheeple wrote : 
In an email thread dated September 26, 2015 between Hillary and her senior policy adviser Ann O’Leary titled “Memo on Cadillac Tax for HRC,” Hillary wrote, “Given the politics now w bipartisan support including Schumer, I’ll support repeal w ‘sense of the Senate’ that revenues would have to be found. I’d be open to a range of options to do that. But we have to be careful that the R version passes which begins the unraveling of the ACA .” 
“Which begins the unraveling of the Affordable Care Act.” 
A Democrat supporting Republican legislation to destroy Obamacare on purpose. How many millions have they raked in on this deal and bilked the American people for in Obamacare penalties because they can’t afford the “affordable” health care? And the American people will look at this like a “victory” when it does unravel, even though it has been the plan all along. 
Hillary Clinton, that savior of woman and children, knew that this would fail . She is supporting the legislation to destroy it, leaving everyone in America at the mercy of the horrible replacement that she will dream up to redistribute wealth and deal the death blow to the already-struggling middle class.

8104,Keeping Your Old Phone Alive and Working - The New York Times,"Q. Some of us like our older phones and want to keep them. I know for many just getting a new battery will be enough, so what resources are available for those of us who want to keep our older iPhones, Android phones and other gear going for as long as possible? A. If your older smartphone has aged out of getting the latest operating system software from its maker, you can still find sites selling replacement parts and online tutorials to help you maintain the hardware. However, if the phone is your sole means of communication and cracking it open to upgrade or fix it makes you nervous, consider finding a local repair shop or   service with a fast turnaround to handle the job. If you feel up to the tasks yourself, iFixit is one good site to visit first. Since it began in 2003, iFixit has grown into a large resource hub that provides free illustrated tutorials for all kinds of gadget repairs along with discussion forums and a store for buying tools and replacement parts for many devices.

If your phone has reached the end of its upgrade life and you are worried about vulnerabilities, check your app store for a compatible   security app.",0
8105,Obamacare Architect Gruber Demands “Larger Mandate Penalty”,"Obamacare Architect Gruber Demands “Larger Mandate Penalty” Bureaucrat who said ""stupidity"" of Americans helped get law passed doubles down Paul Joseph Watson - October 26, 2016 Comments 
Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber – the bureaucrat who once bragged that the “stupidity” of the American people was crucial for passing the health care law in the first place – told CNN that the “fix” for Obamacare was to impose a “larger mandate penalty”. CNN’s CAROL COSTELLO: “So let’s talk about how exactly you can fix Obamacare. I just need you to be specific because I think people really want answers. So Hillary Clinton says she can fix Obamacare. So what would one fix that would drive premiums down?” JONATHAN GRUBER: “Look, once again, there’s no sense it has to be fixed. The law is working as designed. However, it could work better. And I think, probably the most important things experts would agree on is we need a larger mandate penalty“… Gruber’s arrogance is incredible. Even after the Obama administration acknowledged that premiums are set to skyrocket next year, Gruber thinks that the answer is to financially punish Americans to an even greater degree. Gruber is essentially admitting that Obamacare is designed to make Americans destitute. “ObamaCare was never designed *not* to overwhelm you with the shifting of massive costs. ObamaCare was designed to crush you in costs,” points out the Conservative Treehouse blog . His comments shouldn’t come as much of a surprise given what Gruber thinks of the American people. A series of videos that emerged in 2014 featured Gruber admitting that Obamacare was deceptively crafted in order to fool “stupid” Americans into not realizing that it would mean massive price hikes and that the law’s “lack of transparency (was) a huge political advantage” in selling it.

8106,"Trump, Price, Pruitt: Your Wednesday Evening Briefing - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Last year was Earth’s hottest year on record. And it’s the third consecutive year that we’ve hit new highs, another first in recorded history. Many experts believe temperatures are heading to levels that will pose a profound threat to the natural world and human civilization. Here’s a close look at the data NASA used to build its analysis. And you can see how much warmer your city was last year here. _____ 2. President Obama held the last news conference of his term. He said he was looking forward to spending quiet time with his family, writing and celebrating his 25th anniversary with Michelle. But he also said that he would speak out whenever he felt America’s “core values” were threatened, listing as examples “systematic discrimination being ratified,” voting obstacles, “institutional efforts to silence dissent or the press,” and efforts to round up and deport children who grew up in the U. S. _____ 3. As for the transition, Donald Trump’s national security team is off to a rocky start, leaving uncertainty on urgent foreign policy issues. His team has barely engaged with the National Security Council below the most senior levels, in part because of a delay in appointing senior staff members and a dearth of people with security clearances. Above, Mr. Obama’s national security adviser, Susan Rice, “passed the baton” to Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn at an event in Washington. _____ 4. At Senate hearings for Mr. Trump’s cabinet picks, the nominee for health and human services secretary, Tom Price, insisted that Americans would not suddenly lose their health insurance. Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina, above, Mr. Trump’s choice for U. N. ambassador, said she rejected a registry for Muslims. Scott Pruitt, the pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, took a swipe at the Obama administration’s reach, saying his first goal would be a return to “common sense and lawful regulations. ” Wilbur Ross, who is up for commerce secretary, acknowledged employing an household worker who might have been undocumented. _____ 5. We’re   a road trip with Trump supporters heading to the inauguration. “He showed that you can stand up for yourself,” said a Massachusetts woman driving down with a cardboard cutout of Mr. Trump in the back seat (above). We’ve pulled together a schedule of events to guide you through the week. The women’s protest march takes place on Saturday, but divisions over abortion rights are straining hopes for a united front. _____ 6. Former President George Bush and his wife, Barbara Bush, were both admitted to a Houston hospital, but doctors expect them to return home by the weekend. Mr. Bush, 92, who has pneumonia, was in stable condition after a procedure to clear his airway. Mrs. Bush was being monitored for “fatigue and coughing,” a hospital spokesman said. _____ 7. The heads of state, billionaire hedge fund managers and technology executives gathered in the Swiss Alps for the World Economic Forum are ready to fight inequality. Sort of. After populist fury propelled upset votes in Britain and the U. S. many of the talks at the annual forum are focusing on making globalization a more lucrative proposition for the masses. But the rhetoric goes only so far. Redistributing wealth and bolstering workers’ bargaining power are not up for discussion. _____ 8. A big health announcement at the World Economic Forum: A new coalition has raised $500 million to fundamentally change the way pandemics are handled. “We’ll have to make sure we do better than we did against Ebola,” said Bill Gates, whose foundation is a main donor. Others are the governments of Japan and Norway, and Britain’s Wellcome Trust. The goal is to develop and stockpile vaccines against three known viral threats and to help create the technology to brew vaccines quickly when needed. _____ 9. Health news on a more individual scale: Contrary to many people’s fears, a new study found that running may actually be good for knees. A   session of running changes the interior of the knee, it suggests, reducing inflammation and lessening levels of a marker of arthritis. _____  10. Finally, a gentle blow against throwaway culture. Repair cafes, which started in Amsterdam and are spreading across the U. S. bring together broken items and volunteers who can fix them. Or at least try. The only guarantee is an interesting experience. “It’s not just about fixing things,” one participant said. “It’s about the community, also. ” _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

8107,"‘Obviously, Marital Vows Mean Nothing to Him’ - The New York Times","Here are the top 10 comments of the week on our digital platforms, as selected by our readers and the journalists who moderate nearly every comment. 1. “ ‘And when you’re a star they let you do it,’ Mr. Trump says. ‘You can do anything.’ ” Pay no taxes. Insult whomever you wish. Shoot an immigrant on Fifth Avenue. Fire the losers who support you.  —   SBMD in Florida, reacting to an article about a tape that captures Donald J. Trump speaking in vulgar terms about groping women.  2. A private conversation which reflects his public behavior. The man has no discretion. Other presidents may have been equally interested in scoring with women but they had the grace not to demean them in public. Obviously, marital vows mean nothing to him, which raises the question what vows will he keep, i. e. [to] uphold the Constitution and fulfill the duties of office of the presidency, so help me God?  —   Angela Mogin in San Mateo, Calif. 3. Trump paid exactly what was required of him by law, so what’s the issue? Should he have offered to pay more than what was owed? How many people on here can say that come tax time they wish to pay over and above what they owe?  —   Tom Langlais on The Times’s Facebook page, responding to our reporting about Mr. Trump’s 1995 taxes, which showed a $916 million loss, enough to enable Mr. Trump to avoid paying federal income tax for up to 18 years. This comment received more than 700 likes.  4. It is nobody’s obligation to pay more tax than the law demands. If Donald Trump could order his affairs in such a way that his income tax responsibility was ZERO for any particular year, or series of years, that’s fine with me. But whether or not Donald Trump pays taxes is NOT the issue. The issue is whether or not the tax system is fair. If the law is such that Donald Trump could have the kind of money he has and actually owe no federal income tax, then the law needs to be changed drastically. So ask yourself: Which party, and which candidate, do you think is sincerely interested in changing the income tax laws to make them fairer for the vast majority of us, rather than something to be manipulated by the wealthy?  —   Boneisha in Atlanta.  5. Mr. Kaine brilliantly phrased the only question worth asking when he repeatedly grilled Mr. Pence, “Why don’t you trust women to make this choice?” I was (surprisingly) moved to tears to hear a man say these words with so much force and conviction. In my 45 years I have never heard a politician stick his neck out for women’s rights like he did.  —   Alibumbayay in Washington, reacting to an   essay by Katha Pollitt about the   debate and the candidates’ views on abortion and women’s rights. This comment received more than 1, 700 reader recommendations.  6. It was so refreshing to hear Mike Pence speak about his   position and not apologize for his beliefs. Some may not see this as the most important factor for voting for a presidential candidate but many of us still feel it is necessary to discuss abortion and the threat to innocent human life. To me it is very important and I want my president to respect and value life. I wish the Democrats cared about abortion and the destruction it causes as much as they do about other political issues such as free education and health care.  —   KMW in New York. This comment received more than 40 reader responses. 7. Far from being a distraction from “real issues,” I think looking at the candidates’ marriage histories tells us a lot about how they may govern as president. My takeaway is that Hillary sees all that is good inside a flawed relationship, and instead of abandoning it when unpleasant truths emerge, she confronts the problem, and works to figure out how to save what’s good and change the bad. That’s exactly her approach to governing. Trump, in contrast, appears to view marriage like car ownership. He loves to show it off, and really enjoys the ride, but upgrades to a newer model every six years or so. That same mentality is evident in his policy prescriptions for international treaties, trade agreements, and public policy. Once something stops being 100% favorable to him, it’s time to replace it with something brand new, without any real   analysis or thought to   consequences. I think any voter, regardless of party, who has survived and flourished in a   relationship will clearly recognize how meaningful the wisdom and tolerance, and empathy, and capacity for compromise that marriage engenders is perhaps the most telling qualification for serving as president.  —   DavidH in Brooklyn, responding to an article about Hillary Clinton’s reactions to Bill Clinton’s affairs during their political careers. This comment received more than 700 reader recommendations. 8. I really hope that common ground can be found. A telescope is no   power plant and while it certainly has environmental impacts, those impacts can be reduced to a minimum, when given a little attention and foresight. I believe the protests against this particular telescope, and the telescopes in general, are more of a symptom of how the native [Hawaiians] feel about their general treatment and how little they have been involved in processes affecting their cultural and historical backgrounds. This is a possibility for them to shine some light on their situation and get media attention. If both sides are   a solution can surely be found.  —   Pierre Markuse in Germany, reacting to an article about a clash between astronomers and native Hawaiians over a proposed telescope, which would be the biggest and most expensive of its kind in the Northern Hemisphere.  9. My    mom, when she feels she has been served well, loves to ask for the manager. She then compliments like crazy, whoever it was that was kind to her. Whether it’s the porter in her building, a waiter, a store clerk or a receptionist, she is sure to inform their boss. “People are so fast to complain,” she likes to say, “but it’s so easy to take the time to be thankful. ” Mr. DeMarco’s letter reminds me of my mom. No matter the circumstance, acknowledge and appreciate a job well done.  —   Forbes in New York, reacting to an article about a letter sent to the hospital staff by a man after his wife died following an asthma attack, thanking them for caring for her, their families and himself. 10. A man goes for a walk and finds a bottle on a beach. When he pops the cork a genie appears and says, “I shall grant you one wish. ” The man says, “I want to see peace in the Middle East. ” He then hands the genie a map of the Middle East. The genie studies the map for a while and finally says, “What you wish for is impossible. So I shall grant you another wish. ” The man says, “I’ve always wanted to see the Cubs in a World Series. ” The genie replies, “Let me see that map again. ”  —   Marianne in Edmonds, Wash. reacting to an article about whether the Chicago Cubs might win a World Series title for the first time since 1908.",0
8108,"Under Trump, Approach to Civil Rights Law Is Likely to Change Definitively - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   In the final weeks of the Obama administration, the Justice Department won the first   case involving a transgender victim and sued two cities for blocking mosques from opening. Prosecutors settled   charges with two banks, then sued a third. They filed legal briefs on behalf of New York teenagers being held in solitary confinement, and accused Louisiana of forcing mentally ill patients into nursing homes. And then, with days remaining, prosecutors announced a deal to overhaul Baltimore’s Police Department and accused Chicago of unconstitutional police abuses. The moves capped a historic and sometimes controversial   span in which the Justice Department pushed the frontiers of civil rights laws, inserting itself into private lawsuits and siding with transgender students, juvenile prisoners, the homeless, the blind, and people who videotape police officers. On issues of gay rights, policing, criminal justice, voting and more, government lawyers argued for a broad interpretation of civil rights laws, a view that they consistently said would put them on the right side of history. Few areas of federal policy are likely to change so definitively.   Donald Trump’s nominee to be attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, opposes not only the Justice Department’s specific policies on civil rights but its entire approach. While liberal Democrats have criticized Mr. Sessions’s views on specific issues like gay marriage and voting, the larger difference is how differently the Trump administration will view the government’s role in those areas. Vanita Gupta, the head of the civil rights division and the face of the Obama administration’s efforts over the past two years, has spoken about the power “to bend the arc of history itself  —   not merely by serving your clients, but by harnessing the law as a force for positive change. ” “The project of civil rights has always demanded creativity,” she said in an interview. “It requires being bold. Often that means going against the grain of   popular thinking. Or it requires going to the more expansive reading of the law to ensure we are actually ensuring equal protection for everyone. ” Mr. Sessions, a former federal prosecutor, has spoken harshly about lawyers and judges who try to push the law in certain directions  —   “a postmodern philosophy that elevates outcomes over law,” he has called it. Congress makes laws, he has said, and he was outraged when Eric H. Holder Jr. the former attorney general, refused to defend a law banning gay marriage and told his state counterparts that they could ethically do the same regarding state bans. “It was shameful and disgraceful and an abandonment of the rule of law,” Mr. Sessions said in 2015. “I’m not happy about what’s happened to my Department of Justice. ” At this confirmation hearing, Mr. Sessions harkened to the era of segregation in arguing that there was no need for the federal government to become involved in prosecuting crimes against women or gay people that were already being prosecuted locally. “I am not sure women or people with different sexual orientations face that kind of discrimination. I just don’t see it,” Mr. Sessions said, denying that he was   or  . The Obama administration saw its mandate much more broadly. One of the clearest examples of this philosophy came last year, when Ms. Gupta wrote a letter to every public school district in the country and told them to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms that matched their gender identity. The policy touched off a furious debate and became a touchstone for conservatives who saw the Obama administration as out of touch and making its own laws. Courts have not settled the question of whether the federal   laws apply in matters of gender identity. But Justice Department lawyers, who were fielding questions from school officials, interpreted those protections broadly. Congress created the civil rights division as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1957, and its mission and leadership have been the subject of frequent debate. President Reagan’s civil rights chief, William Bradford Reynolds, faced criticism from advocacy groups who said he refused to enforce civil rights laws. President Clinton’s choice to lead the division, Bill Lann Lee, served his tenure in an acting capacity after the Senate refused to confirm him, largely over his support for affirmative action. One of Mr. Obama’s nominees, Debo P. Adegbile, was rejected by the Senate over his prior representation of a man convicted of killing a Philadelphia police officer. In response, Mr. Obama never nominated Ms. Gupta to the post. Like Mr. Lee, she has served her tenure in an acting capacity. She started work amid unrest in Ferguson, Mo. where angry and sometimes violent demonstrators protested the police shooting of an unarmed black teenager and the way police officers treated African Americans. “History simmers beneath the surface in more communities than just Ferguson,” Mr. Holder said at the time as he cast the Justice Department as a voice for those who have felt abused and ignored for years. The Justice Department ultimately cleared the officer involved in the shooting but sued the city, accusing its officers of longstanding abuses of force in encounters with black residents. Ferguson was the most   target of the department’s campaign to use civil rights laws to force changes in police policy. Congress gave the Justice Department that authority in 1994 after the police beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles, but no administration has used that power nearly as aggressively. The Obama administration has opened two dozen such investigations and sued cities to make policing changes. Police groups have criticized the administration’s approach. James O. Pasco Jr. executive director of the National Fraternal Order of Police, said officers were particularly concerned with the administration’s early talk. Tom Perez, Mr. Obama’s first civil rights chief, declared his division was “once again open for business,” and promised more investigations into police departments. “During his entire tenure there, we were never reached out to once. Not once,” Mr. Pasco said. “He went out of his way to make police officers the villains. ” Mr. Pasco has said collaboration with    officers has since improved and spoke glowingly of Ms. Gupta. But many officers still say the Justice Department has portrayed them unfairly, and Mr. Sessions shares that belief. “These lawsuits undermine the respect for police officers and create an impression that the entire department is not doing their work consistent with fidelity to law and fairness,” Mr. Sessions said at his confirmation hearing. He said civil rights lawsuits hurt morale and changed the way citizens viewed the police. “And we need to be careful before we do that. ” In 2015, Mr. Sessions sharply questioned Ms. Gupta about her views on policing and her A. C. L. U. advocacy. “You come from a background that indicates an aggressiveness in these areas,” he said. Ms. Gupta said such questions reflect a double standard. “I don’t think the same comment gets made of criminal prosecutors who’ve obtained a lot of convictions,” she said in an interview, “that they’re too aggressive to do their jobs effectively. ” She added, “I was an aggressive civil rights chief, and I’m proud of that. ” Ms. Gupta will leave government with the administration but a team of career lawyers remains. Many view Mr. Sessions’ nomination warily, but senior officials have urged an open mind. Ms. Gupta said she hopes her successor will have one, too. “This is not abstract work done for its own sake,” she said. “It is fundamentally about the people whose rights we protect. ”",0
8109,"Capitalism Is Doomed — Without Alternatives, So Are We","‘Though it appears as if rumors of capitalism’s imminent demise have been greatly exaggerated,’ writes Johnson, ‘there is good reason to believe that its remarkable ability to adapt and evolve in the face of frequent (self-induced) shocks has reached a breaking point.’ In 1946, George Orwell pondered the fragility of the capitalist order.
Reviewing the work of the influential theorist James Burnham, Orwell presaged several concepts that would later form the groundwork for his best-known novel, 1984.
“Not only is the best of capitalism behind us, but the worst of it may lie just ahead.”
In his book The Managerial Revolution , Burnham envisioned, as Orwell put it , “a new kind of planned, centralised society which will be neither capitalist nor, in any accepted sense of the word, democratic. The rulers of this new society will be the people who effectively control the means of production.”
“The real question,” Orwell adds, “is not whether the people who wipe their boots on us during the next fifty years are to be called managers, bureaucrats, or politicians: the question is whether capitalism, now obviously doomed, is to give way to oligarchy or to true democracy.”
While Orwell was wary of Burnham’s worldview and of his more specific predictions, he agreed that the relationship between capitalism and democracy has always been, and always will be, a precarious one.
“For quite fifty years past,” Orwell noted, “the general drift has almost certainly been towards oligarchy.”
Pointing to the concentration of political and economic power in the hands of the few and acknowledging “the weakness of the proletariat against the centralised state,” Orwell was far from optimistic about the future — but he was quite certain that the economic status quo would eventually give way.
Recent events, and the material circumstances of much of the world’s population, have prompted serious examinations of the same questions Orwell was considering seven decades ago. And though it appears as if rumors of capitalism’s imminent demise have been greatly exaggerated, there is good reason to believe that its remarkable ability to adapt and evolve in the face of frequent (self-induced) shocks has reached a breaking point.
Widespread discontent over stagnant incomes and the uneven prosperity brought about by neoliberal globalization has, in 2016, come to a head in striking fashion; Donald Trump, Brexit, and the rise of far-right parties in Europe have many questioning previously sacred assumptions.
“Is the marriage between liberal democracy and global capitalism an enduring one?” asked Martin Wolf, a formidable commentator in one of the world’s leading business papers, the Financial Times .
This was no rhetorical softball; Wolf is genuinely concerned that the winners of globalization have grown complacent, that they have “taken for granted” a couple that was only tenuously compatible to begin with. He also worries, rightly, that they have downplayed the concerns of the “losers.”
Wolf concludes that “if the legitimacy of our democratic political systems is to be maintained, economic policy must be orientated towards promoting the interests of the many not the few; in the first place would be the citizenry, to whom the politicians are accountable.”
Not all members of the commentariat share Wolf’s willingness to engage with these cherished assumptions, however. Indeed, many analysts have reserved their ire not for failing institutions or policies but for the public, reviving Walter Lippmann’s characterization of the masses as a “bewildered herd” that, if left to its own devices, is sure to usher in a regime of chaos.
“It’s time,” declared Foreign Policy ‘s James Traub, channeling the sentiments of Josh Barro, “for the elites to rise up against the ignorant masses.”
Apologists like Traub and Barro — just two among many — speak and write as if the leash previously restraining the “herd” has been loosened, and that the resulting freedom has laid bare what elitists have long believed to be the case: To use Barro’s infamous words , “Elites are usually elite for good reason, and tend to have better judgment than the average person.” They point to the rise of Donald Trump as evidence of an intolerable democratic surplus — evidence, in short, of what the masses will do if granted a loud enough voice.
Aside from being conveniently self-serving, this narrative is also false.
Far from loosening the leash, elites have consolidated power to an unprecedented extent , and they have used their influence to undercut democratic movements and hijack public institutions. The resulting concentration of wealth and political power is jarring, and it puts the lie to the farcical notion that elites are a persecuted minority.
But, in the midst of these anti-democratic diatribes, fascinating and important critiques of a rather different nature have emerged.
“Far from loosening the leash, elites have consolidated power to an unprecedented extent , and they have used their influence to undercut democratic movements and hijack public institutions.”
Instead of urging us to align Against Democracy , to use the name of a recent book by the libertarian political philosopher Jason Brennan, many are arguing that it is capitalism, and not the excesses of the democratic process, that has provided figures like Trump a launching pad.
In his book Postcapitalism , Paul Mason argues that the rapid emergence of information technology has corroded the boundaries of the market; “capitalism,” he insists, “has reached the limits of its capacity to adapt.” And its attempts to reach beyond these limits have fostered an economic environment defined by instability, crippling austerity for the many, and rapid accumulation of wealth for the few.
According to Oxfam, the global 1 percent now owns as much wealth as the bottom 99 percent. CEO pay has continued to soar. And though post-crisis reforms have carried soaring promises of stability, the financial sector is still far too large , and many of the banks harmed by the crash they created are back and nearly as powerful as ever .",0

8111,"Halloween Is Coming, Vladimir Putin Isn’t","Photo by Jedimentat44 | CC BY 2.0 I would not rank Vladimir Putin high on a list of leaders. If I lived in Russia I’d be working for major reforms in my government, just as I’m doing where I do live, in the United States. I regularly go on Russian media and criticize the Russian government. Russia is illegally and immorally bombing people in Syria, just as the United States is doing in Syria, Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen. But there are Putin Halloween masks for sale in U.S. stores. Time magazine has Putin on the cover accusing him of trying to damage U.S. elections. A Google search for “Hitler Putin” brings back 11 million results. This demonization of a foreign leader should frighten us more than that leader himself. Wars do not only kill, if they kill at all, a foreign leader. But they do kill large numbers of children, grandparents, mothers, and fathers. They enrage people, endanger us, damage the natural environment, justify the removal of our rights, and divert unfathomable resources from areas where they could have done a world of good. The actual Adolph Hitler had no plans or ability to invade the United States and was defeated primarily by Russians who lost at least 27 million lives in the process. For over 70 years, since the end of World War II, the United States has bombed dozens of nations, and in every case that I am aware of U.S. officials have labeled a targeted individual “Hitler.” In May the Politico newspaper reported on Pentagon testimony in Congress to the effect that Russia had a superior and threatening military, but followed that with this: “‘This is the “Chicken-Little, sky-is-falling” set in the Army,’ the senior Pentagon officer said. ‘These guys want us to believe the Russians are 10 feet tall. There’s a simpler explanation: The Army is looking for a purpose, and a bigger chunk of the budget. And the best way to get that is to paint the Russians as being able to land in our rear and on both of our flanks at the same time. What a crock.” Politico then cited a less-than-credible “study” of Russian military superiority and aggression and added: “While the reporting about the Army study made headlines in the major media, a large number in the military’s influential retired community, including former senior Army officers, rolled their eyes.” The United States has overseen the expansion of NATO to Russia’s border. The buffer zone of the last Cold War is gone. U.S./NATO missile bases are now in Romania and being built in Poland. The U.S. has organized in Eastern Europe the largest military exercises seen there since World War II. The U.S. role in supporting a violent coup that created an anti-Russian government in Ukraine was exposed before the coup. When the people of Crimea voted overwhelmingly to rejoin Russia, the U.S. media characterized Russian actions that resulted in total casualties of zero as “an invasion of Ukraine.” Without presenting us with any evidence, the U.S. government has accused Russia of shooting down an airplane, of exposing the corruption within the Democratic National Committee (shouldn’t we be grateful?), and of somehow sabotaging the upcoming U.S. election. Every atrocity committed by Russia or Syria in Syria is big news. Every U.S. atrocity there is a yawn. The stakes are high every time the United States overthrows a government. The disasters of Iraq and Libya have fueled the current catastrophes in those countries and Syria and around the region. But the stakes are higher when the United States and Russia confront each other. These are nuclear nations. Russia has announced that it is considering re-opening a base in Cuba. The Cuban Missile Crisis, in case anyone has forgotten, was one of the many times since the creation of nuclear weapons that humanity has come close to intentionally or accidentally destroying itself. The nukes are of far greater strength now. And our understanding has grown of how a limited nuclear war anywhere on earth would create a crop-destroying nuclear winter followed by mass starvation. We don’t need to take this sort of risk. To avoid it we need to turn away from war. And that means we need to stop using human rights abuses by targeted governments as excuses to bomb people. We should protect human rights through leadership by example and consistent application of the rule of law. Doing so would then open the United States up to the possibility of opposing human rights abuses by some of the nasty governments that it props up and sells or gives weapons to, beginning perhaps with Saudi Arabia, a monarchy that makes Vladimir Putin look like Mohandas Gandhi.

8112,Refugees Encounter a Foreign Word: Welcome - The New York Times,"TORONTO  —   One frigid day in February, Kerry McLorg drove to an airport hotel here to pick up a family of Syrian refugees. She was cautious by nature, with a job poring over insurance data, but she had never even spoken to the people who were about to move into her basement. “I don’t know if they even know we exist,” she said. At the hotel, Abdullah Mohammad’s room phone rang, and an interpreter told him to go downstairs. His children’s only belongings were in pink plastic bags, and the family’s documents lay in a white paper bag printed with a Canadian flag. His sponsors had come, he was told. He had no idea what that meant. Across Canada, ordinary citizens, distressed by news reports of drowning children and the shunning of desperate migrants, are intervening in one of the world’s most pressing problems. Their country allows them a rare power and responsibility: They can band together in small groups and personally resettle  —   essentially adopt  —   a refugee family. In Toronto alone, hockey moms,   friends, book club members, poker buddies and lawyers have formed circles to take in Syrian families. The Canadian government says sponsors officially number in the thousands, but the groups have many more extended members. When Ms. McLorg walked into the hotel lobby to meet Mr. Mohammad and his wife, Eman, she had a letter to explain how sponsorship worked: For one year, Ms. McLorg and her group would provide financial and practical support, from subsidizing food and rent to supplying clothes to helping them learn English and find work. She and her partners had already raised more than 40, 000 Canadian dollars (about $30, 700) selected an apartment, talked to the local school and found a nearby mosque. Ms. McLorg, the mother of two teenagers, made her way through the crowded lobby, a kind of purgatory for newly arrived Syrians. Another member of the group clutched a welcome sign she had written in Arabic but then realized she could not tell if the words faced up or down. When the Mohammads appeared, Ms. McLorg asked their permission to shake hands and took in the people standing before her, no longer just names on a form. Mr. Mohammad looked older than his 35 years. His wife was unreadable, wearing a flowing niqab that obscured her face except for a narrow slot for her eyes. Their four children, all under 10, wore donated parkas with the tags still on. For the Mohammads, who had been in Canada less than 48 hours, the signals were even harder to read. In Syria, Abdullah had worked in his family’s grocery stores and Eman had been a nurse, but after three years of barely hanging on in Jordan, they were not used to being wanted or welcomed. “You mean we’re leaving the hotel?” Abdullah asked. To himself, he was wondering, “What do these people want in return?” Much of the world is reacting to the refugee crisis  —   21 million displaced from their countries, nearly five million of them Syrian  —   with hesitation or hostility. Greece shipped desperate migrants back to Turkey Denmark confiscated their valuables and even Germany, which has accepted more than half a million refugees, is struggling with growing resistance to them. Broader anxiety about immigration and borders helped motivate Britons to take the extraordinary step last week of voting to leave the European Union. In the United States, even before the Orlando massacre spawned new dread about “lone wolf” terrorism, a majority of American governors said they wanted to block Syrian refugees because some could be dangerous. Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has called for temporary bans on all Muslims from entering the country and recently warned that Syrian refugees would cause “big problems in the future. ” The Obama administration promised to take in 10, 000 Syrians by Sept. 30 but has so far admitted about half that many. Just across the border, however, the Canadian government can barely keep up with the demand to welcome them. Many volunteers felt called to action by the photograph of Alan Kurdi, the Syrian toddler whose body washed up last fall on a Turkish beach. He had only a slight connection to Canada  —   his aunt lived near Vancouver  —   but his death caused recrimination so strong it helped elect an idealistic,   prime minister, Justin Trudeau. The Toronto Star greeted the first planeload by splashing “Welcome to Canada” in English and Arabic across its front page. Eager sponsors toured local Middle Eastern supermarkets to learn what to buy and cook and used a   hotline for instant Arabic translation. Impatient   sponsors  —   “an angry mob of ” The Star called them  —   have been seeking more families. The new government committed to taking in 25, 000 Syrian refugees and then raised the total by tens of thousands. “I can’t provide refugees fast enough for all the Canadians who want to sponsor them,” John McCallum, the country’s immigration minister, said in an interview. In the ideal version of private sponsorship, the groups become concierges and surrogate family members who help integrate the outsiders, called “New Canadians. ” The hope is that the Syrians will form bonds with those unlike them, from openly gay sponsors to business owners who will help them find jobs to lifelong residents who will take them skating and canoeing. Ms. McLorg’s group of neighbors and friends includes doctors, economists, a lawyer, an artist, teachers and a bookkeeper. Advocates for sponsorship believe that private citizens can achieve more than the government alone, raising the number of refugees admitted, guiding newcomers more effectively and potentially helping solve the puzzle of how best to resettle Muslims in Western countries. Some advocates even talk about extending the Canadian system across the globe. (Slightly fewer than half of the Syrian refugees who recently arrived in Canada have private sponsors, including some deemed particularly vulnerable who get additional public funds. The rest are resettled by the government.) The fear is that all of this effort could end badly, with the Canadians looking naïve in more ways than one. The Syrians are screened, and many sponsors and refugees take offense at the notion that they could be dangerous, saying they are often victims of terrorism themselves. But American officials point out that it is very difficult to track activity in the chaotic, multifaceted Syrian war. Several Islamic State members involved in the 2015 Paris attacks arrived on Europe’s shores from Syria posing as refugees. Some of the refugees in Canada have   and   backgrounds, including a businessman who started a Canadian version of his medical marketing company within a month after arriving. But many more face steep paths to integration, with no money of their own, uncertain employment prospects and huge cultural gaps. Some had never heard of Canada until shortly before coming here, and a significant number are illiterate in Arabic, which makes learning English  —   or reading a street sign or sending an email in any language  —   a titanic task. No one knows how refugees will navigate the currents of longing, trauma, dependence or resentment they may feel. And volunteers cannot fully anticipate what they may confront  —   clashing expectations of whether Syrian women should work, tensions over how money is spent, families that are still dependent when the year is up, disagreements within sponsor groups. Still, by   only eight weeks after their first encounter with Ms. McLorg, the Mohammads had a downtown apartment with a pristine kitchen, bikes for the children to zip around the courtyard, and a Canadian flag taped to their window. The sponsors knew the children’s shoe sizes Abdullah and Eman still had keys to Ms. McLorg’s house. He studied the neighborhood’s supermarkets, and his wife took a counseling course so she could help others who had experienced dislocation and loss. When the male sponsors visited, she sat at the dining room table with them instead of eating in the kitchen  —   as she would have done back home  —   as long as her husband was around, too. Mr. Mohammad searched for the right words to describe what the sponsors had done for him. “It’s like I’ve been on fire, and now I’m safe in the water,” he said. But he and other new arrivals were beginning to confront fresh questions: How were they supposed to work with these enthusiastic strangers? What would it mean to reinvent their lives under their watch? As sponsors sign the paperwork that commits them, no one really explains the potential range of their unofficial duties: showing a newcomer to spit in a dentist’s sink by miming the motions, rushing over late at night to calm a   family terrified by a garage door blown open by the wind, or using Google Translate to tell children who lived through war and exile that they are supposed to wear pink at school for   day. One April morning, Liz Stark, the grandmother in chief of another sponsor group, could not find Mouhamad Ahmed, the father in the family. She tried his phone and waited in vain outside their new apartment. This was a problem: Wissam, his wife, was in labor with their fifth child. The pregnancy had been anxious because the couple had lost even more than their old life in Syria, where Mr. Ahmed used to farm wheat, cotton and cumin. They had spent years in a refugee camp in Lebanon, their three children never attending school because tuition was too expensive. Ms. Ahmed became pregnant there with their fourth child, but labor was troubled and the girl lived only six hours. They named her Amira, which means princess. “I was thinking maybe the same thing will happen to me here as well,” Ms. Ahmed said. As Ms. Stark hunted for Mr. Ahmed, Peggy Karas, another sponsor, stayed at the hospital massaging Ms. Ahmed’s hand during contractions. Like other such pairs, the two women had come together through opaque, bureaucratic machinery. A United Nations agency referred Ms. Ahmed and her family to Canadian officials who interviewed and screened them, then passed their file to a new nonprofit dedicated to matching Syrians with private sponsors, who had 24 hours to say yes or no based on the barest of details. Ms. Stark and many of her   were retired teachers, bossy and doting, and they had become hellbent on bringing this new child into the world safely. They had introduced Ms. Ahmed to the vitamins she would take, the machines that would monitor her, the hospital ward where she would deliver. The older women had repeated the doctors’ reassurances that all would go smoothly this time. They had helped her pick out tiny outfits and baby gear, but she was too superstitious to take them home, so they formed a small mountain in a sponsor’s living room. Ms. Stark had recruited another newly arrived Syrian refugee to serve as an interpreter during labor. When she finally found Mr. Ahmed, who had been playing soccer, unaware of what was happening, she ushered him to the hospital room, where he took over holding his wife’s hand. Suddenly a medical team rushed her away, saying the umbilical cord was in a dangerous position and she needed an emergency cesarean section. Ms. Ahmed, terrified, asked her husband to take care of their children if she did not survive. As Mr. Ahmed collapsed, sobbing, the sponsors asked his permission to pray. When a nurse finally appeared to say the newborn was healthy, whisked off to intensive care for observation, Ms. Ahmed said she would not believe it until she held the baby, but Mr. Ahmed was jubilant. He called his father in Syria and let him choose a name: Julia, the family’s first Canadian citizen. Once the infant was home, she went from being the Ahmed family member the sponsors worried about most to the one they fretted about least. She would grow up hearing English, going to Canadian preschool and beyond. For her siblings  —      twins, a boy and a girl, and an    brother  —   the sponsors found a program for children who had never been to school. Their father, who had gone through only second grade, worked on learning enough English to find a job. Ms. Ahmed worried about her children. “What if my kids don’t adjust, don’t settle in school very well?” she asked. Everyone was on a deadline: After one year, the sponsors’ obligation ends, and the families are expected to become  . Toronto rents are high, and the Ahmeds may not be able to stay in the relatively inexpensive apartment the sponsors found for them  —   the monthly rent is 1, 400 Canadian dollars, or about $1, 100  —   even if Mr. Ahmed finds a job. Ms. Stark was optimistic because she had lived through other versions of this story. Almost four decades ago, as a young geography teacher, she joined in the first mass wave of Canadian private sponsorship, in which citizens resettled tens of thousands of Vietnamese, Cambodians and Hmong. She helped sponsor three Vietnamese brothers and a Cambodian family, later attending their weddings, celebrating the births of their children and watching them find their places in Toronto, a city so diverse that half the population is  . Now some former Southeast Asian refugees are completing the cycle by sponsoring Syrians. Like many sponsors, Ms. Stark believes that her country is especially suited to resettling refugees, with its vast size, strong social welfare system, and a government that emphasizes multiculturalism. Canada has not endured acts of terrorism like the Sept. 11 hijackings or the Paris attacks, or even an assault on the scale of the Orlando nightclub killings. And with only one land border, little illegal immigration and a tenth of the population of the United States, Canada is hungry for migrants. Officials around the country have clamored to bring Syrian refugees to their provinces. “We are an accident of geography and history,” said Ratna Omidvar, who   Lifeline Syria, a group that matches Syrians with sponsors. Opposition to the influx has been relatively muted. The Conservative Party argues that the country is taking in more refugees than it can provide for, but supports accepting Syrians. Some Canadians complain that the country should take care of its own first, and new chapters of the Soldiers of Odin, a European   group, have cropped up in recent months. A few incidents targeting Syrians  —   graffiti reading “Syrians go home and die” at a Calgary school, a pepper spray attack at an event welcoming refugees  —   drew widespread condemnation. One May evening, three weeks after Julia’s birth, Ms. Stark stopped by the Ahmeds’ apartment with a plastic table for the balcony and cradled the baby. She had a new grandchild, but she had spent more time with Julia. The   retirees were planning a party to welcome her the Syrian way, by feasting on a newly slaughtered lamb on her 40th day. Meanwhile, Mr. Ahmed had adopted a new custom: He sometimes brought his wife breakfast in bed and got the children ready. “When I came here, I saw men just doing everything that women do in Syria,” he said. “And I thought, yeah, of course, I will do the same. ” That night, Ms. Ahmed handed Ms. Stark a form from the twins’ school, unsure what it was about. “What? You’re going to the Blue Jays game?” she crowed to the boy, Majed, who grinned back under his dark curls. Then she turned to his parents. “This costs money, but your sponsors will pay for it because this is important. ” The Ahmeds were so frugal that their benefactors sometimes worried whether they were buying enough to eat. Ms. Ahmed said they wanted to purchase no more than the family needed. “The sponsors worked for the money they are giving us, and we’re not just going to throw it in the garbage,” she explained later. Before leaving, Ms. Stark explained the proper Tylenol dosage for the couple’s daughter, Zahiya, who had a fever. She and her twin now spent their school bus rides exchanging language lessons with a pair of Chinese brothers, pointing to objects and naming them. One day when their parents tried to bring them home after a dentist appointment, the Syrian children refused, insisting on returning to school for the time remaining. English words were starting to emerge from the older children’s mouths, but the sponsors and the adult refugees could barely understand one another without help, often relying on mimed gestures or balky translation apps. Even when the groups use interpreters, they often get stuck in roundelays of Canadian and Syrian courtesy, so reluctant to impose that they do not say what they mean. Ms. Ahmed, who had a   education and was not attending English classes because she was home with a newborn, said that not being able to communicate was painful. “Sometimes I feel like I am losing my mind,” she said, because she felt so close to the sponsors but could not even tell them little things about the baby. Still, some groups faced greater challenges. Some Syrians have backed out before traveling to Canada, intimidated by the geographic and cultural leap. Sam Nammoura, a refugee advocate in Calgary, said he was tracking dozens of cases in which   sponsored friends and relatives and then left them destitute. Other pairings have turned out to be mismatches of expectations one formerly   Syrian family expressed disappointment that its apartment was a     and lacked a washing machine. Others were shocked to discover that their sponsors were posting Facebook messages and blog entries about them that strangers could read. Even when sponsors and refugees become enmeshed in one another’s lives, they do not fully know one another. Not every family is open about its history, and many sponsors would like to know the worst but do not want to ask. (The Ahmeds and the Mohammads asked not to be identified by their full surnames, and were reluctant to publicly share details of their experiences in Syria because they feared reprisals against relatives still there. Most of the refugees in this article left Syria around 2013, during fighting between the Assad regime and rebels.) The sponsors do not share everything about themselves, either. Emma Waverman, the leader of another cluster, was telling her   about the stirring bar mitzvah speech her son had written about the Syrians they were aiding when another woman stopped her. “Do they know we’re Jewish?” she asked. Few issues are as delicate as how hard the sponsors should push and when the refugees can say no. Should the Syrians live close to downtown sponsors or in   neighborhoods with more Middle Easterners  —   and is it right for sponsors to decide without consulting them? The Canadians raise tens of thousands of dollars for each newcomer family who controls how it is spent? Some worry that sponsors are overpowering the refugees with the force of their enthusiasm. Kamal   a journalism professor at Ryerson University who is originally from Yemen, said he had noticed a patronizing tone, as when some sponsors highlighted their volunteering on social media. “The white savior narrative comes into play,” he said. When Muaz and Sawsan Ballani and their    son arrived here in February, they seemed so disoriented and alone that their sponsors became especially eager to nurture them. Mr. Ballani, 26, had once worked in his father’s clothing store, which was run out of their home. Now he introduced himself to his sponsors by showing them a picture of his oldest brother: not a smiling snapshot, but an image of the young man lying dead back home, blood streaming from his body. (Mr. Ballani believed that his brother had been caught in fighting between the regime and the opposition, but in the chaos of the conflict, he said, he could not learn more.) Sawsan wed Muaz when she was 16 in an arranged marriage, rushed because of bombings and failing electricity a month later, they fled. Now 20, she had not seen her family since. The couple had been languishing in Jordan, sleeping in a house crammed with too many people, not enough beds or blankets, and ants that crawled over their son, named Abdulrahman, after Mr. Ballani’s dead brother, and nicknamed Aboudi. One of Mr. Ballani’s brothers was still stuck in the house in Jordan, he said, and his brother’s widow was living in a park in Syria with her three children, foraging for food. “If we hadn’t come here, we would have died,” he said. The family’s sponsors started as mostly strangers to one another  —   a few former colleagues, a friend of a friend. Helga Breier, a market research consultant and one of the organizers, was drawn into sponsorship last summer, when she felt haunted during her Mediterranean vacation by the suffering across the water. The Ballanis became their galvanizing cause. Together they found a bright apartment near their homes and countered the bareness  —   the family had few belongings  —   with cheery posters and tags labeling everything in English: lamp, cupboard, wall, door. The couple spoke almost no English, so to teach Mr. Ballani to get where he needed to go, the sponsors helped him photograph the route. When Aboudi threw tantrums in day care, they sat with him so his mother could stay in language class. The couple cooked elaborate Middle Eastern   meals for the sponsors and mostly welcomed their interventions. Mr. Ballani donned a Toronto Maple Leafs hat that he wore day after day, and his wife gamely hopped on a toboggan. Sometimes the sponsors barely hid their views of how the Ballanis should adjust. At a spring potluck dinner, Ms. Ballani described how she had recently traveled by subway on her own, a trip she could not have imagined taking just a few weeks before. The sponsors around the table, firm feminists, asked what else she might like to do herself. She turned to her husband. “I’m going to ask you an honest question,” she said. “Would you let me work here?” As they waited for the answer, the Canadian women held their breath. “Yes, but I wouldn’t have let you work back” in Jordan, he said, adding that even women who behaved traditionally there were often harassed and that those who appeared too independent faced worse. Ms. Ballani pressed forward: She wanted to attend university and have a career of her own, she said, a daunting set of goals for a woman with only a   education. The Canadians beamed two   each other. At the same time, the sponsors worried that they were becoming helicopter parents, as Ms. Breier put it. When the Syrians skipped English lessons (Aboudi sometimes kept them awake at night) or missed an appointment for donated dental services (a misunderstanding) the sponsors agonized over what to say, debating on the messaging app Slack. Should they show up every morning at the Ballanis’ apartment to make sure they got to class? Aboudi did not nap regularly and seemed to consume a lot of sugar  —   he drank soda, sometimes for breakfast  —   so should they offer advice? Mr. Nammoura, the refugee advocate in Calgary, said he saw a pattern among the cases. The Canadians, who feel responsible for the refugees’ success, want to give them as much help and direction as possible. But many Syrians, finally safe after years of war and flight, want to exhale before launching into language regimens and job searches, and sometimes feel that sponsors are meddling. When the Ballani sponsors sought advice from an Arab community center caseworker and an older Syrian mother, they were told to be harsher  —   to threaten fines or loss of sponsorship if the couple did not accept their guidance. Instead, the sponsors tried to strike a balance, being insistent on issues like health and education but easing off in other areas. A few weeks before Ramadan, the Ballanis raised the prospect of missing school during the month of long fasts. “It’s really hard because we have to fast 16 or 18 hours,” Muaz Ballani told the sponsors. Ms. Breier and her partners dismissed the idea, saying they feared that the couple would lose their slots if they missed too many classes. The Ballanis quickly relented. It was not clear how much freedom they felt to express disagreement to outsiders they seemed reluctant to acknowledge anything but gratitude. That morning, Ms. Ballani said she and her husband never had different opinions from the sponsors. “We’ve never felt like they were telling us what to do,” she added. Another weekend, the extended group gathered for a picnic, the first birthday party anyone had thrown for Mr. Ballani. He was deeply moved by the gesture. “A human life has value here,” he had said in an interview. “You can feel it everywhere. ” But the conversation at the party turned to his relatives in Syria, and he seemed distant as the Canadians presented his cake. Like many of the newcomers, he regularly receives calls and texts from family members, some in harrowing straits, as news reports describe starvation back home and mass drownings in the Mediterranean. “I am really thankful to them I don’t want them to misunderstand,” he said later about the sponsors. “It’s like I’m two people at the same time, one happy and one unhappy,” because of his family’s continued suffering. The sponsors had been working on that, too, helping match Mr. Ballani’s brother in Jordan with another Toronto sponsor group and laboring over the paperwork. By late spring they had news: His relatives could arrive by year’s end. Mr. Ballani, overjoyed, started planning what he would show his relatives in the city that had taken him in. This time, he would be the guide. “Now it’s my turn to help,” he said. Three months after the Mohammads’ awkward first meeting with Kerry McLorg and the other sponsors at the airport hotel, they had clicked into a productive rhythm, settling into Canada faster than anyone had expected. They went on a picnic to Niagara Falls and danced around a maypole at a spring festival. The girls won     honors. Bayan, the eldest, who had whipped past the boys she raced on Jordanian streets, was now beating runners from schools across the city. When the sponsors came to give informal language lessons, Ahmad, the    liked to try new phrases in English, such as “Good job!” Still, there was some culture shock. When Abdullah Mohammad took the children to a community pool, he encountered a woman in a string bikini. “I ran away,” he said later. “I’ve never seen that before in my life. ” Ms. McLorg, measured and methodical, had organized the sponsor group, but the most energetic member was an artist named Susan Stewart, with a seemingly endless list of activities for the family and long email exchanges with the children’s teachers. During her turn to give English lessons, she brought flashcards down to the courtyard, telling the children to alternate between loops on their bicycles and new words. She was sweetly relentless, which was partly why the family had made so much progress, the other sponsors said. When Mr. Mohammad voiced interest in working, Ms. Stewart became consumed with helping him find a job. Of all the tests for the family  —   and, by extension, the sponsors  —   this was perhaps the most crucial. So Ms. Stewart found an   settlement counselor to advise Mr. Mohammad and drove him to a job fair for refugees, where they struck up a conversation with a Syrian supermarket owner. After he invited Mr. Mohammad for an interview, Ms. Stewart fashioned a résumé from a questionnaire she had helped him fill out. “I am keen to learn all aspects of the trade from stocking and organizing shelves to marketing strategies and Canadian shopping habits,” she wrote. Describing his work experience  —   doing odd jobs during his three years in Jordan  —   she wrote, “As a refugee I had to be resourceful and find work wherever I could. ” Even though the interview would be in Arabic, she drilled him in English phrases like “I can stock shelves. ” “Ten more times!” she told him as they drove to the interview. When he was offered the   position, the sponsors were thrilled. But a few days later, he called the Canadians to say he would turn it down. He struggled with taking money from the sponsors  —   back home, others had come to his family for help, and it was “really hard to be on the receiving end,” he said. But he wanted to consider options, such as becoming a mechanic. In Syria or Jordan, he had never had freedom to choose his work. “It’s always what you have to do to earn a living rather than what you really want to do,” he said later. And he did not want to take a job until he improved his English, he said, because he did not want any more favors or charity. At the supermarket, unable to answer basic questions from customers, “I would be a burden to my employer,” he added. He had been annoyed at Ms. Stewart for pressing so hard, he said later, but mostly he was embarrassed to pass on the job after she had done so much. But Ms. McLorg saw a plus side: Mr. Mohammad was starting to navigate his own path in Canada, and the relationship between the sponsors and the family, so lopsided at the start, was beginning to balance out. “Our job was to help them come into Canada and show them the options that are here,” she said. In   at the end of a routine meeting with the sponsors and the Mohammads, she shared news of her own: She had breast cancer. Now that she was facing surgery, she was the one who was vulnerable, and the Syrians were the ones who were checking on her. They brought flowers and chocolates the other sponsors, now practiced in the logistics of caring, offered meal deliveries and other assistance. “I had no intention of building my own support group, but I have one now,” Ms. McLorg said. Bayan and Batoul, the two oldest Mohammad children, made   cards using the same set of watercolors the sponsors had used to make greeting signs that first day at the airport hotel. The morning after Ms. McLorg’s operation, when she made her way down to her living room, the cards were the first things she saw.",0
8113,Female Veterans Release Anti-Trump Ad,"Female Veterans Release Anti-Trump Ad “The problem with Blue Falcons, like Donald Trump, is they get you killed.” | October 28, 2016 Be Sociable, Share! Donald Trump likes to boast about the endorsement he’s received from military personnel, but he’ll have to work a lot harder to win over those who serve if he is elected as the next Commander-in-Chief. As was recently reported, 55 generals denounced the Republican Presidential candidate in a historic rebuke last week. And now, a group of female veterans with the Common Defense PAC have released a compelling new ad called “Blue Falcon”. 
The Common Defense PAC defines itself as “a diverse group of male and female veterans” who represent the United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Army Reserves, and Air National Guard. In the ad below, women from various branches of the military explain their aspirations for serving, as well as their disgust with the business tycoon who is running for President. Said veteran Wendy Barranco: “As a migrant, I wanted to give something back to this country that had given me and my family so much. So I became an Army combat medic. When you’re fighting to save a fellow soldier’s life, things get real very quickly. You have to trust your team.” 
It’s made clear, however, that Donald Trump is not the guy you’d want on your team. Barranco continued: “Guys like Donald Trump? We call them Blue Falcons.” 
In case you’re not familiar with the term, it’s a derogatory euphemism for “buddy-fucker.” The women also explain that a Blue Falcon is the type of person who will step on their teammate to get ahead . 
From his declaration that it should be “expected” for rape to take place in the military to his inappropriate and abrasive comments toward women, minorities, and disabled individuals, he is not the best candidate for President, the veterans assert.

8114,Loretta Lynch takes on 'killer cops' -- except in D.C.,"Print 
Have you ever noticed how Washington always has a plan to solve everybody’s problem – except their own? 
For the federal government, it’s always easy and tempting to look at problems – real or imagined – outside of the beltway and solve them from afar. 
You will recall, of course, how former Attorney General Eric Holder was going to stop police shootings all over America with sensitivity training, the power and force of the federal government and investigations, investigations and more investigations. 
Now Loretta Lynch, his successor, also known as Hillary Clinton’s guardian angel, is set to turn police shootings throughout America into big business and more power for Washington. 
Her latest pet project is assembling a national database on “interactions between law enforcement and civilians,” she reported this month. 
“Accurate and comprehensive data on the use of force by law enforcement is essential to an informed and productive discussion about community-police relations,” Lynch said. “In the days ahead, the Department of Justice will continue to work alongside our local, state, tribal and federal partners to ensure that we put in place a system to collect data that is comprehensive, useful, and responsive to the needs of the communities we serve.” 
The irony here is thick, indeed. 
One of Lynch’s goals, she says, is to get law enforcement agencies to report more thoroughly about people who died during an interaction with them. 
Meanwhile, Lynch presides over the most egregious cover-up of the most outrageous police shooting case I have ever seen in my life – namely the killing of Miriam Carey, a young black mother with baby in tow, who was gunned down by Washington cops and Secret Service agents for a wrong turn in the nation’s capital. 
Lynch wants reports? 
So does WND, which has been pursuing the information through Freedom of Information Act requests and finally, after being stonewalled for years, a lawsuit. 
So does the public and the family of Miriam Carey. Unfortunately, Lynch is holding back on a few things: Missing Evidence The 92-page memo with findings, analysis of evidence and conclusions in the Carey shooting investigation. This would show the evidence and reasoning that led the Department of Justice to decline to file criminal charges against officers. Why they considered this a justifiable homicide – or whether they should have, based on the evidence. Why officers used deadly force. Whether officers followed or violated the policy of their agencies. Video of shooting at Capitol Police guard post at intersection of Constitution Ave., Maryland Ave. and 2nd Street. Only stills have been released. Video would show more clearly if officer’s life actually was in danger, as DOJ claimed, when he fired fatal shot to Carey’s head. Not one of the five witnesses at the scene said Carey was driving at the officer, as the DOJ claimed. Police statements The police report said four officers fired shots at Carey, two from the Capitol Police and two from the Secret Service. Not one statement from those officers was in the report. Their names were also redacted. Redacted information An attorney in the Washington, D.C., mayor’s office said the only redactions were names, in order to protect privacy. It turned out much more was redacted than names. The report was riddled with blacked-out sections and missing information. 12 pages in the report were entirely blacked out. 15 pages were mostly blacked out. 22 pages were partially blacked out. Some of the blacked-out pages just included a heading marked “Evidence.” Some just had a date. Witness statements An astonishing 38 witness accounts are missing from the police report. The police report stated: “There were seventy-two (72) witnesses interviewed regarding this incident and their statements were captured by audio and/or video recordings. Copies of the aforementioned recordings were turned over to the USAO for review. Copies of the aforementioned audio and video recordings are stored in the main case file at the Technical Support Unit (TSU) located at the IAD.” Of those 72 witness statements, only 34 were in the materials provided to WND, leaving 38 missing. Statement transcripts None of the actual transcripts of interviews in the witnesses’ own words were provided, just paraphrased versions in what the former NYPD officer Sanders described as “cop talk.” White House guard post video Stills were released but not the video. It would show whether anyone was manning the post when Carey drove up; whether she tried to drive around the off-duty guard who dragged a gate in front of her; and whether she sped off, or left at a normal speed, as a witness said. Police radio recordings No recordings or transcripts of radio transmissions during the pursuit and shooting of Carey were provided in the FOIA material. Also not provided were transcripts of computer transmissions (instant messaging) between squad cars and police headquarters. Ballistics and forensics reports The Justice Department Washington Metro Police Department responses to FOIA requests did not include a ballistics or a forensics report. 
I could go on and on. For people who want facts and reports, the U.S. Justice Department under both Holder and Lynch have a strong propensity for not willingly releasing the facts and reports to the public or the press. 
We’ve been at this for a long time – years. Yet the stonewall and cover-up of a horrendous, unjustifiable, outrageous police shooting right in their own jurisdiction and backyard continues. 
Do we really expect Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch to find justice for police shooting victims outside of their own jurisdiction with a track record like that?

8116,Why Comey Reopened the Hillary Investigation (The real reasons),"Posted 10/31/2016 10:54 am by PatriotRising with 0 comments 
This last Friday it became public record that FBI Director James Comey reopened the Hillary Clinton email server investigation after repeatedly testifying before Congress and the world up to last July that he’d closed the case , after in his words not finding sufficient evidence of “any criminal wrongdoing ” to indict her in spite of her four years as Secretary of State egregiously breaching our national security , committing obstruction of justice and willful tampering with evidence, deleting 30,000 emails after receiving a court subpoena constituting destruction of evidence, not to mention repeatedly engaging in perjury before Congress and the FBI. 

But obviously, a federal investigation still in process in late June never stopped serial rapist-crime boss Bill Clinton’s illegal ambush at the Phoenix airport of Comey’s boss US Attorney General Loretta Lynch “clearing” the way for Hillary to proceed without consequence to be anointed as the next US figurehead puppet president by the ruling elite. Because it’s so blatantly obvious to the entire world that Hillary is guilty as sin, Comey’s whitewash didn’t go over well with either Americans or longtime FBI agents who reacted angrily to Comey’s over-the-top corruption. Subsequently, in recent months Comey has had a virtual mutiny on his hands as in the FBI boss has lost all credibility, respect, and moral authority. 

A former federal attorney for the District of Columbia Joe diGenova spelled it all out in a WMAL radio interview last Friday just hours after the news was released that Comey had sent a letter informing Congress that the case is being reopened. DiGenova said that with an open revolt brewing inside the FBI, Comey was forced to go public on Friday with reopening the investigation. The former DC attorney added that the FBI investigators discovered more emails on a phone confiscated from the former New York Congressman and separated husband Anthony Weiner that also included his wife and longtime Hillary’s right-hand woman Huma Abedin’s communications that allegedly bear pertinent relevance to the Hillary case. Funny how things have a karmic way of coming full circle – the Clintons first introduced Weiner and Abedin 15 years ago and they married a half dozen years ago. 

In a separate FBI investigation involving Weiner’s alleged sexting messages with a 15-year old minor , the phone in question was handed over to the FBI. The investigating teams of both the Weiner and Hillary cases compared notes and apparently additional emails not already issued by WikiLeaks or already in FBI possession recently came to light on Weiner’s phone . The legions of rank and file FBI agents were already fuming over Comey’s complete ethical and legal lapses in his choice not to indict Hillary. Joe diGenova believes that FBI personnel forced Comey’s hand to reopen the investigation after giving him the ultimatum that if he failed to do so, the FBI defiantly would. According to diGenova, this latest plot twist only proves that: 

The original investigation was not thorough, and that it was an incompetent investigation. 

Otherwise, had a real investigation been conducted, that Weiner phone used by both Anthony and Huma would have been picked up by the FBI and its contents thoroughly scrutinized long before now. 

In addition to stating the obvious, that the higher-up feds had already made the decision to not consequence Hillary for her crimes, speculating on why that phone was not already submitted to the FBI as evidence, the former DC attorney concluded: 

There could be one explanation: Huma Abedin may have denied that any other phone existed, and if she did, she committed a felony. She lied to the FBI just like General Cartwright , and if she did, she’s dead meat, and Comey knows it, and there’s nothing he can do about it. 

Finally, diGenova dropped one more bombshell in Friday’s interview. An inside source has revealed to him that the laptops belonging to key Clinton aides Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson, both wrongly granted immunity , were not destroyed after all as previously reported, but have been secretly kept intact by investigating FBI agents refusing to destroy incriminating evidence as part of the in-house whitewash. Additionally like their boss, Hillary’s aides also sent classified material using private servers. On top of that, longtime aide Cheryl Mills on multiple occasions has perjured herself lying under oath for the Clinton crime family, tasked with “cleaning up” (aka covering up) their countless scandals over the past several decades. Indeed the whole Clinton entourage not already “mysteriously” winding up in the growing Clinton dead pool are all unindicted criminals protected by the corrosively corrupt DC cronyism where backroom deals (a la Bill’s airport ambush) are brokered based on whatever dirt’s been gathered and used as bargaining blackmail chips against all parties involved. That’s how the Washington crowd stays immune from any and all accountability as well as stays alive. Violate that crime syndicate code of conduct and you lose your life as more recent victims earlier this year have. 

In a “leaked” memo to his FBI that surfaced on Fox Friday night, Comey outlined his reasons for reopening the case in light of the new information the director believes would have ultimately been leaked to Congress and the public anyway. So in full damage control/CYA mode, the beleaguered director now going public really had no choice in the matter. His underlings were chomping at the bit to both out and oust him. In an obvious attempt to weakly claim some moral high ground, Comey wrote in his memo: 

I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record. 

Though his leadership and character are perceived by the vast majority of both FBI personnel as well as American citizens to presently lay in ruin as a pathetically shameful stain and humiliating joke on both the FBI organization and Washington in general, James Comey appears to be feebly attempting to save his own career and reputation for appearing now to “come clean.” But make no mistake, his moral turpitude displayed throughout this Hillary debacle from early 2015 to now has over-exposed him as a total lackey and fraud, so at this late stage of the game, redemption is not even an option. But the criminal misconduct, rampant corruption and diabolical evil committed by those at the highest puppet levels of federal power, and especially the elite puppet masters controlling them, their sins produce far more devastating consequences than this morally lacking man in the middle of this latest controversy. 

Because there is no way that the FBI will properly conclude this part 2 of the Hillary investigation saga before the November 8 th election, Hillary, and her Democrats are predictably crying foul , demanding that the FBI immediately disclose what it has, which of course is a moot point that won’t happen. It seems highly unlikely that the email texts from Abedin and Weiner found on his phone would not contain clear criminal evidence that implicates Hillary. Since Hillary was the globalist choice after Obama was selected in 2008, it seems unlikely that the puppet masters would not permit this latest development to even occur. But then perhaps the ruling elite is pulling the plug on Hillary, concluding that she simply carries too much liability baggage with her deteriorating health condition and never-ending scandals, maybe the globalists are rethinking an alternative replacement like her obnoxiously aggressive VP candidate, the Jesuit-trained and educated Tim Kaine. 

That said, there are some cynics who believe that this recent odd turn is the last ditch desperado attempt being staged to overturn Trump winning by a landslide. This conjectured scenario goes something like this: a few days prior to the election the FBI will once again “clear” Hillary of all charges. This, in turn, would offer her the last minute much needed boost being able to cash in on her worn out persecution complex , plagued forever by her “right wing conspiracy” theory against the “much maligned” woman of destiny. 

In response to all her scandals, Hillary’s M.O. has always been to falsely blame some villainous sinister force. This year it’s been Putin hacking into her emails, and Trump, Putin, and Assange colluding and plotting behind her back. She’s always been as paranoid as Richard Nixon , attempting to deflect the heat she draws from her own skullduggery lies by constantly pointing fingers to externalize blame onto others. It’s a deeply rooted pathological complex that certain tightly screwed sociopaths possess. 

This latest sudden turn of events obviously has James Comey incurring the wrath of Hillary Democrats as well as the Justice Department. By disclosing the reopened investigation so close to the election date that undoubtedly casts some influence on the potential outcome, Comey is defying his AG boss while clearly violating DOJ written policy . Lynch herself even tried to quash Comey’s letter to Congress. But as diGenova alluded, by Comey’s own past misdeeds (and those of his boss and Obama as well), the FBI director placed himself between this rock and a hard place by his own slipshod, half-ass probe failing to acquire Weiner’s phone the first time around. 

The entire sordid affair of this year’s totally rigged political election – pre-fixed in Hillary’s favor – blatantly reveals to America the gross misnomer of the US “justice” system being two-tiered, one for elitist crime cabal bosses like Hillary and the other for the rest of us 99% no longer protected in a totalitarian police state by our once rule of law the US Constitution. Regardless of what happens in the future, the truth genie’s already been let out of the bag, and for eyes open enough to see, it’s floating in the Washington cesspool of filth, debauchery and deception regularly perpetrated by our “entrusted perps” we have as our so called leaders. 

Moreover, this year’s unending batches of Wiki-leaked DNC/Hillary emails and Project Veritas undercover campaign videos confirm that the entire US political, as well as economic system, is morally and financially bankrupt, irreparably broken and in need of complete overhaul. Voter fraud and election fraud are rampant. Soros funded electronic voting machines that are preprogrammed to vote for Hillary are operating in 16 key battleground states. America’s internal house now is in total disarray, badly in need of a deep cleaning purge like never before. Mainstream media is strongly biased against Trump in its blind support for Hillary . As Secretary of State she treasonously sold out our nation, placing us all at high security risk and under foreign interest control at the hands of high rolling bidders so she and her fat cats can get richer as fellow partners-in-crime from places like Saudi Arabia and Israel, destroying our once sovereign country while aiding, abetting, financing and supporting our enemies the global terrorists around the world. She helped create ISIS and plans world war against Russia, China and Iran. The traitors in our government and their globalist puppet masters – the Rothschilds, Rockefellers , the Bushes and Clintons all need to be rounded up, imprisoned and tried at The Hague for both treason and their endless crimes against humanity.

8117,Are Tensions With Russia Even Real?,"10-26-16 In September 2015, at the behest of its legitimate government, Russia began aerial operations to combat ISIS and al-Nusra terrorists in Syria. Numerous other likeminded groups are involved, just as cutthroat, just as ruthless, just as extremist, masquerading as moderate rebels when none exist - supported by Washington, NATO, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, other Gulf States, Jordan, Israel and Turkey.Theyre massacring civilians, killing government soldiers defending them, using chemical and other banned weapons, committing gruesome atrocities.Why does Russia pretend conflict is civil when Syria was invaded by terrorists, imported from scores of countries, serving as US imperial foot soldiers? Why does it pretend moderate fighters are involved when none exist? Why does it insist on separating nonexistent moderates from terrorist groups its combating when all anti-government forces are the same?Why isnt it targeting all armed groups wanting Assad toppled and Syrian sovereign independence destroyed? Its the only way to free the country from the scourge its facing - supported by Washington and its rogue allies, NATO and regional ones.Why did it halt its aerial operations to liberate eastern Aleppo, declaring a unilateral ceasefire, a so-called humanitarian pause - a major blunder, accomplishing nothing? Ongoing since October 18, its letting US-supported terrorists infesting the city replenish their ranks, regroup and mobilize for heavy attacks, largely harming civilians Moscow says it wants protected.Last Saturday evening, Russia ended its humanitarian pause because US-supported terrorists in eastern Aleppo prevent civilians from leaving, holding thousands hostage as human shields, including the sick and wounded.Yet it ceased aerial attacks, yielding the advantage to dark forces its sworn to eliminate. What kind of strategy gives them the upper hand? It gets worse.On October 26, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman General Igor Konashenkov issued the following statement:The Russian Aerospace Forces and the Syrian Air Force have been sticking to a moratorium on air strikes for the past eight days. They are staying out of a 10-km (six-mile) zone around Aleppo.Six humanitarian corridors, field kitchens and first aid stations are open for civilians leaving eastern Aleppo 24 hours a day.Russia and the Syrian government are ready to resume humanitarian pauses in Aleppo if they receive guarantees from international organizations confirming readiness to evacuate the sick and the wounded as well as civilian population from the rebel-held areas.Fact: Maintaining an airstrike moratorium aids Washington, its rogue allies and terrorists in eastern Aleppo they support.Fact: What good are humanitarian corridors if eastern Aleppo residents are prevented from using them, risking death or serious injury if they try.Fact: International organizations have no control over terrorists in eastern Aleppo - or anywhere else in the country. So what good are their guarantees if made?Fact: As long as Russia continues making the same mistakes repeatedly, the struggle to liberate Syria will likely go on interminably without resolution - a forever war, while countless thousands more civilians will die, be seriously injured and endure hardships people in Western societies cant imagine, victims of US imperial ruthlessness.A handful of eastern Aleppo civilians alone escaped via a humanitarian corridor. According to one now free, their relatives were seized, imprisoned and tortured.The only way to liberate thousands of others is by relentlessly smashing their terrorist captors, eliminating them - not giving them breathing room to mobilize for greater attacks.Washington is delighted with Moscows ceasefire and humanitarian pause, serving US imperial interests, State Department spokesman admiral John Kirby saying:We welcome the stated intention to extend this pause, and we hope that this extension will be more successful than it has been thus far - meaning the longer it continues, the greater the benefit to US-led dark forces, the worse off trapped Syrians in eastern Aleppo will be, the longer the struggle to liberate Syria will go on.Stephen Lendman lives in Chicago.

8118,Macron INCREASES Lead Ahead of French Election Sunday - Breitbart,"Centrist French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron extended his lead in the polls over his   rival Marine Le Pen on Friday, the final day of a tumultuous election campaign that has turned the country’s politics upside down. [The election is seen as the most important in France for decades with two diametrically opposed views of Europe and France’s place in the world at stake.  The National Front’s Le Pen would close borders and quit the euro currency, while independent Macron, who has never held elected office, wants closer European cooperation and an open economy.

8119,Green Berets Casualties in Jordan Story Disputed; Mosul Siege Completed; Zumwalt Broke Down Again,"Next Cold War Roundup 11/23/16: The official story of how the 3 US Green Berets were killed in Jordan has been disputed. Iraqi militias completed the encirclement of Mosul. The USS Zumwalt broke down again in the Panama Canal. And more in our latest Next Cold War roundup…
3 Green Beret Soldiers Killed in Jordan _ By Jack Murphy, Army special operations veteran and editor of SOFREP: “Three Green Berets killed by ISIS infiltrator after CIA ignored warnings.” Green Berets Matthew Lewellen, Kevin McEnroe, and James Moriarty were on an inter-agency mission in Jordan, part of the CIA “Timber Sycamore” covert operation “to train and arm so-called moderate Syrian rebels.” Murphy’s Special Forces (SF) contacts said the official story is not true. It wasn’t an accident. It was a planned, deliberate attack by an ISIS sympathizer who was either a Jordanian military guard or one of the “moderate” rebels the SF are training.
_ Special Forces soldiers have complained “repeatedly” that the CIA vetting is “dubious at best” and the so called moderate rebels coming into the the training program “were actually ISIS and al-Nusra infiltrators.” The “CIA’s para-military component, called Ground Branch” have made the same complaints, all of which have been ignored. It’s illegal to provide support to terrorist organizations but there are some ways to override that law using loopholes that require very high level approval from the Secretary of State, Attorney General and the White House.
Syrian Rebels Have MANPADs in Southern Syria _ Syrian rebels from the “Ansar al-Islam Front and factions of the FSA” have published a video demonstrating SA-7 MANPADS shoulder-launch missiles. Middle East Eye speculates that the supply of MANPADS might indicate that the US has changed their policy of prohibiting distribution of these weapons because one of their high-level rebel sources said, in September, that this would happen if Syria and Russia increased their attacks on Aleppo. The source said: “Rebels are being told only to target Syrian helicopters, not Russian – but it’s not clear they will abide by this.”

_ Al Masdar News reports the Syrian army and local fighters have made gains in the province of Quneitra, near the Golan Heights.
Mosul _ Iraqi foreign minister al-Jaafari announced that one third of Mosul has been liberated from ISIS. 1000 ISIS fighters were killed and 650 captured.
_ The Iraqi Popular Mobilization Units (PMU), also known as Shiite militias though not all the soldiers are Shia, have completed the encirclement of Mosul . “The PMU reached Peshmerga positions in Sino and cut off the last ISIS-controlled road linking Mosul with the rest of Iraq.” They will now continue operations in Tal Afar, near the Syrian border.
Another Zumwalt Breakdown _ The Navy’s newest ship, the USS Zumwalt, broke down again , for the second time in 2 months, this time while passing through the Panama Canal.
Turkish Coup: NATO Officers Seeking Asylum _ NATO Secretary-General Jen Stoltenberg confirmed that some Turkish military officers within the NATO command structure are seeking asylum in the countries where they were stationed. He did not provide any specifics on the asylum requests. Turkish Pres. Erdogan said the number was not high.
_ Turkey’s crackdown after the failed coup attempt continues and they have made many changes to their own NATO personnel . Stoltenberg said : “I think Turkey will fill these places. It is up to Turkey who will be appointed here.”
_ Stoltenberg traveled to Istanbul on Sunday for the annual NATO Parliamentary Assembly session and will meet with Erdogan on Monday.
_ 38-40 Turkish officers in Germany, ranking “from non-commissioned officer to colonel” applied for asylum, per Hurriyet’s Turkish military sources . German media DW reported “ close to 60 Turkish nationals holding diplomatic passports ” stayed in Germany when they were summoned or due to return to Turkey, and the majority of those were military personnel (and some family members) from NATO bases.
_ At least 2 Turkish officers at NATO headquarters in Brussels requested asylum. 41 of the 50 Turkish military personnel in Brussels were “withdrawn from duty” and Turkey has not yet replaced them.
_ On Sunday, Erdogan said : “How can a terrorist, a terrorist soldier, a soldier who has been involved in plotting a coup, be employed in NATO? […] NATO cannot entertain accepting asylum requests of this kind.”
_ More than 400 Turkish military and staff were summoned back to Turkey after the coup attempt but some chose not to return, claiming that colleagues who did return were arrested.
Syria: De Mistura’s Proposal for Aleppo _ UN envoy Staffan de Mistura proposed that the Syrian government grant autonomy to East Aleppo “in exchange for peace” and he called for the al Qaeda affiliated rebels to leave East Aleppo and go to other rebel-held parts of Syria. The Syrian foreign minister, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem, rejected the proposal and said state institutions should be restored across the city and that Syria would not let the people of East Aleppo remain “hostages to 6,000 gunmen […] “We agreed on the need that terrorists should get out of east Aleppo to end the suffering of the civilians in the city.”
_ Retired Col. Pat Lang’s response to de Mistura’s proposal: “Say what?” In speculating why de Mistura would do this: “The barrel bombing and hospital destruction memes are not having the desired effect and the “White Helmet” farce has been thoroughly debunked, so something else had to be tried.”
_ Moallem welcomed Syrian-to-Syrian talks without foreign influence but de Mistura couldn’t offer help with that, nor could he guarantee a ceasefire.
_ De Mistura has made offers to the jihadis in East Aleppo before, including an offer to personally escort them (with their weapons) from the city. The jihadis refused to leave and said they would fight to the death and they continue to shell the government-held West Aleppo, killing 8 school children and a teacher in recent days.
Syria: Rebels Continue to Shell Government-Held West Aleppo _ The original headline of this BBC article was “Syria war: Aleppo rebel attack on school kills seven children.” The headline was changed to: “Syria war: Aleppo self-rule rejected by government.” The text of the article changed significantly too, as demonstrated by this comparison tool .
Syria: Nusra-Led Rebels Deny Civilian Exit _ The pro-rebel Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has confirmed that the al Nusra-led rebels “are actually blocking the civilians from getting out”of East Aleppo.
_ Anti-war.com also reports that the Associated Press has spoken to people whose relatives have told them that the rebels told civilians who decided to leave to do it at night for safety reasons. Then when the civilians approached the crossing, the rebels opened fire on them. Food shortages in East Aleppo are caused by rebels hoarding aid supplies, according to the Syrian army. The rebels deny this.
Syria: ISIS Weakening at Deir Ezzor _ ISIS position in Deir Ezzor is weakening . Both the Syrian and Russian air forces have been bombing ISIS in and around Deir Ezzor. They also have ground forces in the area. ISIS manpower is affected by the battles in Mosul and Raqqa.
_ ISIS continues to launch offensives on the Syrian army position, and Al Masdar reports that despite repeated offensives, ISIS has not been able to make any significant advances on the Syrian army positions at “Al-Jafra Farms and Deir Ezzor Airport.”
Syria: Al-Bab _ Syrian foreign minister Al-Moallem said Turkish forces were violating Syria’s sovereignty: “We cannot accept to have one Turkish soldier to remain on Syria’s land.”
Halifax Security Forum _ Turkey’s EU affairs minister, Omer Celik, criticized Turkey’s NATO allies on Saturday while at the Halifax Security Forum in Canada, and while accompanied by French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, retired US Gen. John Allen, and US Senator John McCain:
Celik : “Iran and Russia intervened in Syria, made a lot of mistakes, and caused the deaths of many people. As NATO allies, do we have a consensus on [reaching] a solution in Syria? […] Turkey proposed a no-fly zone, [but] our allies did not support that. We asked for safe zones, our allies did not support that. We said let’s fight terrorist groups, our allies did not support that. Our NATO allies are not showing solidarity with Turkey.”
War and Elections _ Doug Bandow for Forbes: “ President-Elect Donald Trump: Stay Out Of Syria .” Bandow notes that “American politicians are still attempting to drag America into another tragic, bloody Middle Eastern conflict” and to do so would be “madness” but like Obama, Trump is surrounded by allies and advisors who are militaristic. Bandow calls out “ivory tower warriors” like Charles Lister and Thanassis Cambanis. “Washington has a half dozen or more conflicting goals, none of are important enough to warrant the use of force.”
_ From October, a profile of retired Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump’s choice for national security advisor: “ How Mike Flynn Became America’s Angriest General .” “He was one of the most respected intelligence officers of his generation. Now he’s Donald Trump’s national security alter ego, goading a crowd to lock Hillary Clinton up. What happened?”
_ Robert Parry: “ Trump’s Tulsi Gabbard Factor .” Parry says that Gabbard might be a signal that Trump intends to do a major break with the neocon foreign policy establishment, moving toward a more libertarian stance, but his choice for Secretary of State will be the biggest tell. If it’s someone like Romney, Giuliani or Bolton, the neocons “can breathe a sigh of relief.”
Analysis and Opinion _ DW interview with researcher Siemon Wezeman: “ Diplomacy and war games in the global arms trade .” “Moscow and Washington are rivals once again, using arms exports to boost their allies and frustrate each other’s plans. The two countries are also renewing their own nuclear arsenals.” Wezeman says that Russia is trying improve relations with Arab countries and sell them weapons but Gulf countries aren’t likely to buy from Russia if Russia sells to Iran.
_ Nassim Nicholas Taleb, “ Syria and the Statistics of War : Trust none of what you hear, some of what you read, and half of what you see.”
Taleb: “I see propagandists and Al Qaeda apologists such as Charles Lister (at the Salafi-funded Middle East Institute) throw numbers that get cited –yes, some idiot will cite numbers from the Al Qaeda propagandist Charles Lister, and may eventually be cited in turn by some decent newspaper, hence get fixed for posterity.”

8120,Tea Party Activists Look to President Trump to Clean Up Ryan’s Obamacare 2.0 - Breitbart,"Tea Party activists, while critical of the healthcare bill proposed by Speaker Paul Ryan ( ) are giving President Trump the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the process of honoring his campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. [“We have no doubt President Trump is on our side,” Tom Zawistowski, president of the We the People Convention and   Ohio Tea Party leader, tells Breitbart News.  “This is between the Tea Party movement and the conservative movement, on the one hand, and establishment Republicans, on the other hand,” the veteran Tea Party activist adds. “We’ve seen this act before,” Zawistowski notes. “Give us the House, we need the Senate, they say. Give us the Senate, we need the White House. Give us the White House, we need 60 votes in the Senate,” Zawistowski says. “We’re not playing these games any more,” he declares. “They can’t pass their bill without us. We won’t pass their bill unless we get what we want, need, and deserve  —   full repeal of Obamacare, and free market replacement. The Art of the Deal says people who can afford to walk away from the table win. Trump needs a deal and he needs to support our position to get one,” Zawistowski concludes. Other Tea Party activists around the country share Zawistowski’s trust in Trump. “I certainly understand what I believe to be the strategy of a phased approach. President Trump and Speaker Ryan have talked about a three phased approach to repeal and replace Obamacare. I understand it’s a complex issue. I trust this president,” Mark Skoda, founder of America First Tennessee and organizer of the March 4   Spirit of America rally in Nashville, tells Breitbart News. “My biggest concern is that they aren’t killing the regulation. If you don’t kill the regulation, then the possibility is for another president to reinstate some form of Obamacare through that regulatory structure. I’m also concerned, as Sen. Rand Paul has suggested, that the current proposal is, in effect, a de facto continuation of the individual mandate,” Skoda adds. “I’ve been telling people to calm down and be a little bit more strategic,” Bill Hennessy, founder of the St. Louis Tea Party, tells Breitbart News. “Donald Trump is a better negotiator than anyone in Congress,” Hennessy says. “The establishment thought President Trump was out of his mind when he announced he was running for president. They thought he was out of his mind when he promised to build a wall. One thing President Trump has shown, he always knows what he’s doing when it comes to setting the table for negotiations,” Hennessy concludes. “I started out as ‘ ’ and became a Trump supporter because President Trump kept his word,” Judson Phillips, founder and president of Tea Party Nation tells Breibart News. “President Trump promised us there will be a repeal of Obamacare, and I believe he will keep his word on that,” Phillips adds. “What Speaker Ryan and the establishment Republicans need to realize is this: they are destroying what little good will they have with the conservative movement. That is a fight they do not wish to have. It is a fight they will end up losing ” he says. “They needed the Tea Party to take the House, take the Senate, and take the White House. If they do what they do best, which is selling out the conservative base, they will find themselves in the minority in the House and in the Senate,” Phillips concludes.",0

Voters deserve answers now. https://t.co/VXQNIoQXB6 — Chad Griffin (@ChadHGriffin) November 1, 2016 Despite the narrative of Putin preferring to see Trump elected president, the FBI investigation apparently arrived at a different conclusion. The New York Times reported that unnamed FBI investigators said they “have become increasingly confident, based on the evidence they have uncovered, that Russia’s direct goal is not to support the election of Mr. Trump, as many Democrats have asserted, but rather to disrupt the integrity of the political system and undermine America’s standing in the world more broadly.” No mention was made of the Kremlin-run English-language propaganda outlet RT, which regularly pushes what can broadly be described as mostly left-wing anti-American and pro-Russian agitation. Also ignored were actual financial connections between Russian-related interests and the Clintons or their inner circle. For months, Democrat politicians and operatives have colluded with their news media allies to push a narrative of Russia’s President Vladimir Putin directing the Russian state apparatus to provide political support to Donald Trump.

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/they-live-possibly-most-powerful.html ‘They Live’ is a science-fiction movie from the Eighties that features aliens, a WWF wrestler and a whole lot of sunglasses. What’s not to like? While, at first glance, the movie appears to be a bunch of nonsense, ‘They Live’ actually communicates a powerful message about the elite and its use of mass media to control the masses. Is the movie describing the control of the Illuminati over our society? This article looks at the deeper meaning of John Carpenter’s strange but fascinating movie ‘ They Live ’. Warning: Major spoilers ahead (get over it, the movie is 24 years old). Watching They Live is a conflicting experience. It is an odd combination of eye-opening messages with lackluster acting, powerful social commentary with 1950’s B-movie special effects and gripping satire with odd punchlines. Constantly making viewers oscillate between “Wow, that was genius!” to “Wow, that was corny!”, it is difficult to properly evaluate the movie from a cinematographic point of view. However, from a “message” point of the view, They Live is gold. Based on Ray Nelson’s short story Eight O’Clock in the Morning, the movie is one of those rare subversive stories that forces viewers to question their world and their surroundings. Because, despite the fact that the movie is about ghoulish aliens, it communicates truths to the viewers that are only alluded to in mainstream movies. In fact, looking deeper into the storyline, one might realize that there’s probably more “science” than “fiction” in the story of They Live … especially when one has “truth-seeing sunglasses”.The hero of the movie, played by WWF wrestler Rowdy Roddy Pipper, is a drifter that is apparently nameless. In the short story and the movie’s credits, he is referred to as Nada, which means ‘nothing’ in Spanish. While this nameless nothing is broke and homeless, he still manages to expose the alien’s hidden rule of the world. How did he accomplish that? With the only thing he’d ever need: The Truth. Oh, and also guns. He used a lot of guns. Most importantly, despite the fact that Nada was tempted several times to shut up in exchange for “generous compensation”, he kept his integrity and never agreed to sell out to the aliens. Now, that’s a role model. To top it off, he says the best things ever. “I’m here to kick ass and chew bubble gum … and I’m all out of bubble gum.” Are the aliens in the movie an imaginative way to portray the world’s elite , those who secretly run the world, those we call the Illuminati? Let’s revisit this cult classic and see how it describes the hidden rule of the elite. The Premise Right from the beginning, as we see Nada walking around Los Angeles with his backpack, the movie sets a particular mood: Something is not quite right. While Nada appears to be a happy-go-lucky kind of guy, the city is not happy and it is not too kind to happy-go-lucky kind of guys.Quite the contrary, there is a sense of impending doom in the air: Poverty is rampant, helicopters fly around the city and street preachers speak of soulless beings ruling the world. “The venom of snakes is under their lips. Their mouths are full of bitterness and curses. And in their paths, nothing but ruin and misery. And the fear of God is not before their eyes! They have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders. “They have recruited the rich and powerful, and they have blinded us to the truth! And our human spirit is corrupted. Why do we worship greed? Because outside the limit of our sight, feeding off us, perched on top of us from birth to death are our owners. “Our owners — they have us. They control us. They are our masters. Wake up. They’re all about you, all around you!”. Is the preacher’s description of the “masters” applicable to the Illuminati? I believe so.As we follow Nada’s aimless drifting across the city, the camera often focuses on people gazing blankly at television screens, mindlessly absorbing the vapid messages it communicates. Regular Joes appear to truly enjoy their television shows … until an obscure organization hacks the airwaves to broadcast subversive messages about the hidden rulers of the world. “Our impulses are being redirected. We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep. (…) The poor and the underclass are growing. Racial justice and human rights are nonexistent. “They have created a repressive society, and we are their unwitting accomplices. Their intention to rule rests with the annihilation of consciousness. We have been lulled into a trance. They have made us indifferent to ourselves, to others. “We are focused only on our own gain. Please understand. They are safe as long as they are not discovered. That is their primary method of survival. Keep us asleep, keep us selfish, keep us sedated.” Can the above statement be applied to those in power? I believe so.The Average Joes who watch this pirated TV broadcast all get a massive headache – the raw truth is indeed too much for most people to bear. One such viewer switches the channel after telling the guy on TV: “Blow it out your ass”. Just like today, most people do not want to hear about this kind of stuff … they just want to go back to their mindless TV viewing.Nada realizes that the street preacher and the man on television are connected through a local church. When he sneaks into the church, he discovers that it is actually the headquarters of an underground organization.On a wall inside the church is written “They Live We Sleep”, a phrase that describes the fundamental difference between the elite and the masses. Those in power know the truth about the world and possess the means and the power to truly “live”.The rest of the population is sedated, dumbed-down and manipulated into a zombie-like status in order for it to be as easily manageable as possible by the masters. The masses’ ignorance equals a state of endless slumber.Nada learns that the rebellious organization is attempting to recruit people to take down the rulers. However, a few days later, Nada discovers what happens to those who plot against those in power.Helicopters, bulldozers and police in riot gear raid the place, destroy everything and violently arrest the members of the underground organization. That is how the elite responds to contrary views.After witnessing the violent police shakedown , Nada begins to realize that something is wrong in America. The happy-go-lucky guy who believed in working hard and following the rules is starting to believe that something is amiss here.Determined to learn more, Nada re-enters the church and finds a few interesting things.The police painted over “They Live We Sleep”. Obviously, “They” don’t want that message to be known .More importantly, Nada discovers a box full of sunglasses that allows his to see the world as it is. Added bonus: They also look pretty cool. Seeing the Truth While the sunglasses found by Nada appear on the surface to be worthless, they actually provide him with the greatest gift of all: The Truth. When Nada first puts on the sunglasses, the experience is shocking.When he has his sunglasses on, Nada sees through the smoke and mirrors projected by advertisement and mass media . He only sees the core of their message and the only reason why they exist.No matter which magazine Nada flips open, he sees the same subliminal messages, which tells a lot about the true function of “celebrity” and “fashion” magazines.Despite the fact that they are all different, they all ultimately serve the same purpose: To reinforce messages from the elite to the masses. Nada also quickly understands the truth about money . “In God We Trust”? Some people are not human . They are from another race that has infiltrated society. Nada realizes that they are everywhere and that they hold positions of power, like this politician giving a typical “politician” speech on television. Is this a way to portray the Illuminati, or something much-much deeper ?Upon discovering this truth, Nada became pissed off. REALLY pissed off. How did he react to the situation? He did not go home and write a poem about it. Nope, he grabbed a shotgun and started shooting aliens.When the aliens realize that Nada can see through their disguise, they immediately alert the authorities saying “I’ve got one that can see”. Being able to “see” is obviously frowned upon by the aliens – they do not like to be exposed. Nada quickly becomes a social pariah and aliens start closing in on him. Confronted with this situation, Nada says profound and timeless words: “I don’t like this ne bit”.Many aliens are part of the police force as its sole purpose is to ensure that the alien’s rule is not disturbed. Most policemen are however regular humans and just follow the orders because that’s their job … a little like actual policemen who do the Illuminati’s work.Nada and everyone in the city are constantly monitored by flying surveillance cameras that are oddly similar to the new unmanned drones that are currently appearing around the world.Flying surveillance cameras were considered science fiction in 1988. They are reality today.An actual, modern unmanned drone mounted with a video camera.The concept of truth-seeing sunglasses is an interesting way to illustrate the importance of knowledge in one’s world perception. Two people can be looking at the exact same thing yet perceive two very different realities, depending on the level of information and awareness possessed by each person. Nada’s sunglasses can therefore represent one’s knowledge of the truth, which allows a clear perception of reality. Looking for Others Who Know the Truth Upon learning the shocking truth about the world, Nada feels the need to share this vital information with his friend Frank Armitage. Nada however quickly realizes some people do not want to hear about it. In fact, many actually get angry and offended at the simple mention of something that alludes to it. When Nada asks Frank to put on his sunglasses so he can see what he sees, Frank firmly refuses and calls him a “crazy motha…”.Nada replies with another classic line “Either you put these sunglasses on or start eating that trash can”.Then ensues one of the longest one-on-one fight scene I ever seen (eight minutes of punching and kicking), a scene that is dragged out for so long that it becomes utterly absurd and even comical. While the scene maybe appear ridiculous, it says something about the difficulty of making regular, average people wake up from their blissful ignorance.Frank finally sees the truth. All it took is Nada beating the crap out of him, sticking the sunglasses on his face against his will and forcing him to look around. Yes, convincing other people of the truth can be a hard task.It takes a lot of effort on Nada’s part, but Frank finally sees the aliens controlling the world. The two pals are then invited to a secret meeting of the underground organization that is attempting to rid the earth from the aliens.During the meeting, Nada and Frank are given truth-seeing contact lenses. The sunglasses gave truth-seers a nasty headache, especially when they are taken off. When first exposed to the truth, adapting to the new reality can indeed be difficult, and even painful. However, after a while, it becomes seamless part of the person. A little like wearing contact lenses.During the meeting, Nada and Frank learn that humans are being recruited by the aliens in exchange for wealth and power. As the leader of the underground organization says: “Most of us just sell out right away”. It is rather easy to make a correlation between the movie and actual politicians and celebrities we’ve seen in previous articles on this site who readily sell out to the Illuminati in exchange for wealth, power and celebrity.The meeting doesn’t last long, however, as police barge in the place and start shooting everyone there. They are designated a “terrorist organization” by the elite. Nada and Frank manage to escape and accidentally find themselves behind enemy lines, in the alien’s underground base. Behind Enemy Lines While exploring the aliens’ underground base, Nada and Frank stumble upon a party thrown by the aliens for human collaborators to thank them for their “partnership”. Although humans will never be considered equals to the aliens, those who sell out to them get monetary benefits … much like those who are not part of today’s elite who nevertheless sell out to push the elite’s New World Order Agenda . “Our projections show that by the year 2025, not only America but the entire planet will be under the protection and the dominion of this power alliance. The gains have been substantial, both for ourselves and for you, the human power elite.” Frank and Nada then discover the source of the aliens’ brainwashing signals: A television studio. The aliens use the network to broadcast hypnotic and subliminal signals to humans, blinding them from the truth about their rulers and the world. The message that is communicated here: Mass media is the elite’s favorite tool indoctrinate the masses and to keep them in servitude. The TV station ‘Cable 54’ is used by the aliens to hypnotize humans. Is this science-fiction? Barely. Nada realizes that the only way to save humanity from the grips of the aliens is to go to the roof of the TV station’s building and to take down the emitter of the subliminal messages, disguised as a satellite dish. Indeed, without an elite-controlled mass media, indoctrinating the masses will be a lot more difficult. So Nada and Frank start shooting their way towards the roof, not an easy task. The Disinformation Agent While this lady appeared to be nice at first, she tried to mislead, deceive and even kill Nada during his quest. She ends up shooting his pal Frank in the head.Nada met Holly Thomspon, a Cable 54 network executive, at the beginning of his wild rampage. While Nada appears to be somewhat enamoured with her, she always somehow brings trouble. During the “terrorist organization” meeting, Holly infiltrated the group, posing as a sympathizer and claiming that Cable 54 “was clean” and was not the source of aliens’ signal, which was false and misleading. Today, disinformation is widely used by the elite to confuse and mislead those who attempt to discover the truth about the world.During Nada’s rush towards the roof of the network’s building, Holly appears again, claiming that she wants to help him. However, she is simply trying to kill him before the mission is accomplished. She is therefore another human that sold out to the aliens being used to disrupt non-corrupted humans attempting to liberate themselves and others. Taking Down the Aliens Here’s the biggest spoiler of them all: Nada manages to take down the aliens’ transmitter and saves humanity. This heroic move gets him killed, however, as a policeman inside a helicopter shoots him dead. Nada therefore becomes the quintessential hero, sacrificing his life for the good of humanity – a martyr for human freedom from soulless rulers .Even though it cost his life, Nada visibly does not regret exposing the aliens to the world. With his last once of strength, Nada gives the aliens a uniquely human parting gift: the finger.TV viewers around the world now realize that those giving the daily news were also those who controlled them. In Conclusion Although They Live is usually described as “a science-fiction movie that criticizes consumer culture”, the scope of its message actually goes way beyond the usual “consumerism is bad” lecture. They Live can indeed be interpreted as a treatise on the thorough and systematic conditioning of human experience in order for a hidden elite to covertly control, manipulate and exploit the masses. In the movie, the rulers are portrayed as a completely different race that perceives humans as inferior – something that can easily be correlated to the attitudes about the bloodlines of the Illuminati. The presence of these strong messages in the movie is one of the reasons They Live became somewhat of a cult-classic, despite the fact that it was panned by movie critics. As the years go by, the movie’s message is becoming increasingly relevant … and freakishly realistic.Many of those who seek the truth about the world realize that it’s reins are held by an un-elected elite, one that is essentially hidden from the public eye. As the movie’s promotional poster says: “You see them on the street. You watch them on TV. You might even vote for one this fall. You think they’re people just like you. You’re wrong. Dead wrong.” Working behind the scenes, this secretive elite constantly works towards the creation of a global system that would serve its interests: a New World Order , ruled by one world government. As a human collaborator says in the movie to justify his selling-out: “There ain’t no countries anymore. No more good guys. They’re running the whole show. They own everything. The whole goddamn planet!” To facilitate the rulers’ work, the masses are kept in the dark and are distracted with the fake puppet show that is politics and the “no independent thought” programming that is mass media . Apathy, ignorance and indifference are the elite’s best friends.Despite its unimpressive special effects and odd dialogue, They Live manages to describe the world elite’s motives and strategy in a way that can be understood by all. And that is no simple task. However, in order to fully understand the movie’s message, one must be wearing truth-seeing sunglasses. Do you have yours on?

8123,A Wizard Comes to the Stage: ‘Harry Potter and the Cursed Child’ Begins Previews in London - The New York Times,"LONDON  —   The eighth installment of the Harry Potter series was presented on Tuesday evening at the Palace Theater here. Neither a book nor a film, it was a play, “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. ” But whatever the medium, the Potter saga continued with unabated interest: fans dressed in Hogwarts costumes, curiosity about the fate of   characters and the allure of magic. When we last left Harry Potter, in the very last pages of J. K. Rowling’s “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,” he was a   bureaucrat sending his middle child, Albus Severus, off to Hogwarts for the first time. After the violence and darkness that had marked his younger years in Ms. Rowling’s story, all seemed well. Now Harry is back  —   in a play, this time  —   and all is not well. “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” which had its first preview in London on Tuesday, begins with the final scene from “Deathly Hallows” and skitters rapidly forward a few years, sketching out Albus’s feelings of alienation both from Hogwarts and from his famous father. It is jarring and exciting to be seeing characters who seemed to be put to rest, suspended forever in place and time, suddenly reanimated. At the same time, the three main characters remained true to their younger selves. Ron still provides comic relief, Hermione remains cerebral and slightly bossy and Harry tries as hard as he can but doesn’t quite live up to his own expectations. It is odd to see it all unfold onstage when we are so used to approaching the story through Ms. Rowling’s books  —   reading them was a rite of passage for so many children (O. K. and adults)  —   or through the movies. But the audience at the Palace Theater here cannot be more thrilled or more appreciative or more ready to be caught up in the spirit of the undertaking. For those outside the theater and who wish to remain unburdened by details, spoilers will ensue in the next paragraph. Some scenes are filled with adolescent angst. At one point what appeared to be a live owl flew across the stage. The producers manage to create some literal stage magic. A wand moves papers across a desk, and books come out of a shelf and speak. SARAH LYALL As the line snaked around the Palace Theater, with people waiting for the play to start, a crowd milled outside, with many ticketless people clutching Potter books. On an especially balmy London day, some were in full Hogwarts uniforms, with capes and school colors. Many seemed to be in their 20s and enduringly loyal to the book series. “They were the best books I read in my childhood,” Jonathan Snow, 28, of Britain, said. “I just want to be back in that world. ” Ticketholders came from Canada, Italy, Singapore, Brazil, the United States and elsewhere. Erika Sloop, 25, and Dennis Allen, 27, from Tampa, Fla. who were in line, came to see the play three days after getting married in a   wedding. The wedding party picked Hogwarts houses to join. They had tables decorated like Gringotts and the forbidden forest. Seating was arranged by a sorting hat and all the guests were given wands. They said the wedding date coincided with the performance. “We originally actually planned our honeymoon for Iceland,” Mr. Allen said. But when tickets became available on the Pottermore. com website, they changed plans. Inside the theater, the set seemed old, ornate and vaguely Hogwartian. The stage had suitcases on it and was surmounted by a large clock. A roar of applause rose when an announcement came that the show was about to start. ROSLYN SULCAS AND CHRISTOPHER D. SHEA Alohomora! Let the curtains draw back. “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” the eagerly anticipated new play that promises a fresh installment of J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter saga, will shed its shroud of secrecy on Tuesday evening. For months, the clock has been ticking down on Ms. Rowling’s Pottermore. com website, counting the weeks, days, hours, minutes and seconds until the first performance of “Cursed Child,” which is being presented in two parts at the Palace Theater here. The first in a run of previews begins at 7:30 p. m. ahead of the official opening night on July 30. The first performance of Part 2 is on Thursday on some days, the two parts can be seen consecutively. The story line of the play is by Ms. Rowling, John Tiffany and Jack Thorne, who wrote the script, and the creators have sought to impose intense secrecy about the plot and production. On Monday, Ms. Rowling posted a short video on Twitter with the hashtag #keepthesecrets by Tuesday afternoon it had more than 82, 000 views, with many commenters agreeing and others crying out to know what happens. “We simply want everyone who’s bought a ticket to #CursedChild to enjoy the onstage surprises,” Ms. Rowling wrote. That will become more difficult right after opening night, when reviews and the script (already the   book on Amazon. com in Britain) will be published. The play sold out within hours of the online booking opening, and is full through May 27, 2017, although 40 tickets will be released on the Pottermore site each Friday at 1 p. m. for the following week. Tickets on resale websites are going for as much as $4, 800. It seems unlikely that in the age of social media, all secrets will be kept. The premise, though, is clear by now. The play begins where the final volume of the   saga, “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,” left off, with an epilogue that showed some of the series’ principal characters  —   Harry, his friends Ron and Hermione, and Draco Malfoy  —   seeing their children off to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry on Platform 9¾ at King’s Cross Station. The announcement in December that Hermione would be played by a black actress, Noma Dumezweni, caused an online uproar that is still reverberating and included a denunciation by Ms. Rowling of critics of the casting decision. Tidbits judiciously revealed by Pottermore have stoked intense speculation. “When we altered the font of the title slightly, people were interpreting what it meant,” said Colin Callender, who   the show with Sonia Friedman. Photographs of cast members in costume provoked theories about which house the young Albus Severus, Harry’s middle son, will belong to (his cloak covered the house colors) and whether he and the young Scorpius Malfoy, son of Harry’s longtime foe, Draco, will be friends or enemies. (The name seems like a clue, no?) In the final book’s epilogue, Albus is given particular attention, and in a 2007 documentary, Ms. Rowling casually said, “Albus is the one I’m most interested in,” when talking about the way her fictional characters linger in her imagination. Is he the Cursed Child? For those who wish they could apparate to the Palace Theater, keep watching this space for clues. For those who don’t want to know, watch for spoiler alerts. ROSLYN SULCAS",0
8124,"Gems, Hidden in Plain Sight in Macedonia - The New York Times","Every tourist to the Balkans has probably heard about the dramatic remaking of  Macedonia’s capital, Skopje.   years after the country peacefully won independence from the former Yugoslavia, its capital is in the midst of a huge  : the construction of some 40 monuments, sculptures, facades and buildings. The transformation is meant to sweep away the   pall and attract tourists. I was one of them last year. Everywhere I looked, I felt small, dwarfed by shiny, new gargantuan bronze statues of Alexander the Great and his parents, Philip II of Macedon and Olympias, that lord over the main plaza. Galloping horses here and imposing Doric columns there round out various corners   facades and balconies reminded me of Josef Stalin’s wedding   apartments along East Berlin’s broad boulevards, which have a certain retro appeal these days but still feel overwrought. Despite the immense investment here  —   the current estimate of the project is $727 million, according to the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network  —   tour operators who aren’t closely linked with the country’s   tourism office are championing a different reason to visit the region: ecotourism. This nascent industry is less interested in Skopje’s overhaul and more keen to spirit travelers along the country’s hiking trails to   Byzantine monasteries and caves, and arrange cycling tours and homestays with cordial Macedonians who can talk about their country’s culture and history. My guide, Slobodan (who goes by his nickname, Danko) works for one of these operators, Macedonia Experience, run by Jane Josifovski, which organizes Jeep safaris, horseback riding, caving, diving and paragliding. My visit last year came when Macedonia had been in the headlines, as hundreds of thousands of refugees had crossed the country’s southern border en route to northern Europe. And yet, Mr. Josifovski told me, overnight stays and tourism in general in Macedonia were moving at a strong clip, helped along by cheap flights into Skopje on the budget airline Wizz Air and inexpensive travel within the country. The morning after I arrived in the capital, Danko drove me to Matka Canyon, one of his favorite haunts. A former student of architecture and the son of engineers, he told me on the way that he had decided to be a mountaineer (and drummer). Most weekends, he heads into the mountains, less than an hour’s drive from Skopje, to hike or ski. From the trailhead, I followed him up narrow, leafy passes and around switchbacks while he recounted the history of the pathways we’d be exploring. The Ottomans had blazed many of Matka’s trails as they sought to build a railroad from Lake Ohrid, on the Albanian border, into Macedonia’s interior. Danko occasionally turned back to point out the view. We could see the Treska River and forested, misty ravines, as well as spiked ridges, like blades of a knife. He later led me to see the   Church of St. Nikola, which was locked, but while perched at a nearby picnic table on a ledge overhanging the summit, he pointed first to hooks driven into the sides of the steep faces, and told me which he himself had scaled. He then pointed to the canyon’s depths, to the cloistered, emerald Lake Matka and to the Monastery of St. Andrew, alongside an attractive lakeside chalet resort, making for a dramatic panorama. We made our way down the mountain toward the lake and once we reached the shore, Danko hailed a small motorboat with a thatched bamboo roof to take us across to the resort. Once there, we sipped espressos and gazed out at the striated gorge while waiting for the next boat that would take us up the Treska River to Cave Vrelo. It had turned chilly, and the thought of touring a frigid cave didn’t excite me, but Danko insisted it would be worth the effort. Our boat finally appeared, and we sped onward through the cavernous passage, where I saw Robinson   bungalows and tree houses on the banks and ducks with their ducklings scurrying away from our boat. Cave Vrelo is among 10 caves in the Matka Canyon, and it is also among Europe’s deepest. As we docked near its entrance, Danko pointed out murky gaps in the exterior where divers slip inside. We were taking the overland route, and as we descended the slippery stairs, I gradually saw that Danko had been right: Before me were   stalactites, smooth in contour, like otherworldly wax, and one most noticeably shaped like a pine cone. Bats swerved overhead as we approached one stunning section known as the concert hall because members of the Macedonian Philharmonic Orchestra once played there after the cave was opened to visitors. We later sat at the restaurant Mechkina Dupka, or Bear’s Cave, where I ordered the   Village Chicken. It was baked, covered in a savory mushroom sauce, and came with fresh squash sautéed in garlic and olive oil, along with a hearty house white wine from Macedonia’s Tikves region. We had a long drive ahead of us, said Danko, via Tetovo and into the Mavrovo National Park, so we toasted our journey before hitting the road. When we reached Tetovo, Danko navigated heavy traffic, and I wondered if a stop there was worth our time. But as we finally pulled up alongside the Sarena Dzamija mosque, my eyes took in the vibrant painting and graceful   design. This was indeed a rare find, in part because it is uncommon for a mosque’s exterior to be so adorned  —   Sarena Dzamija translates to “decorated mosque”  —   but also because two sisters, named Hurshida and Mensure, rather than sultans or pashas, had bankrolled the construction in 1438. The women are buried in the octagonal stone turbe adjacent to the mosque. By dusk, we were at Mavrovo National Park, and had checked into the inviting home of Deni and Tina Lazareski in the village of Leunovo, located in the park itself. The pair welcome tourists   and had recently built an addition to their home for guests. Tina had prepared stuffed peppers in a tomato sauce for us, and we sat around the dinner table long after the meal, talking about our families, and in particular, life under Communism, all aided by Danko’s translation. Danko had hoped to guide me to the summit of Mount Medenica in the Bistra Massif the next day, but we woke to a heavy fog and he didn’t want to risk getting lost. So we chose a trail at a lower elevation that still afforded us pretty views of wild horses in the distance and shepherds with their flocks, as well as clusters of almost supernatural,   cotton thistles. We departed the pastoral scene for Galicnik, a village renowned for its traditional folk dancing and weddings every July, where we met Marko Bekric, who runs a   business. Over lunch at his family’s restaurant, he explained that the business had been inspired by years of cycling the Bistra mountains, scoping out new paths, and thinking that enthusiasts from abroad would thrill to the unspoiled nature, as he does. The Macedonian government evidently thought the same, granting him a rural development loan to start the venture. After lunch, he led me across the road to show me an abandoned   factory he’d renovated where he stores the bikes. Someday, he added, he’d like to convert the building into a museum and offer instruction on making sheep and goat cheese. The tour, though, reached a height the next day when it shifted from ecotourism to cultural immersion in gorgeous Ohrid, one of Europe’s oldest cities at a jewel of a lake bordering both Macedonia and Albania. Our guide, Nebojsa Kamilov, led us up and down the   hills of the city  —   whose Slavic name comes from vo rid, or “city on the hill. ” At just about every turn we took in sweeping views of the translucent water, none so sublime as those at the picturesque Church of St. Jovan at Kaneo, perched on a finger jutting out into the vast lake. A student of art and history, Nebojsa gave a fascinating overview of Ohrid’s Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman roots its scholarly legacy (the first Slavic university was established here by the   Sts. Kliment and Naum) and the hundreds of other churches that once dotted the hillsides, supposedly one for every day of the year. We visited several of these ubiquitous and elegant multidomed churches, each with a covetable collection of frescoes, icons and mosaics. My favorite was the Church of St. Kliment and St. Pantelejmon, which had a   mosaic mysteriously signed “Made by those whose names are only known to God. ” These, of course, were the soaring buildings of their day, structures that involved immense expenditures and likely cost overruns that would dwarf those in Skopje. But these churches, this landscape, had stood the test of time. As Macedonia’s capital remakes itself, their permanence is a reassuring reminder that while this country has changed hands more times than one can count, its beauty and its culture endure.",0
8125,American Irrationalism,"Donald Trump on “The Apprentice”: The false values of reality TV have been carried over into the current presidential race. (NBC) 
There is no shortage of signs of impending environmental catastrophe, including the melting of the polar ice caps and the rise of atmospheric carbon to above 400 parts per million . The planet’s sixth mass extinction is underway. It is not taking place because of planetary forces. Homo sapiens is orchestrating it. We are at the same time bankrupting ourselves by waging endless and unwinnable wars. We have allowed our elites to push more than half the U.S. population into poverty and, often, profound despair through deindustrialization. We do nothing to halt the waves of nihilistic violence by enraged citizens who carry out periodic mass shootings in schools, malls, movie theaters and other public places. The political and financial elites flaunt their greed and corruption. Donald Trump appears to pay no federal income taxes. Bill and Hillary Clinton use their foundation as a tool for legalized bribery. Our largest corporations have orchestrated a legal tax boycott. The judicial system is a subsidiary of the corporate state. Militarized police carry out public executions of unarmed people of color. Our infrastructure, including our schools, roads and bridges, along with our deindustrialized cities, are in ruins. Decay and rot—physical and moral—are pervasive. 
We are blinded to our depressing reality by the avalanche of images disseminated by mass media. Political, intellectual and cultural discourse has been replaced with spectacle. Emotionalism and sensationalism are prized over truth. Highly paid pundits who parrot back the official narrative, corporate advertisers, inane talk shows, violent or sexually explicit entertainment and gossip-fueled news have contaminated cultural life. Reality television, as contrived as every other form of mass entertainment, has produced what might be called a reality presidential candidate. 
Mass culture, because it speaks to us in easily digestible clichés and stereotypes, reinforces ignorance, bigotry and racism. It promotes our individual and collective self-glorification. It sanctifies nonexistent national virtues. It takes from us the intellectual and linguistic tools to separate illusion from truth. It is all show business all the time. 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
There are hundreds of millions of Americans who know that something is terribly wrong. A light has gone out. They see it in their own suffering and hopelessness and the suffering and hopelessness of their neighbors. But they lack, because of the contamination of our political, cultural and intellectual discourse, the words and ideas to make sense of what is happening around them. They are bereft of a vision. Austerity, globalization, unfettered capitalism, an expansion of the extraction of fossil fuels and endless war are not the price to be paid for progress and the advance of civilization. They are part of the savage and deadly exploitation by corporate capitalism and imperialism. They serve a neoliberal ideology . The elites dare not speak this truth. It is toxic. They peddle the seductive illusions that saturate the airwaves. We are left to strike out at shadows. We are enticed to succumb to the racism, allure of white supremacy and bigotry that always accompanies a culture in dissolution. 
We cannot, for this reason, discount the possibility that Donald Trump will be elected president. The election outcome will be decided by whatever emotion Americans feel when they cast their ballots. 
Celebrity narratives, manufactured pseudo-drama, sex scandals, natural disasters, insults and invective, mass shootings and war flash before us in a constant jumble of images on ubiquitous screens. The assault of images obliterates reality. A former congressman who sends a picture of himself in underwear to a woman is a national news story. Sober examinations of our economic, foreign, judicial and environmental policies are dismissed as too complicated and boring. It does not produce engaging images. The electronic media’s sole goal is to attract viewers and advertising dollars. It has conditioned us to demand an endless vaudeville act. 
We are infected because of this mass indoctrination by what Daniel Boorstin in “ The Image : A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America” calls “social narcissism.” The bottomless narcissism of Trump and Bill and Hillary Clinton cater to this social narcissism. They reflect back to us our desperate longing for, as well as celebration of, entertainment, celebrity, wealth, power and self-aggrandizement. It is not only advertising and public relations, as Boorstin points out, that carries out the incessant manufacturing of illusions that feed social narcissism. Journalists, book publishers, politicians, athletes, entertainers, positive psychologists, self-help gurus, the Christian Right and talk show hosts all feed the mania for illusion. They all chant the insane mantra that reality is never an impediment to what we desire. We can have anything we want if we work hard, get an education, believe in ourselves, grasp that we are exceptional and believe the impossible is always possible. It is magical thinking. And magical thinking is the only real commodity the elites have left offer to us. Make American Great Again. Or America already is great. Take your pick of idiotic clichés. 
“We tyrannize and frustrate ourselves by expecting more than the world can give us or than we can make of the world,” Boorstin writes. “We demand that everyone who talks to us, or writes for us, or takes pictures for us, or makes merchandise for us, should live in our world of extravagant expectations. We expect this even of the peoples of foreign countries. We have become so accustomed to our illusions that we mistake them for reality. We demand them. And we demand that there be always more of them, bigger and better and more vivid.” 
The incessant search for instant gratification and the most appealing image, including the image of ourselves we manufacture for others on social media, has robbed us of the ability to examine ourselves and our society. It has extinguished the truth. The terminal decline of the American empire, the utter incompetence of our elites to manage everything from the ecosystem to the economy and foreign policy, the climate crisis, along with the widespread poverty and despair that defines over half of America, do not fit with the illusion. So these realities are blotted from public consciousness. The poor are rendered invisible. The climate crisis is ignored. The foreign policy debacles will be fixed with more bombs. A culture that can no longer discern or confront reality is unable to reform itself and dies. Only the Soviet and fascist dictatorships, along with the medieval Catholic Church, controlled thought as effectively.",0
8126,London Bridge Terror Ringleader May Have Plotted to Attack Wimbledon,"The ringleader of the London Bridge terror attack secured an interview with a security firm providing personnel to Wimbledon, sparking fears he was plotting to strike the tennis tournament. [Khuram Butt, who was a known extremist on a list of British police extremist suspects, landed the interview with the unnamed firm that also supplies staff to Premier League football matches.  Wimbledon is the oldest and most famous tennis tournament in the world, attracting 493, 928 spectators over 14 days in 2016, and   police are now investigating Mr. Butt’s motives for trying to work at the iconic event, The Sunday Telegraph reports. “The security firm would check his background but it does not have access to the police watch list or have knowledge of any MI5 investigation. There would have been no reason for him not to get the job,” a security source told the paper. They added: “Butt could not only have caused serious damage but potentially helped other terrorists get into one of these events. ” The revelation comes as Scotland Yard released photographs of the three London Bridge attackers’ fake suicide belts Sunday night. Mr. Butt was a supporter of notorious hate preacher Anjem Choudary’s banned terror group   and appeared on a Channel 4 television documentary called The Jihadi Next Door in 2016. He was reported to police for radicalising children in a park and was followed around the clock in 2015 whilst intelligence services were intercepting his communications under a warrant signed by the home secretary. Officers wound down the investigation, however, amidst concerns that there was not enough evidence to convict the suspect and “get him off the streets” sources told The Sunday Times. The security insider continued: “We knew Butt was up to no good. We got to know him intimately. We wanted to get him off the streets. But the view was that we may not have enough to convict. ” The   British citizen, who came to the UK as an asylum seeker, was considered by police to be “low priority” despite warnings from whistleblowers. After he led last weekend’s attack, which resulted in the death of eight and 48 injured, there are calls for police to   how they handled his case.",0
8127,Podesta Brothers Kidnapped a 3yo British Girl in Portugal - Wikileaks,"
On Sunday evening, side-by-side images of Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign chairman John Podesta and his brother Tony next to police sketches of potential suspects in a 2007 kidnapping of a three-year-old girl took over the internet.
The resemblance is striking, and Reddit, 4chan, and Twitter rapidly took up the case.

Madeleine Beth McCann should have celebrated her 13th birthday with her family in England this year, but she vanished from her bed during a family vacation to Portugal in 2003. The case gripped the entire world, becoming one of the most high profile missing persons cases in history. Coverage of her kidnapping was comparable to the press interest in the death of Princess Diana.
Her parents had been out with friends at the hotel restaurant approximately 200 feet from where the child had been sleeping. When her mother Kate McCann went to check on her around 11 pm, but she was gone.
â€œWe go to bed every night with the agonising feeling that just maybe tomorrow we will find something to lead us back to Madeleine. To let us know what happened. To give us hope,â€ Kate McCann, who is now an ambassador for Missing People, said at the launch of a new nonprofit organization called Find Every Child, in London this week .
Though it has been nearly a decade since their little girl vanished, the family has continued the search, and believe that there is a possibility that she may still be alive.
â€œWhen my little girl first disappeared, on that horrendous night that changed our lives forever, I could never have imagined that nearly 10 years later we would still be in the same position,â€ she continued.
In 2013, five years after Portuguese police had closed the case, they reopened it and revealed two new police sketches. It was believed that they were supposed to be of the same man, but from two different witnesses. Reddit and others on social media are now asking, what if it was actually two different men, and what if it was the Podestas?

An email found in the Wikileaks release of John Podestaâ€™s emails at the time of McCannâ€™s disappearance implies that he may have been vacationing around the time of her disappearance, but does not indicate where.
People have also pointed out that another police sketch related to the case looks strikingly similar to Anthony Wiener.

Tony Podestaâ€™s home also contains photographs of nude teenage girls in one of the bedrooms â€” because â€œart.â€
â€œFolks attending a house tour in the Lake Barcroft neighborhood in Falls Church earlier this year got an eyeful when they walked into a bedroom at the Podesta residence hung with multiple color pictures by Katy Grannan, a photographer known for documentary-style pictures of naked teenagers in their parentsâ€™ suburban homes,â€ the Washington Post reported in 2004.
â€œThey were horrified,â€ Tonyâ€™s wife Heather told the Post of her guests reactions, as a grin reportedly spread across her face.
While it is extremely far-fetched that the Podestas would be involved in this extremely high-profile missing persons case, the fact that thousands of people are having serious discussions about it on a Sunday evening speaks volumes about the trust people have in Hillary Clintonâ€™s inner circle.

8128,Thai Officials Battle Buddhist Monks Over Tigers’ Fate - The New York Times,"SAI YOK, Thailand  —   Saira Tahir, a London lawyer, waved a bamboo pole with a plastic bag affixed to the end high in the air. A   tiger leapt and swatted it like a house cat batting a string toy. For her $140 premium admission, Ms. Tahir also bathed a tiger,   a cub and posed for a photo with a tiger’s head in her lap. “It’s a surreal experience being so close to them,” she said. “Even with the tiger’s head in your lap, you can feel the energy. It’s not something you do every day. ” Part Buddhist monastery and part petting zoo, the Tiger Temple in western Thailand has long been the bane of conservationists and animal rights activists who accuse it of abuse and exploitation even as it offers tourists an Edenesque wildlife fantasy. Now, after complaints of trafficking in endangered species, the government is trying to shut down the attraction. But there are two major obstacles: the temple, which has gone to court to block the closing, and the tigers. What do you do with nearly 150 carnivorous cats raised in captivity? The government began removing the tigers this year but was ordered to stop after the lawsuit was filed in February. Until the case is resolved, the fate of the tigers is mired in a legal standoff that pits wildlife officials, conservationists and Thailand’s military government against a wealthy tourist enterprise backed by influential Buddhist monks. The Tiger Temple, in rural Kanchanaburi Province near the Myanmar border, started collecting animals 15 years ago with an act of charity. Villagers took an injured tiger cub to the local abbot, who agreed to care for it. Word spread, and soon there were six tigers. “We built this temple to spread Buddhism,” said Supitpong Pakdjarung, a former police colonel who runs the temple’s business arm. “The tigers came by themselves. ” The tourists came next. Today, the temple takes in $5. 7 million a year from ticket sales, wildlife officials say, and receives millions more in donations. A standard ticket, about $17, entitles a visitor to walk a leashed tiger and pose with a chained tiger. The 15 or so monks who live on the grounds have little to do with the tigers beyond occasionally posing with them for tourists. But a Buddhist atmosphere is part of the pitch. The temple promotes itself as a place where tigers betray their wild nature to coexist with humans in Buddhist harmony. “We can live together peacefully because of kindness,” Mr. Supitpong said. Some monks and staff members believe that certain tigers are reincarnated monks or relatives. Mr. Supitpong said that through meditation, monks had come up with dietary solutions to repair genetic defects from inbreeding. “It is a spiritual connection,” he said. The Buddhist imprimatur also makes the temple a powerful adversary in its legal battle with the government. In Thailand, the moral authority of monks rivals the secular authority of the law. “They have the power to say right or wrong in terms of morality,” said Surapot Taweesak, a scholar in philosophy and religion at Suan Dusit Rajabhat University in Bangkok. “This makes people listen and not dare to argue or debate with monks for fear of being sinful. ” The government has ordered the temple to stop breeding tigers, charging fees to tourists and letting visitors feed tigers, officials say, but the temple has refused. “The monks have the attitude, ‘I am over the law,’ ” said Teunchai Noochdumrong, the director of Thailand’s Wildlife Conservation Office. “They say because they are monks, they have the right to take care of all the animals in that area. ” The abbot, Phra Vissuthisaradhera, is “not a monk,” Ms. Teunchai said. “He’s a criminal. ” Mr. Vissuthisaradhera, who was attacked and clawed on the face last year by his favorite tiger, declined to be interviewed. For years, the temple has faced allegations of misconduct. Recently, a handler was caught on video punching a tiger in the head. Mr. Supitpong acknowledges that staff members sometimes have to strike the tigers to distract them from focusing on tourists as prey. “We have to hit them so we can change the tiger’s mood at the moment,” he said. Charges of tiger smuggling date to at least 2008, when the British group Care for the Wild said the temple was illegally trading tigers with a farm in neighboring Laos. Last year, the temple’s veterinarian resigned and reported that three tigers had vanished from the temple. He handed over three microchips that he said had been removed from the tigers such chips are used to track endangered animals. An Australian organization, Cee4life, claims that 281 tigers have been born at the temple over the years and that natural deaths alone could not account for today’s population, which stands at 138, not counting the 10 already removed by the government. The organization also presented evidence that some of the temple’s first tigers had been caught in the wild and that others had been brought later from Laos. The temple’s business success has inspired dozens of other operators of unlicensed zoos to offer tourists close contact with rare animals, said Edwin Wiek, the founder of the Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand. The animals they breed are unwanted once they mature, Mr. Wiek said, contributing to Thailand’s role as a global hub for illegal trafficking in endangered animals. Tiger parts are in high demand in Asia, particularly China, for use in traditional medicine. Tiger bone can fetch as much as $168 a pound, and tiger penis soup goes for as much as $320 a bowl. At the Tiger Temple, only tigers under age 4  —   there are 16 of them now  —   are brought out for tourists. Larger tigers, which can be careless about the rules of interspecies harmony, are retired to cages. After the veterinarian’s accusations, the government revoked the temple’s permission to keep tigers. The temple lacks documents proving ownership, so wildlife officials contend that the tigers belong to the government. Temple officials deny abusing the tigers or trading in tigers or tiger parts. They lack ownership papers, they say, because most of the tigers were born at the temple. Mr. Supitpong said that the three tigers suspected to be missing were still on the premises, and that he had no knowledge of any microchips being removed. During a raid last year, government officials also found eight hornbills and six Asian black bears, also protected species. The temple said it was the legitimate owner of those animals, too, but lacked the documents proving it, Ms. Teunchai said. When wildlife officials tried to seize the animals last year, protesting monks and temple supporters blocked the main road to the temple. Officials circumvented the protest by driving a crane to the side of the temple and hoisting the bears over a   wall. Mr. Supitpong says the temple earns $3 million a year in ticket revenue, about half what the government says. Most of the donations go toward the construction of a $29 million temple that is expected to be completed in 2022, the next Year of the Tiger. The temple will be one of Thailand’s largest. “We have received all the funds by the tigers’ virtue,” Mr. Supitpong said. “In the past we called it ‘monks feed tigers.’ But now it’s ‘tigers feed monks.’ ” There are about 2, 000 captive tigers in Thailand, but most are a mix of Bengal tigers, a type that is native to the Indian subcontinent, and Indochinese tigers. Only an estimated 189 Indochinese tigers  —   the subspecies native to the region  —   remain in Thailand’s forests. The crossbred tigers are of no value in protecting the species as a whole, conservationists say. While the temple tigers are not domesticated  —   their behavior can be unpredictable, and there have been several attacks on tourists and staff members  —   they are not wild, either, having been raised in captivity and unafraid of people. If the Tiger Temple is shut down, the tigers cannot simply be set free in the jungle. The 10 tigers removed by the government were taken by truck to a government center, the Khao Prathap Chang Wildlife Breeding Center, in neighboring Ratchaburi Province, where each has a    cage equipped with a concrete pool the size of a large bathtub. The cages, unlike those at the temple, have no access to an enclosure with grass and trees. Temple officials insist that tigers are better off at the temple. “In Thailand, this is the best place for them,” said Tanya Erzinclioglu, a volunteer coordinator. But Banpot Maleehuan, the government center’s director, said ending the tigers’ close contact with people had already been good for them. “They have been here two months now, and they are becoming real tigers,” he said. “A tiger is a tiger, not a pet. They have to live their nature. ”",0
8129,Bombing Suspect Pleads Not Guilty in Shootout With New Jersey Officers - The New York Times,"ELIZABETH, N. J.  —   More than three weeks after the bombings in New York City and at the Jersey Shore, the man accused in the attacks pleaded not guilty on Thursday to charges relating to the attempted murder of police officers. The man, Ahmad Khan Rahami, who appeared in Superior Court here via video conference from his bed at University Hospital in Newark, said little, generally giving   answers to questions. Mr. Rahami, 28, has been in the hospital recovering from gunshot wounds since his capture on Sept. 19 in Linden, N. J. It was the public’s first glimpse of Mr. Rahami since he was loaded into an ambulance after a shootout with officers that ended a search for the person responsible for planting bombs here, in Seaside Park, N. J. and in Manhattan. One of the bombs, planted under a trash bin on 23rd Street in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, exploded on Sept. 17, injuring 31 people. Earlier that day, an explosive detonated in a trash can in Seaside Park, where a   race had been scheduled. Another blast occurred as a robot was trying to disarm explosives left in the trash at the train station in Elizabeth. A fourth bomb was found in Chelsea, but it did not detonate. Charges relating to the bombings have been filed in federal court, although Mr. Rahami has not been arraigned on them. It is rare for so much time to pass between a defendant’s arrest and his first appearance in court. But in the days after Mr. Rahami’s capture, state prosecutors opposed an effort by public defenders to visit him, saying that he was “incapacitated and unable to communicate” and therefore unable to assert his right to a counsel. Little has been said about Mr. Rahami’s health. He was shot several times after he fired on officers who had discovered him asleep in the vestibule of a bar. But on Thursday, he could be seen reclining in a hospital bed, his head propped up by a pillow. A white sheet was draped over his body, concealing the extent of his injuries. In a soft voice, Mr. Rahami answered “yes” to a few routine questions from the judge: Was he able to hear what the judge was saying? Had he seen a copy of the criminal charges? One of his lawyers, Peter Liguori, did much of the talking, as he stood over Mr. Rahami’s bed, in a yellow hospital gown and blue gloves. Mr. Liguori said Mr. Rahami would be pleading not guilty to each of the charges. “I will enter a not guilty plea, of course, on all the charges,” the judge, Regina Caulfield, said before setting bail at $5. 2 million. Judge Caulfield outlined the charges Mr. Rahami faces in state court, the most serious of which were the attempted murder of five police officers. None were seriously injured. He is accused of shooting one officer in the torso, although that officer was spared serious injury because of his body armor. It is not known when Mr. Rahami will be formally arraigned in federal court on   charges. An   naturalized United States citizen, he is said by federal prosecutors to have taken his inspiration from “Brother Osama bin Laden” and other international terrorists, including members of the Islamic State, according to a criminal complaint and a notebook he had when he was apprehended. Still, much about his radicalization remains unknown. Mr. Rahami spent hours watching videos on the internet espousing violent jihad, frightening his father, Mohammad Rahami, who confronted his son and said he shared his concerns with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, after his son had been arrested on assault charges in a domestic violence case. But Mr. Rahami’s radicalization does not appear to have occurred entirely in his bedroom, above the family’s fried chicken restaurant here. He traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan for extended periods in recent years. He returned home from one yearlong trip in 2014, noticeably angry, friends and relatives have said. His family grew concerned that he may have come under the sway of a radical cleric while living in Quetta, Pakistan, where the Rahami family has relatives.",0

8131,"Good at Skipping Ads? No, You’re Not - The New York Times","BLACK OPS ADVERTISINGNative Ads, Content Marketing, and the Covert World of the Digital Sell By Mara Einstein248 pp. OR Books. Paper, $18. I don’t often watch late night television, which may be why I was caught unawares. Jimmy Fallon’s opening monologue began hilariously enough, when abruptly he pivoted to a series of inexplicably weak jokes centered on a forthcoming football game. It slowly dawned on me that I was watching a commercial for NBC’s “Sunday Night Football,” albeit one baked right into the opening monologue and delivered by Fallon himself. The realization that something you thought to be “real” is actually an advertisement is an increasingly common, if unsettling, sensation. Mara Einstein calls it “content confusion,” and if her book, “Black Ops Advertising,” is right, we’re in for even more such trickery, indeed a possible future where nearly everything becomes hidden commercial propaganda of one form or another. She forecasts the potential of a “world where there is no real content: Everything we experience is some form of sales pitch. ” Einstein, a former advertising executive turned media professor (who, among other things, worked campaigns for Uncle Ben’s and Miller Lite) makes it clear that things were not always this way. Once upon a time the line between editorial and advertising, if not exactly a Chinese wall, was somewhat clearer. Einstein’s   and accomplished book is mainly about the effort to tear down that wall. The sledgehammers and pick axes in this case are things like “sponsored content,” “native advertising” and “content marketing” designed to fool you into thinking they are real. Such stealth advertising may entertain or inform, yet it also brands, or more cleverly, facilitates a later branding exercise or sales pitch. The handoff can be smooth enough that you don’t notice you’ve been steered to exit through the gift shop. “Black Ops” presents some startling examples of stealth advertising. Remember that guy who in 2012 jumped out of a helium balloon at 128, 000 feet for a new world record? Covered widely in the media, it was all, according to Einstein, a disguised Red Bull marketing campaign, but one where Red Bull’s role was so discreet as to be almost invisible. You may also recall the audacious “tagging” of Air Force One by a graffiti artist named Marc Ecko, which has been viewed nearly a million times on YouTube. It was a hoax intended for the branding of a clothing and accessories label. That “ad” fooled so many members of the public and press that it was awarded the top prize for digital media at the annual Cannes Lions advertising festival. The book is slightly guilty of exaggerating the novelty of   advertising techniques. Content that doubles as brand advertising is not exactly new. In the 1980s, “The Transformers” and “G. I. Joe” were popular children’s cartoons but also advertisements, and so of course was the much beloved “Mickey Mouse Club” back in the 1960s. The idea of inventing media stories for commercial purpose also has a long pedigree, dating to at least the late 1920s, when Lucky Strike staged a protest (the “torches of liberty”) featuring attractive women demanding the right to smoke outdoors as a part of suffragist liberation (yielding, ultimately, an equal right to lung cancer). Subliminal advertising, perhaps the blackest of all black ops, was popular in the 1950s, until it was banned. The difference, Einstein argues, lies in how much effort is going toward the dark arts. It is, she suggests, for one simple reason: that we, the public, are so good at avoiding or ignoring traditional advertising. We are fickle fish, cynical creatures who have already been hooked so many times that the simpler lures no longer work. We avoid ads using devices as simple as the remote control (originally conceived as an   technology) and as sophisticated as   phones (thanks, Apple). Many of us have developed a mental blindness that helps us see through advertising as if it were not there. Indeed, ad avoidance has become a lifestyle, so much so that some people will simply declare, “I don’t watch advertising” the same way one might declare adherence to a   diet. Einstein’s book wanders from its main topic into a fuller review of contemporary advertising practice, including   on social media, mass harvesting of private data and other unappealing practices. Perhaps the most important contribution she makes is providing a clear sense of what free content actually costs. There was a time when the idealists among us prophesied that the 21st century would be a golden age of free stuff, powered by a culture of sharing, and that targeted advertising would be a blessing for consumers. Today that vision has soured and even seems like a bad joke given how plagued we are by the rise of stealth advertising, the invasions of privacy, the proliferation of clickbait and stalking advertising, and the general degradation of much of the web. Einstein is not enthusiastic about contemporary advertising practice, and few of us are likely to regard constant deception as attractive. But what’s the remedy? One, briefly mentioned by Einstein, is legal. The Federal Trade Commission regards advertising posing as legitimate content to be an illegal form of “consumer deception. ” Einstein calls for more enforcement, but admits that it’s not easy. What does one do, for example, about the many movies (like “The Transformers”) and reality shows (“Keeping Up With the Kardashians”) that are simultaneously entertainment and advertisement? Einstein is not the first former marketing executive to turn on her profession James Rorty, in 1934, wrote of his colleagues: “They are dead men. Their bones are Bakelite. Their blood is water, their flesh is pallid  —   yes, prick them and they do not bleed. ” But unlike Rorty, who wanted to destroy advertising, she would prefer to save it: She is nostalgic for the recent past, when audiences sitting through commercials made deception unnecessary. But if that’s the remedy, it is a lost cause: No one who figures out how to avoid advertising willingly goes back. Einstein too quickly discards the most important remedy for advertising’s abuses: paying for content. A broader historical view can remind us that   media competes with paid media (like HBO, film, books). Those who don’t want to live in a world constantly trying to trick us into watching ads may have the most impact by voting with their dollars and starving the beast of the attention it needs to survive. Paying for things (Facebook, if it let you pay, Einstein tells us, might be $12 a year) strikes at the heart of the business model, and indeed a partial revolt is already underway, as suggested by the popularity of   subscription services like Netflix. It is a reminder that   supported entertainment is hardly indelible or eternal, but a relatively recent invention whose future is insecure. From this perspective, the rise of black ops advertising may be less a sign of power than of desperation.",0

8133,Tom Wolfe’s ‘The Kingdom of Speech’ Takes Aim at Darwin and Chomsky - The New York Times,"“If you are not having a fight with somebody,” Tom Wolfe told The Guardian in 2004, “then you are not sure whether you are alive when you wake up in the morning. ” Mr. Wolfe is famous for his   and   books of literary journalism (“The Electric   Acid Test” in 1968, “The Right Stuff” in 1979) and for   social novels like “The Bonfire of the Vanities” (1987) and “A Man in Full” (1998). Like an industrial engineer who also makes bespoke dueling pistols in his shed on the weekends, Mr. Wolfe has made a side career of skirmishing with the eminati (his term) in an array of cultural fields. If fighting enlivens one’s mornings, Mr. Wolfe has had little need of caffeine. He took aim at Modern art and its enabling theorists in “The Painted Word” (1975) and modern architecture and its critical druids in “From Bauhaus to Our House” (1981). In his essay “Stalking the   Beast” (1989) he   the American literary establishment for its solipsistic retreat from realism. He referred to three of his antagonists  —   John Updike, Norman Mailer and John Irving  —   in the title of another essay, published in 2000, as “My Three Stooges. ” Mr. Wolfe’s assaults were not meant to be well received by his entrenched opponents, and indeed they were not. He was tagged as an incorrigible philistine and worse. Few took his more combative books and essays altogether seriously, though they sharpened the conversation. Oddly, little of the stirred mud stuck to him. To recall these contretemps is to freshly appreciate Mr. Wolfe’s cameo appearance in “The Simpsons” when, after Homer smears chocolate on the author’s trademark white suit, Mr. Wolfe yanks it off to reveal an identical clean one underneath. Mr. Wolfe, now 85, shows no sign of mellowing. His new book, “The Kingdom of Speech,” is his boldest bit of dueling yet. It’s a whooping,   and hyperbolic raid on, of all things, the theory of evolution, which he finds to be less scientific certainty than “a messy guess  —   baggy, boggy, soggy and leaking all over the place,” to put it in the words he inserts into the mouths of past genetic theorists. Secondarily, this book is a rebuke of the work of the linguist Noam Chomsky, whom Mr. Wolfe refers to as “Noam Charisma. ” Rebuke is actually too frivolous a word for the contumely Mr. Wolfe looses in his direction. More precisely, he tars and feathers Mr. Chomsky before sticking a clown nose on his face and rolling him in a baby stroller off a cliff. Mr. Wolfe does not complain about evolution on religious grounds in fact, he is an atheist. He begins by declaring the notion of the big bang to be vaguely ridiculous, and likens it to a mythopoetic bedtime story. Everything came from nothing? Most essentially, Mr. Wolfe employs new research from the controversial anthropologist Daniel Everett to argue that the power of speech  —   man’s signal attribute  —   is not the product of evolution at all but rather a tool that man created. “Bango!” Mr. Wolfe writes. “There is a cardinal distinction between man and animal. ” He wonders how airtight the theory of evolution can be if it does not account for such a thing. “What is it,” he asks, “that has left endless generations of academics, certified geniuses, utterly baffled when it comes to speech?” Scientists will be likely to shrug at Mr. Wolfe’s lucid if overexcited synthesis of other people’s ideas and respond this way: We’ll get there, in terms of sussing out speech, through the combined use of anatomy and physiology and biochemistry. The structures that support language don’t fossilize, so evidence is simply harder to come by. This is not something we will lose sleep over, no matter how much you pogo and spit in the Sid Vicious manner. Mr. Chomsky, on the other hand, reading “The Kingdom of Speech,” may lose a bit of sleep. Mr. Wolfe chronicles the arguments against two of that linguist’s central theories  —   the notion that humans are born with an unseen language organ in the brain, and the complicated structural concept of recursion in language  —   and declares Mr. Chomsky to be bankrupt in nearly every regard, a pretentious man whose ideas set linguistic study back for decades. He narrates disputations of Mr. Chomsky’s work as if they were prizefights: “OOOF!  —   right into the solar plexus!” Mr. Wolfe seems especially incensed that as a scholar, Mr. Chomsky privileged mental work over fieldwork, making linguistics an indoor rather than an outdoor pursuit. (In this book’s first section, Mr. Wolfe attacks Charles Darwin on similar grounds, paying almost no attention to the nearly five years Darwin spent aboard the Beagle.) These arguments neatly parallel his brief against American novelists whom, Mr. Wolfe thinks, don’t get out of the house nearly enough. Because this is a Tom Wolfe production, there is a great deal of funny and acid commentary on social class. About the possibility that Darwin, a wealthy and connected British gentleman, might have plundered some of his ideas about evolution from Alfred Russel Wallace, a social nobody, he writes: “The British Gentleman was not merely rich, powerful, and refined. He was also a slick operator   …     smooth   …     smooth   …     smooth and then some. It was said that a British Gentleman could steal your underwear, your smalls and skivvies and knickers, and leave you staring straight at him asking if he didn’t think it had turned rather chilly all of a sudden. ” Because this is a Tom Wolfe production, a torrent of language is set free. Sentences spin past like whirligigs, or like Rube Goldberg devices that emit a pellet of information only after bouncing off four increasingly unlikely surfaces. Mr. Wolfe’s prose here is mostly   but there are moments when he seems on the verge of losing it, of falling into fragments of   nonsense that will put older readers in mind of the insane   columns Larry King once filed for USA Today. Here is Mr. Wolfe, for example, on the work of eight evolutionists he wishes to mock: “I surfed and Safaried and finally moused upon the only academic I could find who disagreed with the eight failures, a chemist at Rice University   …     Rice   …     Rice used to have a   football team   …     the Rice Owls   …     wonder how they’re doing now? I moused around on the Rice site some more, and     …     not so great last season, the Owls   …     football   …     and I surfed to football concussions   …     exactly as I thought!” The   system in his cranium, here and elsewhere, has gone haywire. “The Kingdom of Speech” is meant to be a provocation rather than a dissertation. The sound it makes is that of a lively mind having a very good time, and enjoying the scent of its own   napalm in the morning.",0
8134,Reasons to Risk Nuclear Annihilation,"Reasons to Risk Nuclear Annihilation   latest neocon/liberal-hawk scheme is for the U.S. population to risk nuclear war to protect corrupt politicians in Ukraine and Al Qaeda terrorists in east Aleppo, two rather dubious reasons to end life on the planet, says Robert Parry. 
By Robert Parry 
Obviously, I never wanted to see a nuclear war, which would likely kill not only me but my children, grandchildren, relatives, friends and billions of others. We’d be incinerated in the blast or poisoned by radiation or left to starve in a nuclear winter. 
But at least I always assumed that this horrific possibility would only come into play over something truly worthy, assuming that anything would justify the mass extinction of life on the planet. Peter Sellers playing Dr. Strangelove as he struggles to control his right arm from making a Nazi salute. 
Now, however, Official Washington’s neocons and liberal interventionists are telling me and others that we should risk nuclear annihilation over which set of thieves gets to rule Ukraine and over helping Al Qaeda terrorists (and their “moderate” allies) keep control of east Aleppo in Syria. 
In support of the Ukraine goal, there is endless tough talk at the think tanks, on the op-ed pages and in the halls of power about the need to arm the Ukrainian military so it can crush ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine who dared object to the U.S.-backed coup in 2014 that ousted their elected President Viktor Yanukovych. 
And after “liberating” eastern Ukraine, the U.S.-backed Ukrainian army would wheel around and “liberate” Crimea from Russia, even though 96 percent of Crimean voters voted to leave Ukraine and rejoin Russia – and there is no sign they want to go back . 
So, the world would be risking World War III over the principle of the West’s right to sponsor the overthrow of elected leaders who don’t do what they’re told and then to slaughter people who object to this violation of democratic order. 
This risk of nuclear Armageddon would then be compounded to defend the principle that the people of Crimea don’t have the right of self-determination but must submit to a corrupt post-coup regime in Kiev regardless of Crimea’s democratic judgment. 
And, to further maintain our resolve in this gamble over nuclear war in defense of Ukraine, we must ignore the spectacle of the U.S.-backed regime in Kiev wallowing in graft and corruption . 
While the Ukrainian people earn on average $214 a month and face neoliberal “reforms,” such as reduced pensions, extended years of work for the elderly and slashed heating subsidies, their new leaders in the parliament report wealth averaging more than $1 million in “monetary assets” each, much of it in cash. 
A Troubling Departure 
The obvious implication of widespread corruption was underscored on Monday with the abrupt resignation of former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili who was the appointed governor of Ukraine’s Odessa region. A scene from “Dr. Strangelove,” in which the bomber pilot (played by actor Slim Pickens) rides a nuclear bomb to its target in the Soviet Union. 
Though Saakashvili faces charges of abusing power back in Georgia, he was nevertheless put in charge of Odessa by current President Petro Poroshenko, but has now quit (or was ousted) amid charges and counter-charges about corruption. 
Noting the mysterious wealth of Ukraine’s officials, Saakashvili denounced the country’s rulers as “corrupt filth” and accused Poroshenko and his administration of sabotaging real reform. 
“Odessa can only develop once Kiev will be freed from these bribe takers, who directly patronize organized crime and lawlessness,” Saakashvili said . Yes, that would be a good slogan to scribble on the side of a nuclear bomb heading for Moscow: “Defending the corrupt filth and bribe takers who patronize organized crime.” 
But the recent finger-pointing about corruption is also ironic because the West cited the alleged corruption of the Yanukovych government to justify the violent putsch in February 2014 that drove him from office and sparked Ukraine’s current civil war. 
Yet, the problems don’t stop with Kiev’s corruption. There is the troubling presence of neo-Nazis , ultranationalists and even Islamic jihadists assigned to the Azov battalion and other military units sent east to the front lines to kill ethnic Russians. 
On top of that, United Nations human rights investigators have accused Ukraine’s SBU intelligence service of hiding torture chambers . 
But we consumers of the mainstream U.S. media’s narrative are supposed to see the putschists as the white hats and Yanukovych (who was excoriated for having a sauna in his official residence) and Russian President Vladimir Putin as the black hats. 
Though U.S. officials, such as Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, helped organize or “midwife” the coup ousting Yanukovych, we are told that the Ukraine crisis was a clear-cut case of “Russian aggression” and Crimea’s decision to secede (and rejoin Russia) was a “Russian invasion” and an “annexation.” 
So, all stirred up with righteous indignation, we absorbed the explanation that economic sanctions were needed to punish Putin and to destabilize Russian society, with the hoped-for goal of another “regime change,” this time in Moscow. 
We weren’t supposed to ask if anyone had actually thought through the idea of destabilizing a nuclear-armed power and the prospect that Putin’s overthrow, even if possible, might lead to a highly unstable fight for control of the nuclear codes. 
Silencing Dissent 
Brushing aside such worries, the neocons/liberal-hawks are confident that the answer is to move NATO forces up to Russia’s borders and to provide military training to Ukraine’s army, even to its neo-Nazi “shock troops.” Nazi symbols on helmets worn by members of Ukraine’s Azov battalion. (As filmed by a Norwegian film crew and shown on German TV) 
After all, when have the neocons and their liberal interventionist sidekicks ever miscalculated about anything. No fair mentioning Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya or other lucky countries that have been on the receiving end of a benighted “regime change.” 
An American who protests or even mentions the risk of nuclear war is dismissed as a “Kremlin stooge” or a “Putin puppet” or a “useful fool” repeating “Russian disinformation” and assisting Moscow’s “information war” against the U.S. government. 
But if you’re still a bit queasy about risking nuclear annihilation to keep some Ukrainian kleptocrats in power, there is the other cause worth having the human race die over: protecting Al Qaeda terrorists and their “moderate” rebel comrades holed up in east Aleppo. 
Since these modern terrorists turn out to be highly skilled with video cameras and the dissemination of propaganda, they have created the image for Westerners that the Syrian military and its Russian allies simply want to kill as many children as possible. 
Indeed, most Western coverage of the battle for Aleppo whites out the role of Al Qaeda almost completely although occasionally the reality slips through in on-the-ground reporting , along with the admission that Al Qaeda and its fellow fighters are keeping as many civilians in east Aleppo as possible, all the better to put up heartrending videos and photos on social media. 
Of course, when a similar situation exists in Islamic State-held Mosul, Iraq, the mainstream Western media dutifully denounces the tactic of keeping children in a war zone as the cynical use of “human shields,” thus justifying Iraqi and U.S. forces killing lots of civilians during their “liberation.” The deaths are all the enemy’s fault. 
However, when the shoe is on the Syrian/Russian foot, we’re talking about “war crimes” and the need to invade Syria to establish “safe zones” and “no-fly zones” even if that means killing large numbers of additional Syrians and shooting down Russian warplanes. 
After all, isn’t the protection of Al Qaeda terrorists worth the risk of starting World War III with nuclear-armed Russia? And if Al Qaeda isn’t worth fighting a nuclear war to defend, what about the thieves in Ukraine and their neo-Nazi shock troops? Calling Dr. Strangelove.

8135,"Who Hates Free Trade Treaties? Surprisingly, Not Voters - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   Few issues in this campaign cycle seem as toxic as trade: Both   presidential candidates oppose President Obama’s     Partnership, and congressional leaders, having refused all year to vote on the trade accord until after the election, say they will not do so even then  —   potentially killing the largest regional trade pact in history. So that must mean voters are overwhelmingly opposed, right? Wrong. National polls continue to show that Americans either narrowly favor international trade generally, and the   T. P. P. specifically, or are split. Younger voters are especially favorable. But Republicans are not, reflecting the influence of the   nominee Donald J. Trump on his traditionally   party. And certainly trade remains more unpopular in battleground states like Ohio, where it is blamed for years of manufacturing job losses. Yet the level of support for trade agreements in general, and the pending Pacific pact in particular, stands in notable contrast to the toxicity of trade in an election season largely defined by anger among   voters. What matters to many politicians, however, is the fact that the opponents are the ones most motivated to vote based on the issue  —   just as they are on issues like immigration and gun restrictions that also have more support than divisive debates suggest. “There really is a lot of ambivalence on the part of the public” toward expanded foreign trade, said Jay Campbell, a senior vice president with the polling firm Hart Research, who is not working for a presidential campaign. “At a very basic level they know it’s a necessary thing for the United States to trade with other countries  —   that is clear as a bell throughout all the polling,” Mr. Campbell said. But when asked about trade’s impact on jobs, “people are more inclined to think it’s more of a negative than a positive. ” A survey last month by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center found that Americans by 50 to 42 percent said trade agreements had been “a good thing” for the United States. By a narrower 40 to 35 percent, they said the same of the Pacific pact, which would phase out tariffs and set commercial rules between the United States and nations from Canada and Japan to Australia, Vietnam and Chile. Mr. Trump has had a measurable negative impact, the research center said. In a Pew poll a month before Mr. Trump announced his candidacy in June 2015, Republicans, by 51 to 39 percent, said trade accords had been good for the nation. By last month, after Mr. Trump was nominated, Republicans, by 61 to 32 percent, called past agreements a bad thing, a flip that has not been lost on Congress’s Republican leaders. Democrats’ views are little changed. Among registered voters surveyed by Pew, 55 percent of supporters of Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, said the Pacific pact would be a good thing (58 percent of Trump supporters said the opposite). And while Mrs. Clinton, under pressure from her   pact Democratic primary rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, came out in opposition to the T. P. P. in October, a Pew survey in March found that even 55 percent of Sanders supporters said trade agreements had been good for the country. The pollster for the liberal group Public Citizen, which is among the most active opponents of trade agreements, recently found that the public comes to the debate over T. P. P. from a position “bordering on neutrality,” with Republicans very negative and Democrats more positive. A plurality of all Americans favored past agreements, it said. “The public rates past trade agreements more positively than not, though many are unsure and few hold strong opinions,” said a memo on the poll by Democracy Corps, a liberal nonprofit founded by the Democratic strategists Stanley Greenberg and James Carville. As for the T. P. P. specifically, 56 percent of voters were either unfamiliar with it or neutral, the group said. To build opposition, Democracy Corps recommended that opponents link the agreement to the influence over government by corporations and “big money. ” Perhaps the most counterintuitive finding, given that both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump oppose the T. P. P. was in a July Washington   News poll. Asked if they wanted the next president to be someone who supports trade agreements or opposes them, 75 percent of respondents said they wanted a supporter and 17 percent favored an opponent. A Gallup poll early this year found that 58 percent of Americans viewed trade as an economic opportunity, 34 percent as a threat. Similarly, in a July poll for NBC News, 55 percent of registered voters agreed with a statement that trade was good “because it opens up new markets and we cannot avoid the fact that it is a global economy,” while 38 percent agreed that trade was bad “because it has hurt manufacturing and other key industries. ” Among the groups most supportive of trade are younger and highly educated voters. The Pew survey, for example, found that people with a high school education or less said that trade agreements had hurt their family’s finances  —   by a ratio of nearly two to one. That survey and a poll in June by the Associated   Center and Black Youth Project found that about   of voters under 30 said that trade agreements had helped them and their families. But strategists in both parties say those who are more supportive of trade are less likely to vote on that issue than are the opponents. “I can guarantee you that the intensity and energy on the issue is all on the   side,” said Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster and founding partner of the firm Public Opinion Strategies. “It’s a motivating issue, and one that hits home to Americans who are still struggling to make it back from the recession. ” He added: “Those who support free trade are more ‘lukewarm.’ For them it’s not a voting issue. ” Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster and strategist for Priorities USA Action, a super PAC supporting Mrs. Clinton, echoed Mr. Newhouse. “The people who are opposed to trade agreements feel more passionately about it than the people who are supportive of them,” he said. Alluding to Mr. Obama’s arguments that approving the T. P. P. is crucial for American influence in the   region, Mr. Garin added: “Most people don’t really live in the world of geopolitics, and don’t think very much about China’s influence in the Pacific relative to our influence in the Pacific. But they do think about jobs and wages and whether corporations can be trusted to use these trade agreements for the greater benefit of the American people. ” Presidents do worry about geopolitics, and that alone could keep the Pacific deal alive. On Friday, after Mr. Obama met with business leaders and elected officials to coordinate their uphill campaign for the accord, the mayor of Atlanta, Kasim Reed, told reporters, “People who run for office often campaign against trade, but people who become president of the United States end up supporting trade. ”",0
8136,"Muhammad Ali Jr., Detained Last Month at Airport, Stopped Again - The New York Times","One day after Muhammad Ali Jr. spoke with members of Congress about being detained at a Florida airport last month, he was briefly stopped again before boarding a flight on Friday afternoon, his lawyer said. When Mr. Ali, whose father died last year, arrived at Reagan National Airport in Washington on Friday for a flight to Fort Lauderdale, Fla. he gave his Illinois identification card to a JetBlue agent to get his boarding pass, said his lawyer, Chris Mancini, who was traveling with him and witnessed the episode. Almost immediately, Mr. Ali was told that there was a problem and that the agent needed to call the Department of Homeland Security, Mr. Mancini said. Mr. Ali, 44, was asked his date of birth, where he was born and his Social Security number, Mr. Mancini said. After answering the questions, he was told that his   identification card, which expires in 2019 but is not a driver’s license, was invalid for flying. “The same state ID from Illinois that he traveled to Washington on was rejected,” Mr. Mancini said in an interview on Friday night. Mr. Ali then produced his United States passport, which was accepted, and went through security and boarded the flight with his mother, Khalilah   the second wife of Muhammad Ali, and Mr. Mancini. Mr. Mancini said that the episode lasted between 20 and 25 minutes. “This whole thing smacks of some sort of retaliation for his testimony,” he said. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Democrat of Florida, was on the same flight, and posted about the episode on Twitter, saying that Mr. Ali had been “detained again. ” In a statement, the Transportation Security Administration disputed that the holdup at the ticket counter lasted long and said that Mr. Ali’s jewelry caused a   delay at the security checkpoint. The agency said that it did not have the authority to detain passengers. “Upon arriving at the airline   counter, a call was made to confirm Mr. Ali’s identity with T. S. A. officials,” the agency said. “When Mr. Ali arrived at the checkpoint, his large jewelry alarmed the checkpoint scanner. He received a targeted   in the area of his jewelry to clear the alarm and was cleared to catch his flight. ” An agency spokesman did not immediately respond to a question about what prompted the additional scrutiny of Mr. Ali’s identification. Mr. Mancini said he was baffled by the agency’s statement because Mr. Ali did not complain about his treatment at security, only at  . Mr. Mancini said he was helping Ms.   through the checkpoint and did not notice that Mr. Ali had been stopped for additional scrutiny. “They are making up stories,” he said. “We have never said anything about anything happening after he left the ticket counter. ” He said he planned to file a complaint with the Department of Homeland Security and was “working toward a lawsuit. ” “People need to start paying attention to what’s happening in our country,” he said. “Our rights are being eroded. ” The dispute between Mr. Ali and the Homeland Security Department, which oversees the T. S. A. follows an episode on Feb. 7 in which he and his mother were stopped for about an hour and a half at Fort   International Airport after returning from Jamaica. Mr. Mancini said then that Customs and Border Protection officials had asked Mr. Ali, “Where did you get your name from?” and, “Are you Muslim?” Mr. Ali and his mother recounted their ordeal at a forum with House Democrats on Thursday and both spoke out against President Trump’s new travel restrictions. “I believe they were religiously and racially profiling me,” Mr. Ali said of the officials, according to reports. When they arrived at the airport on Friday, Mr. Mancini said, he and Mr. Ali joked about whether they would face additional scrutiny because of his comments.",0
8137,Making sense of the Russian naval task force off the coast of Syria,"VINEYARD OF THE SAKER T he AngloZionst Empire’s propaganda machine, otherwise known as the corporate media, has had great difficulties deciding what it should say about the Russian naval task force which has been sent to Syria. The Americans have decided to express their usual contempt for anything Russian and describe this force as centered on the “geriatric” aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov, while the Brits chose to describe it as a formidable “armada” about to completely obliterate the moderate terrorists in Syria. Illustration above: The Nuclear Battle-Cruiser Peter The Great My friend Alexander Mercouris has recently written a superb analysis explaining that, in reality, this task force was neither geriatric nor that formidable. Rather than repeating it all here, I prefer to write what I will consider a follow-up to this excellent piece with a few more details added to it. The first step will be to debunk a few fundamental misconceptions. Let’s begin by the Russian aircraft carrier. The “Heavy Aircraft-Carrying Cruiser Admiral of the Soviet Fleet Kuznetsov” Did you know that the Russian don’t even call the Admiral Kuznetsov an aircraft carrier. The official designation of the Kuznetsov is “Heavy Aircraft-Carrying Cruiser”. It is important to understand why. What is, in your opinion, an aircraft carrier? Or, let me put it this way, why does the United States maintain a force of 10-12 heavy aircraft carriers? If you believe Ronald Reagan, it is to “forward deploy” and bring the war to the Soviets (that was, then, the rationale for a 600 ship navy and US carriers in the northern Atlantic). Nothing could be further from the truth. The reality is that US, British, French aircraft carriers are a colonial rule enforcement tool . You park one or two aircraft carrier battle groups a few hundred miles from a disobedient country, and you bomb the shit out of it until it rolls over. That is, in reality, the only rationale for these immense structures. And the beauty of it is that you can threaten most of the planet and that you do not depend on allies agreeing to your mission. So, we can say that US and other western aircraft carriers are a long range power projection capability to be used against weak and poorly defended countries. Why weak and poorly defended only? Here is the ugly secret that everybody knows: aircraft carriers cannot be defended against a sophisticated enemy. Had the Cold War turned hot, the Soviets would have simultaneously attacked any US carrier in the north Atlantic with a combo of Air launched cruise missiles Surface ship launched cruise missiles Submarine launcher torpedoes I cannot prove the following, but I can just testify that I had plenty of friends in the US military, including some who served on US aircraft carriers, and they all understood that US carriers would never survive a Soviet saturation attack and that in case of a real war they would have been kept away from the Soviet shores. I will only add here that the Chinese apparently have developed specialized ballistic missiles designed to destroy carrier battle groups. That was then, in the early 1990s. Nowadays even countries like Iran are beginning to develop capabilities to engage and successfully destroy US carriers. The Soviets never built any real aircraft carriers. What they had were *cruisers* with a very limited amount of vertically launched aircraft and, of course, helicopters. These cruisers had two main purposes: to extend the reach of the Soviet air defenses and to support a landing of a force from the sea. One very special feature of these aircraft carrying Soviet cruisers is that they had very large (4,5-7 tons) cruise missiles designed to strike at a high-value enemy ships, including US aircraft carriers. You can read up on the “Kiev-class” aircraft carrying cruiser here . Another key characteristic of these Soviet aircraft-carrying cruisers is that they carried a rather lame aircraft, the Yak-38 which was plagued by problems and would have been a very easy target for US F-14. F-15, F-16 or F-18. For that reason, the Kiev-class air-defenses were centered on its surface-to-air missiles and not on its complement of aircraft. By the time the Kuznetsov was built, the Soviets had developed aircraft which were at least equal, if not superior, to their western counterparts: the MiG-29 and, especially, the SU-27. And that gave some of them the idea to build a “real” aircraft carrier. T he decision to built the Kuznetsov was an extremely controversial one which faced a lot of opposition. The Kuznetsov’s “selling points” were that she was a much superior air defense platform, that she could carry vastly superior aircraft and, last but not least, that she could compete for prestige with the US heavy aircraft carriers, especially the planned but never built nuclear-powered follow-on generation. I find that argument wholly unconvincing and nowadays I am pretty confident that most Russian naval force planners would agree with me: Russia does not need US-style aircraft carriers and if she needs any aircraft carriers at all, then they would have to be designed around a *Russian* mission requirement and not just to copy the Americans. [Sidebar: I would love to get on my favorite soapbox and tell you all the bad things I think about aircraft carriers in general and why I think that the Russian Navy should be submarine and frigate centered, but this would take up too much space. I will just say that I much rather have many frigates or corvettes than a few heavy cruisers]. So the Kuznetsov ended up being a mega-compromise and, as compromises go, a pretty good one. Think of it: even though the Kuznetsov packs 12 massive Granit anti-ship missiles, it has, at least potentially, a complement of aircraft bigger than the French Charles de Gaulle (50 vs 40). Initially, the Kuznetsov carried 12 pure air to air SU-33, but now these will be gradually replaced with 20 much more modern MiG-29K and its 24 Ka-27 helicopters will be replaced by the most advanced reconnaissance and attack helicopter on the planet, the Ka-52K . The Kuznetsov still has two major weaknesses: a frankly dated propulsion system (see the Mercouris article) and a lack of on-board AWACs aircraft. The latter is a direct consequence of the design philosophy of the Kuznetsov which was never designed to operate much beyond 500-1000 km from the Russian border (again, the crucial roughly under 1000 km Russian force planning philosophy ). To sum this all up: the Kuznetsov is a fine aircraft carrier which nevertheless reflects a compromise design philosophy and which was never intended to project Russian power at long distances the way western, especially US, carriers have . Now let’s turn to the rest of this Russian naval task force The rest of the Russian naval task force around the Kuznetsov One big name immediately stands out: the Heavy Nuclear Rocket Cruiser Peter the Great. The nuclear battle-cruiser Peter the Great This is one heavy beast and currently the most heavily armed ship on the planet. I won’t even go into all the details here, check this article for a list of armaments if you are interested, suffice to say here that this battlecruiser can do everything: anti-air, anti-ship, anti-submarine. She is packed with top of the line sensors and advanced communications. Being the flagship of the Northern Fleet she is also the de-facto flagship of the entire Russian Navy. Last, but not least, the Peter the Great carries a formidable array of 20 Granit anti-ship missile. Please note that the combined firepower of Granit anti-ship missiles of the Kuznetsov and Peter the Great is 12+20 for a total of 32. I will explain why this is important below. The rest of the task force is composed of two Large Antisubmarine Ships (destroyers in western terminology), the Vice-Admiral Kulakov and the Severomorsk, and a number of support vessels. The Kulakov and the Severomorsk are based on the Udaloy design and are modern and all-around capable combat ships. All these ships will soon merge into one force, including two small missile ships (corvettes in western terminology) which carry the famous Kalibr cruise missiles and which specialize in attacking surface ships. Finally, though this will not be advertised, I believe that this task force will include at least two Akula-class nuclear attack submarines, one Oscar-II cruise missile submarine (armed with another 12 Granit cruise missiles) and several Kilo-class diesel-electric submarines. To sum this all up. The Russian naval task force is a Russian attempt to bring together a number of ships which were never designed to operate as a single naval task force far away from Russia. If you want, it is a clever Russian “hack” . I would argue that it is also a rather successful one as this task force as a whole is a very impressive one. No, it cannot take on all of NATO or even the USN, but there are a number of things which it can do very effectively. Now we can turn to the big question, What can the Russian naval task force in Syria really do? The 7 ton Granit P-700 (3M45) Before looking at the bigger picture, there is one detail which I think deserves to be mentioned here. Just about every article I read about the Granit cruise missile says that it is an anti-ship cruise missile. I also wrote that above in order to keep things simple. But now I have to say that the Granit probably always had a “B” mode, “B” as in “beregovoy” or, if you prefer, “coastal” or “land” mode. I don’t know whether this mode existed from day 1 or whether it was added later, but it is now certain that the Granit has had such a mode. It was probably a fairly minimalistic capability, without fancy guidance and other tricks (which the Granit has in its main anti-ship mode), but the Russians have recently revealed that the upgraded Granits now have a *real* (“complex”) land attack capability. And that requires a totally new look at what that means for this task force. This is what we know about the new and improved Granit (which the Russians refer to as 3M45): Mass: 7 tons Range: 500-600km Warhead: 750kg (conventional and nuclear capable) The Granit is also capable of some very advanced things, including having one missile flying at 500m or higher to detect the target and the rest of them skimming the surface while receiving the data from the high-flying one. These missiles are also capable of automatically attacking from different directions to better overwhelm air defenses. They can fly as low as 25m and as high as 17’000m. What this all means is that these Granits missiles are very capable tactical-operational range missiles of their own right . And considering that there are at the very least 32 such missiles in the Russian task force (46 if a Oscar-II class sub is also present), that means that this task force has a tactical missile firepower similar to an entire rocket brigade! Should things go very wrong, this task force could not only seriously threaten any USN/NATO surface ship within 500km of Syria, but also every single city or military base in this range . I am rather surprised that the western fear-mongers missed this one because it ought to scare NATO pretty badly :-) To be honest here, some specialists are expressing big doubts about the land-attack capabilities of the Granit. Everybody knows that these are relatively old and very expensive missiles, but nobody knows how much effort was really put in their modernization. But even if they are not nearly as capable as advertised, the fact that 32 to 46 of such missiles will be sitting just off the Syrian coast will be a formidable deterrent because nobody will never know what these missiles can do until they really do it. Next: T he combined capabilities of the Russian naval task force and the S-300/S-400 missiles deployed in Syria give the Russians a world-class air-defense capability. If needed the Russians could even throw in A-50 AWACs from Russia protected by MiG-31BMs. What most observers do not realize is that SA-N-6 “Grumble” which forms the core of the air defenses of the Peter the Great is a S-300FM, the modernized naval variant of the S-300 . It is also capable of the amazing Mach 6 speed, has a 150km range, an added infrared terminal capability, a track-via-missile guidance system which allows it to engage ballistic missiles and an altitude envelope of 27’000m. And, guess what – the Peter the Great has 48 such missiles (in 20 launchers), roughly the equivalent of 12 S-300 batteries (assuming 4 launchers per battery). One of the major weaknesses of the Russian deployment in Syria has been the relative low number of missiles the Russians could fire at any one time. The US/NATO could simply saturate Russian defenses with large numbers of missiles. Frankly, they can still do it, but this has now become much, much harder. Can the Russians now stop a US attack on Syria? Probably not. But they can make it much harder and dramatically less effective. First, as soon as the Americans fire, the Russians will see it and they will warn the Syrian and Russian armed forces. Since the Russians will be able to track every US missile, they will be able to pass on the data to all the air defense crews who will be ready by the time the missiles arrive. Furthermore, once the missiles get close, the Russians will be able to shoot down a lot of them, making necessary for the Americans to conduct battle damage assessment from space and then re-strike the same targets many times over. Second, stealth or no stealth, I don’t believe that the USN or the USAF will risk flying into Russian controlled airspace or, if it does, this will be a short-lived experiment. I believe that the Russian presence in Syria will make any attack on Syria a “missile only” attack. Unless the Americans take down the Russian air defenses, which they could only if they want to start WWIII, US aircraft will have to stay outside the Syrian skies. And that means that the Russians have basically made their own no-fly zone over Syria and that a US no-fly zone is now impossible to achieve . Next, the Kuznetsov will be brining a number of fixed and rotary wing aircraft including 15-20 Ka-27 and Ka-52K helicopters, and 15-20 SU-33K and MiG-29K (I don’t think there has been an official figure announced). What the Russians have said is that the fixed-wing aircraft will be upgraded to be able to attack ground targets. Will all that make a difference? Maybe, on the margins. It will definitely help dealing with the expected influx of moderate terrorists coming from Mosul (courtesy of the US operation to flush them down into Syria), but the Russians could have simply moved more SU-25 or even SU-34 to Khmeimin or Iran at a much smaller cost. Thus in terms of its air-wing, I fully agree with Mercouris – this will be mainly a real-life training opportunity and not a game changer. Conclusion T his deployment is highly uncharacteristic of what the Russians have been training for. They have basically found a way to reinforce the Russian contingent in Syria, especially against Hillary’s “no fly zone” nightmare. However, this is also a case of making virtue out of necessity: the operation in Syria was always too far from the Russian border and the Russian force in Syria always too small for its task. Furthermore, this deployment is not sustainable in the long term, and the Russians know it. They have successfully imposed a “Yankee no fly zone” over Syria long enough for the Syrian to take Aleppo and for the Americans to vote for their next President. After that, the situation will either get dramatically better (Trump) or dramatically worse (Hillary). Either way, the new situation will require a completely different Russian strategy. —The Saker PS: I am aware of the semi-official Russian announced plans to build a modern aircraft carrier, probably a nuclear one, with catapults and all. For whatever it’s worth, I am very much opposed to this idea which I find wasteful and which does not fit the Russian defense doctrine. The new generation of Russian subs (SSNs and SLBMs), however, gets my standing ovation.

8138,Cospedal se estrena en Defensa ordenando un ataque en diferido y en forma de simulación,"Cospedal se estrena en Defensa ordenando un ataque en diferido y en forma de simulación SE TRATA DE UNA OPERACIÓN EN PARTES DE LO QUE ANTES ERA UNA OFENSIVA Ministerio de Defensa 
La nueva ministra de Defensa, María Dolores de Cospedal, acompañada por el jefe del Estado Mayor de la Defensa (JEMAD) y el comandante del Mando de Operaciones (CMOPS), ha tomado hoy su primera decisión al frente del ministerio ordenando un ataque “en diferido y en forma de simulación, simulación de lo que hubiera sido en diferido en partes de lo que antes era una maniobra”. 
Cospedal se ha dirigido a las tropas en la base de Retamares, en el municipio madrileño de Pozuelo de Alarcón, para explicar los detalles de la operación contra “ese señor”. 
“Se hará una operación en diferido de una maniobra en forma de ofensiva contra esa persona, organizando el ataque simulado también dándole la forma, en su parte, de operación retribuida”, ha detallado a los soldados. 
Ante el silencio sepulcral de las tropas, que han evidenciado problemas para entender las instrucciones de la ministra, Cospedal ha añadido que “hoy hay personas que pueden discutir si es más o menos oportuno, si militarmente está mejor o peor llevado… o mejor o peor hecho. Pero así ha sido como se ha pactado. Hay que hacerlo como hay que hacerlo”. 
Tras dos horas pasando revista, la titular de Defensa ha abandonado la base militar y los soldados han vuelto a sus quehaceres habituales.",0
8139,NY Times: Being a Sanctuary City ’Not Enough’,"In a New York Times   piece, “sanctuary” cities are called out for not doing “enough” to protect illegal aliens. [The piece, written by Shakeer Rahman and Robin Steinberg, slams New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio for not going far enough when it comes to obstructing federal immigration officers from deporting illegal aliens:  The abruptness of the raids provoked criticism from local officials, including Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, who vowed to stand with immigrant communities. But mass deportation under President Trump will also happen through a more routine policy that is in the mayor’s control: endless, unnecessary arrests for   offenses, which end up feeding immigrants into the federal government’s deportation machine. It’s not enough for cities like New York to declare themselves “sanctuaries,” which simply means that the local police won’t detain noncitizens on the federal government’s behalf. If cities really want to protect immigrants, they must also end the   style of policing that makes immigrants the victims of unnecessary arrests and disproportionate punishment. Many of these unnecessary arrests stem from the discredited idea that a draconian crackdown on the most minor offenses  —   littering, selling loose cigarettes, biking on the sidewalk  —   will prevent more serious crimes. This model of policing, known as broken windows or zero tolerance, helped to drive mass incarceration. Its next cost could be mass deportation. The   then decries the idea that illegal aliens can be deported for “minor offenses like simple marijuana possession” or any “crime involving moral turpitude,” despite that policy seeming to have not changed at least over the last decade. ICE agents were also attacked in the   with Rahman and Steinberg writing, “Even if cities stop sharing arrest information, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been known to send plainclothes agents to local courts, where they wait for immigrants to appear for misdemeanor charges. ” The   goes on to say that Trump’s deportation effort of illegal immigrants, specifically those who have committed crimes, “can’t happen without boots on the ground,” though ICE has long used agents to investigate, arrest and deport criminals. “Until cities reject the failed thinking that led to mass incarceration, local police and prosecutors will be doing the legwork for mass deportation,” the   concludes.

8140,The Only Coup Is a Stolen Election,"Previous The Only Coup Is a Stolen Election 
Wars and rumor of wars. There is no coup. What you are watching is a media distraction. The MSM is actually covering Hillary’s criminality for the very first time. Are you naive enough to believe the media has had a change of heart? Look at the timing. Most of the early balloting is done. The George Soros’ voting machines have been placed into 16 key states. Dead people have already early-voted. But the media would have you believe that Hillary cannot win. When the fake polls at ABC show Trump is now leading, you have to question your common sense if you think you are not being played. And getting the people to believe that Hillary cannot win because of the late exposure of her criminality, will keep the people from working hard to prevent it. 
How can America be so stupid as to believe that the main stream media has had a change of heart? Chris Matthews endorsing Trump along with other main stream media outlets? Really? Was Santa Claus standing in the background laughing? 
The criminal elite and their media pawns have spent the entire election campaign vilifying Trump and now we are to believe that they have found Jesus and are suddenly supporting Trump? For you farm boys, this is called playing possum. 
If you don’t want to live under the biggest criminal to ever run for President, you must block out the media and their minions because if you don’t and Hillary steals this election, I will be saying I told you so. The only way Trump wins the election, is if the people vote in overwhelming numbers for him and no amount of election fraud can overcome a super majority. For the record, voting machine fraud is designed to flip a percentage of the vote. An overwhelming victory cannot be negated without it being painfully obvious to everyone. So, don’t get lulled into complacency. Keep working for Trump!!!! 
Believe who you want America, but in 5 days, if you lose your focus in supporting Trump and start assuming a victory, you are going to hand the election to Soros and Clinton.

8141,When a Couch Is More Than a Couch - The New York Times,"Were I healthy enough these days, I would be sipping a glass of free wine and running my hands over an exquisite accent pillow in an impossibly hip showroom called something like Space or Lust, while a sales assistant speaks to me of the virtues of aniline versus   leather. “So you really think   hardwood is worth the extra expense?” I’d be asking. And, “Does this come in a  ?” Instead, I’m propped in bed on a dozen pillows with my laptop, perusing online furniture stores: West Elm, Joybird, Crate  Barrel and something called Chairish. I am an internet   fiend. I take breaks only when the oxy overwhelms me and my head starts to loll. I cannot rest until I have considered every        sofa the worldwide web has to offer. I pore over design sites like Apartment Therapy, Design Sponge and Domino: searching, searching. Since John and I married 16 years ago, we have never had a real   couch. We’ve had plenty of   misfits: “as is” Ikea specials, parental handoffs, Craigslist   roadside rescues. First we were broke, and then we had babies. It never seemed like the right time to splurge on anything nice. And the misfits have been fine. We’re not fancy, and our taste is eclectic. Our house is full of objects that are stronger on personality than looks: the wood box my father and uncles sat on as children to lace their boots for sledding, a lumpy chaise by the front window in the world’s coziest reading nook. Anyway, whenever we have needed to get down to the serious business of life, we have always preferred to retreat to our bed: our war room, cocoon, escape hatch and, at times, dining room. But in the weeks after I learned that the breast cancer I have been in treatment for over the past year had spread to my bones  —   breaking my spine and becoming incurable and most likely fatal  —   finding the perfect   couch has begun to feel like the most important thing I’ve ever done. Except, just when I find one I love, it turns out I can’t click “buy now. ” And commitment issues have not generally been my problem. Houses, cars,            mastectomy: Bring it. Usually I just pick a   option and don’t look back. Within 10 minutes of meeting John at a summer job at 21, I had already mentally signed on for life  —   although I waited at least a week to tell him that. But the couch. I can’t do it. Maybe I’m holding off until after my next big oncology appointment, as though something my doctor may say will help determine whether I am willing to spend the extra money for Dacron batting and   cushions. She promised some new thoughts about treatment options: immunotherapy, clinical trials,   drugs, acupuncture, the dreaded “watchful waiting. ” It’s a complicated calculus. On the one hand, a basic   analysis: How much money do I want to spend on something I may not be around to really enjoy? On the other: Isn’t buying an expensive couch a kind of lovely expression of hopefulness? And after I’m gone, don’t I still want guests in my home to feel comfortable and stylish? None of this was supposed to happen. At 38, I wasn’t supposed to lie on my back in the E. R. on a late December morning and be told by a teary radiation oncology resident that the pain I’d been having for two months  —   that I’d been assured was from having a weak core after months of chemo  —   was actually from a tumor that had devoured my L2 vertebra. John wasn’t supposed to have to hold me up on the toilet. Put my pants on for me. Do Christmas Eve for the children without me. I’m not supposed to be thinking about where he will sit and hold my hand as I take my last breath. Despite all the pamphlets the social workers gave us when I was in the hospital, we don’t really know how to talk to our boys yet. They are 6 and 9. They know about the cancer and the back break, but they don’t really know what it all means. Instead I ask the    “What do you think of leather upholstery?” “Depends if it’s slippery or nuzzly,” he says. Excellent point. I think I need to take any bonded leather options  —   no matter how cute or economical they seem  —   off my favorites lists and go with  . The day after the emergency surgery, when my doctor was sitting on the end of my bed in the oncology ward, I saw her glance toward those pamphlets that had been left on the bedside table: “What to Tell Your Children About Your Progressive Disease. ” She’s a mother, too. Her children are only a couple of years older than mine. “Is it time to despair?” she said during a pause in our discussion about pain management and radiation, maybe reading one of the pamphlet headings. “No!” she proclaimed, staring straight at me. “No, it is not. ” I trust her completely, even after the chemo failed twice and the cancer spread when she said it wouldn’t. Whatever it is in oncologists that makes them want to be oncologists  —   that crazy mix of fierceness, optimism, arrogance and compassion  —   I get a contact high from it. It’s like love at first sight, or touching something on fire. It’s like making a choice and refusing to look back. John is mildly   averse, but he’s treading carefully. He knows me well enough to understand that when I’m dissertating on the merits of tufted cushions, I’m chewing on something else. “Custom upholstery, really? With two boys?” he asks, flipping through insurance statements on the counter. “O. K. well, I think you should get whatever you’re into. ” One big upside of being told I have incurable cancer is that after all these years, my husband has finally stopped smugly saying, “It’s your funeral,” when I make a decision he doesn’t agree with. “Did you spend thousands of dollars on the internet today?” he asks when he gets home from work and finds me with my pillows and   bottles on the   couch where he left me in the morning, a   rattan situation my parents bought as patio furniture in the early ’90s. “Not today,” I say. “Nice,” he says. “Do you want to go get in bed together and stare at the ceiling?” I do. We do. In January, the afternoon already looks like evening. “Can you believe we found out you have incurable cancer on, literally, the darkest day of the year?” John asks as we hold hands and stare up toward the same blank spot above our bed. “Yeah, I totally can,” I say. We both laugh. I have always loved the sound of him laughing: soft and comfortable, understated, offbeat, with unmistakably sleek midcentury lines. He takes me gingerly in his arms as if we are awkward teenagers. My back spasms, but I wiggle closer to him until I can put my head on his chest and hear his heart beating. Downstairs, the boys gaze at a screen on the old futon in the playroom. We will figure out what to do about them soon enough. They probably already know what’s up and are waiting for us to figure out how to say it. Despite not being much of a Christmas person myself, I hated not being able to watch them open presents and can’t bear the thought of never doing it again. Their very existence is the one dark piece I cannot get right with in all this. I can let go of a lot of things: plans, friends, career goals, places in the world I want to see, maybe even the love of my life. But I cannot figure out how to let go of mothering them. So maybe I don’t try to figure it out. Maybe I just aim to get the couch right: strong bones,   leather, something earthy and animal and real. A surface that knows something of what it was to be alive, that warms to our touch and cools in our absence. Also: an expansive bench that fits all of us. Something that will hold us through everything that lies ahead  —   the loving, collapsing and nuzzling. The dying, the grieving. I know my thoughts have probably diverged from whatever John is thinking about in the near dark of our bedroom. He is silent. Maybe he is dozing. Buying a sofa online, like many of life’s biggest decisions, takes research and trust, but mostly trust. As I lie here, with John’s chest rising and falling under my cheek, I realize that my careful calculations (How long do I have left? Who am I really buying this couch for? Am I getting a good deal?) are irrelevant. As in all things, I have to believe I’ll know what’s right when I see it.",0
8142,Adventures in Upscale Brooklyn - The New York Times,"On a hot September day in Brooklyn, I got off the G train at Metropolitan Avenue and walked through Williamsburg, a neighborhood so thoroughly celebrated it has become something of a cliché. Though it is only one subway transfer from my Flatbush Avenue apartment, I hadn’t been to the neighborhood in years. Today, it has the same incongruous mix of old and new that defines gentrifying neighborhoods. I walked by    condos next to ornate Orthodox churches and modest postwar townhouses. The crowd included men in suits, fashionably unfashionable   neighborhood elders sitting on McCarren Park benches, and nannies pushing expensive strollers past industrial facades painted with colorful murals. Sleek restaurants had opened alongside bodegas, coffee shops and pharmacies  —     establishments that had somehow held on. Since I have lived the larger part of the last decade along the stretch of Flatbush Avenue south of Crown Heights known as Caribbean Flatbush, the version of Brooklyn that one finds in Williamsburg  —   the Brooklyn of national popular perception a sort of East Coast Portlandia, only richer  —   was largely foreign to me. Sure, I’d been to Smorgasburg, Brooklyn Flea’s roaming   food market, so I knew that $10 jars of pickles and “artisanal mayonnaise” were not entirely mythological. I have drunk more than my share of lambrusco at my favorite Fort Greene happy hour bar, Olea, and devoted many Sundays to multihour brunches with girlfriends among the cozy brownstones of Cobble Hill or Prospect Heights. But while I’m not oblivious to its charms and temptations, upscale Brooklyn  —   whether hip or tony  —   is not my Brooklyn. So, as a writer and parent of a young child, being tasked with exploring the borough’s cushier corners felt like a dream assignment. Who, after all, wouldn’t delight in getting the blessing of your employer to eat and drink and treat yourself to the best of your town? Over a weeklong period, I searched out a side of Brooklyn that scarcely existed two decades ago. I visited boutiques and bistros, spas and cocktail lounges,   cinemas and creative new waterfront parks. It was a quest that would not have been complete without at least one afternoon in Williamsburg. Across the   skyline I spotted my destination: the futuristic silver tower of the William Vale, which had opened just nine days before. Among the newest in a series of luxury hotels that have opened in recent years in the borough  —   including the nearby Wythe and the    1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge  —   the William Vale is ostentatious even by the standards of “new Brooklyn. ” Along with its standard $  $500 rooms, each of which features an   balcony, it offers a “garden residence,” a    duplex suite with an enormous patio and an outdoor Jacuzzi. Starting rate: $6, 000 a night. The William Vale rises from its   and   surroundings like an opulent monument surrounded by nondescript headstones. As I waited for the elevator in the lobby, which was splashed with abstract color, I made small talk with the host, a thin man in a handsome suit, his hair parted down the middle like a 1950s film villain. “You’re from the neighborhood?” he asked as he escorted me to the 22nd floor. No, farther south, I told him. Flatbush. He looked perplexed. He lived in Upper Manhattan, he said. “In 15 years, I’ve probably been to Brooklyn only a handful of times. ” Now he was commuting here. It felt like the revenge of the bridge and tunnel crowd. At Westlight, the hotel’s Andrew Carmellini bar, I fought back my fear of heights and headed for the outer deck, peering across the East River to the full expanse of Manhattan. Servers wore vaguely retro navy blue dresses, and a Jason Schwartzman   sported a wooden bow tie. While not going out of its way to defy stereotype, the place was welcoming  —   more casual, and less affected, than its showy,   setting would suggest. In a loftlike room lit by globe lights, I pulled up a stool at the   bar and ordered a $14 glass of Sonoma County sauvignon blanc, a fair price of admission for the dizzying views. Counterintuitively, perhaps, another stop I made in Brooklyn was Crown Heights, a neighborhood that was still closely associated with the 1991 riots when I arrived in the city in the  . Today, it exemplifies gentrification. Along Franklin Avenue, chic new restaurants, bars and boutiques open with such frequency that if even a few months pass between visits, I sometimes find myself disoriented. Was that slick sushi spot there before? When did this wine bar open? Within blocks of one another, there is Aita, a   Italian trattoria with pasta that is praised in superlatives an elegant Mexican restaurant with a   tile bar and a pressed copper roof (Chavela’s) and Glady’s. The last of these serves a similar menu to so many   jerk chicken   places except that it has a   Michael Jacober, who is a Per Se alum an evocative   dining room and potent dark and stormy slushies with a fierce kick of ginger. As if overnight, one Crown Heights street has more fine restaurants than some   cities. On a weekday afternoon, I met a girlfriend at Café Rue Dix, a   bistro on Bedford Avenue, where we were greeted with a warm, unironic “Welcome to Africa. ” We sat at a sidewalk table during a happy hour that draws regulars from the neighborhood for its signature cocktail, the Kale Hemingway (white rum, green juice, lime and maraschino, $9)   bread and     spring rolls. The warm, comfortably weathered space does, somehow, feel both distinctly Crown Heights and vaguely Parisian, though this last impression may have been the   cocktail talking. I ducked next door to Marché Rue Dix, a “cultural concept store” opened by Nilea Alexander, the   (with her Senegalese husband, Lamine Diagne) of Rue Dix. The shop had   flooring and sold chunky sunglasses and funky coats,   candles and stylish African imports. Like the nearby and newly opened Crabby Shack, a bright and airy urban seafood spot, Rue Dix’s twin businesses gave me hope that at least some of the spoils of Crown Heights’ transformation might benefit black business owners. Like the wave of gentrification that has washed from Williamsburg ever deeper into Brooklyn  —   north into what was once the Polish enclave of Greenpoint, east into Bushwick and south through    —   I Ubered from neighborhood to neighborhood. It was a luxury I normally afford myself only on the increasingly rare,   occasion of excess. But during my weeklong stint exploring upscale Brooklyn, I went out of my way to treat myself to such extravagances. I booked an afternoon “Urban Oasis”   massage for $135 at Fort Greene’s Cynergy Spa, where a long,   hallway led to a room with gilded mirrors and a white noise machine playing ambient water sounds. Despite its location at a busy   intersection, the place somehow managed to feel like a refuge. Afterward, I dipped into Karasu, the hidden,   bar behind the comfort food restaurant Walter’s, where a sophisticated,   room featured a wall of Japanese whiskeys. Charles Mingus played overhead while I sipped a Nettai, a   snow cone of rum, orgeat, mandarin and yuzu ($14) through a metal straw. I hadn’t felt so relaxed in months. Over the following days, I resisted impulse buys in   boutiques like Sincerely, Tommy and Peace  Riot drank rosé while watching vintage David Lynch at the cushy new Syndicated theater, in Bushwick, which has a full bar, a   “seasonal ingredient” food menu and   table service and with my husband, Tim, and toddler, Roxie, walked the length of Montague Street in Brooklyn Heights, an area that reminds me more of Boston than Brooklyn and which is home to Hillary Clinton’s campaign headquarters. Along the promenade, I couldn’t help but look up at the windows overlooking New York Harbor and wonder, what would it be like to wake up to that view? Or with the new Pier Six park, a model of postindustrial urban redesign, as your front yard? During my week of big spending, I was especially excited for a lavish date night dinner with my husband. But deciding where to go proved difficult. I waffled over whether to really go all out at the widely recommended Blanca, a   prix fixe restaurant behind Roberta’s in Bushwick. At $195 per person, not including drinks, tax and tip, it would have cost over $500. Twice, I made and canceled reservations. Finally, I decided. I just couldn’t do it. Instead, I booked a table at Olmsted for 10:30 p. m. on a Wednesday, an    York dinner hour and the only reservation I could get. When Tim and I arrived, the place  —   with a living wall, exposed bricks that had been painted white, and a backyard aglow with lights  —   was packed. Early Nineties Naughty by Nature (“O. P. P.? Yeah, you know me”) played as we were seated at a table beside the open kitchen, where a man with tweezers and comfortable sneakers carefully placed final touches on plates. The whole dining room smelled like the area around the Ebbets Field apartment complex, where the Golombeck spice factory infuses several city blocks with the scent of cumin and coriander, curry and paprika. It was a comparative bargain at $145 for two, including cocktails. Everything was beautiful, from the delicate porcelain water glasses,   and swirled like soft serve, to the bartender who wore long dreads and danced with the cocktail shaker as if it were a maraca. When the food arrived, one small plate at a time, it was beautiful, too. There was crawfish boil chicharrón in a newspaper cup, earthy chapati  —   small, flat disks served with cucumbers and labne  —   and a $12 rosemary cocktail of fire and acid. Amusing us both, Tim’s main was one giant slice of tomato. Having traveled from the Grand Army Plaza Greenmarket just up the street, it was served breaded and fried,  . How is it, I asked. “It’s like a grilled cheese,” Tim said. “It has that   …     ” he trailed off, transported to some cozy food memory. “I love putting tomatoes on my grilled cheese,” he said, as if struck by a revelation, an    boy excited about food for the first time. We both laughed. We laughed at the novelty of my week and the fundamental strangeness of being granted the opportunity to step into a life so different from my own.

8143,"Suburban Chicago School Teaches ’Blackenomics,’ ’Trans-Rights,’ and ’White Genocide Against Blacks’ - Breitbart","A suburban Chicago high school is taking the Obama education agenda all the way with new classes and seminars that teach kids that whites are committing “genocide” against blacks, that America is violating the “rights” of transgender Americans, that whites are suppressing the voting rights of blacks, and a long list of other   activist ideas. [New Trier Township High School is one of the Chicago area’s premier high schools in the tony suburb of Winnetka, a lake shore town north of Chicago. But, along with teaching math, science, English, and history, the school is launching into a major   indoctrination project based on Obama’s agenda of liberal activism.  An exposé of the agenda by the Illinois Family Institute shows that “progressivism” is coming fast and furious at New Trier’s kids. The list of classes and speakers for this new series is being called “a rather bold and raw effort at   propaganda with decidedly          and bigoted biases on display. ” Some of the titles of these seminars and workshops are “Whose Civil Rights?: Transpeople of Color Navigating the U. S.,” “21st Century Voter Supression,” “Blackenomics 101 (The Movement, The Music, The Solution),” “Mass Incarceration: Race and Prison in America,” and “R. E. A. L.: Race, Equity, and Leadership  —   A Unique Course for High School Students. ” Revisionist history is also a major topic of this agenda and will include programs titled, “A People’s History of Chicago” and “Western Bias in Science. ” Even the smallest children will be targeted for Obama’s   project with a program being called, “Developing Empathy  Acceptance by Reading Picture Books to Children. ” As part of the “Blackenomics 101” program, a special rap song has been written which includes the lyrics, “Blackenomics nigga, Black beat black, nigga” and “Die motherf*cker die. ” This agenda, though, is not something isolated to one Chicago school it is part and parcel to a huge program Barack Obama has forced onto schools all across the country. As F. H. Buckley, a professor at Scalia Law School, recently revealed in an   at The New York Post, these sort of extreme,   programs based on a virulently   agenda is part of Obama’s “New Civics” program imposed on schools that receive federal funding. “Making Citizens: How American Universities Teach Civics” shows how the Obama DOE has indoctrinated college students through progressive “New Civics” programs that seek to repurpose higher education away from the study of Western institutions, and even away from scholarship in general, in order to make little   community organizers of our students. The goal of the New Civics movement, concludes the NAS, is to teach students “that a good citizen is a radical activist,” putting “political activism at the center of everything that students do in college, including academic study,   pursuits, and   ventures. ” Instead of a civics education that studies the foundations of American government, New Civics teaches students “how to organize protests, occupy buildings, and stage demonstrations. ” Programs like those described above being forced on kids at New Trier are also being programmed into schools all across the nation from the earliest grade school classes to the halls of higher education.

8144,The Emerging Trump Doctrine: Don’t Follow Doctrine - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   As he confronted a series of international challenges from the Middle East to Asia last week, President Trump made certain that nothing was certain about his foreign policy. To the extent that a Trump Doctrine is emerging, it seems to be this: don’t get roped in by doctrine. In a week in which he hosted foreign heads of state and launched a cruise missile strike against Syria’s government, Mr. Trump dispensed with his own dogma and forced other world leaders to   their assumptions about how the United States will lead in this new era. He demonstrated a highly improvisational and situational approach that could inject a risky unpredictability into relations with potential antagonists, but he also opened the door to a more traditional American engagement with the world that eases allies’ fears. As a private citizen and candidate, Mr. Trump spent years arguing that Syria’s civil war was not America’s problem, that Russia should be a friend, and that China was an “enemy” whose leaders should not be invited to dinner. As president, Mr. Trump, in the space of just days, involved America more directly in the Syrian morass than ever before, opened a new acrimonious rift with Russia, and invited China’s leader for a largely convivial, let’   dinner at his Florida estate. In the process, Mr. Trump upended domestic politics as well. He rejected the nationalist wing of his own White House, led by Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, who opposes entanglement in Middle East conflicts beyond fighting terrorism and favors punitive trade measures against Beijing. And Mr. Trump, by launching the strike on Russia’s ally Syria, undercut critics who have portrayed him as a Manchurian candidate doing the bidding of President Vladimir V. Putin after the Kremlin intervened in last year’s election on his behalf. Given his unpredictability, none of this means that Mr. Trump has pivoted permanently in any of these areas. The White House has prepared an executive order that the president may sign in the coming days targeting countries like China that dump steel in the American market. And Mr. Trump is sending Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson on Tuesday to Moscow, where he will have the additional task of trying to smooth over the rancor of recent days, in addition to exploring whether Russia could be a real partner in battling the Islamic State in Syria. Moreover, the missile strike, in response to a chemical weapons attack, was intended to be a limited,   operation, and the president seemed determined to quickly move on. After announcing the attack Thursday evening, he made no mention of it Friday during public appearances, nor on Saturday during his weekly address. As of Saturday afternoon, the   president had not even taunted President Bashar   of Syria online, although he did thank the American troops who carried out the missile strike and defended the decision not to target the runway at the air base that was hit. “Our decisions,” Mr. Trump said in the Saturday address, “will be guided by our values and our goals  —   and we will reject the path of inflexible ideology that too often leads to unintended consequences. ” That concept, flexibility, seems key to understanding Mr. Trump. He hates to be boxed in, as he mused in the Rose Garden last week while contemplating the first new military operation of his presidency with geopolitical consequences. “I like to think of myself as a very flexible person,” he told reporters. “I don’t have to have one specific way. ” He made clear he cherished unpredictability. “I don’t like to say where I’m going and what I’m doing,” he said. That flexibility was a hallmark of his rise in real estate, and if critics preferred the word erratic, it did not bother Mr. Trump  —   it has since worked well enough to vault him to the White House. But now that he is commander in chief of the world’s most powerful nation, leaders around the world are trying to detect a method to the man. “There is no emerging doctrine for Trump foreign policy in a classical sense,” said Kathleen H. Hicks, a former Pentagon official who is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “There are, however, clear emerging characteristics consistent with the attributes of the man himself: unpredictable, instinctual and undisciplined. ” On Syria, Mr. Trump had mocked President Barack Obama for setting a “red line” against the use of chemical weapons and urged him not to launch a punitive strike against Syria after Mr. Assad crossed it in 2013. That attack, with a death toll of 1, 400, dwarfed last week’s toll of 84. And just days before last week’s attack, Mr. Tillerson indicated that Washington would accept Mr. Assad’s remaining in power. Indeed, critics, including Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, argued that Mr. Assad felt free to launch a chemical attack precisely because Mr. Trump’s administration had given him a green light. Russia, critics added, did not constrain Mr. Assad because it has had a blank check from an overly friendly Trump administration. And Mr. Trump’s efforts to bar Syrian refugees from the United States, they said, sent a signal that he did not care about them. “President Trump seems not to have thought through any of this, or have any kind of broader strategy, but rather to have launched a military strike based on a sudden, emotional decision,” Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, wrote in an article for The Huffington Post on Saturday. Mr. Assad is not the only leader testing Mr. Trump. North Korea has   missile after missile in recent weeks, almost as if trying to get Mr. Trump’s attention. So far, he has been measured in his response, urging President Xi Jinping of China during his visit to do more to rein in North Korea. But national security aides have also prepared options for Mr. Trump if China does not take a more assertive stance, including reintroducing nuclear weapons in South Korea. Mr. Trump’s action in Syria was welcomed by many traditional American allies who had fretted over Mr. Obama’s reluctance to take a greater leadership role in the Middle East, and feared that Mr. Trump would withdraw even more. After the missile strike, Israeli news outlets were filled with headlines like “The Americans Are Back,” and European leaders expressed relief both that he had taken action and that he had not gone too far. “We have learned that Trump is not so isolationist as many Europeans feared he would be  —   he appears to care about victims of a gas attack in Syria,” said Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform in London. “We have learned that he understands that U. S. influence had suffered from the perception  —   which grew under Obama  —   that it was a power weakened by its reluctance to use force. ” That touches on another animating factor as Mr. Trump deals with foreign challenges  —   doing the opposite of whatever Mr. Obama did. Mr. Trump’s first instinct after the Syrian chemical attack was to blame Mr. Obama for not enforcing his red line, never mind that Mr. Trump had urged him not to at the time. Even as he announced the missile strike on Thursday night, Mr. Trump asserted that his predecessor’s handling of Syria had “failed very dramatically. ” Intentionally or not, though, Mr. Trump adopted language similar to that used by Mr. Obama and many other presidents in defining American priorities. While in the past Mr. Trump said the United States did not have a national interest in Syria, last week he said instability there was “threatening the United States and its allies. ” He also said that “America stands for justice,” effectively espousing a responsibility to act in cases of human rights abuses, as other presidents have at times. Until now, Mr. Trump has largely eschewed such language. Just three days earlier, he had hosted Egypt’s authoritarian president, Abdel Fattah   and made no public mention of the thousands of people the Cairo government has imprisoned in a political crackdown. “What is striking to me is a subtle yet clear shift away from the rhetoric of pure American   narrowly defined, as espoused by candidate Donald Trump,” said Robert Danin, a former Middle East negotiator who is now at the Council on Foreign Relations. “What has emerged is a new language of American leadership in the world that we have not heard before from President Trump. ” Mr. Grant and others noted that the strike, coming as Mr. Trump shared a meal with Mr. Xi, could resonate in Asia as well, leaving North Korea to wonder whether the president might resort to force to stop its development of ballistic missiles. But Ms. Hicks said Mr. Trump’s flexibility  —   or unpredictability  —   was itself “extremely risky. ” If other countries cannot accurately predict what an American president will do, she said, they may act precipitously, citing the example of China’s extending its maritime claims in the South China Sea. “Imagine if Donald Trump then took exception in ways they didn’t anticipate and major wars ensued,” she said. “Bright lines, derived from clear interests and enforced well, are generally best, and I don’t think Donald Trump likes to be constrained by bright lines. ”",0

8146,Exxon Mobil Fraud Inquiry Said to Focus More on Future Than Past - The New York Times,"For more than a year, much of the public scrutiny of Exxon Mobil was captured by the #Exxonknew hashtag  —   shorthand for revelations about   research on climate change conducted by the company while it funded groups promoting doubt about climate science. Articles about that research have energized protests against Exxon Mobil and the fossil fuel industry and had a role in initiating queries by at least five attorneys general, led by Eric T. Schneiderman of New York. Early on, his office demanded extensive emails, financial records and other documents from the oil company, leaving many observers with the impression that a deeper look into the company’s past was the focus of the investigation. But in an extensive interview, Mr. Schneiderman said that his investigation was focused less on the distant past than on relatively recent statements by Exxon Mobil related to climate change and what it means for the company’s future. In other words, the question for Mr. Schneiderman is less what Exxon knew, and more what it predicts. For example, he said, the investigation is scrutinizing a 2014 report by Exxon Mobil stating that global efforts to address climate change would not mean that it had to leave enormous amounts of oil reserves in the ground as   “stranded assets. ” But many scientists have suggested that if the world were to burn even just a portion of the oil in the ground that the industry declares on its books, the planet would heat up to such dangerous levels that “there’s no one left to burn the rest,” Mr. Schneiderman said. By that logic, Exxon Mobil will have to leave much of its oil in the ground, which means the company’s valuation of its reserves is off by a significant amount. “If, collectively, the fossil fuel companies are overstating their assets by trillions of dollars, that’s a big deal,” Mr. Schneiderman said. And if the company’s own internal research shows that Exxon Mobil knows better, he added, “there may be massive securities fraud here. ” Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for Exxon, dismissed the idea that its forecast could be viewed as fraudulent. “If it turns out to be wrong, that’s not fraud, that’s wrong,” he said. “That’s why we adjust our outlook every year, and that’s why we issue the annual forecast publicly, so people can know the basis of our forecasting. ” The company has said allegations that it secretly developed a definitive understanding of climate change before the rest of the world’s scientists are “preposterous. ” Mr. Schneiderman has praised reports from publications, including Inside Climate News and the Los Angeles Times, that detailed Exxon Mobil’s past research. And all indications were that his office planned to use its subpoena powers to unearth new documents that might show a disconnect between what the company was saying publicly and what it was saying privately about climate change over several decades. In the interview, however, Mr. Schneiderman said his focus lay elsewhere. “The older stuff really is just important to establish knowledge and the framework and to look for inconsistencies. ” He called his efforts a straightforward fraud investigation, like many that he and his predecessors have taken on in subjects as   as the crash of   securities and Volkswagen’s diesel engine deceptions. Mr. Schneiderman also mentioned, as an example of questionable public statements by Exxon Mobil,  congressional testimony in 2010 by its chief executive, Rex Tillerson, who said that while the company acknowledged that humans were affecting the climate through greenhouse gas emissions to some degree, it was not yet clear “to what extent and therefore what can you do about it. ” Mr. Tillerson added, “There is not a model available today that is competent” for understanding the science and predicting the future. Mr. Schneiderman disagrees, and cited the industry’s own extensive climate research and the actions it has taken in response, including exploration in the melting Arctic and raising the decks of offshore oil platforms to compensate for rising sea level. “These guys have the best science for their engineering purposes,” he said. “We’re confident they’re not wasting shareholder dollars to do things that are inconsistent with the science they have internally. ” Since November, when the investigation was first revealed, and as other state attorneys general announced their support, Mr. Schneiderman’s intentions have been questioned and, he said, misconstrued. Supporters of Exxon Mobil have accused him and his colleagues of using prosecutorial powers to pursue political ends and of trying to squelch the First Amendment rights of the company, its scientists and anyone who agrees with them. Lamar Smith, a congressman from Texas and chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, accused the attorneys general of “pursuing a political agenda at the expense of scientists’ rights to free speech” and has issued subpoenas demanding internal documents from Mr. Schneiderman and another state attorney general, as well as eight groups that have supported the investigations. Hans von Spakovsky, a conservative commentator, compared the investigation by the attorneys general to the Spanish Inquisition, and the Daily Caller asked whether Mr. Schneiderman had suggested “jailing global warming skeptics. ” Mr. Schneiderman talks about such accusations with incredulity. “This is an investigation,” he said. “It is a civil fraud case. No one is being prosecuted  —   we’re not out to silence dissenting views. ” He has said, however, that if criminal actions turn up in the evidence the state gathers, criminal charges could be filed. When asked about the First Amendment implications of investigating Exxon’s statements, he repeated a sentence he has uttered many times: “The First Amendment doesn’t protect you for fraud. ” He added, “  monte operators can’t say, ‘Hey, I’m just exercising my First Amendment rights! ’” When asked about the focus of Mr. Schneiderman’s investigation, Joel Seligman, an expert in securities law who is the president of the University of Rochester, said that “at some level, this is a   investigation  —   and there is no guarantee it will lead to a case. ” Exxon Mobil has sued to block subpoenas from Massachusetts and the United States Virgin Islands, but the company has provided hundreds of thousands of pages of documents to New York. If the investigation does turn up the kind of evidence that could lead to a civil case, it is still unclear whether New York or the other states might win, said David M. Uhlmann, a former top federal prosecutor of environmental crime and a professor at the University of Michigan law school. Until governments impose the kind of regulations that will lead to concrete action to slow or reverse climate change, he said, “We’re going to continue to drill for oil and frack for gas. ’’ In that case, he continued, Exxon may “utilize a significant portion of its reserves, which means it may not even be wrong when it states that it expects to utilize its reserves. ” Even if Exxon is wrong in saying that it expects to be able to use all its reserves, “The question is whether they know that they are wrong and are therefore lying to investors,” he added. The investigation, Mr. Schneiderman said, mirrors an earlier inquiry into a coal giant, Peabody Energy. In 2013, he issued subpoenas for internal documents related to climate change, and found false statements to shareholders and the Securities and Exchange Commission. “Simple stuff like ‘it’s impossible to predict the effect of a carbon tax on the coal market,’ and they paid a consultant a lot of money to predict the effect of a carbon market,” he said. Peabody signed an agreement  pledging to properly disclose the climate risk to its business. Mr. Schneiderman has also been accused of conspiring with environmental groups, but he said, “People bring information to us all the time. If it’s got merit to it, we follow up on it. ” Groups like the Union of Concerned Scientists have investigated the fossil fuel industry for years, he said, and so “it would be malpractice for us not to meet with people like this. ” The industry’s tactics come “straight out of the tobacco playbook,” he said. “It’s delay, and sowing doubt. ” Mr. Schneiderman has refused to comply with the congressman’s subpoena, stressing the importance of federalism  —   normally an argument used by conservatives against federal overreach. When asked for comment, Kristina Baum, a spokeswoman for the Science committee, said that Mr. Smith was unavailable.",0
8147,Morrissey children’s album flops,"November 15, 2016 
Former Smiths frontman Morrissey says he is ‘currently contemplating the warm, welcoming embrace of early retirement’ after his album of songs for children ‘Hello Young Persons Everywhere’ failed to chart this weekend. The album, a long-standing ambition for the singer, contains a number of reworked children’s standards including ‘This Old Man, He Played One’ and ‘The Wheels on the Bus’ along with a selection of self-penned numbers including ‘Algebra is a Frightful Bore’ and ‘It is Inadvisable to Commence Your Sentences With a Gerund’. ‘It was my intention to offer today’s younger folk entertainment of an improving nature’ remarked the singer ‘as an alternative to the abominations that are the likes of Hannah Montana and Chuggington. It appears that the entertainment industry has pulled together along with the British Brainwashing Corporation to prevent such an endeavour from ever succeeding.’ Another organisation no longer supporting the singer is The Early Learning Centre who had planned a promotional tie-in with the album’s release. They withdrew support upon hearing the lead single ‘I Know an Old Woman Who Swallowed a Fly’: ‘I know an old woman, who swallowed a fly, And because of this careless old lady, This innocent fly will die Fly will die (x5) ‘I know an old woman, who swallowed a fly, Oh ignorant greedy old woman, I hope that you suddenly die, Hurry up and die (x7)’ Morrissey is keen to stress that despite quitting music, he will not be shunning the limelight. ‘I am already in negotiations with the producers of QI about joining their fragrant and estimable team. Meanwhile, I am ready to unleash my first book for the teenage market. I consider it a necessary counterbalance to the inanities of Eugenia Lavender and Budgie the Helicopter.’ The book: ‘Eats, Shoots and Dates: How the Poor Grammar and Punctuation of Others Has Long Ruined my Chances of Finding Lasting Love’ is published by McMillan in March.

8148,"Too Many Deer on the Road? Let Cougars Return, Study Says - The New York Times","What large mammal regularly kills humans in the Eastern United States? And what other large mammal might significantly reduce those deaths? The answer to the first question is the   deer. Deer do not set out to murder people, as far as anyone knows, but they do jump out in front of vehicles so often that they cause more than a million collisions a year, resulting in more than 200 deaths. The answer to the second question, according to a new scientific study, is the cougar. Laura R. Prugh, a wildlife scientist at the University of Washington Sophie L. Gilbert, a wildlife ecologist at the University of Idaho and several colleagues argue in the journal Conservation Letters that if eastern cougars returned to their historic range, they could prevent 155 human deaths and 21, 400 human injuries, and save $2. 3 billion, over the course of 30 years. And although cougars do kill humans sometimes, the scientists estimated that the total number of lives lost would be fewer than 30, far fewer than the number of lives saved. The scientists studied 19 states, including Maine, Missouri, Ohio, South Carolina and Wisconsin. Four other states  —   Delaware, Illinois, Indiana and Rhode Island  —   were part of the eastern cougar’s historic range, which was wiped out by the early 1900s. However, those states do not have enough open forestland to support viable cougar populations, the scientists said. I have a personal interest in this new report. In 2004, I wrote an entirely selfish and completely undocumented essay lamenting the damage that deer were doing to my garden and suggesting, only partly    that the lawn and garden community would be willing to sacrifice a few pets and joggers if mountain lions could be brought to the suburbs to get rid of the Bambi plague. I noted that deer were also responsible for human deaths, although that was not my true motivation. I’m sure I wasn’t the first to have this idea. What deer do to cultivated suburban yards can make otherwise peaceful people quite bloody minded. But I didn’t do the numbers. Dr. Prugh and her colleagues have done the numbers in an attempt to find some real answers. The return of cougars on their own is entirely possible, they say. The animals have come back to parts of the Midwest over the past few decades and are starting to appear in the East. One animal was documented in Connecticut. That kind of natural repopulation would be likely to face less resistance than a   reintroduction, which she was not advocating, Dr. Prugh said. But would their reappearance really help? She and her colleagues took a methodical approach to putting together available numbers on how deer populations grow, how many car accidents involve deer and how accidents increase with a growing deer population. They gathered information on how many deer a cougar might kill  —   about 259 over an average life span of about six years  —   and how much open, forested land was necessary for cougars to sustain a wild population  —   about 850 square miles. Then the scientists tested a variety of mathematical models and came up with their projections. One of the questions they needed to consider was whether the cougars would be killing just deer that would die anyway from starvation or illness. The scientists took what Dr. Prugh said was a conservative approach that about 75 percent of the deer the cougars killed would have died anyway. They also considered that as adult deer decrease in number, more fawns survive. So killing deer doesn’t immediately shrink the population. Adrian Treves, the head of the Carnivore Coexistence Lab at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, who was not involved with the study, said he was impressed with the analysis and thought it might underestimate the benefits of cougars. He said in an email that there would probably be an even greater reduction in   collisions, “if governments and private citizens allow cougars to recover to historic levels. ” Figuring out the downsides of having cougars back was more difficult. The numbers of cougars would be considerable in some states once the deer and cougar populations stabilized  —   about 1, 000 each in New York and Wisconsin, 350 or so in Missouri and only eight to 15 in New Jersey. They estimated lost livestock values in the areas studied at $2. 35 million a year. But they were not able to get good estimates of pet loss, because it is hard to pin down which pets that disappear were killed by cougars. They may have been killed by coyotes, or cars, or may have been taken in by someone else. Also, they could not account for the obvious emotional response to predators. Even if the estimate is correct that five times as many people would be saved by cougars as would be killed, death by deer and cougar are different. “The idea of being killed in a car crash with a deer just doesn’t scare people the way the idea of a cougar leaping on your back in the woods does,” Dr. Prugh said. But she says she hopes that if cougars do return to the Eastern states, an understanding that they could bring tangible benefits will make people “a little more accepting, even if they are still scared. ”",0
8149,FBI Reopens Hillary Clinton Email Case After New Information Surfaces,"FBI Reopens Hillary Clinton Email Case After New Information Surfaces Posted on Oct 28, 2016 FBI Director James Comey testified on Capitol Hill in July and said the probe of Hillary Clinton’s private email server was finished. ( Evan Vucci / AP ) 
The heat is back on Hillary Clinton. On Friday, the FBI told Congress that it is reviewing its investigation of her private email server after new emails emerged. 
According to The New York Times, the new information came from Anthony Wiener’s electronic devices in an unrelated case. Wiener is the husband of Huma Abedin, one of Clinton’s top aides. 
The latest developments could lead to the FBI reopening its criminal investigation into Clinton. 
In the letter to Congress, FBI Director James Comey stated: 
In previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton’s personal email server. Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony. 
In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation. 
Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committee about our efforts in light of my previous testimony. 
The Associated Press reported that the Clinton campaign and White House did not have any immediate comments . 
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who believes Clinton set up a “criminal scheme,” was happy with the news. 
“Perhaps finally justice will be done,” Trump said. 
State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the department would “cooperate to the full extent that we can.” 
House Speaker Paul Ryan had little sympathy for Clinton and said she has “nobody but herself to blame.” 
“She was entrusted with some of our nation’s most important secrets, and she betrayed that trust by carelessly mishandling highly classified information,” Ryan, R-Wis., expressed in a statement. “This decision, long overdue, is the result of her reckless use of a private email server, and her refusal to be forthcoming with federal investigators. I renew my call for the Director of National Intelligence to suspend all classified briefings for Secretary Clinton until this matter is fully resolved.”

In a speech before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee earlier this year, Hillary Clinton, who vehemently opposes the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement warned against anyone who tries to “to shut down debate, especially in places of learning like colleges and universities.” Her concern, of course, was with reassuring pro-Israel students that she stood behind them as they battled efforts to criticize Israel from the left. 
It is certainly sportsman-like of Clinton to be open to debate, but the reality is that the free exchange of ideas on campus is currently under assault, not from the left but from the right. Consider the following incident from here in Ohio. 
On September 21, the Case Western Reserve University Radical Student Union showed a documentary titled “ ,” which is available to all members of the university community through the Kanopy streaming service. Today, the RSU stands accused by the , a nonprofit pro-Israel group, of engaging in an “antisemitic expression” that “condoned terrorism,” simply for showing the film in public. One radical student critical of Israel’s policies likened the climate of fear on the CWRU campus with respect to this issue as akin to be “stalked.” 
The RSU decided to host the film to raise awareness and in the words of its president, Gabriel Murcia, to give “voice to people who don’t have a voice.” Although some 100 people attended the screening, the RSU decided at the last minute not to have a formal discussion after the film when an email raising the specter of antisemitism emerged from the president of a pro-Israel student group. 
I have watched this film at least four times now. There is absolutely not one shred of evidence of antisemitism in it if by that word we mean hatred or discrimination against the Jewish people. The film does, however, take Israel to task for engaging in a dishonest campaign of public diplomacy. These efforts have tended to cast the problem in Israel/Palestine in terms of terror instead of territory, and have made it seem as if Palestinians are on the whole just prone to violence instead of people with legitimate grievances about displacement and dispossession of land. 
After the movie, a student fellow of the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA), a group formed after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, noted that though “every student on this campus is entitled to express their opinion” the film was biased and “unacceptable to be presented by a student organization at our university.” The her opposition to the BDS movement and argued that the president of CWRU had made opposition to academic boycotts the institution’s official stance. 
The student’s reference is to a in which the president and provost, like many university administrations across the country, communicated their personal opposition to the academic boycott of Israel following the American Studies Association’s endorsement of it. They argued that the boycott compromised academic freedom. Never mind that the academic boycott was set up to help Palestinian scholars achieve academic freedom while under the Israeli occupation. The AMCHA Initiative liked their statement so much that it still links to it on its website. The statement was not, however, the official position of CWRU, simply the personal opinions of its two highest administrators. 
The statement by the CWRU administration and the letter from the CAMERA fellow recall, as I pointed out in a , Edward Said’s comment, nearly 40 years ago, that politically speaking, the Palestinian in the United States “does not exist.” 
I thought the matter was at an end, but to my surprise the about the movie screening. A university administrator who directs a continuing education center dedicated to “ ” condemned the film and the RSU, as if a radical Jewish tradition did not exist. He also implied that faculty drove the group’s agenda, implying that the students were not bright enough to think for themselves. The chairman of the board of trustees of the Jewish Federation of Cleveland, Gary Gross, meanwhile, called the film a bunch of “lies and distortions” without providing any evidence in support of the assertion. In fact, the film is about a policy of using lies and distortions to advance the interests of a foreign government. Gross added that he supports free speech, but then ominously intoned, “We will follow what’s happening on [the CWRU] campus through our partner agency, Cleveland Hillel.” 
The reference to Hillel was not an idle one. Cleveland Hillel just partnered with CWRU on the creation of the new Albert & Norma Geller Hillel Student Center which includes within it classrooms available for undergraduate courses. Some students on the left are dismayed that they are forced to take classes in a building run by a group that offers “ .” 
This incident is part of nationwide trend. Universities all over the country are under surveillance, most famously at the University of California, Berkeley, where a student-led course titled Palestine: A Settler-Colonial Analysis was canceled after AMCHA coordinated with other groups, including CAMERA, to pressure administrators. The course was later reinstated, but the intimidation continues online. An anonymous website called the Canary Mission, established in 2015, targets those on campus critical of the Israeli occupation. The site’s main goal is to harass student activists and attempt to block their admission into graduate school. 
If Hillary Clinton really does care about academic freedom, she should step up and publicly condemn the blacklisting of students and faculty concerned about Palestinian human rights. And so should the university presidents who invoked academic freedom as the rationale for their opposition to the ASA’s endorsement of the boycott of Israeli academic institutions. These leaders should also learn something from the experience on the Berkeley campus and stop caving in to people who have trouble tolerating a perspective that challenges them to think. 
When I informed Mr. Murcia about his group’s inclusion on the AMCHA website he was saddened. As he put it, “All we did was show a movie.”

The US Justice Department has charged 61 people and entities with involvement in a major India-based scam that targeted thousands of Americans. 
The scheme involved Indian call centers, where some workers called American citizens and convinced them to pay their non-existent debts by impersonating Internal Revenue Service (IRS), immigration and other federal officials, the Justice Department said in a statement on Thursday. 
Some victims were even offered short-term loans or grants on condition of providing good-faith deposits or payment of a processing fee. 
The scammers had stolen more than $300 million from at least 15,000 unsuspecting citizens, the department noted. 
The victims’ money was laundered by an American network of criminals who used debit cards or wire transfers under fake identities, the indictment said.

8152,Comment on Will The FBI Email Investigation Shed New Light On The Lolita Express And Other Clinton Sex Scandals? by mleblanc138,"Archives Michael’s Latest Video Will The FBI Email Investigation Shed New Light On The Lolita Express And Other Clinton Sex Scandals? By Michael Snyder, on October 31st, 2016 
Could it be possible that the newly discovered Clinton emails that the FBI is currently examining contain evidence of crimes other than just the mishandling of classified documents? For years, there have been shocking allegations about the sexual behavior of both Bill and Hillary Clinton in the conservative media, but neither Bill nor Hillary has ever been convicted of a sexual crime. However, that may be about to change. There is nobody on the planet that has been closer to Hillary Clinton over the past decade than Huma Abedin, and now the FBI has their hands on approximately 650,000 emails that were stored on electronic devices owned by her and her estranged husband Anthony Weiner. Without a doubt, many of those emails will relate to the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s mishandling of classified documents, but many of those emails will also be personal in nature. So what will the FBI learn about the Clinton sex scandals from those emails, and will that information be shared with the American public? 
In particular, any information regarding Clinton ties to Jeffrey Epstein and “the Lolita Express” could be extremely explosive. 
Bill and Hillary Clinton were both very good friends of billionaire Jeffrey Epstein before he was convicted of soliciting sex from a young girl in 2008. In fact, flight records show that Bill Clinton was a frequent passenger on Epstein’s plane that eventually came to be known as “the Lolita Express”… 
Bill Clinton took repeated trips on the “ Lolita Express “—the private passenger jet owned by billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein—with an actress in softcore porn movies whose name appears in Epstein’s address book under an entry for “massages,” according to flight logbooks obtained by Gawker and published today for the first time . The logs also show that Clinton shared more than a dozen flights with a woman who federal prosecutors believe procured underage girls to sexually service Epstein and his friends and acted as a “potential co-conspirator” in his crimes . 
Overall, Bill took at least 26 trips on board “the Lolita Express”. Fox News says that the plane “earned its Nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls.” 
But sex with underage girls didn’t just happen on the plane. One of the favorite destinations for “the Lolita Express” was Epstein’s 72-acre “Orgy Island”. Here is more from Fox News … 
“Bill Clinton … associated with a man like Jeffrey Epstein, who everyone in New York, certainly within his inner circles, knew was a pedophile,” said Conchita Sarnoff, of the Washington, D.C. based non-profit Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking, and author of a book on the Epstein case called “TrafficKing.” “Why would a former president associate with a man like that?” 
Epstein, who counts among his pals royal figures, heads of state, celebrities and fellow billionaires, spent 13 months in prison and home detention for solicitation and procurement of minors for prostitution. He allegedly had a team of traffickers who procured girls as young as 12 to service his friends on “Orgy Island,” an estate on Epstein’s 72-acre island, called Little St. James, in the U.S. Virgin Islands . 
Are you starting to understand how serious this could be? 
If Bill Clinton had sex with an underage girl just one time, that would be enough to potentially send him to prison for the rest of his life. 
Court records show that Jeffrey Epstein had 21 different phone numbers for Bill Clinton. To say that they were close would be a massive understatement. 
And what was the nature of Hillary Clinton’s involvement with Jeffrey Epstein? 
There are so many unanswered questions, and I don’t know what these 650,000 emails are going to show. But there are persistent whispers that law enforcement officials that were looking through them for the Anthony Weiner case found something big. 
And the truth is that the FBI would have never renewed this investigation so close to the election unless a gamechanger had been discovered. FBI Director James Comey had to know that he was going to take a tremendous amount of heat for this decision, and to move forward on something like this without good reason would be career suicide. 
For the moment, Hillary Clinton is putting on a brave face. On Monday, she challenged the FBI to hurry up and read her emails so that they could see that she had nothing to hide… 
With eight days remaining until Election Day, Hillary Clinton told a crowd of supporters here Monday that the FBI should hurry up and check out the additional emails that agents said they found while investigating the estranged husband of one of her aides. 
“Go ahead. Look at them,” the Democratic nominee said about the emails that may have been originally housed on a private server she used as secretary of state — a revelation that has thrown the presidential election into turmoil. 
Maybe Clinton is telling the truth, but with her you just never know. As I recently explained to a live studio audience down at Morningside , Hillary Clinton is a habitual liar and it is hard to trust her about anything at this point. 
If she is lying about these emails, hopefully we will find out very quickly. 
Her opponent, Donald Trump, seems energized by this new scandal, and he is warning that America may be facing a “constitutional crisis” if Clinton wins the election… 
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, buoyed by tightening polls and a renewed controversy over Democrat Hillary Clinton, told an enthusiastic crowd in suburban Grand Rapids Monday that the U.S. could face a “constitutional crisis” if Clinton is elected president on Nov. 8. 
Trump predicted a “protracted criminal investigation and probably a criminal trial,” and said “nothing will get done.” 
FBI Director James Comey has “brought back his reputation” by reactivating an investigation into the handling of her State Department e-mails , Trump said to loud cheers. 
But the cold, hard reality of the matter is that we could potentially be facing something much more serious than just a “constitutional crisis”. 
If the FBI finds evidence of very serious crimes committed by Hillary Clinton, she could actually be forced to withdraw from the race on the eve of the election, and that would throw the entire process into a state of chaos . 
Even so, it is exceedingly important that the American people get the truth about what is in these emails, and hopefully that will happen as rapidly as possible.

8153,Germany’s Extreme Right Challenges Guilt Over Nazi Past  - The New York Times,"DRESDEN, Germany  —   At a   beer hall on Tuesday evening, the lean blond man’s voice boomed out over a crowd of hundreds  —   some   and   but with a contingent of polished young professionals. “The AfD is the last revolutionary, the last peaceful chance for our fatherland,” declared the man, Björn Höcke, referring to the political party Alternative for Germany, and employing a reverential term for Germany, one of several nationalist buzzwords usually shunned in the country’s politics. “Jawohl!” a few shouted. “Yes!” When Mr. Höcke (pronounced  ) lamented that “German history is handled as rotten and made to look ridiculous”  —   a subtle but clear reference to guilt for the Holocaust and other Nazi war crimes  —   the crowd responded by chanting, “Deutschland, Deutschland. ” His speech at the rally in Dresden on Tuesday touched off a wave of national alarm by challenging Germany’s national atonement for the Holocaust and for its Nazi crimes. His comments drew broad criticism for their venom and because Mr. Höcke, a rising star in the AfD, has found growing success with his messages of extreme nationalism. Shouting to be heard over cheering supporters, many of whom stood, Mr. Höcke challenged the collective national guilt over the war that has restrained German politics for three generations. At times he used language that seemed to hint at lamenting Nazi Germany’s defeat. Germans were “the only people in the world to plant a monument of shame in the heart of its capital,” he said, referring to a memorial to murdered Jews in Berlin. He added that Germans had the “mentality of a totally vanquished people. ” Mr. Höcke, who began his speech by triumphantly raising his arms over his head, represents the rightward flank of Alternative for Germany, an already   party. But his speech and the crowd’s energetic reception of his words offer a glimpse of the relatively new party’s threat to German politics. He is on the fringe, but that fringe is growing in numbers and in willingness to defy the usual restraints, to the rising alarm of Germany’s establishment leaders, who on Wednesday denounced his comments. Sigmar Gabriel, leader of the Social Democrats and the country’s vice chancellor, shot back in a Facebook post showing a banner splashed across an image of Mr. Höcke standing at a lectern, reading: “To remember the millions of victims of the Nazis is no weakness. Baiting the helpless to promote yourself is weakness. ” The chairman of the Green Party for the state of Saxony, Jürgen Kasek, on Twitter called for the speech to be checked for possible violations of   laws. He accused Mr. Höcke of saying things that violated the spirit of the Constitution “in the style of national socialism. ” The Central Council of Jews in Germany, in a statement, called the comments “deeply deplorable and fully unacceptable. ” Charlotte Knobloch, a former president of the council, told the newspaper Stimme Heilbronner that Mr. Höcke’s speech was “unbearable agitation,” and she warned that “the AfD is poisoning the political culture and social debate in Germany. ” Mr. Höcke’s comments even drew a rebuke from the chairwoman of Alternative for Germany, Frauke Petry, who said they were out of line and “straining” the party. Ms. Petry and Mr. Höcke have been locked in a power struggle for months over how far to the right to position the party, which was originally founded on an   platform. The party is polling at nearly 15 percent, ahead of some mainstream parties, for this fall’s national election. Its rapid rise demonstrates that German nationalist politics can find a foothold in unexpected places, for example among educated young people like those at Tuesday’s rally. Those   many in coat and tie, looked   and primly trendy. Most of the men wore their hair buzzed close on the sides and long and floppy on top, separated by a severe side parting that seemed unmistakably evocative of Hitler’s. Mainstream parties in Germany have long eschewed   politics  —   in the style of   movements  —   and have avoided shows of overt nationalism. But that leaves an opening: A populist party like Alternative for Germany can indulge those ideas just enough to excite its supporters without scaring off larger groups of voters. The Alternative for Germany supporters who were gathered in Dresden, the capital of Saxony, seemed animated in a way that is unusual when it comes to modern politics in Germany. Most Germans rarely feel allowed to get excited about their political beliefs or, just as sensitive an issue, about their national identity. The atmosphere lent the evening a feeling of thrilling transgression, as if the act of cheering   ideas was as important, or perhaps more so, than the ideas themselves. Julian M. Wälder, a    law student, said he had initially joined the youth league of the Christian Democratic Union, the   party to which Chancellor Angela Merkel belongs. But the party did not feel like “real politics,” he said. Alternative for Germany, Mr. Wälder said, finally felt genuine. This is a core part of the party’s message: While other parties are all the same, only Alternative for Germany really expresses the popular will. Mr. Wälder and other young attendees seemed tense  —   the location of the gathering was kept secret until that morning in a failed attempt to avoid the   protesters who often gather outside the semiregular rallies  —   but they were jovial. The rally on Tuesday felt, if not like a watershed, then a glimpse of a wider, more gradual change. Calls for asserting a strong national identity are not pernicious on their own  —   all nations have identities, after all  —   but they remain somewhat taboo in Germany. And that taboo is precisely the point. Only the fringes would be brazen enough to champion a nationalist identity. But that risks letting those fringes define its contours. Mr. Höcke, for instance, disavowed a famous 1985 speech by Richard von Weizsacker, then the president of Germany, that called for the Allied victory to be seen as the liberation of the German people, not as their defeat. Mr. Höcke called Mr. Weizsacker’s address “a speech against his own people, and not for his own people. ” Since 2015, when Germany received nearly a million asylum seekers, Alternative for Germany has sought to portray national identity as under threat from migration and multiculturalism. Establishment parties and other enemies, Mr. Höcke told the crowd, “are liquidating our beloved German fatherland, like a piece of soap under warm running water. But we, we beloved friends, we patriots, we will close this open tap, and we will win back our Germany, piece by piece. ” Yascha Mounk, a lecturer at Harvard and a fellow at the Transatlantic Academy of the German Marshall Fund, said Germany had a style of government that could leave an especially wide opening for fringe parties. Because the German parties tend to govern in a grand,   coalition, voters often see little change when parties shift in and out. Politics in Germany usually play out in quiet, polite negotiations among members of the coalition, rather than in dramatic, public clashes between competing parties. The coalition blocks fringe parties like Alternative for Germany, which can then paint mainstream politics as an elite conspiracy to impose unpopular policies and to shut down real debate. The crowd, at one point, chanted a line Mr. Wälder has also used: “We are the outsiders. ” It was a jarring moment, as many of the “outsiders” were young, white and wore suits and ties  —   seemingly the definition of an insider in Germany. Because these young Germans say that the political establishment has denied them sufficient pride in their national identity, they feel as if they are being oppressed, even though they have every right and live in a country that has one of Europe’s   economies. But young and old supporters of Alternative for Germany seemed to find something at Tuesday’s rally that is not common among   politics: a sense of impending victory. Not in the sense that they would oust Ms. Merkel’s government this fall  —   she is likely to retain power  —   but in the belief that their movement would quickly shape and perhaps one day overcome a system that they see as denying them their German pride. Mr. Mounk said that the rise of extremist voices may have been inevitable, given the failure of mainstream parties to satisfy the desires for national   and for charismatic politics. That left an opening for Mr. Höcke to deliver a message “beyond the usual gripes about being too ashamed of being German,” Mr. Mounk added, “implying, though never quite stating outright, that defeat in 1945 was a bad thing. ” Mr. Höcke concluded his speech on Tuesday with a rallying call. “Beloved friends, we must do little less than make history, so that there will be for us Germans, us Europeans, a future,” he said, as the audience stood, cheered and chanted his name. He added, “We can make history, and we are doing it. ”",0
8154,Joe Biden: ‘I Wish to Hell I’d Just Kept Saying the Exact Same Thing’ - The New York Times,"Joe Biden’s personal compartment on the modified Boeing 757 that serves as Air Force Two had the feel of a motel manager’s office equipped with     communications gear. The room held a little black couch with a pullout bed he had slept on more times than he could count over the last eight years, during which he logged more than a million miles aloft. We were en route back to Wilmington, Del. from Cartagena, Colombia, in early December, and Biden was sitting in a black leather seat with a binder in his lap. It contained the speech he had given at the Democratic National Convention in July. He told me he had been rereading it. He began reciting aloud: “If you live in neighborhoods like the one Jill and I grew up in, if you worry about your job and getting decent pay. . .. ” His voice accelerated. “If you worry about your children’s education, if you’re taking care of an elderly parent, there’s only one person in this race who. . .. ” He looked up at me and sighed. “I wish to hell I’d just kept saying the exact same thing. ” Biden was afflicted with regret. He was sorry that, on the campaign trail, he had spoken so often about Donald Trump’s unfitness for office and not enough about what Hillary Clinton would do for the middle class. He was sorry he didn’t push harder inside the White House for a   tax cut. And he was still torn over his decision not to run for president, a race that he said would have been “brutal” but that he also believed he could have won. I spoke with Biden intermittently in the months before and after Election Day, and I had no doubt as to why he didn’t jump in. He was still corny, gabby, lovable Uncle Joe, the guy who once said: “Stand up, Chuck! Let ’em see you!” to a man in a wheelchair. But nearly every speech and interview now included some moving mention of his son Beau, who died of brain cancer in 2015, and how much Biden was doing, and intended to continue to do for the rest of his life, to speed the search for cancer cures. I saw Biden cry in Manchester, N. H. in October when holding an infant that he was told was named after Beau. I saw him near tears in West Mifflin, Pa. the weekend before the election, when he was joined onstage by the former Pittsburgh Steelers Franco Harris and Mel Blount  —   which reminded him of the footballs the team owner sent to young Beau and his brother, Hunter, in the hospital after they were injured in the 1972 car accident that killed Biden’s first wife and baby girl. On his deathbed, Beau advised his father to run, but many friends  —   including President Obama  —   didn’t think he was up to it emotionally, and the vice president finally agreed. “For all that’s important to me in almost a sacred sense,” he told me mournfully, the decision was unavoidable. “The family was broken, and I was more broken than I thought I was. ” How broken? “I don’t know what I’d do if I was in a debate and someone said, ‘You’re doing this because of your son,’’u2009” he told me one late November day in his West Wing office. “I might have walked over and kicked his ass. ” And yet minutes later, he was standing at his desk, fidgeting and replaying what might have been in 2016. The South Carolina primary would have given him a strong start, he said, citing his internal polls there. “Hard to believe, but I was more popular with blacks than Barack was. ” Biden clearly loathes the new president he said during the campaign that if he and Trump were in high school, he’d “take him behind the gym” for the way he bragged about groping women. Trump reminded him of the bullies who teased him as a child on account of his stutter, calling him “  . ” But the politician who has long believed all politics is personal wants to keep it impersonal with Trump. “The president and I have concluded that there’s no value in making that ad hominem argument,” he told me of Obama. “It gets you nowhere. ” Biden wasn’t shocked that Hillary Clinton lost. He had noticed before the election that Trump was connecting with the people he grew up with in Pennsylvania. This shaped his thoughts on how Democrats should respond. When the subject of Trump came up aboard Air Force Two, Biden referred to a   story about how, as a freshman senator, he saw Jesse Helms, the archconservative North Carolina Republican, ripping into a piece of disabilities legislation. Biden was furious about it and began attacking Helms to Mike Mansfield, the Democratic Senate majority leader. Puffing on his pipe, Mansfield asked Biden if he knew that Helms and his wife had adopted a disabled    boy no one else would take. “Question a man’s judgment, not his motives,” Mansfield instructed. Biden, who was invited by Helms decades later to give his eulogy, is convinced that absorbing Mansfield’s advice is what allowed him to work with Senate Republicans during the Obama years, to negotiate the approval of the New Start    treaty, the end of “don’t ask, don’t tell” and the expansion of the   tax credit, among other accomplishments. His approach to Trump, he said, wouldn’t be fundamentally different. “It falls in that category,” Biden told me. “It’s one thing to say: ‘I think the proposal on the following is a serious mistake. I think it’s gonna do the following damage.’ It’s another thing to say, ‘The guy’s a fucking idiot, and he is an egomaniac who’s a whatever. ’’u2009” Biden suggested he might lobby former Republican colleagues when “circumstances generate blowback among mainstream Republicans. ” He remains in the shrinking camp that believes Trump may yet step up, at least a bit, to the demands of high office. His hope is that Trump’s “sense of grandeur is so immense that he’d rather succeed than unleash these forces. ” Given how many Trump voters would lose their insurance under full repeal of the Affordable Care Act, he may well back off of repealing it, Biden said. As for the rest of his own administration’s legacy, he said, “I’m not prepared to bet my granddaughter’s college tuition, but it’s less likely to be undone than frayed on the edges. ” Biden’s biggest worry is that Trump, for all his bluster, could be a global bystander, unwilling to engage a messy world with anything more than  . “The question I get everywhere is: ‘Is American leadership going to continue? ’’u2009” he told me on Air Force Two. If Trump “just stays behind the lines  —   hands off  —   it could be very ugly. Very, very ugly. ” In July, the president of Latvia asked Biden to fly there as soon as possible and give a televised speech assuring the Baltic states that the United States would fulfill its NATO obligations and defend them against a Russian invasion. He did so, emphatically, but his promises offer little comfort   Day. The prospect of Vladimir Putin fulfilling his dream of   Russian hegemony over Eastern Europe is not far from Biden’s mind. “Now if we walk away  —   Hungary, Poland, even the Baltic states, these guys all start to hedge their bets,” he said. Biden’s national security adviser, Colin Kahl, who was with the vice president on the plane, interjected to outline the contradictions in Trump’s emerging foreign policy. If the United States is going to be more cooperative with Russia and Bashar  ’s Syria but more confrontational with Iran, Kahl asked, how will Trump handle them joining together to fight ISIS? “It’s like a Rubik’s cube trying to figure this guy out,” Biden sighed. “We have no freakin’ idea what he’s gonna do. ” When they were Senate colleagues, and Biden was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Biden thought Obama was in too much of a hurry  —   and Obama found the chairman a tad condescending. But in the White House, the two men became exceptionally close. “There was never a point,” Obama told me recently, “where I thought he was distancing himself from me or positioning himself. Never been a time when he wasn’t telling me something he really thought. ” Their families, too, drew together. “Family has been central for us  —   that’s our baseline,” Obama told me. “We both feel freer to do what we think is right because if it doesn’t work out, our families will still love us. ” Biden later told friends that he thought the president was sincerely looking out for him in 2015 when he advised him not to run  —   though he also felt Obama had grown fond of the bright mark he could leave on history by passing the baton from the first black president to the first female president. The big question now is when, and how, they will   the arena. Obama has already said that, unlike George W. Bush, he won’t refrain from commenting on his successor. Biden may go further. Amid discussion of resistance to Trump, he surprised me with talk of 2020, when he’ll turn 78. “I’ll run,” the vice president deadpanned, “if I can walk. ” Three days later, he informed the Washington press corps that he wasn’t joking. Biden isn’t likely to run, but keeping the door ajar gives him a bigger voice in Democratic Party debates. The one that worries him most is over repositioning to win back Trump voters. He has little patience with Democrats who want to move either left or right. “’u2009‘We gotta move to the center,’ ‘We gotta move to those white guys,’ ‘We gotta move to those   people’ or ‘We gotta double down on the social agenda. ’’u2009” It’s a false choice, he said: “They are totally compatible. I have never said anything to the A. C. L. U. that I wouldn’t say to the Chamber of Commerce. ” This was the vision of the Democratic Party to which Biden had dedicated his career. “Amtrak Joe” famously commuted every day from Wilmington to Washington  —   three hours   for 36 years. He told me that as the train neared Baltimore, he habitually peered into the rapidly passing homes close to the tracks  —   a flip book of   families of various backgrounds who might have recognized themselves in his convention speech. “I wonder what the conversation at the dinner table is,” he told me. Sometimes he saw his own family in the early 1960s in those houses. He imagines the families’ struggles with everyday expenses: “’u2009‘Honey, we need a new set of tires, but you gotta get another 20, 000 miles out of them.’ That’s the goddamn discussion people are having! That’s their lives!” Before the election, Biden had begun to map out what his    plans would look like. Soon he would be back on Amtrak, riding to and from a   institute bearing his name at the University of Pennsylvania and a   center at the University of Delaware, and continuing the “cancer moonshot”  —   a   initiative marshaling resources in government and the private sector to accelerate cancer research. In the meantime, he’ll help play defense against Trump. “Even if the Democratic Party didn’t want me, I’m not walking away,” he said. “I’ve worked on this stuff my whole life. ” After Air Force Two touched down on the tarmac in Wilmington, I asked him about a line he liked to use before the election. “So do you still believe what your grandfather said, that God looks out for drunken Irishmen and the United States of America?” Biden said he wasn’t sure about the Irishmen, but he was about the country. “I have to believe that,” he said. “There’s no sense being in this business unless you’re an optimist. ”",0

8156,"Shaken by Sex Scandal, Oakland Police to Get New Leader, Again - The New York Times","For the fourth time in less than two weeks, the police department in Oakland, Calif. is answering to a different leader. The changes have come as the city deals with two investigations involving its officers: a widening sex scandal and a series of racist text messages sent within the department. “As the mayor of Oakland, I am here to run a police department, not a frat house,” Mayor Libby Schaaf said at a news conference on Friday. The sex scandal unfurled after the suicide of one of the department’s officers last fall. An    woman has since alleged in several media reports that she had sex with that officer and several others from Oakland and other police departments in the area, including some while she was a minor. “We continue to be disgusted and outraged by the idea that anyone could abuse an underage victim of sexual exploitation,” Ms. Schaaf said in a statement on June 11. The police department’s former chief, Sean Whent, resigned on June 9. Mr. Whent’s resignation was “a personal choice, which we respect,” said Ms. Schaaf, who then named Ben Fairow the interim chief. Mr. Fairow had previously worked in the department and was serving as deputy chief for the Bay Area Rapid Transit. He lasted five days in the job. “I have just received information that has caused me to lose confidence in Ben Fairow’s ability to lead the Oakland Police Department at this particular moment in time,” the mayor said in a statement on Wednesday, announcing Mr. Fairow’s departure. She did not elaborate on specific reasons for her decision. The department’s assistant chief, Paul Figueroa, was then named acting police chief. That lasted two days: Mr. Figueroa said in a statement on Friday that he was taking leave and would return to the department as a captain. “I feel that this is an appropriate time to place civilian oversight over this police department and to send a very clear message about how serious we are about not tolerating misconduct, unethical behavior, and to root out what is clearly a toxic macho culture,” Ms. Schaaf said, in announcing that the city administrator, Sabrina Landreth, will oversee the department while a national search is conducted for a new chief. The handling of the sex scandal is being reviewed by Oakland’s district attorney and an independent investigator. The Associated Press reported that of the 14 Oakland police officers involved in the sex scandal, two have resigned and three others are on paid leave. Ms. Schaaf said the investigation into racist text messages is not related to the sex scandal or the resignation of Mr. Figueroa. “We do think it’s relevant to share that the text messages were sent by   officers,” the mayor said. “But they are wholly inappropriate and not acceptable from anyone who wears the badge of the Oakland Police Department. ” Neither the mayor’s office nor investigators have released the text messages to the public. The mayor would not say how many officers were involved with the text messages, but said the investigation “suggests that it is not as widespread as the sex scandal. ” “I want to assure the citizens of Oakland that we are hellbent on rooting out this disgusting culture,” Ms. Schaaf said.",0
8157,Transition Team’s Request on Gender Equality Rattles State Dept. - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —     Donald J. Trump’s transition team asked the State Department this week to submit details of programs and jobs aimed at promoting gender equality, rattling State Department employees concerned that the incoming administration will roll back a cornerstone project of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The   memo, a copy of which was provided to The New York Times on Thursday, directed employees to outline “existing programs and activities to promote gender equality, such as ending   violence, promoting women’s participation in economic and political spheres, entrepreneurship, etc. ” It also requested a list of positions “whose primary functions are to promote such issues”  —   though not the names of people in those positions  —   as well as how much funding was directed to   programs in 2016. The United States Agency for International Development also received the request, according to a senior official there. The wording of the memo is neutral and does not hint at any policy change. Nevertheless, some State Department employees took note of the reference to “  staffing,” which they said could also refer to programs focused on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues, though the memo did not refer specifically to them. The memo is reminiscent of one the transition team sent recently to the Energy Department, which asked for the names of people who had worked on climate change or attended global climate talks organized by the United Nations within the past five years. That more detailed questionnaire, on the heels of Mr. Trump’s appointment of a climate change denialist to head the Environmental Protection Agency, sowed fears that the Trump administration would purge anyone involved in trying to curb the effects of climate change. The latest request drew expressions of concern from advocacy groups and some on Capitol Hill. “The transition team should clarify their intent,” said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, in a statement. “I can promise that if the next administration intends to roll back programs designed to lift women up, it will very quickly meet stiff opposition in the Senate. ” The transition team declined a request for comment on the memo. A person answering the phone in the State Department transition office directed inquiries to the public affairs office, which declined to confirm the memo’s existence or to discuss information being sought. After a slow start, the transition team is accelerating its work to staff the State Department, sending memos requesting information from the rank and file on issues such as the department’s antiterrorism initiative, Countering Violent Extremism. Mr. Trump has made the fight against the Islamic State central to his foreign policy and has railed against what he said was President Obama’s refusal to use the term “radical Islamic terrorism. ” The transition team’s questions have led some in the department to assume that, at a minimum, the program will be renamed Countering Islamic Extremism. Transition officials are said to be concerned about how many senior jobs in the department will be vacated by departing political appointees. They asked whether there would be anyone to show the secretary of   Rex W. Tillerson, around his office. On Wednesday, the State Department press secretary, John Kirby, told reporters that in general terms, the information being sought by Mr. Trump’s team was not out of the ordinary. “Having gone through a transition myself a few years ago, without getting into detail, I can tell you that the kinds of things, the kinds of material, the kind of information that they are asking for is very much in keeping with what I’ve seen in at least the one previous presidential transition that I lived through when I was at the Pentagon,” Mr. Kirby said. Secretary of State John Kerry has spoken to Mr. Tillerson, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, in what Mr. Kirby said was a “nice chat where the secretary had an opportunity to congratulate him. ” On Tuesday, Mr. Tillerson met in Washington with Vice   Mike Pence and other senior members of Mr. Trump’s national security team. Mr. Kerry has tended to champion efforts to counter climate change while at the State Department, but Mrs. Clinton made   issues a leitmotif of her tenure. In her first year, she created the position of ambassador at large for global women’s issues, appointing Melanne Verveer, who had been her chief of staff when she was first lady. Mr. Kerry kept the post, which is currently held by Catherine M. Russell, a former chief of staff to Jill Biden, the wife of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Some at the department now worry it will be eliminated. Several of Mrs. Clinton’s showcase projects, like clean stoves for the developing world, had a strong gender component. In travels to El Salvador, India and Pakistan, she gathered female entrepreneurs to discuss their challenges. She often drew a link between the treatment of women and the nation’s security. “If you look at where we are fighting terrorism,” she said in an interview in 2009, “there is a connection to groups that are making a stand against modernity, and that is most evident in their treatment of women. ” Mrs. Clinton also gave equal benefits and protections to   partners of American diplomats. In an internal memo, she wrote, “Like all families, our Foreign Service families come in different configurations all are part of the common fabric of our post communities abroad. ” Although Mr. Trump has a record of derogatory comments about women, it is not clear why he would want to roll back the department’s work in this area. News of the memo came the same day he appointed Kellyanne Conway, who managed his campaign, as counselor to the president, making her the   woman in the White House. One of the people on Mr. Trump’s State Department transition team, Erin Walsh, is a former Goldman Sachs executive in Asia who has worked to advance gender issues. At a conference in 2013, she promoted the “10, 000 Women Initiative,” a   program sponsored by Goldman to provide women with a business and management education. A senior State Department official said it was possible that the memo was simple  . But in the current political environment, and given the language Mr. Trump used in the campaign, he said, people were reading the most malign implications into it. “I can’t believe any of this has been shared with the   because Exxon under Tillerson has been extremely supportive of women’s issues,” Ms. Verveer said. “It’s just really hard to fathom. ” Moreover, Mr. Tillerson was on the Boy Scouts of America’s executive board when the group voted in 2013 to lift the ban on gay scouts.",0
8158,Oddsmaker Adds Kamala Harris to List of 2020 Candidates at 33-to-1 - Breitbart,"A sports betting website has added U. S. Senator Kamala Harris ( ) to its list of possible presidential winners in 2020, entering the charts at   odds. [BetOnline. ag favors President Donald Trump to win   at   odds. However, he is also favored to leave office before the end of his first term.  “Even though he is the favorite, his odds are pretty long,” said Dave Mason, the sports betting book manager for BetOnline. The    winner in 2020 is not a Democrat. It is Vice President Mike Pence, at   odds. The most favored Democrat is Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ). At   odds, she is the frontrunner on the left. Warren is followed by former First Lady Michelle Obama, at   odds. Mrs. Obama said in April that she would not run for public office. However, other than Elizabeth Warren, she remains the most likely Democrat to win in 2020, according to BetOnline. Hillary Clinton and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan are both long shots at  . Others joining Harris at   are former Obama administration cabinet member Julian Castro, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, Facebook pioneer Mark Zuckerberg, and Sen. Amy Klobucher ( ). Not much is known about Harris, Mason said, but is beginning to gain attention. “If they’re a hot story, bets come in,” Mason said. Harris is making all kinds of news  —   most recently for creating a playlist for   Music Appreciation Month.

8159,Report: ’72 Terrorists Came From Countries Covered by Trump Vetting Order’,"“A review of information compiled by a Senate committee in 2016 reveals that 72 individuals from the seven countries covered in President Trump’s vetting executive order have been convicted in terror cases since the   attacks,” according to a report issued by the Center for Immigration Studies on Saturday. [“These facts stand in stark contrast to the assertions by the Ninth Circuit judges who have blocked the president’s order on the basis that there is no evidence showing a risk to the United States in allowing aliens from these seven   countries to come in,” the report states:  In June 2016 the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, then chaired by new Attorney General Jeff Sessions, released a report on individuals convicted in terror cases since  . Using open sources (because the Obama administration refused to provide government records) the report found that 380 out of 580 people convicted in terror cases since   were  . The report is no longer available on the Senate website, but a summary published by Fox News is available here. The Center has obtained a copy of the information compiled by the subcommittee. The information compiled includes names of offenders, dates of conviction, terror group affiliation, federal criminal charges, sentence imposed, state of residence, and immigration history. The Center has extracted information on 72 individuals named in the Senate report whose country of origin is one of the seven   countries included in the vetting executive order: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The Senate researchers were not able to obtain complete information on each convicted terrorist, so it is possible that more of the convicted terrorists are from these countries. Here’s the list of “admitted terrorists from all of the seven dangerous countries” from the report: Somalia: 20Yemen: 19Iraq: 19Syria: 7Iran: 4Libya: 2Sudan: 1Total: 72, “[A]t least 17 individuals entered as refugees from these   countries,” the report notes: Three came in on student visas and one arrived on a diplomatic visa. At least 25 of these immigrants eventually became citizens. Ten were lawful permanent residents, and four were illegal aliens. The report adds “[t]hese immigrant terrorists lived in at least 16 different states,”: New York (10) Minnesota (8) California (8) Michigan (6) Washington state (2) 11 other states (39) “Ironically, Minnesota was one of the states suing to block Trump’s order to pause entries from the   countries, claiming it harmed the state,” the report observes. “At least two of the terrorists were living in Washington, which joined with Minnesota in the lawsuit to block the order,” the report concludes.",0
8160,Trump’s $1.6 Billion Budget for Border Walls -- Mostly for South Texas,"President Donald Trump’s 2018 budget asks Congress to construct 60 miles of new border walls along the U. S.  border  —   all of which would be located in Texas. [The plan is for the Rio Grande Valley Sector to receive 32 miles of a new border wall, and 28 miles of a new levee wall. The levee in Hidalgo County is designed to address flooding. The budget refers to the new border wall as “a physical wall. ”  Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said, “We are absolutely dead serious about the wall. ” He called it one of President Trump’s “top three” budget priorities, reported Breitbart News on Tuesday. Mulvaney denied that the administration was scaling back funding for border walls by saying the Trump administration’s budget was a striking hike from the 2017 budget. The 2018 budget increases allocations for border security by $1. 1 billion, and $1. 5 billion for the U. S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The director of the Office of Management and Budget also urged Trump voters to be patient and said this proposed action was a beginning for a project that will be protracted. “Keep in mind you can’t just   …     you don’t automatically magically build a wall in the middle of nowhere,” the director stated. The budget for the U. S. Department of Justice also asks for $1. 8 million to “meet litigation, acquisition, and appraisal demands during the construction along the border between Mexico and the United States. ” Breitbart News reported that the funds would be used to hire 12 attorneys and eight staff members for the section of the DOJ that defends litigation arising from eminent domain proceedings (the Environmental and Natural Resources Division’s Land Acquisition Section, “LAS”). Those who are fighting the construction of border walls are mostly on partisan lines. Democratic U. S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett ( ) said “Putting taxpayers on the hook to pay for it is just the latest brick in a wall of broken campaign promises. If we are going to pour billions into concrete, it ought to be an investment in ourselves, rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure,” reported Dallas’ WBAP 820 AM on Thursday. However, landowners in Texas say they will fight mightily to keep their property, and they hope the litigation will be protracted beyond any Trump administration tenure. The New York Times report also said there are more than 90 eminent domain lawsuits from landowners in South Texas and they have been pending since 2008. The Dallas radio station reported that Senator John Cornyn ( ) who serves as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Border Security and Immigration said, “If we really want to secure our borders, and I think the voters in this last presidential election indicated they did, we must be willing to devote the necessary level of funding to achieve it. ” Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

8162,FBI To Scour 650k Emails Linked To Private Server Used By Hillary Clinton,"RT.com reports: 
The search warrant allows the bureau to scour through some 650,000 emails discovered on a laptop belonging to ex-Congressman Anthony Weiner and apparently also used by his wife, Clinton’s closest aide Huma Abedin. The probe is set to check if any of the texts are related to the reopened investigation of the former secretary of state’s private email use. 
The authorization came two days after FBI Director James Comey finally revealed the existence of the emails stash which was reportedly discovered by the agency in early October. 
“ The process has begun, ” a federal law enforcement official told the New York Times. 
The new emails were discovered as part of a separate ‘sexting’ probe into former Representative Anthony Weiner (D-New York). His electronic devices were seized during that investigation. 
Abedin claims she has no knowledge of any of her emails being on the electronic device belonging to her husband, CBS News has learned on Sunday. A source told the network that newly-discovered emails belonged to Weiner, not his wife, who left her husband earlier this year over his sexting addiction. 
Clinton’s longtime aide is allegedly cooperating with the investigation and “ seemed surprised that the emails were there, ” according to the CBS source. 
On Friday, FBI Director Comey announced that due to new findings, the criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server had been reopened, as he sent a letter notifying Congress of the email review. 
The review, which is likely to take weeks, will seek to determine whether any of those messages are work-related, and whether they include either classified information or important new evidence in the probe aimed to check whether Clinton’s actions undermined US national security. ‘I can’t predict how long this will take us to complete’– Comey on reopening Clinton email investigation https://t.co/6SJJAU349V pic.twitter.com/EjuwwFENZ8 
— RT America (@RT_America) 28 October 2016 
The unexpected announcement came just over a week before Americans head to the polls to determine the winner in the race for the White House between Democrat Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. Even though some of those emails passed through Clinton’s private server and could be duplicates of the information already handled by the FBI as part of the previous investigation, the probe is unlikely to wrap up before November 8. 
Concerned by the FBI’s move to relaunch the investigation so close to the election date, US Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid on Sunday sent a letter to the FBI director hinting that Comey had violated the Hatch Act, which bars the use of an executive branch position to influence an election. 
“ Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law, ” Reid, a senator from Nevada, said in the letter to Comey. 
Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and campaign manager Robby Mook also questioned the legality of the FBI’s actions. Comey’s letter to Congress was “ long on innuendo, short on facts, ” Podesta told CNN’s State of the Union. “ We are calling on Mr. Comey to come forward and explain what’s at issue here, ” Podesta said, adding the significance of the emails was unclear. 
In the meantime, the NYT reported that senior Justice Department officials vowed to make all resources available to conduct the investigation as quickly as possible. 
In July the FBI’s long investigation of Clinton’s private email use during her time as secretary of state ended without any charges.",0
8163,F.D.A. Approves Muscular Dystrophy Drug That Patients Lobbied For - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The Food and Drug Administration approved the first drug to treat patients with the most common childhood form of muscular dystrophy, a vivid example of the growing power that patients and their advocates wield over the federal government’s evaluation of drugs. The agency’s approval went against the recommendation of its experts. The main clinical trial of the drug was small, involving only 12 boys with the disease known as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and did not have an adequate control group of boys who had the disease but did not take the drug. A group of independent experts convened by the agency this spring said there was not enough evidence that it was effective. But the vote was close. Large and impassioned groups of patients, including boys in wheelchairs, and their advocates, weighed in. The muscular dystrophy community is well organized and has lobbied for years to win approval for the drug, getting members of Congress to write letters to the agency. A decision on the drug had been delayed for months. The approval was so controversial that F. D. A. employees fought over it, a dispute that was taken to the agency’s commissioner, Dr. Robert M. Califf, who ultimately decided that it would stand. The approval delighted the drug’s advocates and sent the share price of the drug’s maker, Sarepta Therapeutics, soaring. But it was taken as a deeply troubling sign among drug policy experts who believe the F. D. A. has been far too influenced by patient advocates and drug companies, and has allowed the delicate balance in drug approvals to tilt toward speedy decisions based on preliminary data and away from more conclusive evidence of effectiveness and safety. “The agency has set a dangerous precedent,” said Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research in Washington. “To prove something works, you have to compare it to something else  —   a placebo or a treatment. They didn’t do that. ” About 9, 000 to 12, 000 Americans, virtually all boys, are estimated to have Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Because of rare genetic mutations, people with the disease make little or no dystrophin, a protein that acts as a shock absorber to protect muscles from deterioration. Boys with Duchenne typically need wheelchairs by their teens and die by their late 20s. The drug, eteplirsen, uses a technology called exon skipping that seeks to partly correct the genetic defect, allowing muscle cells to produce a somewhat functional form of dystrophin. The drug is applicable to only about 13 percent of Duchenne patients. Other   drugs are being developed for patients with different mutations. Sarepta said the average cost of eteplirsen for a patient would be about $300, 000 a year. That is double the cost of most new cancer drugs, according to Dr. Zuckerman. The drug received accelerated approval, which is reserved for medicines that treat serious diseases and address an “unmet medical need. ” The agency defines that as “a condition whose treatment or diagnosis is not addressed adequately by available therapy. ” But even as it approved the drug, the agency also required the company to conduct another clinical trial to confirm the drug’s effectiveness. If the drug maker fails to prove it, the agency said it may “initiate proceedings to withdraw approval. ” During a heated public meeting in April, experts voted 7 to 3, with three abstentions, that the clinical data did not meet the F. D. A. requirements for   studies necessary for approval. The agency had urged Sarepta, which is based in Cambridge, Mass. to do a larger study with a placebo control to better determine whether the drug worked. But the company argued that doing so would be unethical and impractical, since early hints of effectiveness meant that parents would no longer enroll their sons in a trial where they might not get the drug. Instead, Sarepta compared the data from the 12 boys in the trial to historical data from patients in Italy and Belgium who were as closely matched as possible in disease characteristics. Now the company will have to conduct another trial. But Dr. Zuckerman argued that it is more difficult to enroll patients after a drug had been approved, because families will not want to take a chance that their son would be in a placebo group. Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the F. D. A. ’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement, “We eagerly await learning more about the efficacy of this drug through a confirmatory clinical trial that the company must conduct after approval. ”",0
8164,Get Ready For Civil Unrest: Survey Finds That Most Americans Are Concerned About Election Violence,"Get Ready For Civil Unrest: Survey Finds That Most Americans Are Concerned About Election Violence Time is rapidly slipping away and November 8th will be here before we know it Michael Snyder | Economic Collapse - October 27, 2016 Comments 
Could we see violence no matter who wins on November 8th? Let’s hope that it doesn’t happen, but as you will see below, anti-Trump violence is already sweeping the nation. 
If Trump were to actually win the election, that would likely send the radical left into a violent post-election temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before. Alternatively, there is a tremendous amount of concern on the right that this election could be stolen by Hillary Clinton. And as I showed yesterday, it appears that voting machines in Texas are already switching votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . If Hillary Clinton wins this election under suspicious circumstances, that also may be enough to set off widespread civil unrest all across the country. 
At this moment there is less than two weeks to go until November 8th, and a brand new survey has found that a majority of Americans are concerned “about the possibility of violence” on election day… 
A 51% majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on Election Day; one in five are “very concerned.” Three of four say they have confidence that the United States will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked American democracy for more than 200 years, but just 40% say they are “very confident” about that. 
More than four in 10 of Trump supporters say they won’t recognize the legitimacy of Clinton as president, if she prevails, because they say she wouldn’t have won fair and square. 
But many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of violence. On Wednesday, Donald Trump’s star on the Walk of Fame was smashed into pieces by a man with a sledgehammer and a pick-ax… 
Donald Trump took a lot of hits today, and not just in the Presidential race. With less than two weeks to go before America decides if the ex- Apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over Hillary Clinton, Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was destroyed early Wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pick-ax in what looks to be a Tinseltown first. 
And there were two other instances earlier this year when Donald Trump’s star was also vandalized. One came in January, and the other happened in June … 
This is of course not the first time the GOP candidate’s star has been attacked or defaced since Trump announced his White House bid in summer 2015. The most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at 6801 Hollywood Blvd in late January. In June this summer, a mute sign was painted on Trump’s star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused Trump of promoting and reveling in during the campaign. In both cases, Trump’s star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day. 
We have seen anti-Trump violence on the east coast as well. Earlier this month, someone decided to firebomb the Republican Party headquarters in Orange County, North Carolina. On the building next to the headquarters, someone spray-painted “Nazi Republicans get out of town or else” along with a swastika. 
There have also been other disturbing incidents of anti-Trump violence all over the nation in recent days. A recent Lifezette article put together quite a long list, and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece… 
On Oct. 15 in Bangor, Maine, vandals spray-painted about 20 parked cars outside a Trump rally. Trump supporter Paul Foster, whose van was hit with white paint, told reporters, “Why can’t they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars, all of this, to make their statement?” 
Around Oct. 3, a couple of Trump supporters were assaulted in Zeitgeist, a San Francisco bar, after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for Trump, GotNews reports. “The two Trump supporters were attacked, punched, and chased into the street by ‘some thugs’ that a barmaid called out from the back.” Lilian Kim of ABC 7 Bay Area tweeted a photo of the men, in which one was wearing a Trump T-shirt and the other was wearing a “Blue Lives Matter” shirt. 
On Sept. 28 in El Cajon, California, an angry mob at a Black Lives Matter protest beat 21-year-old Trump supporter Feras Jabro for wearing a “Make America Great Again” baseball cap. The assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app Periscope. 
There is a move to get Trump supporters to wear red on election day, but in many parts of America that might just turn his supporters into easy targets. Let’s certainly hope that we don’t see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating. 
Of course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad, and a Hillary Clinton victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge. 
For example, this week former Congressman Joe Walsh said that he is “grabbing my musket” if Donald Trump loses the election… 
Former Rep. Joe Walsh appeared to call for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. 
Walsh, a former tea party congressman from Illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host, tweeted, “On November 8th, I’m voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, I’m grabbing my musket. You in?” 
And without a doubt, many ordinary Americans are stocking up on guns and ammunition just in case Hillary Clinton is victorious. The following comes from USA Today … 
“Since the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards Hillary Clinton, I’ve been buying a lot more ammunition,” says Rick Darling, 69, an engineer from Harrison Township, in Michigan’s Detroit suburbs. In a follow-up phone interview after being surveyed, the Trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to “declare martial law and take our guns away” after the election. 
Today America is more divided than I have ever seen it before, and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another. 
Ironically, Donald Trump has been working very hard to bring America together. In fact, he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any Republican presidential candidate since 1960 . 
If Hillary Clinton and the Democrats win on November 8th, things will not go well for Hillary Clinton’s political enemies. The Clintons used the power of the White House to go after their enemies the first time around, and Hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then. 
And the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are. This is something that I discussed on national television earlier this month … 
As I write this, it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a Hillary Clinton presidency would be. 
But at this point that appears to be the most likely outcome . 
Out of all the candidates that we could have chosen, the American people are about to put the most evil one by far into the White House. 
Perhaps Donald Trump can still pull off a miracle and we can avoid that fate, but time is rapidly slipping away and November 8th will be here before we know it. NEWSLETTER SIGN UP  ",0
8165,Letter From Former Officials Urges Donald Trump to Detail Foreign Dealings - The New York Times,"More than 50 former government officials and national security and military figures have signed an open letter to Donald J. Trump, urging him to disclose details of his overseas business investments before Election Day. The letter  —   signed by dozens of supporters of the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton  —   was drafted as Mr. Trump, the Republican pick who is reported to have extensive overseas entanglements, has refused to release his tax returns. Michael J. Morell, a former acting director of the C. I. A. and Michael G. Vickers, a former under secretary of defense for intelligence, put together the letter with input from Samantha Vinograd, a former senior adviser to Thomas E. Donilon, a former national security adviser. “Donald Trump still has not revealed to the American public his international business relationships, even as it becomes increasingly clear that his overseas ties could well constitute significant conflicts of interest when it comes to charting U. S. foreign policy,” the letter reads. “This is unprecedented for a candidate for the nation’s highest office. As such, we are calling on Mr. Trump to disclose, in full, the nature of his business relationships overseas  —   to include specifically who his business partners are and what and where are his foreign investments. ” The signers  —   who also include prominent Republicans such as Michael Chertoff, who led the Department of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush, and Paul D. Wolfowitz, Mr. Bush’s deputy secretary of defense  —   add that Mr. Trump should “pledge that he will divest himself of his overseas business interests should he win the presidency. ” In a comment after this article was published, Jason Miller, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, singled out one of the letter’s relatively   signers for criticism, without directly addressing the substance of the letter. “If Wendy Sherman is the definition of who is considered a reliable government official, this letter and its signatories lose all credibility,” Mr. Miller said. “Sherman was appointed to the State Department by Hillary Clinton during her disastrous tenure and was the lead negotiator in opening up Iran —  the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism —  for business, ultimately funding terrorist activities and exporting violence around the world. ” He added, “Based on her complete failure in representing American foreign policy and deep ties to Secretary Clinton, this letter epitomizes the rigged system in Washington that has continued to fail Americans over and over again. ” Mrs. Clinton’s husband, former President Bill Clinton, recently announced changes that would take place at the Clinton Foundation, which relies heavily on foreign donations, in an effort to eliminate the potential for the appearance of conflicts of interest if she becomes president. Those changes were announced after Mrs. Clinton faced intense scrutiny, including from Mr. Trump, over the foundation’s foreign donations. Mr. Morell, a supporter of Mrs. Clinton who worked with her while she was secretary of state, said he and Mr. Vickers sought the letter after Newsweek reported that Mr. Trump has had business dealings with questionable figures in China, India and Russia, and claimed to have had negotiations with Col. Muammar   before he was toppled as the dictator of Libya. “On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump has repeatedly praised Vladimir Putin’s authoritarian leadership, while outlining policies that read like a Kremlin wish list,” the letter reads, referring to the president of Russia. “He has claimed that Putin would never invade Ukraine, suggested permanently ceding Crimea to Russia and placed conditions on upholding our obligation to protect our NATO allies,” according to the letter. “He has floated lifting sanctions against Russia, which would benefit both Putin and the Trump Organization. ” The signers wrote that the next president would take office at a complicated moment globally, adding: “Our policies must be motivated exclusively by what is in America’s best interest, not by the financial interests of our president. The onus is on Donald Trump to assure voters that this will be the case by disclosing the nature of his overseas relationships and committing to divest such assets. ”",0

8170,"Thanks To Recreational Marijuana Being Passed, Californians’ Former Charges Are Being Downgraded","Thanks To Recreational Marijuana Being Passed, Californians' Former Charges Are Being Downgraded Nov 16, 2016 0 0 
On the night of the presidential election, many things in our country changed. One of the big winners was marijuana as four new states passed legislation that now allows for recreational marijuana. Those included are Massachusetts, Maine, Nevada and California . With the new law, a person can grow up to 6 plants. 
Since the laws went into effect the very next day, many people who have been charged with marijuana-related crimes are now finding themselves in unfamiliar, but fortunate territory. 
According to South California Public Radio , attorney Bruce Margolin said: 
“People with possession for sale, possession with the intent to sell, transportation or giving away more than an ounce, or sale of cannabis, would normally face prison time from three to four years. However, now it’s been reduced to six months in jail, maximum, and a $500 fine, or both.” 
The Drug Policy Alliance states that over 11,000 people are arrested each year with cannabis-related charges. Part of the Alliances push for the law changing to recreational use is that it would positively impact the lives of these people who were charged with these “crimes.” Such non-violent crimes should not ruin a person’s life. 
These new laws help to bring this specific issue into focus and will likely be a hot topic around this issue for some time to come. 
What should be acceptable for marijuana related charges? In what ways should these charges affect a person’s life and their job? If it was a non-violent act, should the charges be less? Should some charges that were filed before the new legislation be entirely dropped? Which ones specifically? All of these questions are what lawyers, courts and defendants are now facing. 
However, the new laws are still confusing to even lawyers and the courts. Margolin also said: 
“They don’t know what’s going on. It’s like deer with headlights on them.” 
While there have yet to be any official reports such as this one, it can be assumed that people and the courts in Massachusetts, Nevada and Maine are experiencing the same challenges in adapting to the new norm. 
Other winners in the marijuana legislation on election night were Florida, Arkansas and North Dakota, as they approved medical marijuana laws. The 2016 Election was a game-changer for cannabis. 
What do you think about the new laws being passed in these states? How should these laws affect a person’s life moving forward? Should there be any special consideration for those with children? In what ways do you see the new laws affecting society in general in those states? How soon will the rest of the nation follow suit now that 8 states, including the biggest one in the U.S. has now passed laws allowing recreational marijuana? At what point does industrial hemp come into the picture?

8171,Republicans Start Lining Up to Fight for the N.E.A. and N.E.H. - The New York Times,"At first blush it’s like a dream come true for conservatives: Donald J. Trump has become the first president to formally propose eliminating federal programs for the arts and humanities, which have long been in the cross hairs of Republicans, and the threat is all the more real because the party also controls Congress. “The lord has been good to me late in life, my friend,” Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative firebrand, said in an interview this week about the president’s assault on the National Endowment for the Arts, which Mr. Buchanan railed against during his insurgent run for president in 1992. But even with   control in Washington, the fates of the arts endowment and the National Endowment for the Humanities are far from sealed. Several key Republican lawmakers are expressing support for the programs, which, since their   experiences during the culture wars of a generation ago, have taken pains to counter accusations of coastal elitism by making sure to distribute their grants widely across all 50 states. And the contours of the political battle itself have changed since those earlier fights in the 1980s and ’90s. The arguments then were over ideology, taste, free speech and the size of government today they are about economic investment, federal priorities and how people feel about Mr. Trump remaking America to his liking. Senator Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican who is the chairwoman of a crucial Senate appropriations panel that oversees the endowments, said in a statement, “I believe we can find a way to commit to fiscal responsibility while continuing to support the important benefits that N. E. A. and N. E. H. provide. ” Her backing, like that of some other Republicans, comes after years of federal funds have flowed to artists in her state. Since 1995, the endowment has sent more than $18 million in grants to Alaska  —   a state which, partly because of its small population, ranks near the top when it comes to arts grants per capita. Two other Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, signed their names last month to a letter urging continued support for the endowments, which together get $300 million a year. A spokeswoman for Senator Capito, who is on the appropriations committee, said Friday that she would “advocate for her priorities, including funding for the arts and humanities, which are important to our economy and communities. ” And there were warm words among some Republicans in the House as well. Representative Mark Amodei, a Nevada Republican who is on the House appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over the endowments budget, said in a statement, “I support the present level of funding for these programs. ” The chairman of that House panel is Representative Ken Calvert, a California Republican. He said in a statement that with the government approaching $20 trillion in debt, he would take “all sides into account” as he works on the budget  —   but added that he recognized that “the N. E. A. and N. E. H. have a lot of support from the American people and members of Congress. ” The fight for the future of the endowments differs from those in the past. When the Reagan administration considered eliminating the arts endowment, officials backed off after the actor Charlton Heston, a conservative who was close to the president, and powerful board members of cultural institutions made the case for the arts. As the arts endowment came under attack during the culture wars of the 1990s  —   House Republicans voted to abolish it at one point  —   the agency changed the way it operated. The endowment abolished grants to individual artists, whose work could be  provocative  —   and labeled offensive by some conservatives, causing free speech fights. And the agency began sending 40 percent of its money directly to states arts agencies to decide how to distribute. The result is that the arts endowment now sends grants to every Congressional district in the nation: In 2016, the agency said, it recommended 2, 400 grants in 16, 000 communities. That could make it harder for members of Congress to kill it, since doing so would cost their districts money. But the new paradigm also means that the money is spread so thin, with the awarding of many small grants, that it could bolster the arguments of opponents of the endowment who say the lost money could be made up elsewhere. Proponents of preserving endowment grants are increasingly speaking of them in terms that many Republicans can love  —   as investments that spur job creation as   partnerships that award grants that are matched by private donations and as programs that help returning veterans or people who live in rural communities. Representative Leonard Lance, a New Jersey Republican who is   of the Congressional Arts Caucus, said that as he tries to marshal support for the arts endowment among his colleagues, he is focusing on the jobs it supports not just in the arts sector but in tourism, restaurants and other fields as well. “I will try to be persuasive that there is a tremendous multiplier effect  —   that this brings in revenue to the government,” he said. Mick Mulvaney, the president’s budget director, said at a news conference on Thursday that President Trump had “completely defensible” reasons for wanting to “defund” the two endowments, along with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. “I put myself in the shoes of that steelworker in Ohio,” Mr. Mulvaney said. “The coal miner  —   the   family in West Virginia. The mother of two in Detroit. And I’m saying, ‘O. K. I have to go ask these folks for money and I have to tell them where I’m going to spend it.’ Can I really go to those folks, look them in the eye, and say, ‘Look, I want to take money from you and I want to give it to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting’? ” (The corporation sent $11. 8 million to radio and television stations in Ohio $1. 6 million to stations in West Virginia and $9. 1 million to stations in Michigan in 2014, the last year for which a    breakdown was available on its website.) Members of Congress will hear next week from hundreds of activists who were already planning to gather in Washington on Monday and Tuesday to lobby for the arts. The announcement that the president is seeking to eliminate the endowments gave them a sense of added urgency, if not emergency. Robert L. Lynch, the president of Americans for the Arts, an arts advocacy group that has been a player in past battles to save the endowment, said, “We will hit every congressional office, every senatorial office, with our message. ” Even some opponents of the endowments concede that they have a fight on their hands. Mr. Buchanan  —   who once described the arts agency as “the upholstered playpen of the arts and crafts auxiliary of the Eastern liberal establishment”  —   said that he gave President Trump credit for trying to eliminate it, but that its demise was far from assured. “My guess is  —   and it always happens  —   that you come out very strong on the opening day,” he said, “and the arts community and the others will get to the Republicans and others and try to at least preserve these and keep them alive through the Trump era. ”",0
8172,Cardinal Robert Sarah: Criticisms of Pope Benedict XVI Are ‘Diabolical’,"Outspoken African Cardinal Robert Sarah has reacted fiercely to detractors of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, accusing them of “vulgarity and baseness” in their criticisms of the former pope’s afterword to the cardinal’s latest book. [“The arrogance, the violence of language, the disrespect and the inhuman contempt for Benedict XVI are diabolical and cover the Church with a mantle of sadness and shame,” Cardinal Sarah said.  “These people demolish the Church and its profound nature,” he added. Critics of Benedict XVI have complained that the former Pontiff meddled in Church affairs by contributing the afterword to the German edition of the book, in which Benedict praises Cardinal Sarah and thanks Pope Francis for appointing the African prelate to his current post as prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship. In his afterword to Cardinal Sarah’s book, The Power of Silence: Against the Dictatorship of Noise, Benedict XVI wrote that the liturgy is in “good hands” with the Guinean cardinal, while also praising Sarah for his prayer life. Sarah, Benedict writes, speaks “out of the depths of silence with the Lord, out of his interior union with him, and thus really has something to say to each one of us. ” “We should be grateful to Pope Francis for appointing such a spiritual teacher as head of the congregation that is responsible for the celebration of the liturgy in the Church,” Benedict writes. The last line of the afterword reads, “With Cardinal Sarah, a master of silence and of interior prayer, the liturgy is in good hands. ” Critics were quick to accuse the former pope of interfering in Church politics and trying to undermine Pope Francis. One, the Italian liturgist Andrea Grillo, a longtime detractor of Pope Benedict, claims that the former pope has behaved in a “scandalous way” by writing the afterword in praise of Cardinal Sarah and his book, accusing him of “clericalism” and “hypocrisy. ” “It’s as if Ratzinger suddenly renounced his renunciation and wishes to influence the decisions of his successor,” Grillo declared. Throughout his diatribe, Grillo refuses to call Benedict by his correct title, but insists on referring to him simply as “Ratzinger” or “emeritus bishop. ” Cardinal Sarah’s sharp reaction to Benedict’s critics echoes prior statements from the prelate, who never minces words. At a Washington prayer breakfast in May, 2016, the Vatican cardinal denounced   marriage, transgender bathroom laws, and attacks on the family as “demonic. ” In his powerful address, Sarah said that these are “portentous times” for the Church and for the world, while slamming gender theory as “ideological colonization” and decrying the “insidious” dismantling of religious freedom in the United States. Regarding   marriage, Sarah said that what is at stake is not an ideological war about “abstract ideas” but rather the protection of “ourselves, children, and future generations from a demonic ideology that says children do not need mothers and fathers. ” This earned the Guinean cardinal the enduring hostility of gay activists, one of whom has referred to him as “one of the shrillest voices against ‘gender ideology,’   marriage, abortion, contraception and other   attacks on the family. ” The African prelate, who has been dubbed “a standard bearer for Catholic orthodoxy,” was the world’s youngest bishop in 1979, when Pope John Paul II summoned him to don the miter at only 34 years of age. He is now one of the most important cardinals in the Church, as the prefect of the Vatican Congregation for Divine Worship, and his name often comes up on the short list of “papabili” —  or papal candidates to eventually succeed Pope Francis.

8174,How High Blood Pressure May Hurt Children’s Brains - The New York Times,"Increasing numbers of children have high blood pressure, largely as a consequence of their obesity. A growing body of evidence suggests that high blood pressure may impair children’s cognitive skills, reducing their ability to remember, pay attention and organize facts. In the most comprehensive study to date, published on Thursday in The Journal of Pediatrics, 75 children ages 10 to 18 with untreated high blood pressure performed worse on several tests of cognitive function, compared with 75 peers who had normal blood pressure. The differences were subtle, and the new research does not prove that high blood pressure diminishes cognitive skills in children. Still, the findings set off alarm bells among some experts. “This study really shows there are some differences,” said Dr. David B. Kershaw, the director of pediatric nephrology at C. S. Mott Children’s Hospital at the University of Michigan, who was not involved with the research. “This was not just random chance. ” Dr. Marc B. Lande, a professor of pediatric nephrology at the University of Rochester Medical Center, and his colleagues had children tested at four sites in three states, matching those with and without high blood pressure by age, maternal education, race, obesity levels and other factors. The researchers excluded children with learning disabilities and sleep problems, which can affect cognitive skills. Children with elevated blood pressure performed worse than their peers on tests of memory, processing speed and verbal skills, the researchers found. But all the scores were still in the normal range. Because of increased obesity, elevated blood pressure, also called hypertension, is no longer rare in children, though it is underdiagnosed. In a recent survey, about 3. 5 percent of 14, 187 children ages 3 to 18 had hypertension. “Most people don’t understand that cardiovascular risk factors  —   in this case, hypertension  —   can affect thinking and memory, and certainly they don’t think there could be an effect in childhood,” said Dr. Kristine Yaffe, a professor of psychiatry, neurology and epidemiology at the University of California, San Francisco, who has researched the effects of cardiovascular risk factors on cognition. Dr. Lande and his colleagues noted that children with high blood pressure tended to have other risk factors that might negatively affect cognition, including insulin resistance and obstructive sleep apnea. Children who had a formal diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea were excluded from the new study, but some adolescents with poor sleep participated. Dr. Lande said the study found “that the presence of hypertension made the effect of poor sleep on cognition even worse. ” Lower scores on cognitive tests do not necessarily indicate that a child is struggling in everyday life, experts cautioned. “Yes, there are certain differences, but what they mean in terms of life functioning isn’t clear,” said Dr. Julie R. Ingelfinger, a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and a senior consultant in nephrology at Massachusetts General Hospital. But, she added, “We know from other studies that problems with memory, attention and cognitive function have a lot to do with how well you do in your job and at school. ” Children may be uniquely susceptible to cognitive deficits, Dr. Kershaw said. “One of my concerns is, if you have high blood pressure and you’re 10 to 18 years old, it may impact your cognitive function more than if you’re 40 or 50,” he said. The areas of the brain that control executive function mature until a person’s early 20s. So the idea is that perhaps hypertension could hinder that function, Dr. Kershaw said. Observational studies have shown that having high blood pressure in one’s early 40s to 60s increases the risk of cognitive decline later in life. Clinical trials have not shown, however, that controlling high blood pressure with drugs or lifestyle changes can prevent cognitive problems. More research is needed to decipher whether treating children who have high blood pressure with dietary changes, exercise or medication could improve their cognitive ability. The work is already underway: The 75 children with hypertension in the latest study are being treated and followed for a year. The last child will finish the study early next year, Dr. Lande said. “Then we’ll be able to know if subtle neurocognitive differences between hypertensive kids and the controls go away with treatment or not,” he said. Dr. Ingelfinger applauded the “carefully done” research, but said she was more interested in seeing the   research. “The most important thing is, if blood pressure is controlled, do these cognitive changes go away?”",0
8175,"Merkel Warned Support Being ’Destroyed’ by Failure to Deport 500,000 Asylum Seekers","German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been warned public support is being “destroyed” by the fact her government has so far failed to deport half a million rejected asylum seekers.[  Friedrich, an MP for the Bavarian Christian Social Union, Mrs. Merkel’s sister party, said the German people were losing confidence in the government because so many asylum seekers were able to “dance around the state”.  Meanwhile, Rainer Wendt, head of the federal police trade union, warned: “There is a deportation prevention industry, which must be changed urgently. ” Figures published by the German parliament on Monday showed a total of 556, 499 failed asylum seekers have stayed on in the country, with four in five residing in the country for more than six years, thus granting them extra rights. The Times reports around half are officially stateless, have medical conditions, or would not be accepted back into their home country, giving them a right to stay indefinitely. Others simply stayed in illegally or claimed to have no identity papers. Of the half a million failed asylum seekers, 77, 000 are from Turkey, 68, 000 from Kosovo, 50, 000 from Serbia, and 33, 000 from Afghanistan. “Allowing rejected asylum seekers to dance around the state like this is destroying the confidence of citizens in the capacity of the state to act,” said Mr. Friedrich, who also previously served as interior minister. Breitbart London reported last month on figures that showed some 99 per cent of migrants granted asylum in Germany were allowed to stay permanently. An investigation by Die Welt found that although asylum is granted for a period of three years under the Geneva Convention, nearly all German migrants granted asylum are allowed to stay indefinitely. Despite an attempt to tighten up residency permits last year, leave the stay is granted much more quickly in Germany than in other European Union states.",0

FOX NEWS: TUCKER CARLSON TO MOVE TO 8PM SLOT, THE FIVE SHIFTS TO 9PM pic. twitter.   —   Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) April 19, 2017,  *** The Murdoch family has reportedly decided to pull The O’Reilly Factor off air amid allegations of sexual harassment against   host Bill O’Reilly, and will soon be officially announcing his departure, according to sources close to Gabriel Sherman in New York magazine. According to Sherman, the decision was primarily driven by Rupert Murdoch’s sons, James and Lachlan, after The New York Times reported earlier this month that $13 million has been paid out from either Fox News or O’Reilly to five women to settle their sexual harassment claims against the host in lieu of litigation, despite O’Reilly’s denying the veracity of their claims. Fox News executives are reportedly meeting on Wednesday to discuss how to contain any damage from an O’Reilly dismissal. O’Reilly, who is currently on vacation, has hosted the network’s most popular show  —   The O’Reilly Factor  —   since the network’s inception in 1996 and remains the country’s   cable news host. Sherman reports that “the board of Fox News’ parent company, 21st Century Fox, is scheduled to meet on Thursday to discuss the matter. ” Decisions are now being made as to whether O’Reilly will be allowed a final show to bid farewell to his audience. They are also discussing the terms of his release, with O’Reilly recently having signed a new   $20 million a year contract. Executives within the company are also discussing who will fill O’Reilly’s primetime 8 pm slot, with hosts such as Eric Bolling, Dana Perino, and Tucker Carlson currently under consideration. Over 90 companies dropped advertising on The O’Reilly Factor over the allegations, while a small group of feminist protesters gathered outside the Fox News headquarters in New York calling on the network to fire O’Reilly. Last year, Fox News’ longtime chairman Roger Ailes resigned over claims of sexual harassment against several female staff members, including former hosts Gretchen Carlson and Megyn Kelly.

8177,New Report Finds Voters Have No Idea How Outraged They Supposed To Be About Anything Anymore - The Onion - America's Finest News Source,"New Report Finds Voters Have No Idea How Outraged They Supposed To Be About Anything Anymore Close Vol 52 Issue 43 · Politics · Election 2016 
WASHINGTON—Saying that at this point, they were just taking their best guesses at how they should react to each new scandal that emerged about the presidential nominees, voters across the country admitted Monday they had no clue how outraged they are supposed to be about anything anymore. “It seems like there’s a new revelation that comes out each day about Trump or Hillary, and to be honest, I couldn’t even begin to tell you which ones I should just shake my head at and which ones are worth actually getting worked up about,” said Tempe, AZ voter Jeffrey Wilborne, who noted that between the recent breaking news alerts he received about the FBI reopening an investigation into Clinton’s emails just days ahead of the election and the barrage of apoplectic posts from friends on Facebook aimed at either the Democratic candidate or the FBI director, it was hard enough to tell which side to actually be resentful toward, let alone how angry to get. “I felt like it was pretty clear that I should be mad at Trump for what he said on that bus and at Hillary for telling Wall Street completely different things than she was telling us. But what about all that Clinton Foundation stuff? Should I be furious or just let that slide? I’m completely lost over here.” At press time, the nation’s electorate had settled on being completely apathetic to everything from here on out. Share This Story: Sign up For The Onion's Newsletter

8179,Texas County Uses Paper Ballots After Electronic Voting Glitch,"Email 
Chambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne announced that all early voting in the county was once again on the iVotronic machines after one day of early voting using paper ballots. The emergency usage of paper ballots took place on Tuesday, October 25 while a software problem was being resolved. The vendor corrected the problem and reinstalled the corrected configuration in time for all ballots the next day, according to Hawthorne in a press release on October 27. 
The situation was recounted by ABC 12 News: An error in the voting machine programming by Election Systems & Software (ES&S) caused votes for one statewide court of appeals race not to be entered when a voter tried to vote straight ticket in either party according to a release from Chambers County. 
Chambers County, Texas, is a small county, having only 13 precincts and only four early-voting locations. County Clerk Heather Hawthorne told The New American 1,801 ballots were cast before switching to the paper ballots. Some of those 1,801 voters were warned to double check their ballots due to the software glitch. Because Chambers County is a Republican stronghold, the Republican candidate will be more adversely affected than the Democratic candidate by unintended under-votes. The question is how many unintended under-votes were there for these candidates and how close will that contest be? 
There was a similar ballot problem in 2010 in Travis County, Texas, although the 2010 error was made on the paper ballots. A number of military absentee voters who were bona fide Texas residents were accidentally sent ballots for federal overseas voters. The ballots for federal overseas voters did not include local contests, such as ones for the Texas House of Representatives, and it was impossible to vote for that contest using the ballots provided. Republican Dan Neil lost by 16 votes. The final vote total was Donna Howard (D) 25,026, Dan Neil (R) 25,010 and Ben Easton (L) 1,518. Neil challenged the election total for a number of reasons, in addition to the ballot format, but the Texas Legislature, even though it was supposedly solidly Republican, seated Howard even though a very common practice in such close elections is to seat neither candidate, pay both candidates, and give both candidates equal access to the building and caucuses while the dispute is resolved or a new election is called. 
In this case in Chambers County, the affected contest is a judicial contest. Hopefully, it will not be as close as the House District 48 race in 2010. 
The voters who were affected by the Chambers County computer glitch were fortunate the errors were obvious enough for voters to notice and bring to the attention of the election officials. How many errors go undetected because they are not obvious to the voters or the election processes are not transparent? Errors such as this serve as a reminder of how important it is that voting have a paper trail and be a transparent process with plenty of paper documentation in case it becomes necessary to reconstruct precinct vote totals or other vital election records.

8180,Clinton cronies steered millions to foundation — and Bill’s wallet,"Email 

Two Bill Clinton cronies used their private consulting firm to steer millions in business to the former president while raising funds for the Clinton Foundation — and even called the arrangement “Bill Clinton Inc.” 
Doug Band, a top Clinton aide, detailed the complex financial arrangement between his company, Teneo, and the foundation in a memo contained in hacked e-mails released Wednesday by WikiLeaks. 
“Teneo partners have raised in excess of $8 million for the foundation, more than $5.25 million of which is in the bank,” the memo reads. 
“Teneo partners also have generated over $3 million in paid speeches for President Clinton, $1.25 million of which has been paid to him thus far.” 
The consulting company was formed by Band and former State Department envoy Declan Kelly. The memo about its activities shows the incestuous relationship between the foundation and the private business interests of the former president. 
In one arrangement, Kelly introduced Bob McCann, the head of UBS Wealth Management, to Clinton at an event in 2009. 
After the meeting, McCann donated hundreds of thousands to the foundation while inviting Clinton to give several paid speeches. 
Another arrangement involved the Laureate Foundation, which donated more than $1 million to the Clinton Global Initiative. 
Laureate was a “personal advisory services business,” the memo said, paying Clinton “$3.5 million annually to provide advice and serve as their honorary chairman.” 
The cozy relationship with the Clintons put the Baltimore-based Laureate at high-profile events with international players who could help it expand its reach around the globe. 
The Band memo also includes a section about “For-Profit Activity of President Clinton (i.e., Bill Clinton Inc.).” 
Some of the speeches “secured” by Teneo include two $450,000 addresses delivered to UBS in 2011 and 2012, as well as a commitment for three additional paid speeches, if he chose to give them. 
Another secured event was a $1 million fee for Clinton to speak at two one-hour sessions during an event in Hong Kong. The fee included $400,000 for a private plane. 
“Since 2001, President Clinton’s business arrangements have yielded more than $30 million for him personally, with $66 million to be paid out over the next nine years should he choose to continue with the current engagements,” the memo reads. 
The relationship between Band and the donors was criticized harshly by daughter Chelsea Clinton in another e-mail. 
Chelsea specifically called out Band and Teneo for “hustling’” business opportunities out of the foundation. 
“I continue to want — and to try — to disintermediate myself from this muddle, edify the corporate audit and existential process we are in — while also being a responsible board member, daughter and person,” Chelsea wrote in the 2011 e-mail. 
The relationship between foundation donors and Hillary Clinton’s State Department was raised through e-mails obtained by Citizens United in which top Hillary aide Huma Abedin appeared to vet donors’ access to the Clintons based on their links to the CGI. 
In a December 2012 e-mail in which a CGI official asks for Band and a few others to meet with Hillary during a trip to Ireland, Abedin writes to Band, “Are these legit cgi people?”",0
8181,Clues to the Mystery of Prince’s Final Days - The New York Times,"MINNEAPOLIS  —   The 1988 Dassault Falcon 900 was about an hour into its flight from Atlanta in the wee hours of Friday, April 15, when the pilot made a distress call to air traffic controllers in Chicago. There was a medical emergency on board. A male passenger was unresponsive. And so the Chicago airport officials diverted the flight for an emergency landing in Moline, Ill. just 48 minutes from its intended destination of Minneapolis. As it turned out, the flight was carrying the musical genius Prince, who, a week later, would be found dead, collapsed in an elevator on the first floor of his suburban Minneapolis compound. “We had an emergency unscheduled landing at 1:35 a. m. on April 15 for a medical emergency for an unresponsive person,” said Jo Johnson, the human resource manager for Quad Cities International Airport in Moline. It remains unclear what caused Prince, 57, to become unresponsive on the flight last week. His publicist has attributed the crisis to the fact that the entertainer was “fighting the flu. ” But officials investigating Prince’s sudden death said Friday that the plane’s emergency landing, and what caused it, would be part of their sweeping inquiry. Prince spent only a few hours at a Moline hospital before his private jet flew home here, and the entertainer resumed life at his compound in nearby Carver County. Just days before his death, he attended a show at a local jazz club, and playfully showed off his new piano and guitar at a party at his studio. As law enforcement officials await the complete results of an autopsy performed Friday, they said they would be reviewing local pharmaceutical records as part of a broad effort to understand Prince’s full medical history. They declined to comment on reports that Prince had been taking pain medication, saying the investigation was continuing. “This is a tragedy for all of us,” said Jim Olson, the sheriff of Carver County, where Prince’s estate, Paisley Park, was located in the town of Chanhassen. “To you, Prince Rogers Nelson was a celebrity. To us, he was a community member and a good neighbor. ” Prince was last seen alive at about 8 p. m. on Wednesday evening when someone dropped him off at his estate, where he lived alone, Sheriff Olson said during the afternoon news conference. Unable to make contact with Prince on Thursday morning, Paisley Park staff members went looking for him in the sprawling compound. They found him unresponsive in an elevator and called 911 at 9:43 a. m. Sheriff Olson said. “The person is dead here,” a male caller told the dispatcher, according to a transcript of the 911 call. Later, the caller added, “And the people are just distraught. ” Medics responding to the home could not resuscitate Prince, who was pronounced dead at 10:07 a. m. Thursday, Sheriff Olson said. He was not sure, he said, how long Prince, dressed in a shirt and pants, had been collapsed in the elevator. There were no obvious signs of injuries, and Sheriff Olson said the death was not believed to be a murder or a suicide. Officials said the body had been released to Prince’s family but that it may be weeks before any details from the autopsy are released. Before that, further tests need to be completed and the medical history must be compiled. There remain many questions around Prince’s health. Sheila E, a friend who collaborated with Prince, said during an interview with ABC’s “Good Morning America” that the star did have hip problems from his performances onstage. He has said in interviews that he struggled with epilepsy as a child. The mystery of the end of Prince’s life has left his vast legion of supporters measuring their shock. As they wait for answers, fans around the world grieved and celebrated his life with the frenetic energy with which Prince lived it  —   with dance parties and widespread tributes, from social media posts to impromptu Broadway performances. Here in his hometown, the famed First Avenue dance club held a free overnight dance party from Thursday into Friday, with more scheduled through the weekend. Makeshift memorials popped up outside of the club and in front of Paisley Park. Billboards encouraged residents to wear purple, a major bridge was lit in the color and a purple orchid with a note that read “Rest In Peace Prince” lay on the   table of the intimate Dakota Jazz Club where Prince sat when he attended a show there on Tuesday. “It’s a very somber moment here, but his legacy will live on,” Kinneva Brown said as she visited Paisley Park on Friday. Those who knew him and saw him in his final days said the master showman betrayed no sign that he was near death. With his Afro picked out, Prince hopped on stage before about 300 revelers last Saturday  —   the night after his emergency landing in Moline  —   at one of the   parties he was famous for throwing at Paisley Park. He banged out a quick performance of “Chopsticks” on his new purple piano, Scott Lawrence, who was in attendance with his son, said. He then broke out a new    Gus Guitar, placing it on the piano and then moving away. “It’s too cool to open up,” Prince joked, according to Mr. Lawrence. But the   star also offered a few accidentally prescient words, Mr. Lawrence recalled. “Wait a few days before you waste your prayers,” he told the crowd, referring to reports of his medical emergency from the previous day. Close followers of Prince find it hard to believe that anything sinister could have played into his death. He was a Jehovah’s Witness and obsessively healthy eater. You couldn’t drink, smoke or even curse at his Paisley parties. “Better eat your cheeseburger before you get to Paisley,” Van Jones, a political commentator and activist who was a friend of Prince’s, said he used to think before visiting Prince. Last Saturday, Prince stopped by Electric Fetus, a Minneapolis record store, and bought about half a dozen CDs, said Bob Fuchs, the retail manager. Prince had been coming to the store for 30 years, Mr. Fuchs said, and nothing on this visit seemed out of the ordinary. “Thanks for your support,” Mr. Fuchs recalled telling Prince, referring to something the musician had been helping the store with. “He smiled and said ‘Hello’ and ‘You’re welcome. ’” “He looked very alert and well dressed,” Mr. Fuchs added. “He seemed the same old. I did not think anything about the way he looked. Nothing suggested to me anything different. ”",0
8182,"Russia Vetoes U.N. Draft Resolution Condemning Chemical Attack in Syria, China Abstains","After spending days claiming it would welcome United Nations involvement in the Syrian chemical weapons attack, Russia used its veto power on the U. N. Security Council to block a resolution condemning the attack and calling for its perpetrators to be brought to justice. [China abstained from the vote instead of voting “no,” a decision President Donald Trump praised as “wonderful” and a sign of progress in U. S.  relations since China generally votes with Russia on Syrian affairs.  China’s U. N. ambassador, Liu Jieyi, said the resolution could be “amended” into a form China would vote for and said it was his country’s “longstanding hope that the Security Council can speak with one voice on Syria. ” “With its veto, Russia said no to accountability. Russia once again has chosen to side with Assad, even as the rest of the world, overwhelmingly comes together to condemn this murderous regime,” said the American ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley. “You are isolating yourselves from the international community every time one of Assad’s planes drop another barrel bomb on civilians and every time Assad tries to starve another community to death,” Haley told the Russians. The UK Daily Mail reports on a dramatic confrontation between Russian deputy ambassador Vladimir Safronkov and British ambassador Matthew Rycroft at the U. N. that reportedly occurred on Wednesday night. “Time and time again, Russia has abused its veto protect the regime and to defend its use of chemical weapons,” said Rycroft. “What has Russia got in return for its seven vetoes in six years? Russia’s initiative in 2013 to dismantle Syria’s chemical weapons has been exposed as a shambles. Russian pride in the Astana process has been turned to humiliation and Russia’s credibility and reputation across the world have been poisoned by its toxic association with Assad. ” The “Astana process” is a reference to   Syria peace talks held in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan. Safronkov exploded in a   rant at Rycroft, claiming that the United Kingdom was trying to undermine improving relations between the United States and Russia. “You’re losing sleep that we might be working together with the United States,   with the United States. That is what you fear,” Safronkov thundered at the British ambassador. “You’re doing everything to make sure this kind of cooperation is undermined. What have you done to advance a  ? You welcome various opposition groups in London and Paris, illegal armed groups. ” “Don’t you dare insult Russia again,” Safronkov reportedly told Rycroft, accusing him of “irresponsibility” and using “dirty language. ” At one point during his tirade, when Rycroft turned his attention elsewhere, the Russian deputy ambassador snapped, “Look at me. Don’t turn your eyes away. Why are you looking away?” Safronkov explained that the reason Russia vetoed the U. N. resolution was because it “appointed the guilty party prior to the investigation, prior to an independent and objective investigation,” an approach that was “incompatible with the legal norms. ” However, the U. N. resolution did not actually name the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad as the perpetrator of the attack. It condemned “the reported use of chemical weapons, in particular the attack on Khan Sheikhoun” and called upon the Syrian government to fully cooperate with an investigation by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The resolution, which was drafted by Britain, France, and the United States, would have obliged Syria to provide flight plans and details of air operations on the day of the chemical weapons attack, the names of its helicopter squadron commanders, and access to airbases from which the attack might have been launched. This was evidently the provision to which Russia objected most strongly. Safronkov’s accusation that the U. K. wanted to sabotage relations between Russia and the U. S. might seem odd, given the talk from both Washington and Moscow about how those relations have hit a   War low, but this is emerging as the official Russian narrative about the current diplomatic tension. For example, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Thursday that the Trump administration is under pressure from “those who want to prevent it from curing the wounds inflicted by Barack Obama’s administration, and are using the Russian card in internal political struggles. ” “It’s deplorable, and we regret what is going on, but we can do little except asking to back accusations with facts,” said Lavrov. “There hasn’t been a single fact, although under the pressure of President Donald Trump’s foes the White House has been forced to periodically make statements containing unfounded accusations against us. ”",0
8183,Bob Dole Worked Behind the Scenes on Trump-Taiwan Call - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Former Senator Bob Dole, acting as a foreign agent for the government of Taiwan, worked behind the scenes over the past six months to establish   contact between Taiwanese officials and   Donald J. Trump’s staff, an outreach effort that culminated last week in an unorthodox telephone call between Mr. Trump and Taiwan’s president. Mr. Dole, a lobbyist with the Washington law firm Alston  Bird, coordinated with Mr. Trump’s campaign and the transition team to set up a series of meetings between Mr. Trump’s advisers and officials in Taiwan, according to disclosure documents filed last week with the Justice Department. Mr. Dole also assisted in successful efforts by Taiwan to include language favorable to it in the Republican Party platform, according to the documents. Mr. Dole’s firm received $140, 000 from May to October for the work, the forms said. The disclosures suggest that   Trump’s decision to take a call from the president of Taiwan, Tsai   was less a   diplomatic gaffe and more the result of a   plan by Taiwan to use the election of a new president to deepen its relationship with the United States  —   with an assist from a seasoned lobbyist well versed in the machinery of Washington. “They’re very optimistic,” Mr. Dole said of the Taiwanese in an interview on Tuesday. “They see a new president, a Republican, and they’d like to develop a closer relationship. ” The United States’ One China policy is nearly four decades old, Mr. Dole said, referring to the policy established in 1979 that denies Taiwan official diplomatic recognition but maintains close contacts, promoting Taiwan’s democracy and selling it advanced military equipment. The phone call between Mr. Trump and Ms. Tsai was a striking break from nearly four decades of diplomatic practice and threatened to precipitate a major rift with China, which admonished Mr. Trump in a   editorial in the overseas edition of People’s Daily. The disclosure documents were submitted before the call took place and made no mention of it. But Mr. Dole, 93, a former Senate majority leader from Kansas, said he had worked with transition officials to facilitate the conversation. “It’s fair to say that we had some influence,” he said. “When you represent a client and they make requests, you’re supposed to respond. ” Officials on Mr. Trump’s transition team did not respond to requests for comment. The documents suggest that Mr. Dole helped the government of Taiwan establish early access to Mr. Trump’s inner circle during the campaign, when Mr. Dole worked to involve Mr. Trump’s aides in a United States delegation to Taiwan and to facilitate a Taiwanese delegation to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July. The effort has continued in the weeks since the election, with Mr. Dole on Tuesday saying he was trying to fulfill a request from a special envoy from Taiwan who was visiting Washington to see Reince Priebus, tapped by Mr. Trump to be White House chief of staff, and Newt Gingrich, who is close to the  . (The Priebus meeting, Mr. Dole said, would most likely have to wait until Mr. Trump is inaugurated.) Mr. Dole, the only former Republican presidential nominee to endorse Mr. Trump, arranged a meeting between Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, whom Mr. Trump has chosen to be his attorney general, and Stanley Kao, Taiwan’s envoy to the United States, and convened a meeting between Taiwanese officials and Mr. Trump’s transition team, the documents say. Mr. Dole, who said he first took an interest in Taiwan as a senator when Congress was considering the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act that established the current policy, has lobbied for the Taiwanese government for nearly two decades. In a letter in January, Mr. Dole laid out the terms of his agreement to represent the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States, Taiwan’s unofficial embassy, including a $25, 000 monthly retainer. That letter and the document detailing Mr. Dole’s work for the Taiwanese were filed at the Justice Department, which requires foreign agents to register and detail their efforts at influencing the United States government. Among his duties, the letter said, were helping Taiwan achieve its “military goals” and obtain membership in the   Partnership, the   trade deal that Mr. Trump has promised to withdraw from. Mr. Dole was also to arrange for Taiwanese officials to meet with members of Congress from both parties and arrange access to Republican presidential contenders and to the party’s national convention. The government of Taiwan has retained a powerful bipartisan constellation of former members of Congress to promote its interests in Washington. Richard A. Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat and former House majority leader, also signed a $   contract to represent the Taipei office this year, as did Thomas A. Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, a former Senate majority leader, in 2015. Mr. Trump’s transition team has sent mixed messages about the call with Ms. Tsai, whether it was meant as a mere gesture of good will or a provocation aimed at drawing Taiwan closer to the United States as a way of challenging China, which considers Taiwan a breakaway province. Vice   Mike Pence suggested in the days after the call that Mr. Trump had merely been affording a courtesy to another “democratically elected leader. ” But in a series of Twitter posts on Sunday, Mr. Trump suggested a more confrontational motive, criticizing China for unfair trade practices and aggressive military moves. “Did China ask us if it was OK” to take such actions, Mr. Trump asked rhetorically, appearing to counter suggestions that the United States must ask Beijing’s permission to communicate with Taiwan. Several senior advisers to Mr. Trump have long advocated stronger United States support for Taiwan, arguing that it would help to counterbalance Beijing’s influence. Alexander Grey and Peter Navarro, Trump transition advisers, wrote an article last month in Foreign Policy branding the Obama administration’s treatment of Taiwan “egregious. ” Over the weekend, Taiwan’s official Central News Agency said that Edward J. Feulner, a member of Mr. Trump’s transition team and the former president of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that supports stronger ties with Taiwan, had played a crucial role in bringing about the call with Mr. Trump. Mr. Feulner met with Ms. Tsai in Taiwan in October. Even before the phone call, Taiwan had succeeded in accomplishing important goals with Mr. Trump’s team. At their convention in Cleveland in July, Republicans adopted a platform that for the first time enshrined the “six assurances” to Taiwan made by President Ronald Reagan in 1982, including that the United States would not set a date for ending arms sales to the Taiwanese.",0
8184,For People Who Are Worried About Druckenmiller Selling His Gold…,"25 Views November 10, 2016 GOLD , KWN King World News 
For people who are worried about Druckenmiller selling his gold… 
Before we get to Druckenmiller selling his gold, look at the collapse in the 30-year bond market as interest rates continue to surge! A picture is worth a thousand words… 30-Year U.S. Treasuries Continue To Plunge Today, Hitting New Lows! 
By Bill Fleckenstein President Of Fleckenstein Capital November 10 ( King World News ) – I am going to stick with yesterday’s format and try to make sense of the market motion, then turn to the action lower in the column, and I’m doing this in response to all the questions I’ve been getting about how various markets can possibly do what they’re doing, i.e., why are they behaving as they are… IMPORTANT: To find out which company Doug Casey, Rick Rule and Sprott Asset Management are pounding the table on that already has a staggering 18.1 million ounces of gold that just added another massive deposit and is quickly being recognized as one of the greatest gold opportunities in the world – CLICK HERE OR BELOW: Sponsored 
Great Again: Well, That Didn’t Take Long In the first place, let’s be clear, this is all guesswork, and a lot of the motion is noise and the overlapping of extremely short-term time horizons with longer ones. Be that as it may, I will give it my best shot. What we have seen over the last 48 to 72 hours is a massive psychological sea-change — albeit, almost certainly temporary — from overwhelming pessimism to overwhelming optimism regarding the prospects for the U.S. economy and all things American. That has collided with fumes from QE here, and actual QE from other counties. Said differently, a massive change in psychology has collided with free money to spark euphoria, something that can generally only last a short time. 
As that begins to take place people begin to factor in all the things that can go right and very few of the things that can go wrong, though they don’t handicap the amount of time it takes to accomplish said things, nor the degree of difficulty in accomplishing them. For instance, if Congress magically passed a $1 trillion infrastructure project, it would take quite a good deal of time to get the permits and design what needs to happen before the first shovels hit the dirt, so to speak. Not to say that the consequences of doing the project wouldn’t be economically positive, but there is quite a long lag between planning to do it and actually starting it. 
That matters because, at the moment, the multiple on the stock market is very high (north of 20), and it is where it is because of zero-percent rates (and the ridiculous TINA rationale). As rates rise, that tends to put pressure on valuations while it potentially causes some TINA-driven buyers to think twice, especially if they start to lose money. Given my belief that the bond bull market is finished, and that a Trump administration would likely be very unfriendly to bonds, interest rates are headed higher, something that could really be exacerbated if people’s perceptions about inflation change. 
Buy and Hold On? The bottom line is, given the valuation of the stock market and the likely decline in bonds, it will be rather difficult for the stock market to trade on the potential for good news long enough for the good news to hit. Therefore, it is quite likely this could be the final equity market blow-off, however far it may go, sort of matching the bond blow-off of last summer. 
There is some precedent for just this sort of stock market action, as something similar occurred right after Ronald Reagan was elected. I touched on this yesterday (and please don’t send me any emails telling me Trump is not Reagan, I totally understand that), i.e., that we have a potential sea-change in psychology from a very negative macro outlook for the U.S. economy to one that is expected to be better. Again, that doesn’t necessarily translate to higher equity prices, due to the impact of rising rates on the current level of valuations to consider. Nonetheless, after Reagan was elected there was about a two-week 10% rally in the S&P, which then reversed and a substantial decline ensued. 
I believe if and when the stock market rally finally is perceived to have ended we could see a lot of destruction very fast, given the brittle structure that I have talked about ad nauseam. And of course a reversal in the stock market would probably impact the dollar (and metals) and we might even get a kneejerk reaction in bonds. 
Taking Some “You” Time Nearly all markets are currently in motion, so it is best to step back, try to figure out what is really going on, think about what you are looking for that would cause you to change any positions you have, but avoid taking any action unless you are fairly certain about what is happening and why. 
Beneath the surface of the stock market one can see that tech is being sold (that sector, especially FANG, has the highest multiples and therefore is the most vulnerable to a change in the bond market, plus a strong dollar hurts them), while “Trump plays” are being purchased. I don’t see how the market can readjust itself and really hold together because I don’t think there will be enough buyers of tech to accommodate the sellers, and thus the market overall could easily come under pressure fairly soon, but we will just have to see how that plays out. 
WallStreet.com Basically, while we’re in this period of quasi euphoria, the market for the moment is a concept stock, like biotech, and concept stocks don’t generally bother having fundamentals, nor do people worry about them until they do, and then they decline drastically as a consequence of basically being binary. 
With all of that out of the way I will turn to the action. Overnight the SPOOs were about 0.75% higher and the market itself was higher in the early going. We then got a quick reversal both lower then back higher, at least for the Dow (the S&P was up fractionally). The Nasdaq, however, kept leaking. By day’s end the former added over 1% while the latter lost 0.75%. 
Away from stocks, the euphoria playbook was in use and all the outside markets were very volatile, with green paper quite strong, while oil lost 1% and bonds were initially strong, then were beat up again. The 10-year lost another 8 basis points, as yields have now risen from 1.50% to 2.12% in five weeks. 
Precious metals gave up an overnight rally and were lower. Part of that was exacerbated by Stan Druckenmiller, who said he’d sold his gold into the election-night rally (I have covered that all in Ask Fleck). After going negative silver climbed back into positive territory, gaining 0.3%, while gold lost 1.5%. Included below are six questions and answers from the Q&A’s with Bill Fleckenstein. Bonus Q&A Question: Hi Fleck – Hope all is well and you are enjoying the interesting times we live in now. Forget Trump … let’s talk about the Indian PM who has overnight banned large currency notes and is forcing people to deposit them in lieu of newer notes. I feel that this will help to thwart black money (nearly $2 Trillion) and terrorist activities (fake notes etc.) and will also curb real estate prices. But this could change how people view Gold even more. I suspect many Indians now are conducting transactions in Gold (or Crypto currencies such as Bitcoin) which could elevate Gold demand. Import of gold in the form of coins and medallions is prohibited. Ah well, another interesting bit of info in the ever changing times we live in. Narendra Modi Bans India’s Largest Currency Bills in Bid to Cut Corruption Enjoy Answer from Fleck: “ I suspect this will boost gold demand, after the initial shakeout in a scramble for cash by real estate guys. How can anyone trust the government at all after this?” Question: Fleck, I find it odd that SLV has not broken it’s Tuesday low, 11-8-16, while GLD has. Makes me believe that the down move in GLD is just “noise” unless, or until, SLV closes below the Nov. 8th low. Is this how you “analyze” price movement in the precious metal’s complex; that is, waiting for all assets to show a confirmation in movement? Thanks Answer from Fleck: “ Silver is benefitting from being an “industrial” metal, too. That is part of the concept that is working right now.” Question: Hey Bill, 
1. In theory Trump should be good for ‘main street’ and I am wondering if this will cause inflation to tick higher? My inclination is that it will. 
2. In the overnight Gold futures market it seems to be trading strong and then loses that strength when the U.S. opens. My guess is that more spec. longs are unwinding and this should bring open interest down to a more normal level. I know you don’t regard the COT data as too meaningful but if Gold holds above $1,200 while spec. long open interest declines, would this be a good set up for the next leg higher? 
Thanks! Answer from Fleck: “ 1. Yes, plus psychology is changing. 2. There are many scenarios that could be positive, not just yours.” Druckenmiller Sells His Gold Question: As far as I know Soros does trade his positions whereas Druckenmiller keeps his positions for some time. What do you make of Stan selling all his gold? 
[Speaking to CNBC this morning, fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller – who had been pessimistic about the U.S. economy, said that he is now “quite, quite optimistic” on the U.S. economy following the election of President-elect Donald Trump. “It’s as hopeful as I’ve been in a long time.” 
“I sold all my gold on the night of the election.” Why? “All the reasons I owned it for the last couple of years seem to be ending”, namely, expectations that inflation is now set to spike, forcing money out of safe assets – like gold and Treasurys – and into the dollar.] Answer from Fleck: “ Druck is a trader and investor. Please see the other post on this topic.” Question: In India the gold prices have doubled in few cities due to the currency note issue. Wall Street and the moron Drunkenmiller does not have a clue. Chinese demand will also accelerate due to yuan fall. Gold demand is spiking up in Asia all over. Out of touch Wall Street can control the gold prices only for few days. If this continues I will load up gold bars here in America to sell in India and rest of the Asia. There are enough rich people in India who want gold. Maybe “Stan” should sell any coins left over to me. Answer from Fleck: “ You make worthwhile points about demand, but in the short run they can be “trumped” by the herd for a little while.” Question: Interesting….I don’t recall gold miners caring a hoot when Druckenmiller declared that he was long gold. Now that he says he’s out (of gold), they obediently pay attention??? Answer from Fleck: “ LOL, for this five minutes.” *** To subscribe to Bill Fleckenstein’s fascinating Daily Thoughts CLICK HERE.

8186,Donald Groped Hillary in 2005! Trump and Weiner Sext Each Other!,"Topics: anthony weiner , presidential politics , American Politics , Donald J. Trump , Groping , Clinton's emails Friday, 4 November 2016 
[ Associated Press, Washington, D.C. ] FBI Director James Comey informed members of Congress this morning that he was expanding his investigation into e-mails, based on materials found on the laptop of disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner. 
The materials include an e-mail from Trump to ""Carlos Danger,"" the on-line pseudonym which Weiner used, in which Trump bragged about groping then-Senator Clinton when she and former President Bill Clinton attended Trump's third wedding, to Melania Trump, at the billionaire's Mar-a-Lago estate in 2005. 
""There she was, her and Bill, smiling for the cameras, and all the time I had my hand on her ass,"" boasted Trump, according to Comey. 
Comey went on to state that Weiner's laptop contained ""sext"" messages from Weiner to Trump, containing photos of a bulge in the former Congressman's tidy whiteys, and messages back from Trump to Weiner, containing photos showing Trump's tiny hands gripping a large zucchini. 
Comey added that he, also, would be a subject of the ever-expanding investigation, because there were several selfies of himself on the laptop, including one in which he is posed sitting naked on a white horse with a garland of laurel on his brow, one of him dressed up to look like J. Edgar Hoover, in a dress, with the caption, ""Infallible ME!"" and a third one of him engaged in self-flagellation with a Cat'o Nine Tails.

8190,Victims in Istanbul Airport Attack Reflect City’s International Character - The New York Times,"ISTANBUL  —   One man worked as a Turkish translator and was escorting tourists back to the airport. One woman, an airport worker, was looking forward to her wedding in 10 days. There were taxi drivers and a customs officer. And there was a Turkish couple who worked together, and died together, in the suicide attack Tuesday night at Istanbul Ataturk Airport that killed dozens of people and wounded more than 200. As officials said on Wednesday that the death toll from the attack had risen to 41, details about the victims began trickling out. At least 23 of them were from Turkey, according to a Turkish official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the attack publicly. The victims reflected the cosmopolitan and international character of Istanbul, whose airport is among the world’s busiest, a hub for tens of millions of passengers connecting to Europe, the Middle East, Africa and beyond each year. Among the victims were five Saudis, two Iraqis and one citizen each from China, Iran, Jordan, Tunisia, Ukraine and Uzbekistan, the Turkish official said. Hours after the attack  —   which has not been claimed by any group, although Turkish officials said they suspected it was the work of the Islamic State  —   a limited number of flights resumed, and workers continued clearing debris and replacing shattered windows at the airport. Unlike Brussels, where a terrorist attack in March closed the airport for days, Istanbul appeared determined to get back to business as usual. Under a sunny sky on Wednesday morning, cars streamed into the airport’s international terminal, where the attack occurred, almost like on a normal weekday. But traces of the blasts lingered: Police tape marked off the site of one of the explosions on the lower arrivals area. And workers in yellow vests pounded long support bars into the concrete sidewalk, erecting a    metal fence dividing the road from the airport entrance. An elderly woman, who said she was a refugee from Afghanistan, sat on gravel in the shade, near a pile of her belongings, and watched them. Even as the airport reopened, scenes of grief played out at a nearby hospital. A young woman, wearing a brown and pink head scarf, rocked softly back and forth as an older woman embraced her, sobbing. The young woman’s husband was among the injured, and doctors had told her to prepare for the worst. “My God, why did you take him from me?” she said, her voice breaking. Those who survived spoke of panic and confusion, and of gunfire aimed directly at them. A young man said he was going through a metal detector on Tuesday night when he heard shooting. He said he came under fire as the assailants advanced, shooting. He saw one person fall to the ground and dove under the   machine. Adnan Ersoy, a    cabdriver at the hospital, said that three of his friends had been killed, and that eight had been wounded. “They were just taxi drivers,” he said. “Good people, people who were trying to survive and earn their money. ” Passengers making their way through the first airport security checkpoint on Wednesday seemed shaken. “It was only God’s grace that separated us from the tragedies that happened here,” said Tanika Golota, 26, a school counselor from Chicago, who was holding her    Mila. The Golotas, on their way home from a vacation in Portugal with a layover in Istanbul, had left the airport just 40 minutes before the explosion on Tuesday night. “You see it on TV and you know it happens, but we are naïve to the fact that it could happen to us,” she said. A majority of the victims appeared to be Muslims, either Turks or visitors from Muslim countries. If the bombings are confirmed to be the work of the Islamic State, it will show once again that the group, which portrays itself as defending Islam and fighting Western powers, kills far more Muslims than   on the battlefields of Iraq and Syria or in terrorist attacks in the region. The attack cast a pall over a city that until recently was brimming with   projecting itself as a rambunctious, multicultural hub for the arts, with great cuisine and a dazzling history as a former imperial capital. But a series of terrorist attacks over the last year, some attributed to the Islamic State and others to Kurdish militants, have destroyed Turkey’s image as a haven in a dangerous region, and they have damaged its   tourism industry. The chaos enveloping Turkey  —   including the attacks and an enormous influx of refugees that has strained resources  —   vividly illustrates how the civil war in Syria has rippled outward and destabilized neighboring countries. Turkey is grappling with growing domestic strains as well, with deep divisions between Islamists who support President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and secular and nationalist Turks who oppose what they regard as his increasingly authoritarian grip on power. Making matters worse, a war that Turkey had fought for more than three decades against Kurdish militants resumed last year, turning cities in the southeast into war zones. On Wednesday morning, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said that early indications suggested that the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL, was behind the latest attack, although officials had not released any information about the assailants by the afternoon. After other attacks, Turkish officials have equivocated, citing as potential culprits either the Islamic State or Kurdish militants. This, critics have said, provided the government with the pretext to crack down further on Kurdish militants, which has been a greater priority for Turkey than fighting the Islamic State. However, some analysts said the airport attack might be a   for Turkey’s approach to the Islamic State. The United States and other allies have accused Turkey of not doing enough to fight the militant group, and even of contributing to its rise by allowing fighters and weapons to pass through Turkish territory as part of a policy of supporting Syrian rebels. “I was impressed with the rapidity with which the government said it was Daesh,” said Soli Ozel, a Turkish columnist and professor at Kadir Has University in Istanbul, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. “It suggests to me that finally maybe they have learned what the hell they have done. ” John O. Brennan, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, said on Wednesday that the attack “bears the hallmark of ISIL’s depravity,” but he did not confirm that the group was responsible. Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, Mr. Brennan added that the Islamic State typically does not claim responsibility for attacks in Turkey in order to send the Turkish government a grim warning but not alienate sympathizers and potential recruits in the country. The attack came days after Turkey, which has suffered ruptures in relations with many of its neighbors in recent years, took steps to reconcile with Israel and Russia. Turkey’s relationship with Israel fell apart six years ago after Israel commandos stormed an aid flotilla bound for the Gaza Strip in violation of a blockade, killing several Turkish activists. In November, Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet that strayed into its airspace across the Syrian border, raising tensions to a boil. But Mr. Erdogan sent a letter to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, this week expressing remorse for shooting down the jet, and on Wednesday, the two leaders spoke by telephone. At least part of the reason for patching up relations with Israel and Russia was to help improve Turkey’s beleaguered tourism industry, and it bore quick results: On Wednesday, Russia announced that it would lift a ban on travel to Turkey and was moving toward normalizing economic relations. More than four million Russians went to Turkey in 2014, second only to Germans, but millions of Russian tourists stayed home this year. Moscow also banned most imports of fruits, vegetables and other agricultural goods from Turkey, but that ban is due to be lifted, as well. President Obama telephoned President Erdogan from Air Force One on Wednesday to express his condolences for the loss of life and offer America’s help. The White House did not confirm that the Islamic State was responsible for the attack, but the press secretary, Josh Earnest, said the assault illustrated the challenge that Turkey faces because of its shared border with Syria. Subways and streets in Istanbul were quiet on Wednesday, with tourists who had come despite previous violence  —   the airport bombings were the fourth suicide attack in Istanbul alone this year  —   trying to enjoy themselves. “It’s really sad,” said Alex Afridi, 50, from Sacramento, who was visiting Turkey with his family and staying in a hotel in the Beyoglu neighborhood of Istanbul. “This city was already hurting. It’s an amazing city. ” Turks said they felt stunned at the dismal turn their country had taken. “I was in a crying mood this morning, looking at the news,” said Osman Serim, 60, a businessman drinking coffee in Beyoglu. “What is going to happen? What is the hope? What is the future for young people?”",0
8191,"Klimt’s Women, Real and on Canvas - The New York Times","Among the most controversial issues roiling    Vienna was “Die Frauenfrage,” or “the woman question. ” As they were doing in many other cities and nations of Europe and North America, women were challenging a patriarchal society that judged them unworthy of the rights customarily accorded to men. You would hope that “Klimt and the Women of Vienna’s Golden Age, ” at the Neue Galerie, would delve widely, deeply and fearlessly into this complex topic. But while scholarly essays in the hefty,   catalog do just that, the show itself only partly and obliquely brings out the most interesting issues relating to women and the art of Gustav Klimt. That said, the 11   portraits at the heart of the show are fascinating to look at and, with help from the catalog, to think about. Among them, naturally, is Klimt’s best known painting, “Portrait of Adele   I” (1907) which sold for a record $135 million in 2006, was made more famous last year by the movie “Woman in Gold” and has been on permanent display at the Neue Galerie since 2006. And yet, portraiture wasn’t Klimt’s main thing. He was primarily an allegorist who folded mythic figures into otherworldly visions of pagan religiosity. During the period covered by this show, he produced an average of only one portrait a year, all of women, and he hewed to a relatively standardized approach, a compromise between tradition and Modernism. In his major portraits, the subject’s head and features are rendered in a more or less conventionally realistic manner while the clothed body and background are painted more freely in styles reminiscent of Impressionism, Symbolism and Fauvism. While the paintings represent chic, modern women who belong to a world of elegance and luxury, they also have the effect of exoticizing and etherealizing their subjects. As the art historian Jill Lloyd observes in her catalog essay, they seem both women of their time and timeless symbols of femininity, at once contemporary and archaic. Ms. Lloyd avers that while Klimt’s preoccupation with women in the full range of his art “may well relate to a personal obsession, it also seems likely that Klimt viewed the subject of women as a key to the modernity of his art. ” His portraits, she observes, “embody allusions to ‘the women question’ that are far from straightforward to read. ” In light of the ways women are represented in popular culture today, these ideas are as relevant now as they were a century ago. The exhibition, which includes a selection of life drawings as well as numerous pieces of jewelry, decorative objects and furniture designed by Wiener Werkstätte artists like Josef Hoffmann and Koloman Moser, doesn’t go much into Klimt’s personal life. But the catalog does. He was, as Ms. Lloyd puts it, a “serial philanderer. ” He never married but is believed to have fathered 14 children by his models and other   women. But he also had a lifelong companion and confidante in the dress designer and business woman Emilie Flöge, though whether they were lovers remains a mystery. Did Klimt suffer from Sigmund Freud’s   complex? Perhaps. In any event, his portraits of actual women are certainly exalting. Unfortunately, none of the explicitly erotic drawings he made of his models masturbating or of couples making love are included in the show for comparison with his more chaste portrait paintings here. On a more pragmatic level, Klimt had a considerable investment in his few portraits because he depended on their subjects for his income. In his catalog essay, the exhibition’s organizer, the Klimt scholar Tobias G. Natter, explains that after a successful, albeit controversial, career under Austrian state patronage, Klimt renounced governmental support and became the first president of the renegade Vienna Secession. This posed a problem, however, because Vienna lacked the independent dealer and gallery system that artists in Paris and London could rely on. Instead of such a marketplace, Klimt depended on a small circle of wealthy, private patrons. “The more he sought out adventure and distanced himself from his state patrons, the more indispensable the commitment of his private collectors and clients became,” Mr. Natter wrote. Klimt’s most important sponsor was Szerena Lederer, the subject of one of the exhibition’s more beguiling portraits. Made in 1899, it depicts its    subject in a gauzy, glowing white dress against a pale beige background that contrasts sharply with her black hair and clearly defined facial features. The effect is ghostly. Along with her industrialist husband, August Lederer, Szerena would eventually amass the largest collection of Klimt’s work in private hands. The Lederer’s daughter, Elisabeth, is the subject of another   portrait. Made in   the portrait shows her swathed in a white, oddly elongated, cocoonlike dress against a blue background decorated with cartoonish Asian figures. Yet another member of the Lederer clan, Szerena’s niece Ria Munk, who committed suicide over a failed love affair at the age of 24 in 1911, is the subject of a posthumous portrait called “The Dancer” ( ). She is shown in a richly floral patterned robe open to reveal her bare chest against a background of flowers and Asian figures. The painting that conveys a spirit of modern femininity best isn’t of a woman but of a    girl, Mäda Primavesi. Made in 1912, it depicts her in a white,   dress standing on solidly planted feet with one arm akimbo. Gazing back at the viewer with a calm, forthright expression, she projects a   that girls often are blessed to own. The painting could serve nicely as a poster for Day of the Girl, which just happened on Tuesday. After World War II, Primavesi emigrated to Canada, where she founded and headed a convalescent home for children. In 1987, she was in the news for selling a portrait by Klimt of her mother, Eugenia Primavesi, that had been thought lost. When Mäda Primavesi died in 2000, a note in the catalog says, “the last eyewitness to have personally experienced Klimt at the easel passed. ”",0
8192,Trump Chooses Army General H.R. McMaster for National Security Adviser - Breitbart,"On Monday, the White House announced Army Lt. General H. R. McMaster as the replacement for Michael Flynn as National Security Adviser. [McMaster was not one of the top candidates suggested by administration sources after President Trump’s first choice, retired Vice Admiral Robert Harward, declined the position. Over the weekend, President Trump began interviewing three new candidates, along with the current temporary occupant of the position, retired General Keith Kellogg. McMaster was one of the three, along with former U. N. Ambassador John Bolton and West Point superintendent Lt. Gen. Robert Caslen.  According to the White House announcement, Kellogg will continue serving under McMaster as chief of staff for the National Security Council. Thomas Ricks at Foreign Policy predicted McMaster would be Trump’s choice for National Security Adviser on Monday morning, describing him as “smart, energetic, and tough. ” “He has good combat experience, he was a good trainer, and he led the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment well in his deployment to Iraq, most notably in pacifying Tell Afar, to the west of Mosul,” Ricks wrote, adding that McMaster was supported to a “surprising degree” by people who had worked for him in the past. McMaster is the author of a   book on Vietnam, Dereliction of Duty: Johnson, McNamara, the Joint Chief of Staff, and the Lies That Led to Vietnam. The book strongly argues that military leadership should be willing to stand up to civilian political leaders when war is not waged successfully, and also criticizes   military leadership for becoming distracted by bureaucratic infighting. McMaster’s leadership at the famed Battle of 73 Easting in Operation Desert Storm was an important part of the U. S. military’s resurgence, poetically described as “exorcising the ghosts of Vietnam” at the time. In that battle, a vastly outnumbered American unit defeated Iraqi forces with superior tactics, coordination, and technology, without suffering a single casualty. Last February, McMaster wrote an extensive account of the battle, and the lessons it provides for future conflict, for The National Interest. He is noted as an advocate of both strong conventional military forces and   capability. Concerned by cuts to both manpower and equipment modernization, he warned the Senate last year that “we are outranged and outgunned by many potential adversaries  …     our Army in the future risks being too small to secure the nation. ” One of the lessons he recommends learning from the Battle of 73 Easting, a   on, is that American forces may never again have such a pronounced technological advantage over enemy ground forces. One of the adversaries McMaster particularly worries about is Russia. Defense One reported in May 2016 that he believes the Ukraine conflict has “revealed that the Russians have superior artillery firepower, better combat vehicles, and have learned sophisticated use of UAVs for tactical effect. ” McMaster feared American military planners have invested too much effort in “winning   missile duels,” proclaiming such tactics of limited use against the “dispersion, concealment, intermingling with civilian populations  …     the ability to disrupt our network strike capability, precision navigation and timing capabilities” demonstrated by Russian forces in Ukraine. He was also concerned about Russia’s advantages in battlefield artillery. He was also concerned about Russia’s advantages in battlefield artillery, including their use of cluster munitions, thermobaric warheads, and heavy use of electronic warfare, citing reports of Russia’s astonishing effectiveness at shutting down Ukranian tactical radios, drones, and even the electrical fuses on their artillery shells. Even the vaunted American technological edge in air supremacy, tanks, and armored fighting vehicles has dangerously eroded, in McMaster’s estimation.",0
8193,How Putin Derailed the West   : Information," How Putin Derailed the West
By Mike Whitney Nation state as a fundamental unit of mans organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force: International banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation-state.
 Zbigniew Brzezinski, Between Two Ages: The Technetronic Era, 1971
Im going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria .not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians.
 Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Third Presidential Debate
 "" Counterpunch "" - Why is Hillary Clinton so eager to intensify US involvement in Syria when US interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya have all gone so terribly wrong?
The answer to this question is simple. Its because Clinton doesnt think that these interventions went wrong. And neither do any of the other members of the US foreign policy establishment. (akaThe Borg). In fact, in their eyes these wars have been a rousing success. Sure, a few have been critical of the public relations backlash from the nonexistent WMD in Iraq, (or the logistical errors, like disbanding the Iraqi Army) butfor the most part the foreign policy establishment is satisfied with its efforts to destabilize the region and remove leaders that refuse to follow Washingtons diktats.
This is hard for ordinary people to understand. They cant grasp why elite powerbrokers would want to transform functioning, stable countries into uninhabitable wastelands overrun by armed extremists, sectarian death squads and foreign-born terrorists. Nor can they understand what has been gained by Washingtons 15 year-long rampage across the Middle East and Central Asia that has turned a vast swathe of strategic territory into a terrorist breeding grounds? What is the purpose of all this?
First, we have to acknowledge that the decimation and de facto balkanization of these countries is part of a plan. If it wasnt part of a plan, than the decision-makers would change the policy. But they havent changed the policy. The policy is the same. The fact that the US is using foreign-born jihadists to pursue regime change in Syria as opposed to US troops in Iraq, is not a fundamental change in the policy. The ultimate goal is still the decimation of the state and the elimination of the existing government. This same rule applies to Libya and Afghanistan both of which have been plunged into chaos by Washingtons actions.
But why? What is gained by destroying these countries and generating so much suffering and death?
Heres what I think: I think Washington is involved in a grand project to remake the world in a way that better meets the needs of its elite constituents, the international banks and multinational corporations. Brzezinski not only refers to this in the opening Quote: , he also explains what is taking place: The nation-state is being jettisoned as the foundation upon which the global order rests. Instead, Washington is erasing borders, liquidating states, and removing strong, secular leaders that can mount resistance to its machinations in order to impose an entirely new model on the region, a new world order. The people who run these elite institutions want to create an interconnected-global free trade zone overseen by the proconsuls of Big Capital, in other words, a global Eurozone that precludes the required state institutions (like a centralized treasury, mutual debt, federal transfers) that would allow the borderless entity to function properly.
Deep state powerbrokers who set policy behind the smokescreen of our bought-and-paid-for congress think that one world government is an achievable goal provided they control the worlds energy supplies, the worlds reserve currency and become the dominant player in this centurys most populous and prosperous region, Asia. This is essentially what Hillarys pivot to Asia is all about.
The basic problem with Washingtons NWO plan is that a growing number of powerful countries are still attached to the old world order and are now prepared to defend it. This is whats really going on in Syria, the improbable alliance of Russia, Syria, Iran and Hezbollah have stopped the US military juggernaut dead in its tracks. The unstoppable force has hit the immovable object and the immovable object has prevailed so far.
Naturally, the foreign policy establishment is upset about these new developments, and for good reason. The US has run the world for quite a while now, so the rolling back of US policy in Syria is as much a surprise as it is a threat. The Russian Airforce deployed to Syria a full year ago in September, but only recently has Washington shown that its prepared to respond by increasing its support of its jihadists agents on the ground and by mounting an attack on ISIS in the eastern part of the country, Raqqa. But the real escalation is expected to take place when Hillary Clinton becomes president in 2017. Thats when the US will directly engage Russia militarily, assuming that their tit-for-tat encounters will be contained within Syrias borders. Its a risky plan, but its the next logical step in this bloody fiasco. Neither party wants a nuclear war, but Washington believes that doing nothing is tantamount to backing down, therefore, Hillary and her neocon advisors can be counted on to up the ante. No-fly zone, anyone?
The assumption is that eventually, and with enough pressure, Putin will throw in the towel. But this is another miscalculation. Putin is not in Syria because he wants to be nor is he there because he values his friendship with Syrian President Bashar al Assad. Thats not it at all. Putin is in Syria because he has no choice. Russias national security is at stake. If Washingtons strategy of deploying terrorists to topple Assad succeeds, then the same ploy will be attempted in Iran and Russia. Putin knows this, just like he knows that the scourge of foreign-backed terrorism can decimate entire regions like Chechnya. He knows that its better for him to kill these extremists in Aleppo than it will be in Moscow. So he cant back down, thats not an option.
But, by the same token, he can compromise, in other words, his goals and the goals of Assad do not perfectly coincide. For example, he could very well make territorial concessions to the US for the sake of peace that Assad might not support.
But why would he do that? Why wouldnt he continue to fight until every inch of Syrias sovereign territory is recovered?
Because its not in Russias national interest to do so, thats why. Putin has never tried to conceal the fact that hes in Syria to protect Russias national security. Thats his main objective. But hes not an idealist, hes a pragmatist wholl do whatever he has to to end the war ASAP. That means compromise.
This doesnt matter to the Washington warlords .yet. But it will eventually. Eventually there will be an accommodation of some sort. No one is going to get everything they want, that much is certain. For example, its impossible to imagine that Putin would launch a war on Turkey to recover the territory that Turkish troops now occupy in N Syria. In fact, Putin may have already conceded as much to Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan in their recent meetings. But that doesnt mean that Putin doesnt have his red lines. He does. Aleppo is a red line. Turkish troops will not be allowed to enter Aleppo.
The western corridor, the industrial and population centers are all red lines. On these, there will be no compromise. Putin will help Assad remain in power and keep the country largely intact. But will Turkey control sections in the north, and will the US control sections in the east?
Probably. This will have to be worked out in negotiations, but its unlikely that the countrys borders will be the same as they were before the war broke out. Putin will undoubtedly settle for a halfloaf provided the fighting ends and security is restored. In any event, hes not going to hang around until the last dog is hung.
Unfortunately, were a long way from any settlement in Syria, mainly because Washington is nowhere near accepting the fact that its project to rule the world has been derailed. Thats the crux of the matter, isnt it? The bigshots who run the country are still in denial. It hasnt sunk in yet that the war is lost and that their nutty jihadist-militia plan has failed.
Its going to take a long time before Washington gets the message that the world is no longer its oyster. The sooner they figure it out, the better itll be for everyone.

8194,FIFA Shares Results of Investigation and Tries to Turn the Page - The New York Times,"Nearly two years after a sweeping corruption case first felled top leaders of FIFA, the   governing body for international soccer announced on Friday that it had cataloged its officials’ wrongdoing and delivered the results of a   internal investigation to government authorities. The investigation, undertaken by two prominent law firms in 2015, drew on millions of documents and interviews with current and former employees. Among those interviewed was Sepp Blatter, FIFA’s longtime president who stepped down amid scandal, his lawyer confirmed. In recent days, FIFA said, the organization turned over the last in a series of inquiry reports  —   totaling 1, 300 pages, with an additional 20, 000 pages of supplementary evidence  —   to Switzerland’s office of the attorney general. Swiss prosecutors, who have named Mr. Blatter and his former top deputy, Jérôme Valcke, as subjects of a criminal investigation, are expected to share the information with the United States Justice Department, which led international scrutiny of FIFA by charging dozens of soccer officials, businessmen and companies with racketeering, money laundering, wire fraud and bribery in 2015. In its announcement, FIFA’s president, Gianni Infantino, seemed eager to turn the page on one of the darkest chapters in its history. “FIFA committed to conducting a thorough and comprehensive investigation of the facts so we could hold wrongdoers within football accountable and cooperate with the authorities,” Mr. Infantino said. “FIFA will now return its focus to the game. ” The American and Swiss investigations are, however, continuing  —   deconstructing schemes spanning decades to which more than a dozen have confessed. So, too, is an investigation in France, where Mr. Valcke lives. That inquiry is being conducted by France’s national financial prosecutor’s office, which, like the American investigators’ has relied on cooperation from Switzerland’s attorney general. Swiss privacy laws dictate that FIFA’s information must be funneled through Swiss authorities. FIFA, based in Zurich, is forbidden to deliver documents directly to other governments, which frustrated FIFA’s lawyers during early stages of the United States’ case, as they sought to telegraph their cooperation and to solidify FIFA’s place as a victim in the eyes of the authorities. “The office of the attorney general of Switzerland appreciates the preliminary exchange of information and FIFA’s close and consistent cooperation,” Ladina Gapp, a spokeswoman for that office, wrote in an email on Friday. “Since the criminal proceedings are ongoing, FIFA is restricted from releasing or commenting on the findings from its investigation. ” The narrative reports and corresponding evidence newly turned over by FIFA might not be revelatory for government authorities, who have obtained voluminous information through their own interviews, raids and specific document requests, to which FIFA has responded on a rolling basis over the last two years. But the reports, produced by the American law firm Quinn Emanuel and the Swiss law firm Niederer Kraft  Frey, catalog FIFA’s insight into its leadership’s possible crimes and signal a symbolic moment as the organization seeks to emerge from the scandal. The United States has charged more than 40 defendants in its case. Of those, 19 people have so far publicly pleaded guilty, along with multiple companies. As recently as December 2016, a new guilty plea was unsealed. Five soccer officials are actively fighting charges in the United States and set to stand trial in the fall, while numerous others remain abroad and have not answered to the charges against them. The investigations have been dizzying  —   and expensive  —   for FIFA, which has asked the United States government for tens of millions of dollars, a portion of the money that the convicted defendants have pledged to pay the Justice Department in restitution. The scandal has unseated dozens of international and national soccer officials, predominantly from South and Central America, some with deep roots in the sport and their names emblazoned on administration buildings. At least one implicated leader remains in power: Marco Polo Del Nero, the president of Brazil’s soccer association, who was indicted by the United States in 2015. Mr. Infantino, who succeeded Mr. Blatter as FIFA’s president last year, has broadly condemned the disfiguring corruption and advocated change, but he has not called for Mr. Del Nero’s resignation and met with him in Rio de Janeiro last summer as part of a routine visit.",0
8195,Old Treaties and New Alliances Empower Native Americans - The New York Times,"The simmering standoff between the police and Native Americans and their allies who oppose a giant oil pipeline project in North Dakota is the most visible sign of an emerging movement that is shifting the debate about how public lands across North America should be managed. From the rocky, pebbled beaches north of Seattle, where the Lummi Nation has led the fight against a proposed coal terminal, to southern Utah, where a coalition of tribes is demanding management rights over a proposed new national monument, to the tiny wooded community of Bella Bella, British Columbia, 350 miles north of the United States border, Native Americans are asserting old treaty rights and using tribal traditions to protect and manage federally owned land. “If you want to own it, you have to act like you own it,” said Kelly Brown, the director of resource management for the Heiltsuk Nation in Bella Bella. The Heiltsuk pressed the Canadian government for joint management of the local herring fishery and won this year through a campaign of   and political lobbying. The force for change comes in part from tribes’ forming new alliances as they defend territorial claims and manage resources. In some places, the focus is on fossil fuels and pollution in others, on an awareness that climate change could have a disproportionately harsh impact on tribal populations because of where they live, in coastal or forest areas, or their dependence on natural resources or foods. “The tribal voice, and their concerns and what happens on those lands  —   that’s accelerating right now, and where it’s going to go, I don’t know,” said John Freemuth, a professor of public policy at Boise State University who studies public lands. “It’s a big story and a growing story. ” Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota, in particular, where the Sioux and others are fighting the construction of the   Dakota Access oil pipeline, has been one battleground. Native Americans and environmental activists say the project threatens the region’s water supply and would harm sacred cultural lands. The Army announced late Monday that it had finished reviewing its process for approving the pipeline’s route on land owned by the Army Corps of Engineers. But it said it needed more study and wanted input from the Standing Rock Sioux before it allowed the pipeline to cross under a Missouri River reservoir. Pipeline protesters, linking their effort to demonstrations over the last week in many American cities in opposition to   Donald J. Trump, held rallies on Tuesday in cities from Albuquerque to Buffalo. A vast stretch of   temperate rain forest bigger than Maine and stretching from northwest Washington to Alaska  —   called the Great Bear in British Columbia  —   has emerged as a laboratory for change. An agreement signed this year between British Columbia and 27 tribal nations, including the Heiltsuk, protects much of the forest from commercial logging and shifts some management authority to the tribes. In southern Nevada, the Moapa Band of Paiutes is seeking federal protection for lands that now lie within the ranch owned by Cliven Bundy, the father of Ammon and Ryan Bundy, who were recently acquitted of criminal charges for their roles in the armed occupation of a wildlife refuge in Oregon this year. In Idaho last summer, tribal representatives from 19 states met for what organizers said was the biggest Native American workshop on climate change, and they concluded that global environmental changes transcended national boundaries. “This is how land resource decisions are going to be made in the future  —   through   with people who have been on the land forever,” said Hadley Archer, the executive director of the Nature Conservancy Canada, which helped put together the Great Bear forest agreement. To that end, the University of Victoria law school in British Columbia will begin enrolling students next year in a degree program that will combine the traditional study of court precedents and legislation with the study of tribal law. People like Chantal Pronteau, a member of the  ’Xais Nation (pronounced  ) are walking this uncharted road. Last year, Ms. Pronteau, 22, put on a uniform as a member of the Coastal Guardian Watchmen, a Native American patrol, to monitor the environment and guard against poachers and illegal   from Klemtu, her community’s tiny home village of about 300 people. The village, in British Columbia, is reachable only by boat or air. Changes are everywhere, she said. Grizzly bears have been swimming across fjords and rivers to colonize islands where they have not been seen before, as salmon become harder to find. Whales are wintering off the coast rather than heading to Hawaii, breaking another ancient pattern. A treasured culinary seaweed disappeared this year. “We’re the eyes and the ears,” Ms. Pronteau said as she walked a stretch of rocky beach in her black Coastal Guardian Watchman jacket. The importance of her work patrolling the tribe’s territory by boat and on foot, she added, “feels beyond what words can describe, because of what we’re working for, who we’re working for and why we’re working. ” The great mossy forest belt of the Pacific Northwest  —   culturally, environmentally and economically crucial to people here for millenniums  —   was where this new power dynamic began. In the   indigenous people began protesting the   of trees in the Great Bear forest. Involvement of conservation groups like the Nature Conservancy then led to a series of agreements that were capped this year with the tribes and the government of British Columbia banning or strictly limiting industrial logging in nearly half of the forest. An endowment fund created earlier in that process, in 2007, linked economic development and   science and management in the Great Bear forest. That fund helps back programs like the Coastal Guardian Watchmen, which involves at least 14 tribes in the Great Bear area out of 27 that signed the agreement. Like climate change itself, though, there are few certain outcomes. Governments can override Native arguments. Coastal Guardians like Ms. Pronteau also sometimes have the delicate task of trying to persuade trophy game hunters that tribal rules ban bear hunting in their territory, even though the hunters may have legal permits. Some hunters respond and retreat, she said others do not. Legal wrinkles echo across a century or more. Many First Nations in British Columbia, for example, including the  ’Xais, never signed treaties with the Canadian government, which means that, unlike most other tribes across Canada and United States, they never ceded any dominion over their lands. The future, those tribes say, is an open book. But in other places, the legal power of treaties has been reinforced. When the Army Corps of Engineers said this year that a proposed coal terminal in northwest Washington State would threaten fishing rights guaranteed to the Lummi Nation in 1855  —   and again this week, when it said a “  ” relationship with the Sioux was necessary to discuss the North Dakota pipeline  —   it sent a thunderclap across tribal lands. Treaties still have teeth. The echo also hangs heavy in these ancient lands. Archaeological evidence shows a human presence in the Pacific Northwest dating back more than 13, 000 years. “What it comes down to is our cultural history, and the land that we’ve been handed down by our ancestors to take care of,” said William G. Housty, the chairman of the Heiltsuk Integrated Resource Management Department. “I heard my grandfather say, ‘If the world ever ends, it’s going to be us killing ourselves,’” Mr. Housty said as he leaned against a   station at a tribal salmon hatchery. “And that’s all it is,” he said, gesturing to the world around where he stood. “At the end of the day, we need to manage ourselves. ”",0
8196,Jeff Koons Is Giving Sculpture to Paris to Remember Terror Victims - The New York Times,"PARIS  —   Inspired by the Statue of Liberty, the American contemporary artist Jeff Koons is donating a monumental sculpture of a fistful of tulips to the City of Paris and the people of France to commemorate victims of the recent terrorist attacks here. One of Mr. Koons’s largest sculptures  —   34 feet high, 27 feet wide and 33 feet deep  —   “Bouquet of Tulips” is meant to echo the hand of the Statue of Liberty, a gift to the United States from France. Currently under construction in Germany, the work, made of bronze, stainless steel and aluminum, will be permanently installed next year in the plaza in front of the Museum of Modern Art and the Palais de Tokyo. “I hope the work is   to people,” Mr. Koons said in an interview here on Monday. “I hope that the ‘Bouquet of Tulips’ can communicate a sense of future, of optimism, the joy of offering, to find something greater outside the self. ” Inspired by floral paintings by Fragonard, Picasso and others, he said that he had chosen the tulips for their “buoyancy,” which he hoped would inspire the families of victims of the attacks to carry on. Jane D. Hartley, the United States ambassador to France and Monaco, said she had been thinking of a cultural offering the United States could give France “in a spirit of ‘we’re in this together’” after terrorist attacks last year: ones at the Charlie Hebdo satirical newspaper and a kosher supermarket, and then the Nov. 13 attacks that killed 130 people. “My hope is this amazing sculpture will bring visitors to Paris,” Ms. Hartley said at a news conference on Monday announcing the donation. Tourism in Paris has declined dramatically since the attacks. The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, told attendees at the news conference that the sculpture delivered an optimistic message in turbulent times. “We need to tell the youth and the young generation that it’s not true that tomorrow’s world will be worse than it is today,” she said. Ms. Hartley approached Mr. Koons after discussing the idea at a dinner in Paris in January with her friend Jerry I. Speyer, chairman of the board of the Museum of Modern Art in New York and a collector of the artist’s work. “I know how much he loves France, and he’s the most prominent American living artist,” Ms. Hartley said in an interview before the news conference. Mr. Koons, best known for his metallic sculptures of balloon animals and other souvenir and everyday objects, is also one of the most polarizing and   figures in the contemporary art world. His works have sold for hundreds of millions of dollars, but he waived payment for the sculpture. The 3. 5 million euros ($3. 8 million) it will cost to produce and install the work are being raised from private donations by a nonprofit foundation, Fonds Pour Paris, and its counterpart in the United States, the Paris Foundation. This is the first commemorative work Mr. Koons, who lives in New York, has created, but he does have a festive work, “Balloon Flower (Red),” on display outside 7 World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan. Mr. Koons’s work has proved controversial in France. When some of it was displayed at Versailles in 2008, part of a program showing contemporary art at that historic site, French art critics questioned “the intrusion within the walls of the chateau of 16 giant glittering sculptures by an artist considered a paragon of kitsch,” Le Monde reported at the time. Six years later, in a review of Mr. Koons’s work at the Pompidou Center in Paris, Le Figaro asked in a headline whether he was an “impostor or a creator?”",0
8197,Jason Frierson Is a Pro-Life Assembly District 8 Candidate,"Jason Frierson is an African-American Democrat seeking re-election to   in November 2016. While he is not the incumbent this election, he was the assemblyman for the district during the 77th Nevada State Legislature; in 2013. His opponents are Republican Norm Ross and Democrat-turned-Libertarian John Moore , who is the current person representing the citizens.
Planned Parenthood Endorsement of Jason Frierson Nevada Advocates for Planned Parenthood Affiliates (NAPPA) website lists the candidates it endorses for the state’s 2016 Election Guide. On Frierson’s website, abortions are not on his list of issues. In fact, they are only listed in the list of groups and organizations that support him.
The candidate’s affiliation is evident in his photos taken with the women of the NAPPA dressed wearing the standard issue pink tee shirts. How can an African-American man accept the endorsement of a group whose founder began her campaign for birth control as eugenics against the black population?
Margaret Sanger pushed her agenda to forward her cause as early as 1912 when she authored a column, “What Every Girl Should Know.” In 1921, she founded the American Birth Control League and served as president until 1928. The league was the precursor to Planned Parenthood. Sanger was known to write for scientific journals on the importance of birth control for black women. One such article was entitled “Birth Control: The True Eugenics.” She even addressed the Klu Klux Klan in 1926 rally in Silver Lake, New Jersey, according to The Washington Times.
In 2012 the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported that there were 699, 202 legal abortions in the United States. That means the abortion to live birth ratio was 210 per 1,000, respectively. This number may not be accurate since there were only 49 areas supplying data.
Norm Ross Fundraiser for LLS Whereas Ross opposes any tax funding of Planned Parenthood and prefers support from organizations that save lives. As such, he and his wife, Mojgan, a candidate Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) Woman of the Year, held a fundraiser in their home raising $5,000 in donations.
During 2015, the organization invested $67.2 million in research to find a cure for leukemia and lymphoma. Their goal is diametrically opposed to that of Planned Parenthood.
The guest of honor was a young boy, a local resident, who has survived a blood cancer. The LLS website explains the program, Boy & Girl of the Year, provides inspiration and motivation for volunteers and donors.
Jeana Foster wrote this testimonial: “Working with LLS, meeting ‘Boy and Girl of the Year’ […] and knowing that my efforts will bring us closer to finding a cure for them and all those suffering from blood cancers is truly inspiring.”
Jason Frierson Following Hillary Clinton’s Policies Does Frierson agree with Hillary Clinton’s Democratic party line?
Does he support open borders, which has created a significant number of non-English speaking students in Nevada’s public schools? What does he think about allowing millions of refugees entering the U.S. without proper vetting? How about the massive tax increases Clinton has promised Americans? What is his stand about the Army General imprisoned for breaches of National Security? Does Frierson really think that Clinton deserves a get-out-of-jail-free-card for the same offenses? What is his position on Transgender restrooms? These questions need to be answered by Frierson. He appears to be a confused candidate; he is endorsed by an organization that provides abortion and was founded by a woman whose philosophy was eugenics of black Americans. Furthermore, Frierson tows the Democratic platform and supports Clinton’s illegitimate candidacy for the presidency.

8198,"Juppé, comme tout le monde, déteste la police !","(mis à jour 18:15 26.10.2016) URL courte 0 57 1 0 Les livres d’entretiens ne réussissent pas aux candidats à la présidentielle ! Après « Un président ne devrait pas dire ça », qui éclabousse Hollande, c’est « Un Fantasme nommé Juppé » qui se retourne contre son auteur. Dans les deux cas, leur livre révèle surtout le manque de vision de ces politiciens. 
Wesh, Péju, trop de la balle le mec, ou quoi ? Trop chanmé, sérieux, comment qu'il les calcule pas les condés ! T'ain, j'le prenais pour un bouffon, deux de tension, trop cheum, tu vois, mais y déchire sa race, le cousin ! 
Eh oui, Juppé, il ne lui manque plus que le sweat capuche, la casquette des Chicago Bulls avec une plaque en simili métal et les chaînes autour du cou. Tel le djeune de base emmerdé par les flics dans ses petits trafics — pardon, dans son activité d'entrepreneur indépendant —, voilà-t'y pas que notre Ali-du 9-3-larchourma-de-ta-vie — ah voilà que ça me reprend — confesse toute la détestation que lui inspirent les flics et les juges. C'est dans un livre à paraître, Un Fantasme nommé Juppé , mais dont mes confrères n'ont pas hésitéà divulguer quelques bonne feuilles. 
Monsieur le Premier ministre me pardonnera ma familiarité, c'est bien lui qui affirmait, dans un effort de coolitude assez déplacé quand on l'air comme lui de faire un usage plutôt déplacé des balais, qu'il « emmerdait » ceux qui le trouvaient ennuyeux, je vous en parlais d'ailleurs il y a quelque temps. 
Donc le candidat favori des Français, selon ses propres mots, s'apparente donc à un Black Block de base qui scande en marge des manifs Loi travail « tout le monde déteste la police ». Oui, mais pas que. Dans son bouquin, notre énarque assoiffé de pouvoir explique qu'il n'aime donc pas l'intérieur, la justice, mais pas non plus le ministère des Finances « où il n'y a que des coups à prendre ». Sous Sarkozy, il ne voulait même pas du Quai d'Orsay, expliquant au président « Je ne veux pas porter ton cartable ». 
Bref, rien n'est assez bien pour lui, « le meilleur d'entre nous » ne se voit que sur le trône élyséen. Grattez un peu et sous la couche de coolitude, l'animal à sang froid réapparaît rapidement. Comme la plupart de ses petits camarades, Alain Juppé n'est intéressé que par le pouvoir. Mais pour en faire quoi ? Pas forcément pour appliquer des idées dites « de droite » si l'on en croit cette confession : « J'ai été de droite pour prouver qu'on pouvait être intelligent et de droite ! » Ou pas, donc. 
D'ailleurs, il suffit de se pencher un peu sur son action pour que le vernis « de droite » craque aussi légèrement. Quel homme de droite — quel républicain sensé, d'ailleurs — entretiendrait des liens aussi étroits avec l'UOIF, c'est-à-dire les Frères musulmans, comme le fait Alain Juppé ? Rappelons qu'il a remis la Légion d'Honneur à l'imam Tareq Oubrou, membre de l'UOIF et ami de Tariq Ramadan en août dernier. 
Je me réfère également au témoignage d'Amine Elbahi, un jeune ex-soutien du candidat bordelais. Bel exemple d'intégration, le jeune homme s'était engagé dans la réserve citoyenne de l'Éducation nationale et dans les Républicains, aux côtés d'Alain Juppé. « Rester à ses côtés serait renier mes convictions. » explique maintenant Amine Elbahi, qui déplore qu'Alain Juppé travaille aux côtés des salafistes de l'UOIF, comme Amar Lasfar, Tareq Obrou, Ahmed Miktar, qui tous prônent un islam politique incompatible avec nos valeurs françaises et républicaines. 
Oui, le pouvoir pour faire quoi ? On ne sait pas trop donc. Pour l'exercer, tout simplement, tout comme l'actuel locataire de l'Élysée qui lui aussi est là pour le plaisir d'être là et non pour porter une vision. Autre point commun entre les deux hommes : ils ont sorti des livres d'entretiens qu'ils auraient mieux fait de relire avant publication. Le scandale (dans un verre d'eau) du bouquin de Juppé n'ayant pas encore effacé celui du bien nommé« Un président ne devrait pas dire ça » de Hollande, vous avez encore ne mémoire les propos peu amènes du Corrézien de service à propos de la magistrature (tiens encore un point commun), de l'immigration ou de l'islam. 
Eh bien devinez quoi, ce n'est pas de sa faute, à Hollande ! Ce sont les méchants journalistes qui l'ont pousséà la faute ! Tu parles, en 62 entretiens et 10 dîners, ils ont le temps de le pousser, pépère ! et c'est Jean Glavany qui nous l'affirme : 
« … ils savaient depuis le début qu'ils gagneraient d'autant plus d'argent qu'ils pousseraient le président à la faute. Alors ils l'ont poussé, poussé, poussé… et il est tombé, tombé, tombé dans le piège. » 
Pauvre pépère, il n'a pas fait exprès ! En tout cas, il y en a un qui n'est pas content, c'est Alain Juppé, parce que cette excuse bidon pour des propos foireux dans un livre probablement lamentable, elle est déjà prise, maintenant !",0
8199,North Korea to Tillerson: We Are Ready for ’Any War the U.S. Would Like’,"North Korea’s foreign ministry warned Monday that its government is prepared to go to war with the United States, following remarks from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in which he said the Trump administration was prepared for a military engagement with the communist dictatorship should they strike U. S. allies. [“The U. S. should face up to the situation of the world with its eyes wide open. The DPRK has the will and capability to fully respond to any war the U. S. would like to ignite,” the   Korean Central News Agency quoted a foreign ministry spokesman as saying, according to the South Korean newswire service Yonhap.  “If the   . S.  thought that they would frighten the DPRK, they would soon know that their method would not work on the latter,” the spokesman continued. “The world will soon witness what eventful significance the great victory won by the DPRK in the recent ground jet test of     engine will carry. ” Addressing Secretary Tillerson directly, the spokesman said he was “repeating what Obama touted much sanctions [sic] until he left the White House. What matters is that neither Obama nor Tillerson knows the reason why the DPRK had to have access to nuclear weapons and why it is dynamically bolstering up the nuclear force. ” The North Korean official appeared to be responding to Tillerson’s statements in South Korea on Friday where he told reporters that the Trump administration would not back down in protecting its allies in Seoul and Tokyo. “The policy of strategic patience has ended. We are exploring a new range of diplomatic, security and economic measures. All options are on the table,” Tillerson said, clarifying to one reporter that these options did include a military last resort. Tillerson also repeated on multiple stops during his Asia trip that he hoped to see North Korea’s closest ally, China, take steps to ensure that Pyongyang abides by United Nations sanctions. In China, Tillerson emphasized issues on which the two nations agreed, though reports suggest that he privately urged Beijing to cut economic ties with North Korea. Pyongyang appears to have received the message. In addition to the foreign ministry’s response, the Rodong Sinmun, a state propaganda newspaper, published a column Monday arguing that North Korea needs nuclear weapons because the United States will invade it if it does not threaten a nuclear attack. “Our army and people will continuously bolster up our nuclear deterrent for   down the road under the conditions that   U. S. government officials adamantly stick to their hostile policy toward us,” the column read. In addition to public statements, North Korea tested a new rocket engine model on Sunday at the orders of dictator Kim  . The Rodong reported that Kim applauded the test as a success: He noted that the success made in the current test marked a great event of historic significance as it declared a new birth of the   rocket industry which has radically turned into a     industry both in name and in reality by completely doing away with dogmatism, conservatism and formalism left in the field of rocket industry and the dependence on the technology of other countries. Kim said of the test, “the whole world will soon witness what eventful significance the great victory won today carries. ” The rocket engine, experts presume, is meant to fuel the launch of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). North Korea has been developing nuclear technology in the hopes of creating a nuclear weapon with enough reach to successfully strike U. S. soil. Reuters corroborated the claims in North Korean media that the rocket engine test was an advance in the nation’s weapons technology, citing the South Korean defense ministry.",0
8200,’Facezam’ App Lets Strangers Stalk Your Facebook Profile by Taking a Picture of You **UPDATE** It’s a Hoax - Breitbart,"Creepers of the web, rejoice! Now you can find someone’s social media account just by taking their picture. [Jack Kenyon, founder of smartphone app Facezam, says that it “could be the end of our anonymous societies. ” Kenyon outlines the function of the app with alarming clarity: “Users will be able to identify anyone within a matter of seconds, which means privacy will no longer exist in public society. ”  Facezam uses Facebook’s   user information database to match the picture you snap with the person’s social media information. It claims a less than   turnaround on most queries. In testing, its facial recognition has maintained about 70% accuracy. If you do not want to participate, you are unfortunately out of luck. Being one of the almost 2 billion Facebook users means that you are already part of the developer database that Facezam uses for identification. And Facebook already uses facial recognition to suggest who should be tagged in your photos, so the proverbial prize is right there for the taking. The app is set to launch on March 21, but Facebook itself may stand in the way. The social network says that Facezam “violates [their] terms” and that they are “reaching out to the developer to ensure they bring their app into compliance. ” Kenyon, however, disagrees. He says that his company has “looked into this,” and they remain “confident the app won’t be violating Facebook’s terms. ” Furthermore, he claims the ramifications of the app could have “a mix of positives and negatives” and that it could even help to reduce crime. Right now, the only way to reduce Facezam’s effectiveness is to obscure your face in pictures. If you are prone to wearing sunglasses, or have hair that falls across your face, you may be fortunate enough to reduce the chances of being identified by a stranger’s phone to about 55%. **UPDATE** Facezam has been revealed as a hoax, with their website stating, “This was a publicity stunt by Zacozo Creative, a Viral Marketing Agency. ” Follow Nate Church @Get2Church on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both.",0
8201,Meet Evatar: The Lab Model That Mimics the Female Reproductive System - The New York Times,"Researchers in the United States have created a model of a female reproductive system that is so close to the real thing it even simulates a menstrual cycle and pregnancy hormones. The team of researchers, from Northwestern University, the University of Illinois at Chicago and Draper Laboratory, published the results of their study in Nature Communications on Tuesday. The model, fabricated with human and mouse tissue and named Evatar, can be used to test drugs, with implications for women dealing with painful periods, infertility and other conditions. “If I had your stem cells and created a heart, liver, lung and an ovary, I could test 10 different drugs at 10 different doses on you and say, ‘Here’s the drug that will help your Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s or diabetes,’ ” the lead investigator, Teresa K. Woodruff, said in a report about the research on the Northwestern University website. “It’s the ultimate personalized medicine, a model of your body for testing drugs. ” The   model has all the parts of the female reproductive system  —   ovaries, fallopian tubes, a uterus and a cervix. A liver, while not a reproductive organ, is included in the system because it metabolizes drugs. Mouse and human tissues from each of the organs are placed in separate cube compartments that are connected in a square frame in the laboratory. The model mimics what a human body does in real life. The cube wells are about a   deep, which allows the tissue samples to grow in multiple directions, and the organs communicate with hormonal signaling, as they do in a living body. Tubes and valves connecting the model organs are shot through with fluid that serves as the function of blood flow. The organ models communicate through the secretions, which include hormones, growth and immune factors, the report said. That means once the ovarian cycle is stimulated, the other tissues respond. The model undergoes a full   menstrual cycle, and it can even be induced to secrete pregnancy hormones, Dr. Woodruff said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. The ovary for Evatar uses mouse tissue, and other organs are fashioned from human tissue obtained from hysterectomy surgery patients for the other organs. But researchers hope the model can be personalized in the future by using stem cells from individual patients to mimic their personal reproductive systems. Dr. Jerome F. Strauss III, professor at the obstetrics and gynecology department at the Virginia Commonwealth University’s School of Medicine, said the research model was a significant step forward because it did not isolate the cells that are important to the function of the uterus. That is relevant because some hormones exert their influence on one type of cell by using another type as an intermediary. “They have added the complexity of ” he said. “They built that in, and that again is an engineering advance that has been done in other systems but never in this complex, multichannel system. ” “It is a significant step forward toward trying to develop a complex model of human reproduction,” he added. “The key here is to have an integrated picture of events occurring in multiple tissues. ” But he said a shortcoming was the use of ovarian tissue from a mouse, which has a reproductive system controlled by the brain, rather than a monkey, whose reproductive systems are more like humans. The scientists in the Evatar research hope it will help improve understanding into endometriosis, fibroids, cancer and infertility. “All of these diseases are hormonally driven, and we really don’t know how to treat them except for surgery,” Joanna E. Burdette, a researcher with the University of Illinois, said in the Northwestern University report on the research. “The systems are tremendous for the study of cancer, which often is studied as isolated cells rather than systemwide cells. This is going to change the way we study cancer,” she said. The research was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, which has made the recreation of a “body on a chip” a goal for drug testing. Dr. Woodruff said in the interview that the name for the model was derived from the word avatar, which is the digital representation of an individual, combined with the name Eve. “The mother of all ” Dr. Woodruff said.",0
8202,When Your Child Is the Travel Agent - The New York Times,"Last February, when my    Katrina, was struggling to put together a     family trip for spring break, she turned to a nontraditional travel agent: Leo Kugel of Silver Spring, Md. Leo shelved the original Caribbean plan in favor of New Orleans, selected a hotel that had something for everyone, and found an inexpensive flight. But though at    Leo is at least as tall as your average travel agent, he is actually my    nephew. “We were stalled out, ” Katrina told me. “And he said ‘I’ll take it from here.’ I was a little bit skeptical. ” But aside from a tweak in the flight, everyone  —   Katrina my brother, Jeremy my younger nephew, Grady my mom (a. k. a. Grammy) and my Aunt Nancy  —   agreed to his choices, including a   stay in Le Pavillon. When I heard about this, I may have tilted my head like a dog when it hears a weird noise. When did kids suddenly acquire travel planning skills? I’m pretty sure the first time I picked a hotel was when I met up with my girlfriend in England at age 23. Actually, she probably picked it. But times have changed. “The general concept of your children influencing your vacation,” said Karen Cicero, travel editor at Parents magazine, “whether helping pick the destination or planning part of the trip, is a trend. ” I’m skeptical when people use the   but she pointed to a 2015 survey of 540 parents by YouGov for HomeAway, the vacation rental site, showing that millennial parents are more likely to let their children ages 6 to 18 pick a destination themselves, than children of older parents. It makes sense. Trip planning, these days, takes place mostly online, and children know a thing or two about the internet. Considering that Leo shops for sneakers and jackets online, looking for deals to convince his parents, the jump to hotels doesn’t seem drastic. Ms. Cicero said that social media also played a role. “My daughter is 13, and if you scroll through her Instagram feed, you’ll see pics of her friends’ vacations  —   it gets kids excited and gives them ideas. If you think back to even 10 years ago, school ended and you didn’t find out where your friends had gone until you went back. ” Involving children has benefits beyond   experience. “What this highlights is the importance of getting ” said Rainer Jenss, the president and founder of the Family Travel Association. “A lot of parents don’t consider getting their kids involved in the planning process, dictate it to them and sometimes make assumptions about what would make the kids happy. ” That can lead to   choices like Disney World or   cruises. But “if kids are involved in the decision,” he said, “they have ownership. ” I reached Leo on his cellphone as his parents drove him and Grady to a Massachusetts summer camp. “Everyone wanted to go to the Dominican Republic,” he said, “but it’s pretty expensive, so I tried to find a place that was warm and not too expensive. ” That ended up being New Orleans. He checked a weather app to make sure it wouldn’t be too cold. The hotel was trickier. He knew his parents wanted to be “close to the center but not so close that it would be so loud I couldn’t sleep,” Leo said. He had a priority as well: a pool. A web search led to Groupon. com, where he spotted a photo of Le Pavillon’s rooftop pool. He went to lepavillon. com, and noted that the hotel was “a short stroll to the French Quarter. ” And he didn’t forget the older generation. “It had kind of a French name so it sounded like Grammy might like it. ” Curious if he was on target, I emailed my father, Peter Kugel, who confirmed that his wife might be swayed by a French moniker. He signed the email “Pierre,” and cc’ed her. Some experts caution that while involving children in planning is good, there are no precise guidelines. Parents should set limits appropriate to their own children. (Allow me to interpret: Not every    is as awesome as my nephew.) “Younger kids and some teens don’t necessarily have all the tools to plan a trip in a way that would make everyone happy,” said Mark Bertin, a developmental pediatrician in Pleasantville, N. Y. “But as long as you’re aware of what your child’s really capable of, you could even involve a younger child a little bit. ” Maintaining veto power is a   but so is setting boundaries to avoid having to use it  —   perhaps by preselecting options for children to choose among. “If they make a choice that is not practical, it puts you at loggerheads,” said Dr. Karl Neumann, the pediatrician behind kidstraveldoc. com. But for children who can handle it, open planning encourages them to consider others’ preferences. That was a challenge when Maddie Bates, 15, of Sterling, Va. was put in charge (along with her brother, Tyler, 20) of the yearly family vacation  —   also for a   group of six. Greece was their pick, influenced in part by Maddie’s friends who had visited. In a phone call, Maddie described the different preferences within the group. She is into food, while her brother “likes    kind of stuff. ” Then there’s her dad, who is the reading, relaxing type. Her aunt, Philippa Hughes, is into “arts stuff. ” Maddie’s research method led her away from review sites and toward bloggers who had written narratives on trips to Greece. “It was a lot better than reading reviews on TripAdvisor,” she said, “because you knew what they were doing and how they were feeling when they went to each place. ” She also got tips from friends. To encourage family feedback, the two siblings posted suggested activities on Travefy, which allows collaborative trip planning. But up to a few days before departure, their father and aunt had barely meddled. Not so Maddie’s    Vietnamese grandmother. “I feel she’s kind of scared I’m planning,” said Maddie. “Because she’s been warning me about things she doesn’t like. She’s really just not a fan of walking. ” Being in charge was nice for Maddie, who is low on the hierarchy of her traditional Vietnamese family. “Usually, I don’t plan anything, I just go with the flow,” she said. “It’s nice to be the one planning rather than going on a trip and being like ‘I don’t know what I’m doing.’ ” She sounded more confident in her choices at 15 than Leo did at 12. “There was lots of pressure because if the hotel ended up being junky, it would be my fault,” he said. “But I got a sense of pride that I found the stuff. ” And as it turns out, everyone was happy. Not so on the trek to camp. The family was to spend the night together before the children were dropped off. I asked Leo if he helped plan that trip. “I wish I did,” he replied. “We’re staying at the Super 8. ”",0
8203,Solar-powered Pipe desalinates 1.5 billion gallons of drinking water a year for California,"Solar-powered Pipe desalinates 1.5 billion gallons of drinking water a year for California Nov 7, 2016 25 1 
Solar power and water desalination are two of the most important things to lock down in the modern age. Produces an endless source of drinking water and electricity is what we need to guide us through the unknowns of a changing climate . 
This is why an incredible project like The Pipe needs global attention. 
The machine can generate 10,000 MWh each year and additionally turn 4.5 billion liters (or 1.5 billion gallons) of salt water into drinking water in that time. 
It was unveiled at the Land Art Generator Initiative in Santa Monica, California. 
“LAGI 2016 comes to Southern California at an important time,” write Rob Ferry and Elizabeth Monoian, co-founders of the Land Art Generator Initiative . “The sustainable infrastructure that is required to meet California’s development goals and growing population will have a profound influence on the landscape. The Paris Climate Accord from COP 21 has united the world around a goal of 1.5–2° C, which will require a massive investment in clean energy infrastructure.” 
It’s an immense and beautiful structure. 
“Above, solar panels provide power to pump seawater through an electromagnetic filtration process below the pool deck, quietly providing the salt bath with its healing water and the city with clean drinking water,” the design team writes in their brief. “The Pipe represents a change in the future of water.” 
“What results are two products: pure drinkable water that is directed into the city’s primary water piping grid, and clear water with twelve percent salinity. The drinking water is piped to shore, while the salt water supplies the thermal baths before it is redirected back to the ocean through a smart release system, mitigating most of the usual problems associated with returning brine water to the sea.”",0
8204,"How This Syrian Refugee Supports 4 Wives, 22 Children is NUTS","You are here: Home / US / How This Syrian Refugee Supports 4 Wives, 22 Children is NUTS How This Syrian Refugee Supports 4 Wives, 22 Children is NUTS October 27, 2016 
Here’s a preview of Hillary’s America should she be elected president: in Germany, a Syrian refugee has four wives and 22 children that German citizens reportedly support via more £320,000 per year worth of benefits. 
The U.K. Express reported : 
The migrant, known only as Ghazia A, fled Syria last year along with his family. 
He has since resettled in Germany with his four wives and 22 of his children. One of his daughters has since moved to Saudi Arabia where she has married. 
The family could be receiving more than £320,000 a year in benefits according to a financial manager on the Employers’ Association website. 
There is no official confirmation on this figure. 
Under Islamic tradition, the 49-year-old can have up to four wives – as long as he can support them financially. 
Don’t forget everyone, all cultures are equal so you have to respect a culture that says it’s okay to have four wives and 22 children that the rest of society supports. 
Since Germany doesn’t legally recognize polygamy — being a civilized country and all (not for long) — they couldn’t all live together and get benefits. But don’t worry, Ghazia found a way to be compliant with the law and get German taxpayers on the hook for his lifestyle. Isn’t multiculturalism just swell? 
How it works is that Ghazia chose a “main wife,” and now the other three and their children get government benefits to support them. 
Ghazia, his main wife, and their five children live in Montabaur, which is located in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. His other wives and children are spread around up to 31 miles away. 
Back in Syria, Ghazia worked in a garage and car hire service, but ever since he settled in Germany and received government benefits for his family, he just can’t seem to find the time to work anymore. 
He claimed that he wants to work, but because of his religion he has to make sure he spends enough time with each family. Ghazia told German newspaper Bild: “In our religion it is my duty to visit every family and to be with them.” 
Sergei Jaufmann, a neighbor of Ghazia, said according to the Express: “The children play football in the street. The mother I often see, when [she] comes from shopping.” 
According to the Express, a social media user noted that “the Syrian with 4 women and 23 children is now being sold to us as a new normality.” 
Yes it is. This is a prime example of how globalists are actively working to tear down the western world. Refugees and immigrants aren’t expected to assimilate to the culture; the culture is expected to adapt to them. And not only that, you get to pay for it. 
Sorry, all cultures aren’t equal and people from around the world that are clamoring to get into the west — aside from the terrorists that we’re supposed to pretend aren’t abusing immigrant/refugee streams — know that full well, which is why they want to come here and take advantage of what western culture built.",0
8205,"Fake News: Wilders Slams Foreign Criminals, Media Twists Words Into Attack on All Moroccans - Breitbart","Mainstream media outlets in Britain such as the BBC and the Observer have falsely implied that   populist firebrand Geert Wilders made an attack on all Moroccan migrants in the Netherlands when he blasted foreign criminals, in headlines on their websites. [“There is a lot of Moroccan scum in Holland who make the streets unsafe” said Mr Wilders, who leads in the polls ahead of the March 15 parliamentary vote, to kick off his campaign on Saturday.  “And that should change” the Party for Freedom (PVV) figurehead said, emphasising that “not all are scum” as he attempted to take a stroll through a market. But despite Wilders making clear his remarks referred only to Moroccans who “make the streets unsafe” both the headline and first paragraph of the Observer’s report of the exchange make the claim that the   Prime Minister called all migrants from the North African country “scum”. Entitled “  leader Geert Wilders calls Moroccan migrants ‘scum’” the Observer article begins: ‘The Dutch populist leader Geert Wilders sparked outrage on Saturday when he launched his election campaign with a stinging attack on the country’s Moroccan population. The   MP called them “scum” and said he wanted to make the Netherlands “ours again’ It’s not revealed until the third paragraph, in which the   newspaper quotes the populist politician in full, that Mr Wilders specifically singled out criminal migrants in his speech. Sky’s coverage of Wilders’ remarks is similarly misleading. Under a headline which declares that “  Dutch MP Geert Wilders attacks ‘Moroccan scum’” Sky News uses the piece’s lede to tell readers: “The MP begins his election campaign by blaming the “Moroccan scum” for “making the streets of Holland unsafe. “Dutch MP Geert Wilders has launched his campaign for Holland’s top job with an attack on the country’s Moroccans” begins the article in a clear implication that the PVV figure attacked everyone living in Holland who hails from the North African nation. Britain’s public service broadcaster makes the same inference, its headline blaring: “Dutch populist Geert Wilders talks of Moroccan ‘scum’”. The populist politician, who has promised to shut mosques and bring an end to mass immigration from Muslim countries if elected, was speaking in his party’s   stronghold of Spijkenisse, just south of Rotterdam. “If you want to regain your country, if you want to make the Netherlands for the people of the Netherlands, your own home again, than you can only vote [for the PVV],” Wilders told supporters and the press. “Please, make the Netherlands ours again. ” De Volkskrant reported in 2013 that Moroccan criminals were convicted four times more than Dutch suspects. According to the country’s 2011 census, there were more than 167, 000   people in Holland, a figure that does not take into account second or   Moroccans. A report commissioned by the Dutch Ministry of Interior found that most of the Moroccan youth involved in criminal activities were born in Holland. According to the Gatestone Institute, 65 per cent all Moroccan male youths between the ages of and 12 and 23 have been detained by police at least once, with one third of this group having been detained five or more times. Mr. Wilder’s comments come as he rides high in the polls at the Netherlands approaches election day. Although other Dutch political parties have vowed to not enter into a coalition with Mr. Wilders’ Freedom Party, present polling suggests he should lead the largest party on March 16th, which may force others to soften their stance.",0
8206,Yandex Email Account Proves DNC Hacker Was NOT Russian - Jeffrey Carr,"Taming the corporate media beast Yandex Email Account Proves DNC Hacker Was NOT Russian 
Or, who in Russian intelligence doesn’t dpeak Russian? Originally appeared at Medium.com 
On March 22, 2016 William “Billy” Rhinehart, a regional field director at the Democratic National Committee, received an email from Google warning him that someone tried to access his account and that he should immediately change his password. He complied. 
Unfortunately for Mr. Rhinehart, it wasn’t Google who sent him that email. He, along with many others, were a victim of Threat Group 4127 — the SecureWorks designation for Fancy Bear (CrowdStrike), APT28 (FireEye), and Sofacy (Kaspersky Lab). Secureworks assesses that TG 4127 “is operating from the Russian Federation and is gathering intelligence on behalf of the Russian government.” 
Thanks to a bizarre twist involving Guccifer 2.0’s solicitation of a journalist at The Smoking Gun (TSG) to write about the DCLeaks emails in exchange for giving TSG an early look at some of the stolen documents, TSG was able to obtain the original spear phishing email directly from Billy Rhinehart and shared it with ThreatConnect, who posted this screenshot of the email’s headers and identified the actual sender of the email:hi.mymail@yandex.com. 1-ibuqqojl1spagetqb9oumq.png 
What’s Wrong With This Picture? 
Yandex is the Google of Russia. Like Google, Yandex is a search engine, and, like Gmail, Yandex‘s users can open a free email account. 
When you visit Yandex.ru and create a new email account, the email assigned to you has the .ru domain. However, hi.mymail@yandex.com has a .com domain. There’s only one reason why something like that would happen, but first, here’s what a Russian user would see when he creates a Yandex email account on RUNET (the Russian Internet). 
Step One: Pretend that you‘re in Russia 
Secureworks says that you work on behalf of the Russian government. CrowdStrike says that you’re an employee of the Russian government. And everyone else believes that you’re Russian so for this little experiment to work, you need to be on the Russian Internet.

8208,Knifeman on the Run After Four People Stabbed in Frankfurt Train Station,"By wmw_admin on November 1, 2016 News Brief — Oct 31, 2016 Frankfurt central station. Click to enlarge On Sunday a knife wielding attacker stabbed four people in Frankfurt’s Hauptwache train station. At this stage the motive for the stabbings is still unknown and the assailant is still on the run. Frankfurt Police confirmed all four victims were still in hospital. However, the police have yet to issue any description of the attacker or any eyewitness accounts of the attacks. All of which prompts this writer to wonder why? Normally following such incidents police release an impression of the attacker based on victims description. But this time German police have released no such information, not even a photofit of the alleged attacker. Although it is still unclear who was responsible or what their motive was, the attacks follow a spate of similar attacks carried out by migrants and asylum seekers in Germany. In addition to a wave of sexual assaults that accompanied the migrant influx, more overtly politically motivated attacks have also been carried out. All of which have called into question Angela Merkel’s open-door immigration policy. A week of violence that rocked Germany began in mid July when Pakistani teenager Riaz Khan Ahmadzai, 17, posing as an Afghan refugee, hacked at passengers on a train in Wurzburg with an axe, wounding five. He was shot dead by police. Four days later mentally disturbed German-Iranian teenager Ali Sonboly shot nine dead during a rampage through a Munich shopping centre before taking his own life. Although the authorities said that there was no terrorist motive for the attack and that Sonboly had acted in response to bullying, that didn’t stop many Germans from arriving at their own conclusions. Two days later a Syrian refugee, 21, hacked a pregnant woman to death in Reutlingen and on the same night a 27year-old Syrian refugee injured 12 people when he detonated a rucksack packed with metal shards and screws in Ansbach. The bomber was also killed by the blast. However, in a message left on his mobile phone he claimed that the attack had been carried out on behalf of ISIS as an act of revenge against Germans . More deaths had been narrowly averted after the bomber was turned away by security guards at a music festival and instead detonated his rucksack bomb outside a nearby wine bar. Earlier this month the town of Chemitz went into lockdown after police raided the flat of Syrian refugee Jaber Albakr, who is alleged to have been plotting a terror attack on a German airport. All of which leaves us wondering: why no photofit or eyewitness description from the Frankfurt attack? In fact since the attack occurred on Sunday and the attacker went on the run there have been no further updates. Nothing. Almost as if a news blackout were being imposed. Ed",0
8209,Washington Post Blind Item: FBI Russia Probe Expands to WH Adviser ’Close to the President’,"The Washington Post has published a “blind item” White House report  —   where not only its sources but the subject of the article is anonymous. [Using “people familiar with the matter” as sources, the Post’s Devlin Barrett and Matt Zapotosky report that the investigation into the Trump campaign and its connections to Russia “has identified a current White House official as a significant person of interest, showing that the probe is reaching the highest levels of government. ”  The person is a senior White House adviser “close to the president,” but the unnamed sources would not identify that official, the Post reported. “The sources emphasized that investigators remain keenly interested in people who previously wielded influence in the Trump campaign and administration but are no longer part of it, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort,” the Post reported. However, the story says, “people familiar with the investigation said the intensifying effort does not mean criminal charges are near, or that any such charges will result. ” White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer emphasized the lack of evidence of collusion in a statement responding to the Post’s story. “As the President has stated before  —   a thorough investigation will confirm that there was no collusion between the campaign and any foreign entity,” the statement said. The Post published this story as President Donald Trump is on his way to Saudi Arabia on the first leg of multiple state visits, his first trip abroad since he took office. Earlier this week, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III to serve as special counsel and lead the investigation going forward.  ",0
8210,Zakharova: The US is protecting Al-Nusra from being destroyed,"November 4, 2016 - Fort Russ News -  RIA Novosti - translated by J. Arnoldski - 


The US should get rid of the illusion that there is the possibility of “taming” terrorists, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova stated.  
“Terrorism is like a snake: you turn your back on it and it bites you. Don’t play with it,” she said in an interview to China Radio International. 
Zakharova remarked that Western and regional countries have invested a lot of forces and means in terrorist groupings. 
“But these are terrorists, and they shouldn’t be flirted with,” Zakharova added. 
In the diplomat’s opinion, the actions of the American side, which is not allowing Jebat Al-Nusra to be destroyed, “are a clear manifestation of the fact that they are protecting it.”  

Zakharova also noted that this is not the first time that Russia is clashing with such an approach by the US.

8211,Fandor: A Streaming Rabbit Hole Worth Falling Down - The New York Times,"“Drama. ” “ . ” “Thriller. ” “ . ” If you’re searching for a movie to watch on a streaming site, and you filter by genre, those are among the words you’ll see right away. Pretty straightforward, yes. Intrepid or surprising, not in the least. The Fandor experience is quite different. Based in San Francisco, Fandor combines breathtaking eclecticism with an   platform that’s an exemplary example of the digitization of   culture. Search for a film in the “ ” genre, and you’ll get 18 pages with 18 choices on each, but there are even more options: The top of the page has links to 10 other very specific subgenres, including “Martial Arts,” “Sword and Sandal,” “Wilderness” and “Treasure Hunting. ” You can also refine your search by checking off from a list of about 30 countries, or toggle between film durations (shortest to longest) and years of release (oldest to most recent). Going down the Fandor rabbit hole is the most fun I’ve had with a streaming website in a while. While “Documentary” isn’t the first place I look when exploring movies on streaming sites, one recent afternoon two of the many documentaries the service offers jumped out at me. The first was “Komeda: A Soundtrack for a Life. ” This 2010 short feature directed by Claudia   tells the life story of Krzysztof Komeda, the Polish jazz musician and film score composer whose life came to a freakishly tragic end not too long after he went to Hollywood to work on his friend Roman Polanski’s first American film, “Rosemary’s Baby. ” The next documentary was Mark Rappaport’s “Debra Paget, for Example,” from 2015, a study of the onetime 20th Century Fox contract bombshell best known for her work with Elvis Presley and Fritz Lang. Not all of the documentaries are so   but this is a site that rewards buffs capable of appreciating the tendrils of its library and how it’s organized. Returning to “” the selection under that rubric reflects a wide and arguably generous interpretation of the category. There’s the searing 1980 military saga “Breaker Morant” and the 2001   cult item “Ichi the Killer. ” There’s John Ford’s seminal “Stagecoach” Ted V. Mikels’s    evergreen, “Ten Violent Women” and “The Wild Geese,” a  ’70s mercenary (in every sense of the term)   action picture in which Richard Harris and Richard Burton phone it in while Roger Moore does his usual level best. According to Gail Gendler, the head of programming at Fandor, the site’s goal is to maintain access to 6, 000 titles (more or less) at any given time, even as titles come and go. “We want to present a canon for film fanatics and millennial movie lovers,” Ms. Gendler said in a phone interview. She was quick to point out that the site, which started in 2011, functions as a vital bridge between cult and mainstream. “We have the first film by Damien Chazelle and the first film by Barry Jenkins,” she said, citing two filmmakers who had good showings at this year’s Academy Awards. (Those are “Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench” by Mr. Chazelle, the “La La Land” director, and “My Josephine” by Mr. Jenkins, the “Moonlight” director both are well worth checking out.) “We have early work by Kelly Reichardt, one of the most vital indie filmmakers in the United States. ” Speaking to Ms. Gendler about the site’s remarkable menus, I mentioned that while looking through Fandor’s L. G. B. T. Q. page, I found “Out 1,” French director Jacques Rivette’s   experimental drama from 1971, a picture that I never considered as thematically L. G. B. T. Q. But thinking about how one of that film’s characters, a street hustler played by Juliet Berto, struggles with identity questions throughout her story line, it occurred to me that perhaps I had been looking at the film narrowly. “We’re always having interesting arguments internally about genre and tagging systems. ” she said. “Does one category contain too many films or not enough films is one aspect of the discussion. But often times where we place a given film offers an opportunity for conversation with the film community of both subscribers and nonsubscribers who look at the editorial and social part of the site, or on the Facebook page. We want to make the experience not just about viewing, but connecting with other film lovers. ” To that end, the editorial side of the site, Keyframe, has a great asset in the correspondent David Hudson, who deftly aggregates film news, connecting readers to outside material while maintaining a reliable and witty voice and displaying a   sensibility. Keyframe itself offers a lot of video essays, with topics recently ranging from a profile of the silent film pioneer Alice   to a primer on the “chopped and screwed” genre of   featured on the soundtrack of “Moonlight. ” Also contributing to what Ms. Gendler calls a “once you get there, it’s hard to leave” aim, the site features monthly “Spotlights,” which gather library films under occasionally timely topics. February, for instance, featured 2017 Oscar nominees, with work by Mr. Jenkins Mr. Chazelle and Maren Ade, whose “Toni Erdmann” was a nominee for best foreign language film. Sometimes the topics are just topics, as in last month’s “Twenty Something,” with titles from Bertrand Blier’s corrosive      “Going Places” (  a young and hunky Gérard Depardieu in 1974) to Sean Baker’s “Starlet” (2012) about an aimless young woman in the fringes of California’s porn industry (a very fringy place to be). This month, a nod to the Tribeca Film Festival comes in the form of a “New York films” spotlight. The company is expanding into the funding and production of original documentary shorts  —   one of which, “Gut Hack,” is having a premiere as a New York Times   on Monday, April 10  —   and anticipating more good things from a deal with Amazon, offering the service at a slightly reduced rate for Amazon Video subscribers. (Fandor’s   monthly fee is $10.) “That’s wonderful for us,” Ms Gendler said. “Any platform wants more growth. And we’re hungry to build our subscription base. ” I’d say the site deserves that.",0

8214,Joint Way Forward Deal Does Not Lead to Peace or Progress for Afghans,"Joint Way Forward Deal Does Not Lead to Peace or Progress for Afghans   Nazifa Alizada Afghans protest in Stockholm against the Joint Way Forward deal with signs that read: “Do not sell us for money.” (Shahmama and Salsal National Association (SANSA)) 
I was born in Ghazni province of Afghanistan but have no memories of my birthplace. When I was 3, the Taliban took over and forced me and my family to flee the country. I was too little to realize any of this. I still have a blurred image of an old orange bus, a loaf of bread, and rugged, dusty mountains. 
As I grew older, my mother explained that the bus belonged to my father, and we did not attempt to migrate to Iran at first. The Soviet invasion and the Afghan civil war taught people of my village how to protect themselves when crises get heated. The men would move their women and children to the dark, moist undergrounds immediately and make them stay there until the situation calmed down. We were not lucky enough to fit in the underground this time. We passed two days in a mountain—the blurred mountain, in my mind—and hopelessly moved toward Iran. 
My Afghan identity took my precious childhood from me. In Iran, I refrained from playing with other kids since they would mock my Afghan accent. I preferred to stay home to avoid hearing “Afghani kesafat,” or “Afghani Ashghal,” literally meaning “the garbage Afghan,” on the street. 
  
When I turned 7, schools refused to let me attend because I was an undocumented Afghan migrant. I enrolled in a school run by refugees for refugees and did my primary schooling there. But the school lacked human and capital resources to offer classes beyond seventh grade, and an undocumented Afghan refugee could not get any further education. Constant insults, seclusion and deprivation of the right to a quality education were the gifts Iran provided me in my childhood. 
In 2001, upon the fall of the Taliban regime, my family and I returned to Afghanistan. At first glance, Kabul resembled anything but a city. Crumbled walls, broken glass, burned buildings, dusty roads and bullet shells on the streets all were evidence of the war. We did not expect a war-weary city to be any better. Yet one thing lured us into returning: safety and the hope for a better future. The Joint Way Forward deal between the European Union and Afghanistan misses this crucial point. 
In early October, the Afghan government and the EU signed this bilateral deal, which facilitates deportation of thousands of Afghan asylum seekers. In return, the EU promised to continue its generous aid package to Afghanistan. The deal promises job creation for returnees, emphasizes reintegration and resettlement programs, and ensures the safe return of vulnerable groups, in particular unaccompanied minors and women. 
None of these factors are enough to prevent hundreds of thousands of Afghans from taking the perilous journey toward Europe without a guarantee of security. After the fall of the Taliban, thousands of Afghan families returned to the war-torn country despite being aware of the existing limited opportunities. 
Peace, hope for the future and stability were the factors which drove Afghans back to their homeland for the first time since 2001. The irony is that the lack of these very notions in 2015 made thousands of others abandon the country. With more than 11,000 civilian casualties, 2015 is the worst year in terms of security since the fall of the Taliban. 
The Joint Way Forward is based on the illusion that Afghanistan is safe. Kunduz, one of the country’s major cities, fell into the hands of the Taliban for the second time this year. The war forced hundreds to flee the city, while hundreds of others remained defenseless and stuck. 
In Badghis, a northwestern province, at least 60 police officers surrendered to the Taliban with their guns and resources. Three districts of Farah, a western province, already are ruled by insurgents. The Taliban rules many districts of Helmand province, and active war goes on in the city every so often. 
Nengarhar, Paktia, Paktika, Ghazni, and most other provinces are no better. Even the shortest highways—such as the Kabul-Ghazni, or Kabul-Wardak, routes—are controlled by the Taliban. Unknown numbers of people are being kidnapped or killed based on ethnic and religious reasons, or for having ties with foreign or government officials, on a regular basis. 
At least three bombs have exploded in different areas of Kabul since the deal was signed. By considering Afghanistan safe, despite the ongoing turmoil, the EU flinches from its humanitarian responsibility. 
Afghans have fled uncertainty, insecurity and the abusive policies of their government with the hopes of establishing a better life for themselves in Europe. They never imagined they would risk their entire lives to be sold back to the government they just escaped. More than a mere failure of security in Afghanistan, the EU-Afghan deal is a failure of humanity. 
Most EU countries warn their citizens against travelling to Afghanistan and mark it unsafe on their Foreign Affairs website. If it is not safe for EU citizens to spend a few days in Afghanistan, how is it safe for Afghans to live their whole lives there? Such deals reinforce double standards and spotlight how differently people’s lives are valued in today’s world. 
Europe’s decision to deport Afghans is hasty, unconstructive and shortsighted. People’s lives are being endangered for a second time. Statistics show that a great number of previous deportees already have attempted to return to Europe through Balkan routes. Many others lack social support to stay in Afghanistan after migrating to Europe from Pakistan or Iran. 
The deal is also unproductive for Europe, since it could lead to a repeat of the 2015 refugee crisis. 
The current bilateral EU-Afghan deal will be a colossal failure unless the EU forces the Afghan government to prioritize security. Dealing with corruption and regaining people’s trust is the next big move to push people back to their homeland. 
The developed world should not use aid as a negotiating tool to pressurize poorer nations. 
People’s lives are not political capital.

8215,Microsoft Outlook to introduce ‘Hillary’ button to delete emails ‘en masse’,"Tuesday 1 November 2016 by Pete Redfern Microsoft Outlook to introduce ‘Hillary’ button to delete emails ‘en masse’ 
Microsoft has today announced that the next version of their popular email software will include a function that quickly and irretrievably deletes every email on the computer. 
Head of product development Simon Williams announced, “With the FBI investigating Hillary Clinton’s emails, we have recognised the need for a quick one-click button that will instantly remove all emails from your PC. 
“This will be useful if you suddenly find yourself under investigation by the FBI. Or if you’ve had a bit of a flirty email exchange with that girl from accounts who you felt you had a bit of chemistry with, but then you took it a bit too far that one time and now suddenly realise you are in grave danger of being dismissed for sexual harassment. 
“You know, everyday sort of situations.” 
The new Microsoft Office suite is due to be released next year, and Outlook is reportedly not the only software with a Clinton inspired update. 
“We’ve tweaked Internet Explorer a little too,” continued Mr Williams. 
“For those users who routinely forget to use InPrivate Browsing, we will be adding a ‘Bill’ button which with one click will simultaneously close your browsing window and delete all of your search history and cookies. 
“This will protect you from your wife ever knowing that you googled ‘What is Monica Lewinsky up to these days’. 
“Or in the case of a regular user it will prevent your spouse finding out whatever niche, depraved pornography you are into when she unexpectedly returns from a work social an hour early and catches you mid self-pleasure. 
“Again, just normal, everyday situations our customers find themselves in.”

8216,"Obamacare Options? In Many Parts of Country, Only One Insurer Will Remain - The New York Times","So much for choice. In many parts of the country, Obamacare customers will be down to one insurer when they go to sign up for coverage next year on the public exchanges. A central tenet of the federal health law was to offer a range of affordable health plans through competition among private insurers. But a wave of insurer failures and the recent decision by several of the largest companies, including Aetna, to exit markets are leaving large portions of the country with functional monopolies for next year. According to an analysis done for The Upshot by the McKinsey Center for U. S. Health System Reform, 17 percent of Americans eligible for an Affordable Care Act plan may have only one insurer to choose next year. The analysis shows that there are five entire states currently set to have one insurer, although our map also includes two more states because the plans for more carriers are not final. By comparison, only 2 percent of eligible customers last year had only one choice. A similar analysis by Avalere Health, another consulting firm, also highlighted the increase in areas with only one insurance carrier. The market is still in some flux. Final contracts between insurers and the federal government won’t be signed until late September. That means it is still possible that additional insurers will choose to enter new markets between now and then, and the competitive picture could improve. It is also possible that some carriers will decide to exit. It was just this week that Aetna surprised regulators and others with the news that it was leaving most of the markets where it offered policies on the exchange, leaving it in just four states. The Obama administration says it is too early to evaluate competition in the Obamacare markets for 2017. Marjorie Connolly, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said: “A number of steps remain before the full picture of marketplace competition and prices are known. Regardless, we remain confident that the majority of marketplace consumers will have multiple choices and will be able to select a plan for less than $75 per month when Open Enrollment begins Nov. 1. ” Many places in the country still have robust choice and competition, including many large population centers like Denver, Los Angeles, New York and Miami. But large areas have limited choice, like the five states that now have only one issuer: Alabama, Alaska, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wyoming. (Our map also shows Kansas and North Carolina with only one, but the picture may change for parts of those states, because additional insurers have said they plan to enter.) Large sections of other states may also be down to one carrier, including Florida, Utah and Missouri. It also appears that there is one county in Arizona, Pinal County, between Phoenix and Tucson, where no carriers are set to offer health plans in the marketplace. While the dwindling competition may not be fatal, “it isn’t ideal,” conceded Larry Levitt, a senior executive at the Kaiser Family Foundation. People shopping for plans in the exchanges will be left with fewer insurer choices but also, probably, fewer choices of doctors and hospitals because the companies that remain will most likely offer sharply narrow networks. Evidence from the first years of the marketplace suggests that consumers benefit from more plan choices. According to a study from researchers at the Urban Institute, more competitive markets tended to have lower premiums. “It’s important to have competition in the exchange markets, both to have consumer choice and to keep premiums competitive,” said Caroline Pearson, a senior vice president at Avalere Health. But it is unclear whether competitive markets are causing lower premiums, or whether the kinds of places attractive to insurance carriers  —   those with many healthy customers and a broad range of doctors and hospitals  —   may simply be easier places to offer   insurance. A rule in the health law limits how much of their premiums insurers can keep for overhead and profits, which may hinder a monopoly insurer’s ability to overcharge, even in the absence of competition. The exodus has left some states in flux, with regulators and remaining insurers trying to stabilize the market. In North Carolina, the exit of the UnitedHealth Group and Aetna has left BlueCross Blue Shield of North Carolina to serve the exchange. The plan says it lost $405 million in 2014 and 2015 on the exchanges, and its chief executive, Brad Wilson, is concerned about the market. The insurer has sought sharply higher premiums for next year. “Consistently losing money on these plans ultimately puts all of our customers and our business at risk,” he said. Insurers say the current rush to the exits underscores their contention that changes need to be made to the law. The decline in participation “echoes our calls for Congress and the administration to move forward with solutions that will improve the stability of the market and provide the affordable coverage options that consumers need,” said Clare Krusing, a spokeswoman for the America’s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group. The McKinsey analysis is based on detailed information about the number of carriers in regions of the country known as ratings areas. In 17 states, as well as Washington, D. C. analysts had full information about carriers intending to sell insurance next year. For the rest of the country, the analysts used complete data from 2016, then updated the information whenever an insurer announced publicly that it was leaving an entire state. Our map does not show places where insurers have exited only portions of those states, and so may show more carriers in some areas than there will be. Nor does it take account of carriers’ promises to enter portions of states that have not yet published filings for 2017. The Affordable Care Act has changed a lot about the individual insurance market  —   opening it to people even if they had previous illnesses, guaranteeing a standard package of covered services and providing   subsidies to help   Americans buy their own plans. But when it comes to competition and choice, the markets may look very much the way they did before the enactment of the law, with regions and even whole states dominated by a single insurance company, typically a Blue Cross plan. The Blue Cross plans traditionally played the role of the insurer of last resort, said Timothy Jost, an emeritus law professor at Washington and Lee who has closely followed the progress of the law. “They will be the last people to leave the marketplace,” he said.",0
8217,5.4-magnitude earthquake jolts central Italy,"The photo taken on October 4, 2016, shows destruction in the village of Amatrice that was rattled by an earthquake on August 24. (Photo by AFP) 
An earthquake measuring 5.4 on the Richter scale has hit central Italy, including the capital Rome. 
Italy's national geophysics institute said the quake struck at a depth of nine kilometers in the Macerata area of the central region of Marche on Wednesday. 
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) confirmed the magnitude, saying the epicenter was seven kilometers south-southwest of Visso village in Macerata. 
There was no information immediately available about potential casualties or damage caused by the quake, which was felt in the towns of Pescara, Ancone and L'Aquila, which was jolted by a 6.3-magnitude quake in 2009 that killed over 300 people. 
Wednesday’s quake rattled windows and doors in the capital of Rome. 
The quake comes about two months after nearly 300 people were killed as a strong earthquake hit central Italy. 
On August 24, a powerful earthquake measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale hit Italy, and almost flattened scores of towns and villages in the central parts. The quake was followed by a series of aftershocks, the strongest of which measured 4.2, rattling the already hit areas. Loading ...",0
8219,"Re: The U.S. Will Lose Global Reserve Status, Expect 80-90% Devaluation Of the U.S. Dollar","Email 
In the following interview with the X22Report Spotlight report, Dr. Jim Willie unleashes with both guns blazing on a subject I’ve been warning about for about for over two years now, which is the loss the U.S. Dollar’s status as the World’s Global Reserve Currency. 
For the simple fact that no one under the age of 70 has never known a planet earth where the U.S. Dollar has not been the World’s Reserve Currency, most Americans in particular have no idea what it will mean when we lose that status. 
The subject is not one that is taught in schools until well into the graduate school level in most cases, so unless a person has done independent research on the subject, the average American cannot comprehend how painful it will be for individual American families not IF, but WHEN the inevitable finally happens. 
Losing the World Reserve Currency status is a process, just like losing the world’s faith in the U.S. was a process. Both are processes that have been well underway for the better part of the last two decades, especially this past decade. Roughly ten years ago, 75% of global trade was denominated in U.S. Dollars, and that makes sense. After all, we’ve been the Reserve Currency. 
Over the last ten years, that figure has dropped to roughly 35% of all global trade which is now settled in U.S. Dollars, because countries are rushing to distance themselves from the U.S. for many of the reasons Dr. Willie outlines in another interview from earlier today titled, Dr. Jim Willie: Unprecedented Bond Dumping Means U.S. Dollar Collapse Ahead . 
The bottom line is this: The U.S. has grossly abused its privilege of being the World Reserve Currency, largely because we've adopted the practice of monetizing our debt by printing money out of thin air. Giving that process a fancy name like Quantitative Easing, doesn't change the reality of what it is. We print money out of thin air, and rip-off every country we've borrowed from when we pay them back with Dollars worth less than the ones we borrowed. 
Now, the world has lost all faith in the only thing that backs the U.S. Dollar in the first place: The Full Faith and Credit of the United States Government. In the interview, Dr. Willie gives a BLISTERING account of what to expect. He begins the first 30 seconds of the interview by explaining how once the U.S. Dollar is finished being phased out, a process that as I’ve said is well underway, he expects the Dollar to experience a massive currency devaluation of 30% almost instantly. 
After the initial devaluation of 30%, Dr. Willie expects there to be another another 30% devaluation six to eight months down the road, followed by a long series of 20% devaluations over the next several years, until we reach a point in about 4-5 years when our currency is completely devalued, and worth about 10% of what it is today. 
For a country with a trade deficit of over $500 BILLION, and as a country that imports over 50% of our food… that means conditions Americans once considered to be unthinkable here in the United States, will soon become ordinary. Let that sink in for a moment. The unthinkable will become ordinary. The time to prepare is now. Brace yourself for a very intense interview… one of Dr. Willie’s most intense ever! 
DO NOT MISS THE SECOND VIDEO BELOW WITH CANADIAN BILLIONAIRE NED GOODMAN, AS HE LECTURES ON THE COMING COLLAPSE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR! 

As individual Americans or as families, in the past when we’ve heard news from pundits or politicians talking about issues like trade deficits, bad trade deals, or the federal debt, many times what we hear goes in one ear and out the other, because many of us cannot SEE or FEEL how those reports affect our families on a daily basis, or in our every day lives. 
The loss of the Reserve Currency is not something that might happen. It’s not something that could happen. It’s an eventually that there’s no chance of avoiding. That ship set sail far too long ago to fix the damage already done, and what lies ahead. It’s not an event where a vote is taken, and we’ll lose the status over night thanks to anything done by a U.N. vote, or by our own politicians in Washington. What's done is done, now it just has to play out. 
As explained, it’s a process, and it’s well underway. I could not be more serious when I say that conditions Americans once considered to be unthinkable in the United States, will soon become ordinary. If you’re fortunate enough to still be working, and you have an income, do not squander your opportunity to protect your family. Begin preparing. There is a reason Peter Schiff has said: The Collapse of the Dollar Will Be the Single Biggest Event In All of Human History . 
How The Coming Dollar Collapse Will Leave Americans Destitute 
An increasing number of financial experts are saying the United States dollar is no longer a reliable and dependable currency – and that its downfall is inevitable. There are even some experts who think the dollar is so unstable that the Chinese Yuan will soon become the world’s reserve currency, or currency of choice. 
“Our addictions to debt and cheap money have finally caused our major international creditors to call for an end to dollar hegemony and to push for a ‘de-Americanized’ world,” investment advisor and financial strategist Micheal Pento wrote in an op-ed piece for CNBC . 
Others agree. 
“In my view the dollar is about to become dethroned as the world’s defacto currency basically,” Canadian billionaire investor Ned Goodman said. “We’re headed to a period of stagflation , maybe serious inflation , and the United States will be losing the privilege of being able to print at its will the global reserve currency.” 
Goodman believes the US already is in another recession. The unemployment numbers are understated and the “real” unemployment number likely is closer to 15 percent, he said. 
Over half of 200 international institutional investors surveyed by the Economist think that the Yuan will eventually replace the dollar as the world’s reserve currency. The reserve currency is the money most commonly accepted for international trade. 

Why Reserve Currencies Matter 
Having money with a reserve currency status enables a nation to dominate and control the world’s financial markets, as their currency is used for international trade and transactions. The US has the ability to maintain a $17 trillion national debt largely because the dollar is the reserve currency. 
A nation with a reserve currency can simply print money to pay its debts. 
In past centuries nations such as Britain, France, Spain, the Netherlands, and Portugal lost their status as super powers in part when their money lost reserve currency status. Reserve currencies collapse because people no longer trust or believe in the governments that issue them. 
Goodman says that the US dollar became the reserve currency in the 1970s because Saudi Arabia agreed to only accept only the dollar as payment for oil. Goodman noted that at least one major producer, Russia, is now accepting Yuan in payment for oil. 
Goodman was referring to a deal that Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin made last May. Under the terms of deal, Russian companies can borrow money directly from China in exchange for oil. 
The US dollar once was backed by gold and silver, Goodman said, but now is “backed by nothing.” 
Australia Starts Using Yuan 
One of America’s oldest and closest allies may have taken the first step to ending the dollar’s reign as the reserve currency. CNBC reported that the Yuan will now be traded in Australia’s financial markets. Among other things that will let Chinese customers pay Australian firms in Yuan. China is the biggest market for Australia’s exports such as iron and coal. 
Story continues below video 

The Australian government has endorsed the deal because China is Australia’s biggest trading partner. Arthur Sinodinos, Australia’s Assistant Treasurer (treasury secretary) even went on CNBC’s Asia Squawk Box show to endorse the deal. 
“It’s a big vote of confidence by both countries in the future of the relationship,” Sinodinos said. Not even recent economic problems in China seemed to dampen Sinodinos’ enthusiasm for the arrangement. 
“There’s no doubt that the Chinese authorities are having to manage issues in the financial sector to make sure that growth is sustained, but they’ve shown great skill at that in the past they were very adept at the fallout from the global financial crisis,” Sinodinos said. In other words, Sinokinos believes the Chinese are doing a very good job of managing their economy and their currency is reliable. 

How will the Dethroning of the Dollar Affect You? 
Observers disagree widely on how the end of the dollar’s reign as reserve currency would affect the US economy and average Americans. Retired neurosurgeon and pundit Dr. Ben Carson thinks it would turn the US into a third world nation and lead to unrest that would lead to martial law, as Off The Grid News recently reported. 
Goodman believes there will soon be a massive sell off of US dollars that will lead to inflation. He also suggested a way for people to protect their assets. 
“The Chinese have three and a half trillion US dollars and they’re spending these dollars as quickly as they can, and it will not be long before the rest of the world and the US will be thinking likewise. I do.” Goodman said. 
In the 1930s, everyone wanted US dollars, he said, but today they’re trying to get rid of them. He thinks that many investors are trying to spend all of their dollars to buy hard assets in order to avoid losing money invested in dollars. 
That means average people might be able to protect themselves by investing in hard assets such as gold, real estate or silver, Goodman said.

8221,There Are More White Voters Than People Think. That’s Good News for Trump. - The New York Times,"One of the biggest reasons Donald Trump is considered to be a long shot to win the presidency is the diversity of the country. As Joe Scarborough of MSNBC put it, “There are not enough white voters in America for Donald Trump to win while getting routed among minorities. ” But a growing body of evidence suggests that there is still a path, albeit a narrow one, for Mr. Trump to win without gains among nonwhite voters. New analysis by The Upshot shows that millions more white, older   voters went to the polls in 2012 than was found by exit polls on Election Day. This raises the prospect that Mr. Trump has a larger pool of potential voters than generally believed. The wider path may help explain why Mr. Trump is competitive in early general election surveys against Hillary Clinton. And it calls into question the prevailing demographic explanation of recent elections, which held that Barack Obama did very poorly among whites and won only because young and minority voters turned out in record numbers. This story line led Republicans to conclude that they had maximized their support from white voters and needed to reach out to Hispanics to win in 2016. Those previous conclusions emerged from exit polls released on election night. The new data from the census, voter registration files, polls and the finalized results tells a subtly different story with potential consequences for the 2016 election. The data implies that Mr. Obama was not as weak among white voters as typically believed. He fared better than his predecessors among white voters outside the South. Demographic shifts weren’t so important: He would have been   even with an electorate as old and white as it was in 2004. Latino voters did not put Mr. Obama over the top, as many argued in the days after Mr. Obama’s  . He would have won even if he had done as poorly among Latino voters as John Kerry. This is all good news for Mr. Trump. There’s more room for him to make gains among white   voters than many assumed  —   enough to win without making gains among nonwhite or   white voters. But Mr. Trump’s narrow path could close if he loses ground among   voters and alienates even more nonwhite voters than Mitt Romney did four years ago. His ratings among these groups remain poor, and he continues to draw fresh criticism, most recently for saying the judge overseeing a lawsuit against Trump University is biased because of his Mexican heritage. When you hear about the demographic challenges facing the Republican Party, almost all of the data comes from exit polls: surveys conducted with tens of thousands of voters at precincts across the country on Election Day, along with a supplemental telephone survey with early voters. The exit polls are excellent surveys. But like any survey, they’re imperfect. The problem is that analysts, including me, have treated the exit polls like a precise account of the electorate. “There are campaigns and journalists who take the exit polls as the word of God about the shape of the electorate and their voting propensities,” said Michael McDonald, a political scientist at the University of Florida who researches voter turnout. “They’re meant to tell us why people voted. They’re not designed to tell us much about the demographic profile of the electorate. ” The exit polls have a series of subtle biases that depict a younger,   and more diverse electorate. Mr. McDonald tentatively reached this conclusion in 2005, and the pattern has been seen in a broader set of data. The evidence for a whiter,   and older electorate comes from two main sources. The first  —   and    —   source of alternative data is the Current Population Survey, known as the C. P. S. Conducted by the Census Bureau, it is the same monthly survey that yields the unemployment report. After elections, it includes a question about whether people voted. A second source is the   voter file: a compilation of local records on every American who has registered to vote, including address, age and whether the person voted in a given election. The voter file data used for analysis here comes from Catalist, a Democratic data firm that offers an academic subscription. Researchers have found that the data is unbiased and more accurate than public voting records. These sources show a 2012 electorate that was far whiter, older and less educated than the exit polls indicated. Over all, the exit polls suggest that 23 percent of voters in 2012 were white, over age 45 and without a college degree. Catalist puts this group at 29 percent, and the census at 30 percent  —   implying 10 million more voters than the 23 percent figure. What’s the best estimate? That’s a matter for debate. “The truth, if you could ever get to it, is probably somewhere between the three measures,” said Joe Lenski, the vice president at Edison Research, who runs the exit poll, “because they all have their faults. ” They do have their faults. Just about every year, the census reports more people voted than actually did  —   especially in Southern states with a large black population. The census also has a challenge with people who decline to say whether they voted. Things can go wrong with the voter file, too, if, say, the state erred in data entry or updates. The models are imperfect as well. But for many experts in the field, these issues pale next to those facing the exit polls. For Bernard Fraga, a professor of political science at Indiana University, there is “no question that the exit poll is not as accurate. ” He added, “It’s clearly much more reliable to look at the C. P. S. or even better to look at the voter   work. ” Today, virtually all major campaign polling, voter targeting and election law litigation is conducted using voter file data. The actual results also tend to imply that the census and Catalist figures make a lot more sense in many of the cases where the disagreements are greatest. Take Ohio, where the exit polls show that the black share of the electorate increased by four percentage points to more than 15 percent of voters in 2012. If these figures are taken as precise, it would imply that nearly 250, 000 more black voters turned out than in 2008, with the turnout reaching 88 percent of adult black citizens. There is no trace of this kind of surge in turnout in the actual result. The black turnout in Cleveland actually dropped  —   to 55 percent of adult citizens. This type of story repeats itself across the battlegrounds. It also plays out with age, where the exit polls imply that youth turnout was higher than turnout among seniors with education, where the exit polls show that more college graduates voted than actually live in America or Hispanics, where the exit polls show that white and Hispanic turnout was nearly equal, despite decades of evidence to the contrary. You can see more of this data here. The larger number of white   voters implies that Democrats are far more dependent on winning white   voters, and therefore more vulnerable to a populist candidate like Mr. Trump. Over all, 34 percent of Mr. Obama’s supporters were white voters without a college degree, compared with 25 percent in the exit polls, according to an Upshot statistical model that integrated census data, actual results and 15, 000 interviews from various   surveys. The model yields a full alternative to the exit polls that assume an older, whiter electorate like the one depicted by the census. (For those interested in the details about our estimates, we’ve written a technical sidebar.) “This is a great way to deal with the limits of traditional surveys,” said Andrew Gelman, a professor at Columbia who popularized the statistical technique known as multilevel regression and  . “It smooths out noise, reduces bias and arrives at better estimates for smaller groups. ” Mr. Obama’s dependence among white voters might seem surprising in light of the 2012 postelection consensus. But it won’t be surprising if you think just a little further back  —   to the   story line. Mr. Obama’s advantage heading into the election was thought to be a “Midwestern Firewall”  —   a big edge in Midwestern battlegrounds where white   voters supported the auto bailout and were skeptical of Mr. Romney, who was criticized for his time at Bain Capital. The   story line was tossed aside when the national exit polls showed an electorate that was even more diverse than it was in 2008, while showing Mr. Obama faring worse among white voters than any Democrat since Walter Mondale in 1984. But the Upshot analysis shows that all of Mr. Obama’s weaknesses were in the South  —   defined as the former Confederacy plus Oklahoma, Missouri, Kentucky and West Virginia  —   where he won just 26 percent. Outside the South, he won 46 percent of white voters, even running ahead of Mr. Kerry and Al Gore in earlier elections. Many of the regions where Mr. Obama lost ground in white areas outside the South  —   like the   areas of North Dakota or Appalachia, Mormon Utah, culturally Southern stretches of Southern Illinois, or Mr. Kerry and Mr. Romney’s home state of Massachusetts  —   were exceptions that proved the rule. The Upshot obtained similar estimates for 2012 from Mr. Ghitza, who matched polling data to the Catalist voter registration file, in his dissertation on the use of big data in politics. Mr. Ghitza found similar figures as The Upshot’s estimates using different data sets and different models. Demographics Overrated. The data implies that demographic shifts played a somewhat smaller role in Mr. Obama’s   than the postelection narrative suggested. Even if the electorate were as old and as white as it was in 2004, Mr. Obama would have won, because of the gains he made among white voters in states like New Mexico, Colorado and Iowa. Hispanic voters played only a modest role in Mr. Romney’s defeat. They cost him Florida  —   a   state for Republicans, but also the closest contest. Elsewhere, Mr. Obama would have easily survived even if Mr. Romney had equaled George W. Bush’s 2004 share of Hispanic voters. All of this is good news for a Republican who intends to win with greater strength among white   voters, like Mr. Trump. There is a downside for him. The lower turnout among Hispanic and young voters implies that it’s possible  —   even easy  —   to imagine a huge increase in Hispanic and youth turnout in 2016. And Mr. Obama’s strength among Northern white voters raises doubts about whether the Republicans, including Mr. Trump, can assume that white   voters are receptive to conservative candidates. The best case for Mr. Trump is that white Northerners reluctantly backed Mr. Obama because Mr. Romney was successfully caricatured as a rapacious plutocrat. Yet it’s hard to argue that the attacks on Bain Capital were responsible for Mr. Obama’s gains among young and   white voters. These voters moved decisively in Mr. Obama’s direction, perhaps in part because of cultural issues. If that’s right, Mr. Trump will be hard pressed to reverse Mr. Obama’s gains  —   and there’s plenty of evidence he could slip further. The    Theory. There has long been a notion that Mr. Romney was hurt by “missing white voters,” those who voted in 2008 but skipped the 2012 presidential election. And the G. O. P. ’s hope is that Mr. Trump could benefit with a surge of those   voters. But that view of 2012 is largely unsupported by the data. The decline in white turnout in 2012 was particularly marked among registered Democrats, according to data from Catalist. Republican turnout dropped a bit as well, but it was less than the drop among Democrats across every age cohort. And among voters over age 60, Republican turnout increased. According to data from L2, a nonpartisan voter file vendor, the missing white voters were far more likely to be registered Democrats, or to have participated in Democratic primaries, than the white voters who actually did turn out. Is it possible that some of these Democrats are actually ready to vote for Mr. Trump? Yes. But it’s a stretch to argue that a huge share of them would have voted for Mr. Romney or would vote for Mr. Trump, especially considering how young they are. (Mr. Trump’s support is weaker among the young). They could just as easily be supporters of Bernie Sanders. Even if the missing white voters were disproportionately Republican, a return to previous turnout levels wouldn’t have been anywhere near enough to get Mr. Romney over the top. There were far fewer missing white voters in the battleground states than there were nationally. There weren’t close to enough of them to flip the outcome in key states. The real pool of missing white voters are those who haven’t participated in any recent election, or aren’t even registered to vote. There are millions of these missing white voters  —   but they will be much harder to mobilize. Many are young, and might not be especially favorable to Mr. Trump. The older ones are true bystanders in American politics. To win, Mr. Trump will need to make gains among white   voters. The earliest evidence, and polling this early can be quite inaccurate, suggests that he is doing that handily. So far, Mr. Trump leads Mrs. Clinton by 27 points among white voters without a degree, 58 percent to 31 percent, in the last six national surveys from major news organizations. In the final 2012 polls, Mr. Romney led by just 19 points among such voters, 58 percent to 39 percent, over Mr. Obama. One of the big questions for Mr. Trump is whether his polling gains among that group, should they hold, will manifest themselves in battleground states. Mr. Romney’s national gains over Mr. Bush did him relatively little good: They were concentrated in the South and Appalachia, where they had little influence on the Electoral College. For now, it’s an open question whether Mr. Trump will make outsize gains in important states like Iowa, Ohio or Wisconsin, where he struggled in the primary season. Mr. Trump’s big advantage among white   voters hasn’t translated to a much stronger position in national polls. That’s because he is underperforming Mr. Romney’s 2012 results among white voters with a college degree and nonwhite voters, often by a far greater amount than he’s gaining among   whites. The same polls show Mrs. Clinton leading among   white voters by 47 percent to 42 percent. It’s a reversal from 2012, when Mr. Romney led that group by six points, 52 percent to 46 percent in the final polls. Even modest additional gains for Mrs. Clinton among   white voters or nonwhite voters would quickly start to make things very challenging for Mr. Trump. If Mr. Trump lost five points among   white voters and Hispanics, which is how he’s doing in current polls, his target for white   voters would quickly skyrocket. In a battleground state like Colorado, for example, he would need to gain 15 percentage points more of the white working class. Whether Mr. Trump can suppress his losses among   voters and Latinos will be decided by a lot more than demographics. Usually, the   fundamentals  —   including the current president’s approval rating and the pace of economic growth  —   play a big role in determining whether voters will support the incumbent’s party. This year, there are other big questions: whether Mr. Trump’s penchant to offend goes too far, and whether Mrs. Clinton has an advantage with women and faces a penalty among men (and which is bigger). So far, the polls suggest he will lose too much ground among   and nonwhite voters to win. But the diversity of the country in itself does not rule out a victory for Mr. Trump.",0
8222,This Is What Will Happen to Mosul After Isis Is Pushed Out,"  Recipient Email => 
I visited Mosul on the day it fell to Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and a small detachment of US Special Forces on 11 April 2003. As we drove into the city, we passed lines of pick-up trucks piled high with loot returning to the Kurdish-controlled enclave in northern Iraq. US soldiers at a checkpoint, over which waved the Stars and Stripes, were shooting at a man in the distance who kept bobbing up from behind a wall and waving the Iraqi flag . 
If there had ever been any sympathy between liberators and liberated in Mosul, it was disappearing fast. Inside the city, every government building, including the university, was being systematically looted by Kurds and Arabs alike. I saw one man who had stolen an enormous and very ugly red and gold sofa from the governor’s office dragging it slowly down the street. He would push one end of the sofa a few feet forward and then go to the other end and repeat the same process. The mosques were soon calling on the Sunni Arab majority to build barricades to defend their neighbourhoods from marauders. 
We parked our vehicle near a medieval quarter of ancient stone buildings while we went to see a Christian ecclesiastic. When we got back, we found that our driver was very frightened and wanted to get out of Mosul as fast as possible. He explained that soon after we left a crowd had gathered, recognised our number plates as Kurdish and debated lynching him and setting fire to his car before being restrained by a local religious leader moments before they took action. 
The oil city of Kirkuk was captured at about the same time by the Peshmerga, despite having promised the Americans and Turks that they would do no such thing. Again, there was looting everywhere and I saw two Peshmerga stand in the middle of the road to stop an enormous yellow bulldozer that was being driven off. Instead of slowing down, the driver put his foot on the accelerator so the Peshmerga had to jump aside to avoid being crushed. 
Inside the newly established Peshmerga headquarters, I ran into Pavel Talabani, whose father Jalal Talabani headed the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, the political party whose militia now held the city. He stressed the temporary nature of the Kurdish occupation of the city. “We came to control the situation,” he said. “We expect to withdraw some of our men in 45 minutes.” 
Some Peshmerga, but not all: 13 years later the Kurds still hold Kirkuk, whose population is Kurdish, Arab and Turkoman, and to which the Kurds claim an historic right saying they have only reversed anti-Kurdish ethnic cleansing by Saddam Hussein. 
By now the rest of the world has forgotten that there was a time when the Kurds did not hold the city. The Kurdish leaders had understood that the US-led invasion and the fall of Saddam Hussein had created conditions of unprecedented political fluidity and it was an ideal moment to create facts on the map, which would become permanent whatever the protestations of other players. 
The current multi-pronged offensive aimed at taking Mosul is producing a similar situation as different countries, parties and communities vie to fill the vacuum they expect to be created by the fall of Isis, just as in 2003 the vacuum was the result of the fall of Saddam Hussein. 
The different segments of the anti-Isis forces potentially involved in seizing Mosul – the Iraqi army, Kurds, Shia and Sunni paramilitaries, Turks – may be temporary allies, but they are also rivals. They all have their own very different and conflicting agendas. Presiding over this ramshackle and disputatious alliance is the US, which is orchestrating the Mosul offensive and without whose air power and Special Forces there would be no attack. 
The Shia-dominated Iraqi government needs to take and hold Mosul, Iraq’s main Sunni Arab city, if it is to be convincing as the national government of Iraq. To achieve this, Baghdad’s rule must be acceptable to the Sunni majority in the city in a way that was not true when Isis took it in 2014. It needs to establish its rule while it still has full military and political support from the US. 
The Kurds, for their part, want to solidify their control of the so-called “disputed territories” claimed by both the central government and the Kurdish regional authorities. The Kurds opportunistically used the defeat of the Iraqi Army in northern Iraq by Isis two years ago to take these territories inhabited by both Kurds and Arabs, thereby expanding by 40 per cent the area of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). They know that once Isis is defeated, the Kurds will no longer get international and, above all, American backing to hold this expanded version of the KRG. 
These problems have only begun to surface because Mosul is still a long way from being besieged or even encircled. 
The Shia militia forces are surprisingly calm about being excluded from a military role in the siege. They may calculate that the Iraqi army, if it gets sucked into street fighting, will not be able to take Mosul on its own and will have to look to them for support. The Shia paramilitaries are making up for their lack of participation in the battle for Mosul by sending reinforcements – some 5,000 men, according to reports – to join the Syrian Army in the siege of East Aleppo. 
Turkey wants to be a player and, as a great Sunni power, the defender of the Sunnis of Mosul. To this end, it has soldiers based at Bashiqa, north east of Mosul, and claims to be taking part in the attack. But so far at least, Turkish ambitions and rhetoric in Iraq and Syria have exceeded its performance. Both interventions may be designed to impress a domestic audience which is deluged with exaggerated accounts of Turkish achievements in the government-controlled Turkish media. 
These participants in the struggle for Mosul may be dividing the tiger’s skin before the tiger is properly dead. Isis showed that it still has sharp claws when it responded to the assault on Mosul with raids on Kirkuk and Rutbah on the main Iraq-Jordan road. It is fighting hard to slow down the anti-Isis advance towards Mosul with a mix of suicide bombers, IEDs, booby-traps, snipers and mortar teams. But it is unclear if it will make a last stand in Mosul where, at the end of the day, it must go down to defeat in the face of superior numbers backed by the massive firepower of the US-led air forces. 
The likelihood is that Isis will fight for Mosul, the site of its first great victory, in order to prolong the battle, cause casualties and to let divisions emerge among its enemies. But its strategy over the last 12 months has been not to stage heroic but doomed last stands in any of the cities it has lost in Iraq and Syria. 
At Ramadi, Fallujah, Sinjar, Palmyra and Manbij it has staged a fighting withdrawal at the last moment. The same may now happen in Mosul. (Reprinted from The Independent  ",0
8223,Trump Says Nordstrom Treated His Daughter ‘So Unfairly’ Fireworks Before Final Vote on Jeff Sessions - The New York Times,"■ A vote on Jeff Sessions’s nomination as attorney general is expected on Wednesday. ■ A proposed Senate bill would require congressional approval to lift sanctions on Russia. ■ Vice President Mike Pence will attend a Republican Jewish Coalition meeting in Las Vegas. Mr. Trump on Wednesday lashed out at Nordstrom for dropping his daughter Ivanka’s clothing and accessories line, once again raising questions about the tangled relationship between the president and his family’s business interests. The president has been criticized for singling out other companies for criticism, like Boeing and Lockheed Martin, prompting gyrations in their stock prices, but those controversies had to do with government contracts, not his family’s own fortunes. Nordstrom, the department store chain, said on Friday that it was dropping the Ivanka Trump line, a decision it said was based on sales performance. A campaign, using the hashtag #GrabYourWallet, which has encouraged shoppers to boycott products with ties to Mr. Trump, his family and his donors, called the Nordstrom announcement a victory. It was not clear what prompted the president to criticize the company five days later. As Mr. Trump has noted several times, federal    laws apply to other officials, but not to the president. Nordstrom’s stock dropped briefly after the president’s Twitter post, then rose again. Mr. Trump’s blast at the company came two days after his wife, Melania, filed a libel lawsuit describing her “multiyear term” as “one of the most photographed women in the world”  —   an apparent reference to her status as a candidate’s wife and now first lady  —   as a lucrative business opportunity. A day after her narrow confirmation as education secretary, Betsy DeVos toured the department she now leads and delivered a speech to staff members and reporters. She began with a joke: “This confirmation process and the drama it engendered have been a bit of a bear,” she said, a reference to her   comment during her Senate hearing that schools might need guns to protect students from “grizzlies. ” “We’ve just come through one of the most bruising, divisive elections in modern times, and that’s O. K.,” she said. “All of us here can help bring unity by personally committing to being more open to and patient toward views different from our own. ” In her speech, she did not mention some of the issues that had made her such a contentious nominee, like her support of private school vouchers and charter schools. But while she had seemed unfamiliar in her Senate hearing with basic education terms and policies, such as the requirements of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, on Wednesday Ms. DeVos went out of her way to promise to serve “  students and families to whom we owe our full support,” as well as “students who may be struggling” and “hardworking teachers who may feel stifled. ” She continued, “I pledge to listen and learn from you, and from stakeholders around our country. ” Capping a strikingly contentious confirmation process, the Senate is expected to vote as soon as Wednesday evening on the nomination of Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama to be attorney general. Senators usually show a great deal of deference when one of their own is nominated for a cabinet post. But Democrats have sharply criticized over his background on civil rights and his stances on voter access and immigration. After Mr. Sessions’s nomination cleared a procedural hurdle on Tuesday in the Senate, Democrats took to the floor to reiterate their opposition to the senator during the final hourslong debate. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, wrote those Twitter posts after being halted by the majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, as she tried to read on the floor a 1986 letter by Coretta Scott King opposing Mr. Sessions’s nomination for a judgeship. Mr. McConnell, in a rare step, said Ms. Warren had breached Senate rules by impugning the character of Mr. Sessions. The Senate then voted, along party lines, to bar Ms. Warren from speaking again during the debate. In the end, though, Democrats can do little more than raise their voices. None of the 52 Republicans have said they would vote against Mr. Sessions, and he needs only a simple majority to win confirmation. In a bit of procedural strategy, Republican leaders held off on Mr. Sessions’s vote until after confirming Betsy DeVos, President Trump’s education secretary. With Mr. Sessions still in the Senate, Republicans had just enough votes to push her to confirmation. A day after a federal appeals court panel voiced skepticism over his targeted travel ban, Mr. Trump seemed to acknowledge on Wednesday the possibility that he could lose the case. But to lose the normal way, on the merits? The president sees other forces at play. Later in the morning, Mr. Trump resumed that theme at a gathering of sheriffs and police chiefs. “I don’t ever want to call a court biased, so I won’t call it biased,” he said. “But courts seem to be so political. ” He also called the appeals court hearing “disgraceful. ” With that, Mr. Trump kept up his efforts to call into question the independence of the judiciary  —   a cornerstone of American democracy. A few days ago, he referred to the district court judge in the travel ban case as a “  judge. ” And before that, he doubted that the judge in a Trump University case could be impartial because of his Mexican heritage. The president has been   blaming judges for any terrorist attack that might happen during the travel ban suspension. On Sunday, he attacked the district court judge who blocked his immigration order, James Robart of Seattle. “If something happens,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, “blame him and court system. ” On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump was back on Twitter, claiming that foreigners were flowing into the United States from “certain areas. ” A bipartisan group of senators is expected to introduce legislation on Wednesday that would require congressional approval for Mr. Trump to lift sanctions on Russia, according to two Senate aides. The group is expected to include six senators: Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, John McCain of Arizona and Marco Rubio of Florida, all Republicans and Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Claire McCaskill of Missouri, all Democrats. The effort comes amid longstanding worries on Capitol Hill that the Trump administration might be too dovish on Russia, which intelligence officials say intervened in the election in an effort to help Mr. Trump. Last week, the president seemed to defend the reputation of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia by asking an interviewer, “You think our country’s so innocent?” The vice president will attend a Republican Jewish Coalition gathering in Las Vegas at the end of the month, according to a notice from the group sent to prospective attendees. Las Vegas is home to one of the group’s biggest donors, the casino magnate Sheldon G. Adelson. Mr. Pence’s trip will come a few weeks after the Trump administration issued a muted statement about Israeli settlements, calling for immediate curbs on construction but also signaling a shift away from the Obama administration’s rejection of all settlement activity. It will also come after the president’s promise to immediately move the American Embassy to Jerusalem has been delayed. It seems that no mission is too impossible for Jim Mattis to take on. During a recent trip to Asia, Mr. Mattis, the defense secretary, succeeded in shoring up connections with South Korea and Japan despite Mr. Trump’s campaign talk about pulling back from the United States’ security commitments in the region. On Tuesday, Mr. Mattis made an effort to salvage relations with Mexico, at least in the area of military cooperation. According to a statement issued Tuesday night by the Pentagon, Mr. Mattis spoke by phone with two of his Mexican counterparts: Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda, the secretary of national defense, and Adm. Vidal Francisco Soberón Sanz, the secretary of the navy. Mr. Mattis talked about the need to strengthen military connections between the two countries, and “lauded Mexico’s growing leadership in the region,” the Pentagon said. The statement did not say when Mr. Mattis might be visiting the country, but it noted that Mexico was planning to host the Conference of Defense Ministers of the Americas in 2018. No word if Mr. Trump’s wall will be built by then.",0
8224,"Comment on The “Six Million” Myth by The Jew, the Zionist and antisemitism at the House of Lords – 24/6 Magazine","By wmw_admin on April 16, 2011 Zion’s Big Lie 
“ The First Holocaust ” by Don Heddesheimer is a critical work documenting the continuous Jewish attempts at floating out Holocaust propaganda before, during and after World War One , often invoking the magical “6,000,000” figure and using the term “Holocaust”. Of course, these clever propagandists have since accomplished their goal of establishing the outrageous myth of the Jewish Holocaust™ in the public consciousness following the end of WW2. In large part due to fictional Hollywood movies like “Shindler’s List” from that lying venomous worm, Steven Spielberg. Read The First Holocaust online here . 
Why the number “Six Million”? 
As documented in the book The First Holocaust , the Zionists have continuously and hysterically attempted to claim that six million Jews were dead, dying or in grave danger in Europe and Russia since the late 1800’s. Any time there was turmoil in Europe, albeit turmoil often instigated by Jews in the first place, prominent Zionist figures and Jewish-controlled media organizations world wide continuously whipped up a frenzy with phony sob stories to get people to feel sorry for Europe’s Jews and donate money to Jewish charities. It turns out that this mythical six million figure, long since discredited even by mainstream Holohoax historians, comes from a Jewish-Talmudic religious myth that says “ye shall return minus six million” or “you shall return to the land of Israel with six million less”, and of course WW2 birthed the modern state of Israel which was established in 1948. Israeli Jews often excuse their systematic genocide of Palestinians and theft of Palestinian lands by bringing up the so-called Holocaust™ of WW2, which any serious researcher and critical thinker knows by now is a fraud of collosal proportions. The Zionists have so much influence that they turned a delusional Jewish religious prophecy into “historical fact”. 
From History & Scriptural Origins of the Six Million Number ; 
[Quote 1] Jewish prophecies in the Torah require that 6 million Jews must “vanish” before the state of Israel can be formed. “You shall return minus 6 million.” That’s why Tom Segev, an Israeli historian, declared that the “6 million” is an attempt to transform the Holocaust story into state religion. Those six million, according to prophecy, had to disappear in “burning ovens”, which the judicial version of the Holocaust now authenticates. As a matter of fact, Robert B. Goldmann writes: “. . . without the Holocaust, there would be no Jewish State.” A simple consequence: Given six million Jews gassed at Auschwitz who ended up in the “burning ovens” (the Greek word holocaust means burned offerings), therefore, the prophecies have now been “fulfilled” and Israel can become a “legitimate state”. –Unknown [ Quote 2] Regarding the ‘six million’ number you should know the following: In the Hebrew text of the Torah prophesies, one can read “you shall return”. In the text the letter “V” or “VAU” is absent, as Hebrew does not have any numbers; the letter V stands for the number 6. Ben Weintraub, a religious scientist, learned from rabbis that the meaning of the missing letter means the number is ‘6 million’. The prophesy then reads: You will return, but with 6 million less. See Ben Weintraub: “The Holocaust Dogma of Judaism”, Cosmo Publishing, Washington 1995, page 3. The missing 6 million must be so before the Jews can return to the Promised Land. Jahweh sees this as a cleaning of the souls of the sinful people. The Jews must, on the return to the Promised Land, be clean — the cleaning shall be done in burning stokes. –A Correspondent

8225,Twitter Adds New Ways to Curb Abuse and Hate Speech - The New York Times,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   Social media companies are under increasing  scrutiny for the amount of hate speech that thrives on their platforms, especially since the presidential election. Now, Twitter has unveiled several new measures to curb the online abuse, though the changes are unlikely to be   enough to quiet the company’s critics. On Tuesday, Twitter said it was making it easier for its users to hide content they do not wish to see on the service and to report abusive posts, even when those messages are directed at other users. The company has given its support teams training to better identify mistreatment on Twitter. “There’s a fine line between free expression and abuse, and this launch is another step on the path toward getting rid of abuse,” said Del Harvey, Twitter’s vice president of trust and security. “We’ve been launching new products to address this, and the cadence of product releases is picking up. We have a lot planned on this path. ” Online harassment and hate speech have long festered on Twitter, but the incidents appeared to rise during the presidential campaign. Exchanges between supporters of   Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton grew personal and acrimonious. Many of Mr. Trump’s supporters also relied on a series of images  —   some   and others quietly coded as racist  —   to circulate hate speech on Twitter. Since Mr. Trump’s victory last week, Twitter has been filled with reports of racist and derogatory taunts against minorities. Many users have expressed fear and concern about the escalation of such behavior. When asked about harassment of minorities, Mr. Trump told “60 Minutes” that his supporters should “stop it. ” Twitter has not had a comprehensive response for dealing with hate speech, largely because the company did not want to limit freedom of expression on the service. But over time, Twitter has rolled out measures to tackle the problem. It has let people mute the accounts of other users, effectively making their content disappear from view. Last year, it issued an explicit prohibition against hateful conduct. The company is now taking more action. It is letting people more specifically block out what they do not want to see on the service, including muting words, phrases and even entire conversations. Twitter is also making it easier for people to report abusive behavior, even if they are only bystanders to the abuse, and for the company to evaluate those reports. And it has overhauled its approach to training support teams, holding special sessions on cultural and historical context for hateful conduct. “Someone looking at user complaints in Asia may not recognize something happening in the E. U. or the U. S. as hateful,” Ms. Harvey said. “We need to make sure there is a universal familiarity with the most common trends and themes we’re seeing that are abusive, but may not seem so at first glance. ” Critics said that while the steps are positive, they will not eliminate hate speech. Twitter’s changes “don’t stop the problem of posting abusive content,” said Mark S. Luckie, a former Twitter manager who now runs a digest of the topics trending among Twitter’s   users called Today in #BlackTwitter. “People will find a way to abuse others online, but these changes may put users at ease and curb the perception of abuse on Twitter. ” Part of the reason abuse has thrived on Twitter is because the company allows anonymity, Mr. Luckie said. “But unlike other sites with anonymity, Twitter lets users broadcast to the world  —   so their abuse has a huge potential impact,” he said. “If you fight with a celebrity and the celebrity fights back, then you have potentially reached a global audience with your abuse. ” Ms. Harvey acknowledged that Twitter has not always moved fast enough to clamp down on abusive behavior. She said that the problem would probably never be entirely solved, but that the company was doing more to identify repeat offenders who create new accounts when Twitter shuts them down or who incite users to gang up on others. “When I hear that Twitter only cares about this now, that we’re only going through the motions, I understand where that perception comes from,” Ms. Harvey said. “But this is important to us because people are experiencing these abusive things, and we need to make sure they know what options they have and that we’re taking action to make things better. ”",0
8226,What Exactly Are Poll Watchers? Here's The Cliff Notes Version (VIDEO),"What Exactly Are Poll Watchers? Here’s The Cliff Notes Version (VIDEO) By Natalie Dailey on October 29, 2016 Subscribe 
For months, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has been whining that the election is rigged against him. 
He urges people to go to the polls and look out for voter fraud. Watching for fraud is not illegal by itself. If you actually try to force someone to vote a certain way, that is illegal. Sending out false information about the election is also illegal in Ohio. In most states, intimidating voters like that is illegal. According to 18 U.S. Code § 594 : “Whoever intimidates, threatens, coerces, or attempts to intimidate, threaten, or coerce, any other person for the purpose of interfering with the right of such other person to vote or to vote as he may choose.” 
The states are allowed to regulate election procedures, so the rules vary widely. Some states allow poll watchers to help out by simply being in the room. They watch for any specific suspicious behavior. What Are Poll Watchers? 
For example, in Florida, each candidate is allowed to have one poll watcher at each polling place. They have to be approved by the state beforehand. 
The poll watcher’s job is to make sure that the votes are counted correctly and to make sure there aren’t any weird voting schemes going on. 
Also in Florida, the poll watchers are allowed to challenge someone’s identity if they find a problem with the person’s identification or if the voter doesn’t show up on local voter rolls. If the issue isn’t resolved on-site, then the person can fill out a “provisional” ballot. 
This ballot won’t get counted until the problem with the voter’s identity is cleared up, and only if the vote numbers are close enough for provisional ballots to make a difference. Unfortunately, they often don’t get counted at all and if they do, not until after the vote would’ve been useful. Who Are The Poll Workers? 
The poll workers are usually a combination of state employees, temporary contractors, or volunteers. They are trained to answer your questions, and they handle disputes with the poll watchers. 
You are allowed to ask who poll workers are and who they represent. If you have a problem while voting, you’ll report it to the poll workers. 
Poll watchers and poll workers are not allowed to intimidate voters or suppress voting based on race, gender, national origin, or religion. They also can’t question you, and they can’t film you without your approval. 
Stay safe on election day, November 8! 
Donald Trump has gotten himself in some hot water for calling for poll watchers:

8227,James Comey’s Democrat Critics Now See Russian Conspiracy in Trump’s Firing,"While former aides to President Obama and members of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign predictably panned President Donald Trump for firing James Comey as FBI director, it was only a few months ago that Clinton’s campaign repeatedly alleged wrongdoing by Comey over his investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server. [And last October, Obama’s former attorney general, Eric Holder, signed his name to a letter circulated by Clinton’s campaign strongly criticizing Comey’s decision to publicize aspects of the FBI investigation, alleging Comey’s moves were inconsistent with FBI protocol.  In late October, less than two weeks before the presidential election, Comey informed key members of Congress that the FBI was reviewing additional emails that may have been relevant to the Clinton probe. This after emails were reportedly discovered on the personal devices of disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of   top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. At the time, Clinton’s campaign circulated the   letter, signed by Holder as well as nearly 100 former federal prosecutors and   Department of Justice officials. The letter stated: “Many of us have worked with Director Comey all of us respect him. But his unprecedented decision to publicly comment on evidence in what may be an ongoing inquiry just eleven days before a presidential election leaves us both astonished and perplexed. ” ABC News reported on the letter: The authors of the letter said they were “moved” to speak out publicly because Comey’s action violated “settled” DOJ tenets. Justice Department officials are instructed to refrain from commenting publicly on pending investigations except in “exceptional circumstances,” as well as to “exercise heightened restraint near the time of a primary or general election,” said the letter. “We cannot recall a prior instance where a senior Justice Department official —   Republican or Democrat —  has, on the eve of a major election, issued a public statement where the mere disclosure of information may impact the election’s outcome, yet the official acknowledges the information to be examined may not be significant or new,” they wrote. The nearly 100 former DOJ officials who signed on to the letter wrote that Comey’s letter to Congress was inconsistent with prevailing department policy and that it broke with longstanding practices followed during past elections. “Perhaps most troubling to us is the precedent set by this departure from the Department’s     traditions,” they wrote. After Comey renewed the email probe in late October, Clinton herself called the FBI chief’s actions “deeply troubling. ” “It is pretty strange,” she said. “It’s pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information, right before an election. In fact, it’s not just strange it’s unprecedented and it’s deeply troubling. ” Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, said Comey had “not been forthcoming with the facts. ” However, now that Trump has fired Comey, with administration officials citing Comey’s handling of the Clinton email investigation, former Obama aides and Clinton officials claim to be dismayed. Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein clarified the firing in a letter, writing, “I cannot defend the director’s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton’s emails. ” Yet Sen. Tim Kaine, Clinton’s running mate, claimed the firing was about the Russia investigation. “Trump firing Comey shows how frightened the Admin is over Russia investigation,” Kaine tweeted in response to the news. “Comey firing part of a growing pattern by White House to   the truth. ” Trump firing Comey shows how frightened the Admin is over Russia investigation,  —   Senator Tim Kaine (@timkaine) May 9, 2017,  Robby Mook, Clinton’s campaign manager, released the following statement: I was as frustrated, concerned and disappointed as anyone with Director Comey’s handling of the email investigation, but President Trump just fired the man investigating how Russia meddled in our election and whether members of his campaign were involved, an investigation President Trump called a “charade” only 24 hours ago. It’s equally concerning that our attorney general, who lied about his own meetings with the Russians, approved Director Comey’s firing. Clinton’s press secretary, Brian Fallon, tweeted, “I’m not shedding any tears for Comey personally  —   he hurt the FBI’s reputation  —   but I do worry whether we ever get to the bottom of Russia now. ” Former aides to Obama also claimed Trump fired Comey over the Russia investigation. “This should not be sugarcoated. Firing Comey is up there in terms of the scariest things Trump has done,” former Obama White House Communications Director Jen Psaki wrote on Twitter. Former Obama National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes expressed concern: “This is not normal. This is not healthy for a democracy. The fixed 10 year term for an FBI Director exists to prevent   …     this,” he wrote. “This justification several months into this Administration is just completely and insultingly unbelievable. ” Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

8229,Paul Ryan Emerges From Health Care Defeat Badly Damaged - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   For two days in January, all seemed right in the Republican Party. Gathered in Philadelphia for their annual congressional retreat, less than a week after President Trump’s inauguration, lawmakers exulted in the possibilities of total government control, grinning through forums about an aggressive   agenda that began with honoring a central campaign promise: repealing the Affordable Care Act. Adult beverages flowed. Members were given   socks. And the president showered praise on his most important partner, the man with the   pen, the man who would find the votes. “Speaker Paul Ryan  —   very, very special,” Mr. Trump said. “He is writing his heart out, right? And we’re actually going to sign the stuff that you’re writing. ” “Now,” the president said, “it’s going to happen. ” It is not going to happen. At least not this time. Less than 18 months after being elected speaker, Mr. Ryan has emerged from the defeat of the health care bill badly damaged, retaining a grip on the job but left to confront the realities of his failure  —   imperiling the   partnership that was supposed to sustain a new era of conservative government under unified Republican rule. So far, to the surprise of some close to Mr. Trump, the president has remained upbeat on Mr. Ryan, a frequent punching bag during the 2016 campaign and an ideological mismatch whose instincts informed the molding and selling of the health bill far more than the president’s own. But after a humiliating defeat, which many Trump advisers are eager to pin on the speaker, Mr. Ryan is now tasked with defending not just his leadership abilities but his very brand of conservatism in a party fitfully searching for a coherent policy identity that can deliver tangible victories. In this first fight, Mr. Ryan’s more orthodox   vision was   only halfheartedly by Mr. Trump, who has few fixed political beliefs, in service of a bill the president never well understood, even as he laid on the superlatives in praising it. Now, Mr. Ryan must tug a ruptured conference toward future agenda items, like overhauling the tax code, made all the more difficult by this initial failure. “Oh, I’m sure he’ll get blamed,” Representative Billy Long, Republican of Missouri and a vocal Trump supporter, said of the speaker as he left the Capitol on Friday, making clear he did not believe this would be fair. “He’ll get blamed for everything. ” The episode not only demonstrated an inability to honor a longstanding pledge that powered Republicans through a string of election cycles. It was also a remarkable setback for Mr. Ryan as the body’s principal   in his first major test as the speaker under a Republican president. In January, he coasted to   with almost unanimous party support, prompting allies to gloat that he had tamed the   House Freedom Caucus far more deftly than his predecessor, John A. Boehner. By Friday, his bill had at once alienated those archconservatives and more moderate members who abandoned the legislation as Mr. Ryan and Mr. Trump began caving to demands of the far right, to little effect. “We were a   opposition party, where being against things was easy to do,” Mr. Ryan said at a sheepish news conference shortly after the bill was pulled, adding with uncharacteristic candor that Republicans were not yet prepared to be a “governing party. ” “We will get there,” Mr. Ryan said, “but we weren’t there today. ” His job will not get easier. With disparate coalitions in his conference, outside groups like the political arm of the Heritage Foundation pushing lawmakers to pursue conservative purity, and a    president whom some members have appeared more willing to buck recently, there are few establishment forces helping Mr. Ryan keep the peace. “There is a lot more safety in opposition than there used to be,” said Eric Cantor, the former House majority leader who was ousted by a more conservative challenger, citing pressure from the outside groups. At the same time, several Trump allies have suggested that Mr. Ryan has still failed to grasp fully the lessons of the president’s election and its rejection of traditional political dogma. The most ominous signals have proliferated on sites like Breitbart, often the online id of Mr. Trump’s orbit. Its lead headlines on Saturday morning included: “Polls: GOP Legislators Dodged 2018 Headache When Leaders Dropped Ryancare” and “Speaker Ryan Crippled? Replacement Chatter Erupts on Hill. ” But as the bill circled the congressional drain, Republicans appeared broadly supportive of Mr. Ryan, grateful for his steady hand and policy fluency and mindful of the risks he took last year as Mr. Trump’s     campaign nemesis, giving members cover during a tumultuous election cycle. Most suggested there was nothing he could have done differently to secure the necessary votes. “If he can’t deliver them, they can’t be delivered,” said Representative Chris Collins of New York, a close Trump ally. “I’m certainly not blaming Paul Ryan in the least. ” Others grew more wistful, recalling that Mr. Ryan had to be coaxed into seizing the speaker’s gavel in the first place. “He didn’t ask to do it,” said Representative Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota. “We wanted a speaker who could articulate our principles, who could go on everybody’s radio shows and everybody’s TV shows, and go district to district in many cases, selling and articulating our philosophy, as well as sometimes pretty nerdy legislative stuff. He was tireless in that effort. ” A handful of Republicans took veiled swipes at the House leadership as the bill flailed. Representative Justin Amash of Michigan wrote Friday night on Twitter that the House was “supposed to be a deliberative body where outcomes are discovered, not dictated. ” “Compromise  consensus cannot be centrally planned,” said Mr. Amash, a member of the Freedom Caucus. But the chief wild card, as ever, is Mr. Trump. In his private conversations, the president has remained supportive of Mr. Ryan, declining to join in his advisers’ frustrations over how the bill was handled in the House. One adviser described him as still “smitten” with Mr. Ryan. “I want to thank Paul Ryan. He worked very, very hard,” Mr. Trump said on Friday. “I will tell you that. He worked very, very hard. ” Mr. Trump’s praise for Mr. Ryan seemed to owe, at least in part, to the fact that the speaker had repeatedly kept him informed throughout the negotiations. Mr. Ryan was also exceedingly deferential to the president, casting him for days as the consummate closer and a winner of the highest order. “The president gave his all in this effort,” he said on Friday. “He’s really been fantastic. ” Dynamics could shift quickly. Several of Mr. Trump’s advisers have for days been casting blame on Mr. Ryan, who is close with the president’s chief of staff, Reince Priebus. Mr. Trump is also known to grow angrier over time, particularly if faced with public embarrassment. On Friday, Mr. Ryan was quick to adopt Mr. Trump’s favored rationale during the health fight, arguing that Republicans had been doing Democrats a grand favor by dismantling President Barack Obama’s health law in the first place and that Democrats would eventually suffer the consequences. “I’m sure they may be pleased right now,” Mr. Ryan said, but when they see “how bad” things get, “I don’t think they’re going to like that, either. ” Mr. Ryan spoke from the same room where, just two weeks earlier, he delivered a slide show presentation live on cable, holding the attention of the political world  —   clicker in hand, sleeves peeled above his forearms  —   with a meditation on insurance premiums and Medicaid spending. For all the outward displays of collaboration, the exhibition demonstrated the gulfs, both philosophical and stylistic, that divided Mr. Ryan from the Trump White House. The administration had sought a different visual as the bill debuted to a critical panning: arranging competing stacks of paper in the White House briefing room, meant to demonstrate the relative simplicity of the Republican proposal compared with the thicker Affordable Care Act. “This is government,” Sean Spicer, the press secretary, said at the time, gesturing first to the Democrats’ bill, then the new one. “This is not. ”",0
8230,"Duterte, Citing Hitler, Says He Wants to Kill 3 Million Addicts in Philippines - The New York Times","MANILA  —   President Rodrigo Duterte said Friday that he would like to kill millions of drug addicts in the Philippines, defying international criticism of his country’s bloody war on narcotics and escalating his brutal rhetoric with a reference to the Holocaust. “Hitler massacred three million Jews,” Mr. Duterte said after returning to the Philippines from a trip to Vietnam, understating the toll cited by historians, which is six million. “Now there is three million, there’s three million drug addicts. There are. I’d be happy to slaughter them. ” Killing that number of drug users would “finish the problem of my country and save the next generation from perdition,” he said. Since Mr. Duterte took office in June promising a grisly campaign against crime and drugs, the Philippines has seen a surge in killings of drug suspects. Philippine officials have counted about 3, 000 deaths during the crackdown, about a third at the hands of the police. The police spokesman Dionardo Carlos said on Friday that the police had been overstating the number killed by the police. He said that the correct number was 1, 120, not about 1, 500, which the police had given earlier. He did not explain why the number had been revised. The police have also said that 1, 500 nonpolice killings are under investigation and that hundreds of these also are believed to be  . Responding to expressions of alarm about the killings from the European Union and other international bodies, Mr. Duterte said Friday that the European Union’s advisers on the issue were “ . ” He criticized European officials for finding fault with his government while not doing enough to help migrants fleeing   Middle Eastern countries. “You allow them to rot, and then you’re worried about the death of about 1, 000, 2, 000, 3, 000?” he said. Mr. Duterte complained that his foreign critics had depicted him as “a cousin of Hitler” and said that they were wrong to criticize him now that he was the country’s president. Doing so put all Filipinos “to shame,” he said. The president’s latest provocative remarks came days after he cast doubt on the Philippines’ longstanding military ties with the United States, announcing in Vietnam that the countries’ coming joint military exercises would be their last. Officials in his government later said that all military agreements with the United States were still in effect and that they were awaiting “clarification and guidance” from Mr. Duterte. While in Vietnam, Mr. Duterte also said he had received information that “the C. I. A. is planning to kill me. ” Officials in his government and at the United States Embassy in Manila declined to comment on that statement. A spokeswoman for the embassy, Molly Koscina, said Friday that the United States would continue to work with the Philippines to “uphold our shared democratic values. ” She said the relationship was built on “shared sacrifices for democracy and human rights, and strong    and societal ties, and obviously we’d like to see that continue. ”",0
8231,‘The Only Way We Can Fight Back Is to Excel’ - The New York Times,"When Indira Islas was in third grade at Centennial Arts Academy, a public elementary school in Gainesville, Ga. she decided it was time to get serious. It was 2006, and she was in the lowest reading group in her class. She had been in that group since arriving two years earlier, speaking no English, in Gainesville, a city of 38, 000 just northeast of Atlanta’s booming outer suburbs. But being at the bottom went against everything she believed about herself. “I wanted to be with the smart kids,” she recalls. Starting the year before, in second grade, she read every volume of the “Magic Tree House” books in her   library, a series about two ordinary siblings who climb into their backyard treehouse and   to Pompeii, the Wild West, the ice age, feudal Japan and beyond. “I absolutely loved them,” she says. “It was like going on adventures all over the world. ” It was also the opposite of her own life. Indira left Mexico for the United States at age 6 with her parents and two younger sisters. Her mother cleaned houses when she wasn’t caring for the children  —   there would eventually be seven of them  —   and her father worked in construction, and there was no money for   lessons or soccer clubs, let alone traveling. “I’d hear about trips and experiences of my white friends, and I remember thinking: I’ll never go to the beach or Disney World for spring break,” Indira says. Her parents told her that education was all that mattered, and she had to spend all her free time inside, reading and writing. “I tell my children this country is a blessing to all the people living here,” her mother told me. “If you have the opportunity to be good, it’s very important to take it. ” Indira took this advice to heart. By the time she was in fifth grade, her reading skills had improved so much that she tested into the top reading group. By middle school, she consistently got A’s, which qualified her for a celebratory school trip every time report cards came out. “They rewarded us by taking us skating or bowling,” she says. “I felt like I was so smart, just getting the chance to go out for the whole school day with friends. That’s when I said: ‘I can make it. ’’u2009” Indira began to throw herself into everything. At recess, she played soccer and basketball, competing so fiercely that everyone took notice. Boys usually picked other boys for their teams, and white kids tended to favor other white kids. But everyone started picking Indira. In middle school, she was on the track team, running   races. Her coach was stunned by her determination. In meets, even when she won her event, she scolded herself unless she broke her previous record. After practices ended, she would keep running. “I wanted to think,” she says. “I’d stay after practice and run and run and run. ” Indira remembers understanding vaguely that it wasn’t just poverty that set her and her family apart. Her parents had been doctors in Mexico. She admired pictures in their dresser drawer of the two of them in their 20s standing together, tall and proud in their white coats  —   before they all fled the violence of drug gangs who were then taking over their home state, Guerrero. When she asked her parents why they were no longer doctors, they explained it was because they were not American citizens. It didn’t make sense to Indira. Why would her father have shed that beautiful crisp white coat for the fraying pants and shirts he now wore? Soon after Indira turned 13, in 2011, she was riding home from track practice with her mother when another car sideswiped the family’s Ford Expedition. The other driver, who was at fault, insisted on calling the police, according to Indira and a lawyer who assisted the family. Indira pleaded not to involve the police, explaining that her mother did not have a driver’s license because she was not an American citizen. (In Georgia and most other states, undocumented immigrants cannot obtain driver’s licenses.) But the driver said she needed a police report to get insurance to cover the damage to her car. A police officer arrived and asked for Indira’s mother’s license. When she said she did not have one  —   a state crime  —   she was told to get out of the car. Indira got out, too. She remembers two of her younger siblings sleeping in the back, one in a booster seat, one in a car seat. Two elders from the church they attended arrived to ask for mercy. She has seven children, they told the officer. He responded that he was simply enforcing the law. Indira’s mother turned to her and began to cry. “Indira, I don’t know what is going to happen,” she said. “They’re going to take me. ” Indira remembers remaining strangely calm. “When she was being handcuffed, I said: ‘Mom, everything is going to be O. K.’’u2009” Indira’s mother was held in Gainesville’s Hall County jail for three days, but that wasn’t the most frightening part for the family. Hall is one of four counties in Georgia that have a formal agreement to report arrests of undocumented immigrants to the Department of Homeland Security, which means that infractions as minor as a   bulb above a license plate can spiral into deportation proceedings. Indira’s mother says that her charge of driving without a license ultimately led to a referral to immigration court and a deportation order instructing her to leave the country within 30 days. She stayed, slipping into the shadows. Every day since, Indira says, she and her siblings have feared that their mother would be deported. It would take only one more traffic stop. “That woke me up,” Indira says. “Until then, I thought the world was happy. ” In fact, she now realized, it was only American citizens who seemed truly happy. “It must feel pretty good, I guess, to not have to worry about whether your family could be taken away any day. ” Indira has wanted to be a doctor for almost as long as she can remember. When she was 10, her family was shopping for groceries at Sam’s Club, and she spotted a large book about human anatomy. She became so excited about it that her parents bought it for her birthday, even though it was well above her reading level  —   and their price range. She began working her way through it, mesmerized, and when she got stuck, her mother would explain whatever had stumped her. She was determined to go to college and medical school and fulfill her parents’ interrupted dream. In her junior year, Indira began researching college options. She would be a strong applicant. She was consistently at or near the top of her class she was on the   track and soccer teams she volunteered over 1, 000 hours a year at the local hospital, a record in the history of the   program and she led her school’s chapter of the Hispanic Organization Promoting Education (HOPE) which encouraged Latino students  —   who made up just over half the district’s population  —   to stay in school and graduate. She was distressed to discover that Georgia barred undocumented immigrants from attending its top public universities and charged them    tuition at all others  —   triple the rate for citizen residents. She then turned to researching financial aid and learned that Congress barred her from accessing federal Pell grants, loans, scholarships and   jobs  —   the most common forms of assistance for   students. At first, she greeted this as just another set of obstacles to surmount, but as time went on, she began to despair. She would retreat to the classroom of her science teacher, Teresa Leach, who had become her mentor, in need of encouragement. “There were a couple of times when I just cried to her because I was tired,” she said. “I questioned myself if it was all worth the effort. ” All the while, Indira told me, she held onto her religious conviction that God had a plan, and that she must respect it. At a college fair attended by representatives of numerous Georgia colleges, she asked admissions officers what kind of help was available for undocumented students. No one had any to offer her. She switched her focus to private colleges and was admitted to Atlanta’s Agnes Scott, which she says awarded her $20, 000 annually in financial aid, less than half of what she needed. She researched   private scholarships and found two for undocumented students, but she was selected for neither. She was awarded seven small scholarships, which totaled $10, 000, enough to go to a nearby public commuter college for only one semester at the    tuition rate. Last May, Indira attended her graduation ceremony at Gainesville High School, but she had nowhere to go next. In every picture from that day, she wears a wide smile, but she was in pain inside, particularly when she caught a glimpse of her mother in the crowd, looking distraught. Unable to bring herself to celebrate with friends, she went home to be with her family. Days later, a friend told her about a philanthropic organization called TheDream. US, which was offering undocumented students full   scholarships to Delaware State University or Eastern Connecticut State University. The application was demanding, and only 76 students would be chosen. She poured herself into the essays, spending hours composing them alongside an English teacher, Cindy Lloyd. She applied to Delaware State, a historically black college in Dover, five hours closer to home than Eastern Connecticut. In late June, she received an email from TheDream. US. “I saw ‘Congratulations,’’u2009” she remembers, “and I read no more. ” In late August, Indira made the   drive with her parents from Gainesville to Delaware State in unusual silence. She was thinking hard about each of her six younger siblings, wondering how they would fare without her. Over breakfast at a Cracker Barrel in South Carolina, when her mother pressed her about how she was feeling, she talked only of her concerns about not being at home to help everyone. When she arrived on campus  —   a flat expanse of grassy courtyards and buildings amid strip malls, auto dealers and chain restaurants just beyond Dover’s historic capital area  —   she found 33 other “opportunity scholars,” just as worried and hopeful as she was. All of them were assigned to a dorm about a quarter of a mile from the D. S. U. campus, a former Sheraton hotel acquired a few years earlier by the university as part of an expansion. They bonded instantly, traveling as a posse from classes to the library to the cafeteria, often ending up together late at night in the dorm lobby or in a lounge that had been a large hotel suite on the second floor. In their first month on campus, the opportunity scholars were invited to a welcoming ceremony in the school’s Martin Luther King Jr. Student Center with Gov. Jack Markell the Democratic senator Tom Carper Donald Graham, a founder of TheDream. US and D. S. U. ’s president, Harry Williams. “This is not just an opportunity for you it is an opportunity for the state of Delaware,” Markell told them. “It is sad to see your own home state reject such talent and potential. ” He pronounced himself “thrilled that you’re here. ” It was the first time many of the students could recall being welcomed anywhere. “We felt rejection our whole lives from our own states,” Indira said. “We were here only three weeks, and we already met the governor and the senator. It felt like saying ‘Haha!’ to Georgia. ” Of the 34 opportunity scholars enrolled at D. S. U. 28 are from Mexico and one each is from Ecuador, El Salvador, Peru, Gabon, Gambia and Trinidad and Tobago. Their families are a composite portrait of the economic forces that have drawn undocumented immigrants to the nation’s small towns and metropolitan heartland. Their parents work in poultry plants, on factory lines, in warehouses, on construction sites, in restaurants they clean and paint houses and schools, tend gardens. “They make everything look perfect for the tourists,” Yulma Lopez, who left Mexico at age 3, said of her parents’ work for a landscaping company in Charleston, S. C. Almost all their parents work illegally, but many pay income taxes, having obtained federal   numbers. And some, including Indira’s father, have secured temporary federal permission to work and drive lawfully. While most of the students are 18 or 19, typical for college freshmen, some have worked for years in hopes of one day saving enough for college. Olivia Bekale, who is 27 and grew up in Baton Rouge, arrived in Louisiana from Gabon as a child. She graduated from high school in 2008 with a 3. 9 G. P. A. from the Louisiana School for Math, Science and the Arts, a prestigious   boarding school for top achievers. Unable to afford college, she cycled from one   position to the next  —   server at the Melting Pot, a fondue restaurant retail sales consultant for Sprint   agent for Marriott pharmacy tech for Walgreens. Olivia, who had wanted to be a doctor since an aunt died of AIDS when she was 5, had been out of high school for eight years when she learned of the opportunity scholarship she applied immediately. All but one of the students were enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA. Created in 2012 by an   executive action, DACA allowed teenagers and young adults who came to the United States illegally as children with their parents to register with the government and in turn receive a   renewable protection against deportation, along with work permits and Social Security numbers. Most of the students, like Indira, signed up at age 15, as soon as they were eligible. With DACA, Indira, who is now 18, was able to get a driver’s license and a job at a Publix supermarket when she was in high school, working 20 hours a week as a cashier and bagger. Being able to work and drive legally, free of the fears her mother faced, and fitting in with her classmates, Indira says, was “living the American dream. ” With her income from Publix, she even was able to get braces for her teeth. The starting point for all of their dreams was education, and the quest for it has been central to the experience of undocumented young people since long before Indira and her classmates were born. In the late 1970s, when undocumented immigrants had yet to move in large numbers beyond border states, Texas passed a law authorizing local school districts to ban them from public schools or charge them tuition. In a landmark decision in Plyler v. Doe in 1982, a narrowly divided Supreme Court struck down the law, finding that undocumented children had a constitutional right to free    public education. The opinion blamed a dysfunctional immigration system for creating the crisis by failing to keep out undocumented immigrants or provide them a path to citizenship. “Already disadvantaged as a result of poverty, lack of   ability and undeniable racial prejudices, these children, without an education, will become permanently locked into the lowest socioeconomic class,” Justice William Brennan wrote for the majority, quoting the   opinion. The case also introduced the argument that undocumented children were legally blameless, unlike their parents: “The classification at issue deprives a group of children of the opportunity for education afforded all other children simply because they have been assigned a legal status due to a violation of law by their parents,” Justice Lewis Powell wrote in a concurring opinion. Undocumented children poured into the nation’s schools over the next generation, and as they reached college age, they coalesced into a movement, advocating access to higher education as well as full citizenship. In 2001, they began calling themselves Dreamers, now an estimated 2. 1 million young immigrants who have grown up as Americans in almost every way except for their passports. The name came from the Dream Act (Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors) introduced in Congress in 2001 by Senator Richard Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, and Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican from Utah, and for which activists fought for over a decade. The measure, which would have put undocumented children on a path to citizenship, never passed, but the vast network of Dreamers became a compelling political force. In 2001, hundreds of them turned out to testify in Texas in favor of legislation to allow undocumented residents to pay   college tuition if they graduated from Texas high schools and lived in the state for three years. “Something magical happened when those kids told their stories,” says the former Texas state representative Rick Noriega, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. “It was a humanizing of a very real issue dealing with children’s dreams and hopes. Every heart on that committee was touched, Republicans and Democrats. ” The legislation passed both houses almost unanimously and was signed by Rick Perry, then governor of Texas and now President Donald Trump’s pick for energy secretary. Texas became the first state, followed quickly by California, to allow Dreamers to pay   tuition. Today, 21 states charge Dreamers the same tuition as legal residents, including six carried by Trump  —   Florida, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Utah and Texas. In many of those states, however, the   issue has turned politically treacherous. In Texas, efforts to repeal the tuition law come closer to passing every year, and Noriega says there is no chance the original measure would pass today. The leading national opponents of   tuition for Dreamers include the Republican senator Jeff Sessions, Trump’s choice for attorney general, and the secretary of state of Kansas, Kris Kobach, a Republican who was a leader of Trump’s transition team on immigration. Each argues that students who are in the United States illegally should not get a public benefit in any state that is denied to a citizen from another state. In other words, if Dreamers pay   tuition in Texas, citizen students next door in Arkansas and Oklahoma  —   or Massachusetts, for that matter  —   should have the same right. “How much sense does that make, to have people here illegally, and they have more benefits than those who are here legally?” Sessions asked in a Senate floor statement. Kobach used the same argument to bring   lawsuits against   tuition for Dreamers in Kansas and California. Judges found no legal basis for the claims and dismissed the cases. The larger debate over how to treat an estimated 11 million immigrants who came here illegally has been at a stalemate for decades, with advocates seeking a “path to citizenship” for   families who have been in the country for years and opponents denouncing “amnesty” for people who broke the law to enter the country. Amid hardening resistance in Congress to immigration reform, Dreamers brought pressure on Obama  —   including   and hunger strikes at his 2012 campaign offices  —   to use his executive power to create DACA. The program, announced on June 15, 2012, the 30th anniversary of the Supreme Court’s Plyler decision, proved transformative for Dreamers. They have entered college, taken    jobs, received driver’s licenses, bought cars. They now fly on planes, passing effortlessly through airport security. They still lack legal immigration status, but no longer are they exactly undocumented. “DACAmented,” many have called themselves. Even in states where they pay   tuition, Dreamers still struggle to afford college because they are disproportionately   and have no access to federal financial aid. Fewer than 10 percent of Dreamers who graduate from high school enroll in college. At a time when college graduates earn 70 percent more than those without degrees, these numbers conjure the 1982 warning by the Supreme Court that undocumented children could become a permanent underclass. In response, a handful of philanthropies have adopted the cause of sending students with DACA status to college. The biggest of these, TheDream. US, has raised $90 million to eventually finance 4, 000 students at public colleges, with significant contributions from Donald Graham, former publisher and chief executive of The Washington Post, and his family Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan Bill and Melinda Gates the   executive William Ackman and Michael Bloomberg, among others. (I was a reporter at The Washington Post from 1980 to 2008.) In 2014, TheDream. US began offering Dreamers full scholarships in states that charge them   tuition. Last year, in partnership with Delaware and Connecticut, the organization created the   program for students from the other 29 states, financed by $41 million in philanthropy from Graham and his family and two anonymous donors. The governors of Delaware and Connecticut agreed to charge roughly   tuition rates for the 34 scholars at Delaware State and the 42 at Eastern Connecticut State  —   a total of $80, 000 per student for tuition, room and board for four years. In an effort to   political opposition, Graham says, the philanthropy works only with schools, like Delaware State and Eastern Connecticut State, that have excess capacity, so that undocumented students are not displacing citizens. And private donors pay all expenses, so that no state dollars are spent. Still, when The Delaware State News ran an article in September about the D. S. U. opportunity scholars, the online comments complained that undocumented immigrants, not citizens, were benefiting. “Trump isn’t perfect, but I will vote for him because he puts Americans FIRST,” wrote a reader named John Huff of Magnolia, Del. “There are plenty of kids who are citizens who have the same dream and should come first. ” And as news of the scholarship spread on the Delaware campus this fall, a number of   students told Dreamers that they resented that their own families had to go into debt for a portion of their education costs while the DACA students got full scholarships. By then, Trump had mobilized   anger in large swaths of the country, having kicked off his campaign criticizing Mexican immigrants  —   “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists”  —   and vowing to build a wall on the border to keep them out. In stump speeches, he promised to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants and, in his first 100 days in office, to terminate DACA, labeling it “illegal amnesty. ” Both vows became instant applause lines. Indira declared her major in biological sciences at the beginning of the semester and started a demanding   curriculum with six classes, including biology and chemistry, both requiring labs. Her parents had insisted she not take a job, in order to devote herself to education, freeing up four hours a night that she had spent working in high school. With that extra time, she found the academic challenges manageable. Much harder was living apart from her   family for the first time in her life. Her mother texted her daily. “Good morning, hija,” she wrote one recent morning, using the Spanish word for daughter. “May God bless you today in school. Please be kind to everyone. ” That night, over FaceTime, Indira talked with two of her younger sisters, who like her were born in Mexico and are undocumented. One, a junior in high school, is already on a quest for college scholarships. She and Indira came up with potential essay ideas and discussed her résumé. Then Indira helped the other, a freshman who is the smartest of all the family’s children, Indira says, with physics homework. On weekends, she FaceTimes with her four youngest siblings  —   a sixth grader, a fourth grader, a third grader and a first grader  —   all of whom were born in Georgia and are citizens. Separation from family, from home, even from Mexican food made most of the opportunity scholars profoundly lonely. Estephany Martinez, a petite   major with long black hair, couldn’t stop thinking about her sisters in the first weeks. “Whenever we came home from school, all four sisters would sit in the living room and do our homework and talk and watch TV,” she recalled wistfully of her life in Winder, Ga. In Delaware, “I didn’t have anybody that cared for me. I didn’t have anyone to come home to. ” In early September, she summoned all the scholars to a gathering in the dorm’s   lounge. “All right, you guys, we’re going to be here for each other,” she said. “That part of our lives  —   being undocumented  —   is critical to who we are. We have to share our stories. ” Everyone crowded in, sitting on the sofa, spilling onto the floor, sitting shoulder to shoulder on counters that once were part of a kitchenette, sprawling into one another’s space. Carlos Gonzales of Manteo, N. C. a lanky and cheerful marketing major whose mother is a restaurant cook, broke down crying when he recalled the violence that drove his family from Mexico City. He, his mother and his younger sister moved to North Carolina when he was 7. It was his mother who encouraged him, beginning in elementary school, to reach for college. “I don’t want you to live the life we’re living now,” she told him. In high school, he was an honor student and varsity wrestler and runner, working nights and weekends at McDonald’s in his Outer Banks town. When he received the email telling him he was an opportunity scholar, he said: “I hugged my mom and cried for two hours. The only reason I stopped was I had to go to work. ” Indira told the harrowing story that led to her own family’s departure from Mexico. In 2004, when she was 6, three masked gunmen broke into their home, which housed her parents’ clinic, and robbed them of everything  —   money, jewelry, a new computer, a television, cameras and medications. They filed a report with the police, they said, who didn’t investigate, in deference to cartels then taking over Guerrero, now the most violent state in Mexico. An uncle of her father’s already had been killed. In subsequent years, a cousin of her mother’s, a veterinarian, was kidnapped and never found. Two nephews disappeared. Her mother’s sister has been kidnapped twice  —   most recently this past November  —   and returned only after her family paid steep ransoms. Weeks after the robbery, Indira’s family of five arrived in the United States on a tourist visa that her father procured a month earlier in hopes of taking everyone to Disney World. Instead, they went to Gainesville, where her father’s brother worked in construction  —   one of thousands of Mexican workers who flocked to the north Georgia community in the last 25 years, swelling the Hispanic population to more than 40 percent in 2013 from 8 percent in 1990. Indira said her parents are certain they would have been killed had they stayed. They decided to forfeit their careers for their family’s safety. “I no longer saw my future, but I saw my children’s future,” her father said to me. Antonio Patino, a   major who is a lifeguard and plays bass and guitar in his spare time, told the group about riding with his family in their car in 2015 in Lawrenceville, Ga. when a police officer pulled them over, though none of them understood why. His father, who is undocumented and processes returns for a local manufacturer, was driving but did not have a license. Antonio and his mother, younger sister and brother all watched in terror as his father was handcuffed, placed in a police cruiser and driven off to jail. As it turned out, he was released the next day after paying a fine of more than $800 and was not referred to immigration court for further proceedings, but the incident shook Antonio’s sense of belonging in America. “I felt like I got slapped in the face just for living, trying to be a normal person in this beautiful country,” he said. “It feels like a hole inside me. ” He said he now found himself gripped with fears for his parents’ safety at random moments during his days at D. S. U. It is as if he has swapped roles with his mother and father. “Like I’m now the parent and they’re the child, and I’m worried for them,” he told me. “Not being there, all these   swarm into my mind. What if out of nowhere they get pulled over again?” Calling them and hearing their voices usually comforts him. But after one such call, he said: “I went outside, and I had to cry a little. I was feeling like I couldn’t help them. ” A number of students shared the enormous sacrifices they had seen their parents make for them. Juan Chavez, 23, who grew up in Plymouth, Ind. and worked for five years after high school, told of his mother suffering a breakdown after her divorce from his father. He saw it as a response to the crushing instability of their lives, moving from one home to another in search of shelter. “She’s the strongest person I’ll ever know,” he said. “She’s my role model. My father figure as well as my mother. ” He continued: “I felt so helpless to make things better. I decided almost right then I’ll go to college and medical school if it takes me the rest of my life. ” He is now a psychology and   major, intending to become a psychiatrist. On and on the students went until almost 3 a. m. the common threads in their stories drawing them closer. It was the first time most of them had talked openly about being undocumented, but instead of feeling exposed, they felt safer. Until then, Antonio had gone out of his way to avoid conversations with   at D. S. U. about his scholarship, not wanting to have to explain that he got it because he was undocumented. The next day, though, he fell into conversation with a student who asked him how he happened to come all the way from Georgia to D. S. U. and he said without hesitation: “I got a scholarship. ” “What for?” “I’m undocumented,” Antonio said, surprised at how comfortable this felt. “O. K. man, that’s cool,” the student said. After their long night talking, the scholars also better understood what had propelled them all for as long as they could remember. Throughout high school, the opportunity scholars watched undocumented friends and siblings give up and drop out, shamed and beaten down by public scorn over illegal immigration and the   options awaiting even those who excelled in high school. But they kept on striving, steeled to the insults, positioning themselves for a breakthrough they couldn’t yet see. Now this all made sense. “This pain  —   it pushes us,” Estephany said. “It’s motivation. It has made me who I am. It makes me go through every day. ” “Now we know what drives us,” Indira said. One morning in   at 9:50 a. m. 10 minutes before Indira’s   class was scheduled to start, she and two other opportunity scholars were already ensconced in the three center   seats, notebooks, pens and textbooks at the ready. Indira was wearing a Harvard sweatshirt that a classmate bought for her when their   A. P.  class visited Boston. (Indira couldn’t afford to go.) “I’m going to get there one day,” she said with a confident smile. Most of the other students didn’t arrive until class was about to begin  —   or later  —   and there was little competition for the front rows. A similar scene unfolded that morning in the ultramodern science center, in   class, where Antonio and Jose Reyes Rios, another   major, sat front and center with an   classmate named Hanqaamo Lintisio, who is from Maryland and has a track scholarship. The three had formed a study group and tutored one another so effectively that they all scored above 100 on the midterm. (They nailed the bonus question.) Theirs were the only A’s in the class. The Dreamers gather daily at a long Formica table in a D. S. U. cafeteria for food and conversation. At lunch, Carla Moreno propped her English composition textbook, “Patterns for College Writing,” against a napkin holder, securing it with an apple. She paged through a chapter while eating her salad and chili dog. “It’s just a quiz,” she said, “but I want to keep my A. ” “I deal with a lot of students, and I feel like the Dreamers are at a different level,” says Kevin Noriega, the adviser for their scholarships. “They’re saying, ‘I’ve got to make this happen because it’s my only option. ’’u2009” Of the 488 scholars funded by TheDream. US who began college in 2014, 94 percent remain enrolled after their sophomore year research shows that only 66 percent of   college students nationally return after one year. “This is a   population with retention rates like Harvard’s,” Donald Graham says. Because beneficiaries of TheDream. US have full rides, they avoid a common problem faced by other disadvantaged students: running short of money for costs not covered by Pell grants or other forms of aid. One night in October before a biology exam, Indira went to the D. S. U. athletic center for a workout to relieve stress. She was armed with a stack of homemade flash cards and her iPhone, on which she had downloaded discussions of test topics from various websites. While pounding out three miles on the treadmill, she flipped through her study cards, then plugged in her earbuds for a YouTube lecture on glycolysis. Returning to her dorm, she sat down at her desk for a final review. Hanging on the wall in front of her was a collage of family photographs. One showed the whole family of nine around their dinner table. “When I’m struggling, I look at a picture of my mom or dad, and I say, ‘I’m working for that person,’’u2009” she said. That night, her studying complete, she took a last look at her parents’ picture and fell asleep listening to recordings of her biology professor’s lectures. She got an A on the exam. Indira’s determination to become a doctor requires more than a little imagination, because under current law in Georgia and many other states, licenses to practice medicine are reserved for citizens and legal residents. “I’m not planning my life based on the way things are today,” she said. “I’m thinking of the future. ” In her eyes, America is a land of   opportunity. Over Columbus Day weekend, she visited Washington for the first time with her roommate, Karen Baltazar, who is from Lawrenceville, Ga. and also wants to be a doctor. At the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, Indira stood underneath Roosevelt’s Four Freedoms  —   freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, freedom from fear  —   her arms raised high above her head, as if exulting in the message. Her smile was radiant. Karen snapped a picture, and Indira posted it on her Facebook page along with the caption, “I have never forgotten the reasons my parents brought me to this great country. ” Such unsinkable optimism, which I heard from many D. S. U. Dreamers in the early fall, is hard to maintain, and many of the estimated 65, 000 undocumented immigrants who graduate from high school every year  —   and thousands who drop out  —   simply can’t muster it. In a recent book, “Lives in Limbo,” Roberto G. Gonzales, an assistant professor at Harvard’s graduate school of education, writes that academically successful Dreamers are far outnumbered by those who become casualties of “the deeper and more   consequences of being undocumented: living in poverty, having parents and family members who also bear the burdens of being undocumented, watching friends moving forward but being unable to join them, watching opportunities pass you by, navigating a world of exclusions while constantly looking over your shoulder. ” At least some of the opportunity scholars’ optimism last fall came from their assumption, based on reported polls, that Hillary Clinton would be the next president. They were heartened by her speeches about keeping families together and pursuing comprehensive immigration reform. At the very least, they were confident that DACA would remain in effect under her leadership. Though they didn’t believe Trump could win, he unnerved them with his speeches branding Mexicans criminals who stole Americans’ jobs and lived off their tax dollars. They took this rhetoric as a personal affront and were horrified by the hatred they saw on the faces of those who cheered his words. “The only thing that depresses me is so many people support him,” Jose Reyes Rios, the   major, who aspires to work at Google one day, said in late September. On election night, a group of Dreamers gathered around the   TV in the dorm lobby, many of them studying as they watched returns. Indira had exams the next day in math and biology and arrived equipped with her flash cards. The mood turned dark after Trump won Florida. Everyone’s mind flooded with his vows that they had discounted until now  —   to revoke DACA, to deputize local police departments to enforce federal immigration laws. “We will issue detainers for all illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings,” Trump said last summer in Arizona. As all of them knew well, these crimes included one of their parents’ daily activities  —   driving without a license. If DACA disappeared, and with it their Social Security numbers, their own driver’s licenses would be worthless. So would their federal work authorization, meaning most would lose the jobs that paid for their books, phones, clothes, travel home and anything else they needed. By 1 a. m. Indira became too distressed to concentrate. Olivia Bekale was one of four opportunity scholars who watched until Trump was declared the  . “We were just looking at each other and crying,” she says. “We hugged each other and went to our rooms. ” On the Sunday after the election, when they gathered in the dorm lobby, the opportunity scholars were struggling with something unfamiliar: despair. They had registered for DACA with the Department of Homeland Security, which now knew exactly where they were. “Life is going to be like it is for our parents,” said Victor Hernandez of Coats, N. C. stunned and shaking his head. “They could come pick us up and take us away any time. ” Social media brought aftershocks for all of them as they discovered that many of their best friends voted for Trump. Almost all of Antonio’s   swim teammates in Lawrenceville had Trump filters on their Facebook and Snapchat profile pictures. “All I could think was: You voted against me,” he said. “What did I do to you?” The day after the election, Indira couldn’t bear to call her mother until the afternoon. Instead, she confided her fears in text messages to her former science teacher, Teresa Leach. “I’ve never been so disappointed in this country,” she wrote. “I’ve never felt so powerless. . .. I’m scared about my family, my mom. . .. Not sure if I’ll even get my degree, much less go to medical school here. ” When Indira finally did call home, her mother insisted she was not afraid and told Indira that education was now even more important. Several of Indira’s friends back home told her they doubted Trump would follow through on all his campaign promises, and in any case, they couldn’t imagine he would target her. “These are people who helped me get to where I am, who remind me they love me, and I love them,” she said. “But they’ll never understand what we feel. They say, ‘He won’t do that.’ Do they think he’s going to send back all the immigrants except Indira?” A lifeline of sorts arrived the week after the election, when the students received letters from TheDream. US, Governor Markell and the president of D. S. U. pledging to stand behind their scholarships no matter what became of DACA. Donald Graham lined up attorneys to represent them if anyone challenged their right to be in school. But their bigger fears were for their parents. Antonio and Indira went home for Christmas to find their families filled with trepidation. “We’re trying to be invisible, trying to stay hidden,” Antonio’s father said, “do only the things we have to do to live, like go to work, go buy groceries. ” During the 2015 holiday season, they took a driving tour of the Christmas lights and celebrated New Year’s Eve in downtown Lawrenceville. “Now we can’t go to any festivities because for us it’s very dangerous,” his mother told me in their apartment in a complex in Buford, Ga. “There are a lot of police there. ” Antonio’s father said he worries about driving his daughter, Litzy, 15, home from her   practice at rush hour, when the police presence increases. Litzy was born in Georgia, and he thought of asking her to leave the team until she is old enough to drive because, as a citizen, she will be able to get a driver’s license. “But then I said to myself: ‘No! That’s crazy. That’s why we’re here  —   for our kids. So they can take advantage of every opportunity. ’’u2009” He continues to ferry her  —   carefully  —   during rush hour. Indira found her mother more frightened than at any time since receiving her deportation order. Her mother says she has no choice but to drive when someone at her church asks for help, when her children call for rides home and when she is needed at a charity medical clinic where she volunteers as a doctor’s assistant and translator. “Life changed after the election,” she told me in December, in her living room decorated with framed academic awards for each child. She was surrounded by her kids, who listened carefully. “The children know I don’t have a driver’s license. They know at any time maybe the police will take me again. ‘If I can’t come back,’ I tell them, ‘you have to go to school every day. You have to study hard  —   even harder. ’’u2009” By the time Indira and the other opportunity scholars returned to campus in January, all of them had come to the same conclusion: There was now only one thing they could control  —   their education. “The only way we can fight back is to excel in school,” Indira wrote to me in a text message. She felt weary in the aftermath of the election, but when she had this epiphany, she said: “I wasn’t tired anymore. I had that drive, that hunger to just come out on top. I was angry. I was staying at the library longer, going to the gym a lot more. ” Estephany Martinez focused on her life’s mission. “My goal is being a police chief  —   something that makes my voice louder,” said the   major. “I have to educate myself to get there. I want to show people who don’t believe in us: ‘I got all the way here. I’m starting from the bottom with education, and I’m going to get there. ’’u2009” As they settled into the semester, they monitored everything Trump and his close allies were saying about immigration, their moods shifting with each utterance. Back in December, they felt hopeful when Trump, in his interview as Time Magazine’s Person of the Year, said approving things about Dreamers and indicated that he would deport serious criminals before other undocumented immigrants. They were discouraged in January when Jeff Sessions, in his confirmation hearing to become attorney general, appeared unconcerned about the consequences of revoking DACA. They took heart two days later when Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, said in a CNN   meeting that he wanted Congress to pass legislation making Dreamers “right with the law. ” Indira and other Georgia scholars were exhilarated in early January when a state court ordered the Board of Regents to allow DACA holders to pay   tuition. But their hopes collapsed when a state appeals court stayed the decision Trump appeared likely to revoke DACA before Georgia Dreamers could reap the benefits. “I said: ‘I don’t know what’ll happen next, but we’re here in this place, and the only way we can win is to succeed in our education,’’u2009” Indira told me. Soon after classes started, the opportunity scholars learned that their collective grade point average for the first semester was a 3. 76. Six of the 34 students had achieved a perfect 4. 0. Indira was one of them. “Succeeding for me is how I can get my revenge,” she told me over the phone, interrupting her biology homework for a few minutes. “I want to break the stereotype of us being here taking jobs away and not helping the economy. I want Trump to see we’re the total opposite of what he thinks. ”",0
8232,"World’s Diplomats, Seeking a Bridge to Trump, Look to Haley - The New York Times","UNITED NATIONS  —   The shock is gone. Panic is subsiding. Now, diplomats who represent the nations of the world are entering what one described as the third stage of grief: figuring out how to deal with President Trump. They’re scrambling to speak with his advisers and poring over his Twitter posts  —   or if they’re old school, ordering their minions to print out   lists of presidential outbursts. They’re watching anxiously how he reacts to a series of   tests (military provocations by   separatists in Ukraine, for instance) while trying to parse the contradictory statements coming out of his administration (what exactly is the United States’ view on Russia? ). And they’re counting on his United Nations envoy, Nikki R. Haley, to be a coolheaded adviser, even as they wonder whether she, his     critic, has her mercurial boss’s ear. Their doubts surfaced late Friday over the abruptly annulled appointment of a Palestinian leader for a senior United Nations post. Diplomats said they had been led to believe the appointment of the Palestinian, Salam Fayyad, had been approved by all Security Council members  —   only to be greeted with a   statement from Ms. Haley’s office, quashing the appointment. The United States does not recognize Palestine as a state, the statement read, raising questions about whether Ms. Haley had been overridden by the White House. So far, she has revealed little of her world views, except an opening salvo that did not go down very well among her peers. “For those who don’t have our back, we’re taking names,” she said of America’s allies in her first remarks at the United Nations headquarters, and then repurposed it into a hashtag: #TakingNames. So far on Mr. Trump’s watch, Iran and North Korea have carried out ballistic missile tests, Israel has expanded settlements and fighting has escalated between Ukraine and   rebels  —   all regarded as early tests for the White House. His travel ban on seven   nations has given ballast to the Islamic State, his somersaults on Taiwan are seen to have strengthened China’s hand, and his unpleasant exchanges with the leaders of close allies like Mexico and Australia have left many diplomats wondering whether they can count on the world’s most powerful nation as a reliable partner. Mr. Trump’s supporters see his edicts and outbursts as perfectly consistent with his campaign promise to upend the establishment, reassert America’s primacy and put all on notice not to trifle with him  —   a kind of chaos theory of   management to leave everyone guessing, all the time. For America’s friends in the world, the uncertainty is complicated by not knowing exactly whom to talk to. The warrens of the State Department are unusually empty. Obama administration officials have packed up new appointments have yet to be made. And a series of contradictory statements have emerged from cabinet officials about crucial issues  —   not least Russia. Mr. Trump has continued to express his admiration for his counterpart in the Kremlin, Vladimir V. Putin. Yet Ms. Haley has taken a different posture. In both her confirmation hearing and in her first open remarks in the Security Council, she condemned Russia’s “aggressive actions” in Ukraine and insisted that United States sanctions on Moscow would remain. Several Western envoys breathed a sigh of relief, but not without doubts. Was she speaking for herself, or for the administration? Was the inconsistency deliberate, or did it reflect a lack of consensus? Who is setting United States policy, and whom should they be talking to? “Unanswerable right now,” advised Kathleen Hicks, a Pentagon official under President Barack Obama and now a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “They’re smartest to have multiple points of entry. Backups to backups. ” Ms. Haley will have to weigh in on difficult, contentious issues that are already on the United Nations’ agenda: how to save South Sudan from what could be a genocide, say, or whether to punish the president of Syria, Bashar   for unleashing chemical weapons on his people, or how to stanch the spread of terrorism in West Africa. Yet she has not expressed opinions on much. On Twitter, she posted selfies with her husband, Michael, and a YouTube video of Billy Joel singing “New York State of Mind. ” She admitted to being excited to see the movie “Deepwater Horizon,” and offered a new hashtag: #WeekendsInNYC. On the last Sunday of January, as Mr. Trump’s travel ban left immigrants and refugees stranded across the world, Ms. Haley wrote a Twitter post about her husband driving up to New York with the family’s pets, including two frogs and a fish. On Saturday night, after North Korea tested a missile, Ms. Haley posted a Twitter message about her admiration for Joan Jett, the 1980s rock star. What kind of influence she may have on the White House remains unknown. She is far from being a confidante of Mr. Trump’s, and it’s unclear how much sway she will have over him on any of the big crises facing the world. “Nikki Haley will be a perfectly normal politician sent to be ambassador,” said Eliot A. Cohen, a former Bush administration official. Mr. Trump, he warned, has “instincts and prejudices which are out of the norm of American diplomatic belief and practice. ” The diplomatic corps is queuing up to see her  —   and those who score face time are wasting no time sharing it. “The #SpecialRelationship comes to @UN,”  the British ambassador, Matthew Rycroft, posted on Twitter, along with a photo of the two of them shoulder to shoulder. “Very positive meeting,” offered the Ukrainian ambassador, Volodymyr Y. Yelchenko, posting a picture of his own. At a crowded reception one recent evening, one diplomat described the first weeks of the Trump presidency as “surreal,” as though he were describing a Luis Buñuel movie. Then he spotted Ms. Haley and deftly snaked through the crowd to introduce himself. I spoke to more than a dozen diplomats for this article, and nearly all described Ms. Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, as a natural politician and a refreshing contrast to the president. “Cordial,” one envoy said. “Businesslike,” said another. “We need to find a way to engage with the new administration, particularly with Ambassador Haley, and to explore with them what we can do together,” said João Vale de Almeida, the envoy representing the European Union’s 28 member nations. “In doing so, we should try to avoid dangers and pitfalls. ” Vitaly I. Churkin, the Russian ambassador and perhaps Ms. Haley’s most important colleague on the Council, complimented her “very powerful record” as governor. On Twitter, he said cryptically that he looked forward to working with her according to the “  of their capitals. ” (Her boss, in Washington, has lavished praise on his, in Moscow.) Few people at the United Nations need to be on her good list more than the man who heads the world body, António Guterres. Mr. Trump has dismissed Mr. Guterres’s entire operation as a social club. Republicans in Congress have threatened to pull funding. And Ms. Haley has made it clear that she intends to scrutinize how the United Nations spends its money and eliminate things that do not serve United States interests, while also taking pains to say she would not take a “slash and burn” approach. The United States pays for more than a fifth of the United Nations’ core budget, and controls key jobs in the world body’s system. So Mr. Guterres must strike a balance between keeping United States officials on board and not being seen as subservient to United States interests. He faced that challenge over Mr. Trump’s travel ban. Mr. Guterres was criticized as not speaking out against it directly enough, quickly enough. Finally, he told reporters that the restrictions “violate our basic principles” and called for them to be discontinued. Mr. Guterres is a former socialist prime minister of Portugal. Ms. Haley is a conservative from the American South. But both are politicians, as Richard Gowan, a research fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, pointed out. And, he argued, they could help each other  —   Ms. Haley in prodding him to show that America gets value at the United Nations, Mr. Guterres by using pressure from her to make the reforms he thinks are necessary. As Mr. Gowan put it in a recent essay, “Their political fortunes are inseparable. ”",0

November 2016 Trump froh, dass er sich ab morgen endlich nicht mehr zurückhalten muss New York (dpo) - Bald kann er wieder ganz so sein wie er ist: Nach Monaten taktischer Zurückhaltung und höchster Achtsamkeit auf Seriosität und Political Correctness freut sich Donald Trump eigenen Angaben zufolge bereits auf die Zeit nach der Präsidentschaftswahl – ganz unabhängig von deren Ausgang. ""Egal ob ich gewinne oder verliere: Ab morgen kann ich endlich wieder ich selbst sein und muss mich nicht mehr ständig zusammenreißen"", freute sich Trump heute in einem Interview mit dem Fernsehsender Fox News. ""Diese ständige Rücksichtnahme war in den letzten Monaten echt anstrengend. Ich musste wirklich jedes Wort auf die Goldwaage legen, damit ich niemanden beleidige."" Zu mehreren Bevölkerungsgruppen wären Trump noch ganz andere Dinge eingefallen, hätte er sich nicht mit aller Kraft beherrscht: ""Gerade Mexikaner habe ich betont sachlich als 'Mörder und Vergewaltiger' beschrieben, da hätte ich durchaus auch ausfallend werden können"", so Trump. Vom Wahlkampf jedenfalls hat der Geschäftsmann die Nase gestrichen voll: ""Wissen Sie, wievielen Frauen, die glatte Zehns waren, ich nicht an die Pussy greifen konnte, weil ich Kandidat war? Meine Tic-Tac-Packung von letztem November ist immer noch nicht aufgebraucht, weil ich so wenig geküsst habe. Was bin ich froh, wenn das alles endlich vorbei ist!"" Dabei kann Trump auch einer möglichen Niederlage positive Aspekte abgewinnen. ""Selbst wenn ich die Wahl verlieren sollte, bin ich immerhin wieder frei"", erklärte er. ""Ob ich dann so richtig vom Leder ziehe und das Land in einen Bürgerkrieg stürze oder einfach wieder wie früher die nackten Kandidatinnen meiner Schönheitswettbewerbe ausspanne, weiß ich nocht nicht. Ich würde aber auf jeden Fall das beste aus der Zeit machen und meine Freiheit genießen."" Am liebsten würde er jedoch die Wahl gewinnen. ""Selbst als berühmter Milliardär kann man sich nicht so austoben wie als US-Präsident. Das wird ein Feuerwerk! Wenn ich erstmal frei von dem Zwang bin, immer auf Umfragen achten zu müssen, beginnt der Spaß erst richtig. Mächtigster Mann der Welt sage ich da nur"", so Trump mit einem Augenzwinkern.",0
8234,Liberalism Yet To Come: The Boundaries of the Thinkable,"by Outis Philalithopoulos In yesterday’s episode of this series , Outis came up with an attractive synthesis about the trajectory of modern progressivism. He was then thrown into confusion by the arrival of a Phantom, and cryptic references to “neoliberalism’s intellectual and cultural border guard.” I felt like a snake, compelled to painfully tear away one skin after another. The outline of my conclusions was the same, but in the cold light of Reed’s words, things somehow appeared differently. Is it true that we have surpassed postmodernism? We still look negatively at right wingers and others who believe in non-trendy absolutes. We still pay lip service to the idea that other cultures are just as praiseworthy as upper middle class American liberal culture. But looking beneath the surface, it does seem like postmodernism has been consigned to the graveyard of history. But rather than post-postmodernists who have learned from the mistakes of postmodernism, we are neo-modernists who have successfully forgotten that postmodernism ever existed. Already in the 90s, parts of the left/liberal world were uncomfortable with postmodernism, and Wendy Brown argued that they had set up their own “reactionary foundationalism.” By that she meant that they had selected one aspect of their dogma, and then declared all attempts to interpret it critically to be subversive. Our newfound unity is based on two prongs. On the one hand, we have consolidated our alliance with key sectors of modern capitalism, and thereby cemented our branding as well-educated, intelligent people. It is working out wonderfully – but have we paid a price for it? Daniel Bell argued in 1976 ( The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism ) that conservatives supporting capitalism were thereby supporting a cultural engine that undermined the social values central to their conservatism. Have we, by letting the cultural arm of the economy fight our battles for us, clouded our ability to radically critique that economy? In the complex relationship between modern progressivism and the cultural sector of capitalism, who is using whom? On the other hand, we have fixed certain instances of suffering as foundational texts, and can now blast anyone who seems to doubt their centrality in understanding the world. Earlier attempts to create a liberal culture based on a consensus about oppression tended to produce a hodgepodge of groups that centrifugal forces could easily pull apart. What was different now? Maybe, as I had suggested to Foucault, the Internet had played a role. But 9/11 seemed relevant as well. As Osama bin Laden had hoped, the image of the planes striking the towers appeared on television as a dramatic flash of absolute reality. In the new rhetorical world thus created, “squishy” postmodernism came off as inane and decadent; meanwhile, neocon Republicans happily twitted liberals over their lack of moral clarity. The Right surged from one apparent victory to another, while liberals seethed with humiliation. Maybe there was no epistemological breakthrough that enabled us to answer the postmodernists’ gnawing doubts about objectivity. Maybe we changed the nature of liberalism, absorbed the stubborn moral clarity of Rush Limbaugh’s conservatism, and went on to forge a rough-and-ready consensus between unruly interest groups, simply because we believed we had to. Morality As stylized images of suffering inject us with potent shots of certainty, we become addicted to empathy with suffering, as an antidote for existential disorientation. This leads to a natural desire to expand our attention to micro-aggressions and hurtful ways of thinking. But then, if we commit to being on the side of people who experience micro-aggressions, almost everyone might be able to find something in their life that could qualify. And in fact, many groups for whom we feel little sympathy are not unwilling to talk about their pain and humiliation. We have dodged this trap by finding a principle that will disqualify unintended groups from empathy – that way we can classify their pain as notreal. The simple rule that does the trick is: “If a group has suffered something historical that we agree is really, unmistakably horrible , then it is also allowed to claim micro-aggressions as real.” We dress it up in academic language about what counts as “structural” oppression, but in simple words, the rule is, “if a group suffered, and we have canonized their suffering as a source of moral clarity for us , then they should be allowed to freely discover further incitements to suffering.” So in Judy’s movie, mocking older people, or rural people, or government employees, or overweight people, is all entirely acceptable , while carrying around fox repellent, thinking a sheep’s fur is fluffy, calling a bunny cute, or not supporting a baby fox who wants to be an elephant are all entirely unacceptable. T he principle isn’t that prejudice is wrong. The principle is that the latter examples are code for liberal flash points. I thought about something Brown said: In its emergence as a protest against marginalization or subordination, politicized identity […] instills its pain over its unredeemed history in the very foundation of its political claim […] Politicized identity enunciates itself, makes claims for itself, only by entrenching, restating, dramatizing, and inscribing its pain in politics; it can hold out no future – for itself or others – that triumphs over this pain. By “instilling” pain at the center of our epistemological universe, we condemn ourselves to endless efforts to shuttle around, direct, and amplify that pain. Brown emphasized revenge as a key technique in dealing with pain: […] a will that makes not only a psychological but a political practice of revenge, […] an identity whose present past is one of insistently unredeemable injury. Zootopia offers plenty of examples of hurting people the way they hurt others, so they can see what it feels like, and learn. The response to Nick tricking Judy and telling her “it’s a hustle, sweetheart” is for her to trick him and then announce, “it’s a hustle, sweetheart.” The same line is then used on the evil female sheep at the end of the movie. The movie sees cultural insensitivity as not only the primary evil in the world, but also the most appropriate punishment – the final prison episode also came to mind, when I had laughed at the evil sheep’s anger at her wool getting touched. The culmination of Judy’s apology is announcing that she really is “just a dumb bunny” – her guilt is so great that she knows she deserves the pain of stereotyping. Brown worried about the insatiable dead end of “insistently irredeemable injury.” Here, though, modern liberal culture proposesa way out of the cycle of suffering and revenge – Judy models it for us in her apology to Nick. If the oppressor voluntarily decides to submit to the worst tortures the oppressed can inflict, and to bind herself as an instrument of his revenge, then he may choose to forgive her, making possible a triumph over pain. I had always thought that when people do something wrong, they should just stop caring about their own feelings and, like Judy, really, deeply apologize. In the movie, Nick had forgiven her. But in real life, if someone apologized like that, say in a professional context, and the other person chose to be unmerciful – what then? Imagining the Future Wendy Brown said that right wing fundamentalists were trying to “foreclose democratic conversation about our collective condition and future.” Are we doing the same thing? Adolph Reed maybe thought so. What did he mean when he said we had become “border guards of neoliberalism,” policing “the boundaries of the thinkable”? Of course we work hard to stigmatize certain sorts of prejudices. Do we thereby successfully repress them? Foucault, in his History of Sexuality , recalled that it is often supposed that the Victorian era’s rules of manners and taboos on sexuality were aimed at making sex “driven out, denied, and reduced to silence.” He argued instead that those restrictions had the effect, and maybe the purpose, of inciting and intensifying the power of sexuality: a “complex deployment for compelling sex to speak, for fastening our attention and concern upon” it. If Foucault was right about sexuality, are our attempts at “repressing” prejudice and trauma serving to amplify them as a force in society, by “compelling prejudice and trauma to speak,” “fastening our attention” upon them? Is the result then to drown out attempts to speak in other ways, and so to police “the boundaries of the thinkable”? Is the neoliberal order safeguarded by the fact that certain conversations just don’t happen in mainstream progressive circles? Well, it does seem that Star Trek is better at imagining an economic system without money than modern progressives Maybe we see a radical stance on the economy as a quick way to brand oneself as edgy, while privately assuming that there is no alternative to modern capitalism. If so, why continue to be so moralistic about it? Is our compulsive focus on mental sin a way we cover up despair at our inability to change the deep structure of the world? A lot of ordinary people are convinced not that capitalism is perfect, but that any alternative to it is will necessarily involve the collapse of technological civilization or severe restrictions on freedom. If this isn’t true, are there some progressives trying to explain why? I struggled with what I had perceived. Were we, despite our idealistic vision of ourselves, simply agents of the system, tentacles that it uses to smash some people, complete with the pretext of defending others? Was it a labyrinthine, twisted joke? Hope At that point, I rebelled at the implications of my thought. Maybe modern progressives are much less self-critical than we imagined ourselves to be. Maybe we do indulge in some prejudices while criticizing and often tokenizing others. Maybe we have acquiesced in a long series of accommodations with power. But Polyphemus had spoken not just of wretchedness, but of idealism and grandeur. Maybe I didn’t agree with the postmodernists after all. Maybe there is something good, or at least potentially good, in the way we have tried to turn back to sincerity and moral conviction, to humility and introspection. Brown said that in the postmodern world, individuals are buffeted and controlled by global configuations of […] power of extraordinary proportions, and are at the same time nakedly individuated, stripped of reprieve […] Since she wrote, the way the world makes many feel precarious and lost has only gotten worse. Maybe she was right that when we feel this way, we try to rebuild a sense of something we can really believe in. But was she right in assuming that this was mainly a bad thing? When Judy apologizes to Nick, she treats herself as utterly insignificant, and her victim as omnipotent, exactly mimicking the relationship between the sinner and God in traditional Christian confession. This was extreme, but could it also be seen as the sign of a great and widely-shared loneliness? Of the longing we feel for more dramatically intimate relationships between people, or between a person and some sort of transcendence? Could we salvage what was hopeful in modern progressivism and disentangle it from what wasn’t? That sounds… hard, I thought to myself. Anyway, I’m dead. Maybe someone else will worry about it. Then I remembered Judy Hopps. She wouldn’t accept me being dead as a reason for me not to try to help people. What could I do? “Polyphemus,” I cried out. “You’re back.” He surveyed me. “WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED?” his voice boomed. I thought for a moment. Then I realized how to solve this problem. “Polyphemus,” I said. “I have learned that I have been ignorant and irresponsible and small-minded. When I hear criticism of liberals that I don’t want to think about, I deal with it by explaining how right-wingers caused the problem, or are worse than us, or are scary or horrible. Or I say the criticism is justified, but only as a criticism of not-real-progressives. Or I divert attention by accusing critics of ignoring the horrible things that have been done to marginalized people. I say I am against prejudice and trauma, but my attempts to repress certain forms of them have the predictable effect of intensifying their power throughout society. I say I am against prejudice, but I don’t mind making fun of old people, Millennials, hicks, wingnuts, adults who live with their parents, and a whole slew of other categories and stereotypes. I say I am against capitalism, but I’m completely fine with corporate action when it imposes antiracism, feminism, and other aspects of liberal culture. If someone raises an objection, I accuse them of opposing antiracism or feminism. I have the privilege of knowing that I can repel any attack on my basic understanding of reality. I really am a horrible hypocrite; some of the things I do hurt people, abet an atmosphere of shaming and guilt, and ultimately foreclose any possibility of positive change.” “How do you feel now?” Polyphemus inquired. “Great,” I responded. “I feel great.” “So will you honor the spirit of true progressivism in your heart, and try to keep it always?” he demanded. “Perhaps,” I said. “But not just now. A bootleg copy of the latest Game of Thrones season just made it past Charon. And anyway, I’ve faced my fears, I’ve recognized my progressive privilege, and I feel like I’ve really grown through this experience.” Polyphemus smirked at me. I smirked back. Epilogue: And so I thought no more about these matters, and have been able to return to my comfortable existence in the underworld. I no longer need this diary, and am casting it into a bottle so that it can dance along the eddies of fate, troubling whom it may. Outis Philalithopoulos",0
8235,"Ahead of Theresa May’s Visit, Talk of Trade Deal Is Clouded by Politics - The New York Times","In the world according to President Trump, the United States and Britain are about to make their special relationship great again. Having cast off decades of global niceties  —   the United States by putting him in the White House, Britain by voting to leave the European Union  —   they can now forge a magnificent future. Mr. Trump is readying proof. As he prepares to host Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain at the White House on Friday, he intends to begin discussions on a   agreement that would deepen commercial ties between their countries. A trade agreement would make for useful political theater on both sides of the Atlantic, particularly as President Barack Obama had pointedly warned that a deal would not easily happen. But as a spur to economic expansion and hiring, a deal would almost certainly amount to very little. Until Britain actually leaves Europe  —   a step most likely at least two years away  —   it is legally barred from entering a trade agreement with any country. If a deal was quietly negotiated to take effect after Britain’s departure, its economic punch would probably be modest. Tariffs between the countries are already minimal, meaning there are relatively few trade impediments left to clear away. What areas of business could be opened to increased competition tend to be the most politically sensitive: agriculture, government procurement and defense. Legions of lobbyists would mount ferocious battles to preserve the privileges of   industries. American federal government contracts would attract keen interest from British defense and aerospace companies, especially as Mr. Trump has vowed to rebuild the military. But opening such business to foreign competitors in a trade agreement would directly collide with Mr. Trump’s “America First” mantra. “If President Trump genuinely means ‘buy American, hire American’ above all else, then there’s going to be very little left to offer other countries,” said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the   committee at the Bank of England and now president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “There is no way in hell this is a massive trade deal. It would take massive effort to create a trade deal of even minimal effect. ” Trade, it is worth noting, tends to involve  . Negotiations are politically fraught, because they expose domestic industries to the prospect of greater competition with overseas companies. In exchange, domestic consumers gain access to more and cheaper products. British steak aficionados may cheer the shrinking of steep tariffs that limit the influx of American beef. The British beef industry would probably respond less enthusiastically. It would seek protection, particularly as Britain’s exit from the bloc would eliminate European subsidies for British agriculture. Any proposed opening of agriculture would probaly provoke British opposition to genetically modified crops. British insurance companies may be eager for a greater crack at the enormous American market, but that would be outside the scope of a potential deal. In the United States, the insurance industry is regulated at the state level, meaning the Trump administration would lack the authority to engineer an opening. The biggest impediment to a substantial deal between Britain and the United States is the similarity of the two economies, and especially the importance of financial services on both shores. Opening finance to greater competition would require that British bankers pledge fealty to American regulations. Either that, or the rules would have to be opened and renegotiated by both sides. That might happen in the same way that Mr. Trump might perhaps renounce shiny ties and golf in favor of   and Zen meditation. For American companies, the appeal of giving something up to gain access to the British market has been diminished by the very thing that makes such a trade permissible: Britain’s looming exit from Europe, known as Brexit. Britain’s inclusion in the European Union and its enormous single market has made Britain a prized center for manufacturing and corporate headquarters for multinational companies. American investment banks have been able to set up shop in London and use these bases to serve clients from Ireland to Romania, as if operating in one country. But once Britain leaves Europe, these benefits would almost certainly disappear, raising endless questions about the future terms of trade across the English Channel. Already, major banks are publicly outlining plans to shift some operations to cities in the European Union, exploring Dublin, Paris and Luxembourg. Already, major multinational companies are expressing reservations about sinking the next investment in Britain. All of this makes a trade deal less compelling, diminishing the stakes, leaving politics as the most meaningful context. Last year, before Britain’s referendum, Mr. Obama visited the country and urged voters to opt for remaining in Europe. He sought to undercut a key aspiration of those urging a break from the bloc  —   the prospect that a more independent Britain could strike a   deal with the United States. Washington had little interest in striking deals with single countries, Mr. Obama said, preferring to focus on giant multilateral trade arrangements like the sprawling   Partnership (a deal Mr. Trump just renounced). If it sought a trade deal with the United States, Britain would land “in the back of the queue,” Mr. Obama warned. With Mr. Trump now in the White House, Britain’s place in the queue has effectively been upgraded, a handy development for Mrs. May as she presses ahead with Brexit. She is under pressure to demonstrate that Britain, once liberated from Europe, can harvest bounty via trade with   more innovative parts of the globe. A trade deal with the largest economy on earth would presumably check that box. “It is clearly in the British government’s political interest to show that it can negotiate a   agreement with the United States,” said Stephen Woolcock, a trade expert at the London School of Economics. “The question is what the economic costs and benefits of such an agreement would be? These would seem to be less clear cut. ” In much of the world, Britain’s decision to abandon the European Union has been construed as a retrenchment of British influence and a disengagement from global affairs. In recent weeks, Mrs. May has labored to displace that notion by describing   Britain as a land of dauntless capitalists scouring the planet for fresh opportunities. In a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week, she described a British exit as “a vote to take control and make decisions for ourselves and, crucially, to become even more global and internationalist in action and in spirit, too. Because that is who we are as a nation. ” A trade deal with the United States could be considered evidence to further that case. Mr. Trump could post a deal with Britain on Twitter as proof he is not, despite popular perceptions, a nativist protectionist leading the United States on a retreat from global concerns. Mr. Trump has   Carrier and Ford Motor into altering plans to shift production from American factories to Mexico, cashing in on photo opportunities that allow him to claim he is engineering a renaissance in industrial America, even as the big picture remains unchanged. In a similar vein, he could use a trade deal with Britain  —   even a narrow, economically inconsequential one  —   to claim vindication for his encouragement of leaving the bloc. That could resonate with the sort of voters who make up Mr. Trump’s base as well as supporters of Brexit in Britain  —   that is, those inclined to blame immigrants for economic afflictions. “Trump can play to his constituents,” Mr. Posen of the Peterson Institute said, people “who believe that trade deals among white rich people are particularly desirable. ”",0
8236,Blueprint for social control: The brutal legacy of the Attica prison uprising,"Sun, 23 Oct 2016 00:00 UTC Heather Ann Thompson's book "" Blood in the Water : The Attica Prison Uprising of 1971 and Its Legacy"" is a detailed study of the inner workings of America. The blueprint for social control employed before and after the crushing of the Attica revolt is the same blueprint used today to keep tens of millions of poor people, especially poor people of color, caged or living in miniature police states. Thompson meticulously documents the innumerable ways the state oppresses the poor by discrediting their voices, turning the press into a megaphone for government propaganda and lies, stoking the negative stereotypes of black people, exalting white supremacy, ruining the lives of people who speak the truth, manipulating the courts and law enforcement, and pressuring state witnesses to lie to obstruct justice. Her book elucidates not only the past but also the present, which, she concedes, is worse. ""America by the early twenty-first century had, in disturbing ways, come to resemble America in the late nineteenth century,"" Thompson writes near the end of her book. ""In 1800 the three-fifths clause gave white voters political power from a black population that was itself barred from voting, and after 2000 prison gerrymandering was doing exactly the same thing in numerous states across the country. After 1865, African American desires for equality and civil rights in the South following the American Civil War led whites to criminalize African American communities in new ways and then sent record numbers of blacks to prison in that region. Similarly, a dramatic spike in black incarceration followed the civil rights movement—a movement that epitomized Attica. And just as businesses had profited from the increased number of Americans in penal facilities after 1870, so did they seek the labor of a growing captive prison population after 1970. In both centuries, white Americans had responded to black claims for freedom by beefing up, and making more punitive, the nation's criminal justice system."" On Sept. 9, 1971, prisoners at the Attica Correctional Facility in upstate New York rebelled in the face of intolerable conditions . They were sick of the racist-fueled violence of the white, rural guards; angry at poor medical care and the dearth of vocational and educational programs; underfed (the prison allocated only 63 cents a day to feed a prisoner); unhappy about their mail being censored, or destroyed if it was in Spanish; living in poorly ventilated cells with little or no heat or stifling heat; unable to buy basic commissary items on salaries that averaged 6 cents a day; and tired of being given only one bar of soap and one roll of toilet paper a month and allowed only one shower a week. The uprising was not premeditated. It took place when prisoners, trapped inadvertently by guards in a tunnel that led to the yard, thought they were going to be given another beating by sadistic correction officers. The spontaneous uprising took place ""because ordinary men, poor men, disenfranchised men, and men of color had simply had enough of being treated as less than human, "" Thompson writes. Four hundred fifty prisoners had previously staged a peaceful sit-down strike in the prison's metal shop to protest wages that, as a witness later testified at a New York state hearing, were ""so low that working at Attica [was] tantamount to slavery."" Prisoners had formed committees and sent respectful letters to prison authorities asking them to address their concerns. The requests were largely ignored. Despite authorities' promises that there would be no retribution, those who organized the protests were put in isolation or transferred to other prisons. The callousness of the officials was especially unconscionable in light of the fact that the state had netted huge sums for sales of products made by the prisoners. Comment: The slave labor system continues to this day, forcing inmates to begin hunger strikes and work stoppages to end prison slavery: End prison slavery!' 24,000+ inmates join nationwide jail strike causing lockdowns (VIDEO) After three days of negotiations, in which the prison authorities refused to grant the rebellious prisoners amnesty, 550 New York state troopers, 200 sheriff's deputies and numerous Attica prison guards were issued high-powered weapons, including rifles loaded with especially destructive bullets that expanded on impact, bullets banned in warfare under the Geneva Conventions. The prisoners had no firearms. The assault force members were fed a steady diet of lies and unfounded rumors to stoke their hatred of the prisoners. Black radicals were coming, they were falsely told, to the town of Attica to kidnap white children, a rumor that led to the closing of the schools. Through clouds of CS gas , the assault force stormed the yard, where some 1,200 prisoners held 42 guards and civilian staff members. It unleashed a blizzard of gunfire, shooting 130 people. Twenty-nine prisoners and nine hostages died. (One guard beaten by prisoners in the first moments of the uprising died later in a hospital.) The assault force, which had done all the killings that day, immediately began to hide evidence of its crimes. State officials told the press outside the prison that seven or eight of the hostages had died when the prisoners slit their throats. They claimed that the genitals of one of the guards were cut off and stuffed in his mouth. These reports were untrue, but they dominated the news coverage. Meanwhile, inside the retaken institution, many prisoners were suffering from gunshot wounds that would not be treated for days. Some were stripped and made to run gantlets in which they were beaten by guards with ax handles, baseball bats and rifle butts. Those singled out as the leaders of the rebellion were marked with Xs on their backs, forced to crawl through mud, tortured and in few cases, it appears, executed. New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller and the Nixon White House feared that the rebellion presaged armed revolution. The scores of dead and wounded were, for them, a message to the rest of the country— defy us and we will kill you . Today, any citizen who seriously resists the corporate state can expect the same response. Comment: A perfect example: Private security mercenaries pepper spray and sic dogs on Dakota Access Pipeline protesters Thompson writes, ""All of those assembled in the president's office agreed that while the morning's events made a particularly 'gruesome story,' news of the slashings and castration would go a long way toward discrediting America's 'bleeding hearts' like 'the Tom Wicker s of the world.' 'I think this is going to have a hell of a salutary effect on future prison riots,' Nixon said. 'Just as Kent State [the May 4, 1970, shooting by National Guardsmen of unarmed students that left four dead and nine wounded] had a hell of a salutary effect. ... They can talk all they want about force, but that is the purpose of force.' "" The avalanche of government lies permeates the narrative —not a surprise to anyone who has reported on the inner workings of power or spent time in our prisons and marginal communities. There are heroes in the narrative. Their fate, which is almost universally bleak, is also instructive. The prisoner Sam Melville, who was serving an 18-year sentence in Attica for setting off explosives in government buildings to protest the Vietnam War, who taught classes to other inmates and who researched prison operations to show how the institution cruelly exploited prisoner labor for profit, was executed by guards after the uprising, according to other prisoners. So, apparently, was Elliot ""L.D."" Barkley, who was in prison for violating parole by driving without a license and who, although he was only 21, was one of the most articulate spokespeople for the prisoners. Prisoners such as Frank ""Big Black"" Smith, savagely tortured by guards after the uprising, and Bernard ""Shango"" Stroble rose up majestically during the revolt to protect hostages and maintain order, and they fought for justice long after their release from prison. Civil rights attorneys such as Ernie Goodman and William Kunstler came to the prisoners' defense. A few within the governmental system exhibited rare moral courage. Among them were Dr. John Edland of the Monroe County medical examiner's office, who refused to falsify autopsy reports and told the public that the hostages had been killed by state gunfire; Attica guard Michael Smith, who defied his own fraternity to speak the truth about state abuse; and government attorney Malcolm Bell, who exposed the state cover-up of the killings by the state troopers, sheriff's deputies and prison guards. However, most who knew the truth remained silent. Edland was especially singled out for condemnation. He was attacked as incompetent by state officials and called a clown and, although a Republican, a radical left-winger. (State troopers were dispatched to local funeral homes to prevent morticians from informing families of the cause of death of hostages.) Edland received death threats and other hate mail, was shunned by the local community and saw state troopers menacingly idle their automobiles in front of his home. Edland called the day he released the autopsy findings ""the worst day of my life."" When the state decides to isolate, discredit and crush you it has innumerable ways to do so. The press often is manipulated. Employers blacklist you. A gullible population is made to believe the caricature of you as a traitor or an enemy . Such smear campaigns are now directed against Julian Assange, Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden. New York State Police Capt. Henry ""Hank"" Williams oversaw the investigation into the 1971 assault. This meant that, in Thompson's words, ""the main investigators of the crimes of Attica were those who may well have committed them."" Williams made sure that ""nothing related to the shooting—shell casings, the weapons themselves—was collected."" No chalk outlines, usually required at a crime scene, were drawn to indicate where the bodies had fallen. No calculations were made regarding bullet trajectories. The yard where the killings took place was cleaned up under Williams' supervision as quickly as possible. Prisoners were threatened with violence or indictment if they refused to incriminate the leaders of the uprising. The goal was not justice; it was to punish and isolate the prisoner leadership and protect law enforcement. ""When strong-arm tactics still proved ineffective,"" Thompson writes concerning one interrogation, ""they switched their approach: should this witness help them, investigators suggested, they would, in turn, help him get paroled. In addition to enticing the witness with the possibility of parole, they also promised to make prison life easier for him in the meantime."" Scores of prisoners were indicted in connection with the uprising; only one member of the assault force was charged, with a minor offense. The state's entire case when it went to the courts was built on a scaffolding of lies designed to exonerate the assault force and punish prisoner leaders. Jurors, who saw doctored films and photographs, never knew they were being presented with fabricated and tainted evidence, including photos of crude knives that had been planted next to slain prisoners. Witnesses recited stories fed to them by government investigators. The state has never admitted wrongdoing for the Attica assault, and important parts of the record —autopsies, ballistics reports, trooper statements, and depositions— remain sealed nearly five decades later . Thompson stumbled onto Attica files in the Erie County courthouse and the New York State Museum, but since her discovery, she writes, they have vanished or ""been removed from anyone's view."" ""American voters ultimately did not respond to this prison uprising by demanding that states rein in police power, "" she concludes. ""Instead they demanded that police be given even more support and even more punitive laws to enforce. Comment: And despite the curent wave of police brutality, the sheeple continue to support them: Respect for police among Americans surges to highs not seen since late '60s ""Indeed, the 1960s and 1970s were all about the politics of the ironic. At the Democratic National Convention protests of 1968, Kent State in 1970, and Wounded Knee in 1973, unfettered police power each time turned protests violent, and yet, after each of these events, the nation was sent the message that the people, not the police, were dangerous. Somehow, voters came to believe that democracy was worth curtailing and civil rights and liberties were worth suspending for the sake of 'order' and maintaining the status quo."" Though immediately after the Attica uprising there were minor reforms, these improvements were soon rolled back. Conditions in prisons today are worse than those that led to the 1971 revolt. Control of prison populations is more brutal, more sophisticated and more inhumane. It is doubtful that the press, unlike at Attica in 1971, would ever be allowed inside a prison during an uprising to air the voices of the prisoners. Much of the worst damage was done during the Clinton administration . President Bill Clinton signed into law, with Republican support, the draconian 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. It provided $9.7 billion to build more prisons. By 1995 the prison population exceeded 1 million. It would soon double. ""The fact that so many of these people now in prison had been arrested because they were drug addicts, mentally ill, poor, and racially profiled concerned few if any politicians , whether in a statehouse or in Washington, D.C.,"" Thompson writes. ""Then, to make sure that this now enormous group of the incarcerated did not resist their deteriorating conditions of confinement via the nation's legal system as they had done so effectively both before and after the Attica uprising, in 1996 legislators passed the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA)."" The PLRA made it difficult and often impossible for prisoners to use the courts to protect their Eighth Amendment right not to endure cruel and unusual punishment. The New York Times columnist Tom Wicker, who was part of the negotiating team that tried to resolve the Attica uprising without bloodshed, singled out white fear as the central issue in the 1971 case. ""White fear fixed itself upon the literal presence of black human beings. Black people, to whites, were the symbolic representation of the evil in man and thus were also the handy instruments by which white people could hold themselves symbolically innocent of that evil."" Wicker concluded, ""The heart of the matter was the fear of blackness."" This white fear remains unexamined in America. It allows us to stand by passively and watch the daily murders by police of unarmed black men and women. It allows us to maintain a prison system that holds a staggering 25 percent of the world's prisoners, the majority of them poor people of color. This white fear condemns us as a nation. It perpetuates the evil of white supremacy. Poor people of color have been robbed of the most elemental forms of justice and basic constitutional rights. But the state, in the age of deindustrialization, has no intention of stopping there. These forms of social control, so familiar to poor people of color, will bear upon all of us.",0

8238,Inequality as Policy,"Globalization and technology are routinely cited as drivers of inequality over the last four decades. While the relative importance of these causes is disputed, both are often viewed as natural and inevitable products of the working of the economy, rather than as the outcomes of deliberate policy. In fact, both the course of globalization and the distribution of rewards from technological innovation are very much the result of policy. Insofar as they have led to greater inequality, this has been the result of conscious policy choices.
Starting with globalization, there was nothing pre-determined about a pattern of trade liberalization that put U.S. manufacturing workers in direct competition with their much lower paid counterparts in the developing world. Instead, that competition was the result of trade pacts written to make it as easy as possible for U.S. corporations to invest in the developing world to take advantage of lower labor costs, and then ship their products back to the United States. The predicted and actual result of this pattern of trade has been to lower wages for manufacturing workers and non-college educated workers more generally, as displaced manufacturing workers crowd into other sectors of the economy.
Instead of only putting manufacturing workers into competition with lower-paid workers in other countries, our trade deals could have been crafted to subject doctors, dentists, lawyers and other highly-paid professionals to international competition. As it stands, almost nothing has been done to remove the protectionist barriers that allow highly-educated professionals in the United States to earn far more than their counterparts in other wealthy countries.
This is clearest in the case of doctors. For the most part, it is impossible for foreign-trained physicians to practice in the United States unless they have completed a residency program in the United States. The number of residency slots, in turn, is strictly limited, as is the number of slots open for foreign medical students. While this is a quite blatantly protectionist restriction, it has persisted largely unquestioned through a long process of trade liberalization that has radically reduced or eliminated most of the barriers on trade in goods. The result is that doctors in the United States earn an average of more than $250,000 a year, more than twice as much as their counterparts in other wealthy countries. This costs the country roughly $100 billion a year in higher medical bills compared to a situation in which U.S. doctors received the same pay as doctors elsewhere. Economists, including trade economists, have largely chosen to ignore the barriers that sustain high professional pay at enormous economic cost.
In addition to the items subject to trade, the overall trade balance is also very much the result of policy choices. The textbook theory has capital flowing from rich countries to poor countries, which means that rich countries run trade surpluses with poor countries. While this accurately described the pattern of trade in the 1990s up until the East Asian financial crisis (a period in which the countries of the region enjoyed very rapid growth), in the last two decades developing countries taken as a whole have been running large trade surpluses with wealthy countries.
This implies large trade deficits in rich countries, especially the United States, which in turn has meant a further loss of manufacturing jobs with the resulting negative impact on wage inequality. However, there was nothing inevitable about the policy shifts associated with the bailout from the East Asian financial crisis that led the developing world to become a net exporter of capital.
The pattern of gains from technology has been even more directly determined by policy than is the case with gains from trade. There has been a considerable strengthening and lengthening of patent and copyright and related protections over the last four decades. The laws have been changed to extend patents to new areas such as life forms, business methods, and software. Copyright duration has been extended from 55 years to 95 years. Perhaps even more important, the laws have become much more friendly to holders of these property claims to tilt legal proceedings in their favor, with courts becoming more patent-friendly and penalties for violations becoming harsher. And, the United States has placed stronger intellectual property (IP) rules at center of every trade agreement negotiated in the last quarter century.
In this context, it would hardly be surprising if the development of “technology” was causing an upward redistribution of income. The people in a position to profit from stronger IP rules are almost exclusively the highly educated and those at the top end of the income distribution. It is almost definitional that stronger IP rules will result in an upward redistribution of income.
This upward redistribution could be justified if stronger IP rules led to more rapid productivity growth, thereby benefitting the economy as a whole. However, there is very little evidence to support that claim. Michele Boldrin and David Levine have done considerable research on this topic and generally found the opposite. My own work , using cross-country regressions with standard measures of patent strength, generally found a negative and often significant relationship between patent strength and productivity growth.
There is also a substantial amount of money at stake. In the case of prescription drugs alone, the United States is on path to spend more than $430 billion in 2016 for drugs that would likely cost one-tenth of this amount in the absence of patent and related protections. While we do need mechanisms for financing innovation and creative work, it is almost certainly the case that patent and copyright monopolies as currently structured are not the most efficient route, even if their negative consequences for distribution are quite evident.
The structuring of trade and rules on IP are two important ways in which policy has been designed to redistribute income upward over the last four decades. There are many other ways in which the market has been structured to disadvantage those at the middle and bottom of the income distribution, perhaps most notably macroeconomic policies that result in high unemployment. While tax and transfer policies that reduce poverty and inequality may be desirable, we should also be aware of the ways in which policy has been designed to increase inequality. It is much easier to have an economic system that produces more equality rather than one that needlessly generates inequality, which we then try to address with redistributive policies.

8240,Crossing the Acheron: Back to Vietnam,"Email 
In classical mythology, the Acheron is one of the rivers of the Underworld. It marks the boundary between the living and the dead. The ferryman Charon ferries the dead across the Acheron to a place where they lose memory. Nothing of what made them human remains—happiness, suffering, love, hatred, guilt, regret, redemption, betrayal, forgiveness. 
From Gilgamesh to Odysseus to Aeneas, the living heroes of the epic descend into the Underworld at a point of despair in the sense of their quest. Burdened by a fate that requires momentous courage and tragic self-sacrifice for the sake of their people’s survival, they resent the absurdity of their lot. Down there on a visit, they return from the shadow land strengthened. They recognize that the business of living is not oblivion but action. 
John Marciano’s recently published book, The American War in Vietnam: Crime or Commemoration ? functions as such a Charon in reverse. It ferries readers back to the realm of remembering. This slim volume could not have come at a more opportune moment. American political culture is punch-drunk with the pursuit of war. The altered state is reaching the point of delirium tremens. Thwarted in the neocolonial scheme of annexing Syria by Russia’s legal intervention, the American elite are pushing for confrontation. Though it is hard to think the unthinkable, the nuclear holocaust may happen if not by intention then by spontaneous combustion from over-intoxication with the fumes of war. 
This reckless confrontation results from decades of accumulated unaccountable power. Its boldness reflects a cumulative experience of impunity for aggressive behavior by soft and hard neocolonial postures since the end of WW II. The war in Vietnam, as Marciano suggests, should have functioned as the lesson that checked the nation’s historical thrust for conquest, but the turning point would have required a national effort to relinquish the myth of the Noble Cause, the delusion that America is vested with a divine mandate to assimilate the people of the world to the American image–for the people’s own good. Britain had its White Man’s Burden; France its mission civilatrise ; America its Manifest Destiny. 
This timely volume traces the war to the apocalyptic finale of the most powerful military in the world defeated by the determination, courage, and self-sacrifice of a peasant people unwilling to be enslaved. But this is as much a book about the past as it is about the present. It reminds us, with Tolstoy, “The reality of war is in the killing, “ a realization officialdom would like to block. In fact, they have prepared a falsifying celebration of that moral and military debacle. 
As Marciano writes in his introduction, 
“In May 2012, President Barack Obama and the Pentagon announced a Commemoration of the Vietnam War to continue through 2025, the fiftieth anniversary of the conflict’s end. Among the Commemoration’s objectives, three stand out: ‘to thank and honor’ veterans and their families . . . ‘to highlight the advances in technology, science, and medicine related to military research conducted during’ the war; and to ‘recognize the contributions and sacrifices made by the allies’.” 
President Obama claimed in the commemoration announcement speech that the war had been “an honorable cause.” Marciano challenges this notion. America’s historic ideology of the Noble Cause, he writes, rests on the belief that the United States is 
“A unique force for good in the world, superior not only in its military and economic power, but in the quality of its government and institutions, the character and morality of its people, and its way of life.” 
This is the mystical bigotry of a messianic faith typical of empires. Imperial militarism seeks in a Noble Cause the justification for subjugating large chunks of humanity. In the distant past, the Noble Cause may have received the sword directly from a god—as it did in postcolonial America when it sought to exterminate the native inhabitants. By the anointment of the sword, the divinity also endowed, supposedly, the conquering “race” with moral superiority. Thus, imperialism, in the perverse arrogance of its twisted psyche, contains the germ of genocide. As a result, the superstition of a superior “race” has been endured by most of the “races” on the planet as a most Ignoble Cause. In Vietnam alone, the Big Lie of the Noble Cause sent four million Vietnamese to their death. 
Marciano leaves us in no doubt that the White House and the Pentagon are commemorating a crime. They are falsifying history in order to shape the future, which will be and is the reenactment of the war against Vietnam on a global scale. They want to establish the altar for a “sacred union,” the nation united behind the Noble Cause of war. On the altar will sit the fetish of the export of the “miracle of democracy, ” in reality the imposition of regimes of terror such as the Vietnam War planners established in Saigon. We see today in Ukraine that the “miracle of democracy,” brought to Kiev by the US in 2014 to the tune of five billion dollars, amounts to a handful of dry dust, collected from the WW II graveyard of European Nazism, inciting a lot of blind, anti-democratic and noxious nationalism. 
As through a glass darkly, Marciano shows us that in the war crime against Vietnam we can see reflected the crimes perpetrated today from Afghanistan to Yemen, from Iraq to Syria, from Yugoslavia to Libya and across the African continent. As in Vietnam (the fakery of the Gulf of Tonkin incident), today’s war are based on fabricated pretexts; as in Vietnam (napalm and agent orange), today’s wars are chemical wars (depleted uranium for Yugoslavia and Iraq; phosphorus for Falluja); as in Vietnam (Hanoi and Haiphong) the bombings destroy urban life, vital infrastructure, schools and hospitals; as in Vietnam (Laos, Cambodia) the bombings spreads out (today to Yemen); as in Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh) the leaders who resist US penetration are demonized (Milosevic, Saddam, Qaddafi, Assad) as enemies of humanity. As in Vietnam, all the wars of today are fought mostly to prevent or reverse independence and self-determination of former colonial places. 
Finally, as in Vietnam the USSR, today’s Russia is emerging as the displacement of all the guilt that weighs on the shoulders of the Noble Cause. The Washington Post recently wrote “the Kremlin annexed Ukraine.” I read it twice—not “annexed Crimea,” the standard disinformation, but the whole of Ukraine! Does one laugh or weep? Does one have to take a hallucinogenic to see Russian flags and images of Putin blanketing Kiev instead of Neo-Nazi emblems and images of Bandera? 
The next president will certainly be Hillary Clinton, whom I call “the centripetal president.” From Republicans to Democrats to Neo-Cons, all converge on endorsing the war candidate. In her consensus war regime, the elite will decide everything. We will not be consulted. This is why The American War in Vietnam: Crime or Commemoration? is a vital read. It calls for our re-democratization–to question our leaders, to be skeptical of the media, to avert our eyes from the petrifying stare of the Medusa decked with the aegis of the Noble Cause; to challenge—even ridicule– the vaunted humanitarianism of an elite of bloodhounds baying for war; to refuse to commemorate war crimes and to work to stop them. 
Above all, we need to remember that the crimes of other governments are the responsibility of the people of those governments—not of our bombs. Though our elite have abrogated to themselves the power and the right to remake the map of the world by force, we need to reassert the legal principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of a sovereign states if we are serious about peace. We, citizens, do not have the right (or the power, unless we line up behind the power of the militarist state) to change the practices of other states, but we do have the right to demand change for those of our own. Let’s start exercising that right. We did for Vietnam; we can do it again. Commemorate the people who protested the war in Vietnam, not the crime the governing elite committed there in our name, as Marciano’s book amply documents. 
The US government is now engaged in waging eight wars. We better get busy. ",0
8241,Where Are Women in F.B.I.’s Top Ranks? - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   When the call came in that a bomb had exploded in Manhattan, Amy Hess quickly got to work.

She is also the first woman to head the science branch  —   one of few female agents commanding such an important job at the F. B. I. a clubby agency where men are more predominant in senior positions than they were even three years ago. Ms. Hess, 50, put it simply: “There is a lack of women in leadership roles. ” Today at the F. B. I. women hold 12 percent of 220 senior agent positions, including nine who run field offices in places like Los Angeles Oklahoma City Louisville, Ky. and Knoxville, Tenn. That is a decline from 2013, when women held about 20 percent of senior agent jobs and 15 women ran field offices. “It seems to be going backwards,” said Janice K. Fedarcyk, now retired, who ran the New York office, with about 2, 000 employees, from 2010 to 2012. “They need to do something to turn that around. ’’ James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director, has described the lack of women  —   and also minorities  —   in the F. B. I. as a serious problem that can undermine investigations and keep the agency out of touch with the communities it serves. Of the bureau’s 13, 523 agents over all, 2, 683  —   or about 20 percent  —   are women. About 83 percent of the agents over all are white. “The big challenge we’ve been confronting over the last two years is, how do we get women and people of color” to join the F. B. I. Mr. Comey said last Sunday at a conference of police chiefs in San Diego. “That’s been our big trouble, and I’ve described it as a crisis. ” In response, the F. B. I. put a plan in place to try to increase the overall number of female agents to 33 percent. The bureau will also soon start providing field offices with recruitment data, something it had never done. That will allow the F. B. I. to track where it has successfully recruited employees and perhaps tie the data to performance reviews and bonuses. “Our ability to be believed is at risk,” Mr. Comey said in a speech earlier this year. “The F. B. I. must be able to stand on any corner in the U. S. or before any jury and be believed. ” The F. B. I. has long struggled to promote women. It was not until after J. Edgar Hoover’s death in 1972 that women were accepted as agents  —   the people at the agency who carry guns, run investigations and are at the heart of the F. B. I. ’s macho culture. It took another two decades before Burdena G. Pasenelli, known as Birdie, was appointed the first female agent to run a field office. Her assignment? Anchorage, which was not then, or now, at the center of the action. But for women in the bureau, Ms. Pasenelli, who died this year, was a trailblazer. “It opened the door for a lot of women to think about the possibilities,” said Stephanie Douglas, who in 2012 became the first woman to run the F. B. I. ’s national security branch. Ms. Douglas, who worked with prosecutors to investigate the destruction of C. I. A. videotapes that depicted the torture of terrorism suspects overseas, retired in 2013. F. B. I. officials say they cannot explain completely the step backward for women in leadership roles at the bureau, but they say retirements and the timing of openings are partly responsible. David Schlendorf, assistant director for the F. B. I. ’s human resources division, called it a “worrisome” trend, although not intractable. “I am optimistic we can do better,” said Valerie Parlave, Mr. Schlendorf’s boss, who in 2013 became the first woman to run the Washington field office. Women cite three important reasons so few of them are in the F. B. I. ’s senior ranks. First, the F. B. I. ’s path to promotion is often less appealing to women, more than a dozen former and current female agents said. F. B. I. agents can be transferred at a moment’s notice, which often requires leaving a family behind. Traditionally, that has meant that men in the bureau have to uproot without their children and spouses for long stretches of time, a sacrifice women may be less willing to make. Ms. Douglas, who does not have children, said that she once moved from San Francisco to Washington in four days and that she relocated four times from 2005 to 2013. Each time a call came, she feared that if she said no, she might not get another chance. “The bureau is incredibly competitive,” Ms. Douglas said. “If you don’t take advantage of that opportunity, somebody else will. ” Second, women say the F. B. I. does not have enough   female role models or mentors. Although women hold senior agent jobs, a woman has never been in charge of a large F. B. I. operational division like counterterrorism, which in the    world has been dominated by men who went on to bigger jobs  —   including the F. B. I. ’s No. 2 position, deputy director. A woman has never been deputy director, or director. Ms. Fedarcyk, the former head of the New York field office who was also the top agent in charge of terrorism in Los Angeles and managed the bureau’s effort to track terrorism financing, said her success was, in part, because people took an interest in her work and helped her along the way. “I had a great career,” she said. “There are a lot of different reasons why that is the case. Some women don’t want to take that next step. Some guys don’t want to take that next step. I was fortunate coming up in the bureau. I had strong mentors. ” A third problem, women say, is that far fewer women apply for top F. B. I. jobs than men. For every dozen or so applicants for a senior job, Ms. Hess said, only one or two are women. In part, that is because there are fewer women in the agency to begin with, but women also shy away from applying for top F. B. I. jobs, Ms. Hess said, for the same reason that many men do: They see sitting behind a desk, even with more seniority and pay, as inferior to what many consider the dream job of agent  —   working the streets, meeting with informants, making cases and putting criminals in jail. “That’s the reason you come into the bureau,” said Ms. Hess, who once worked violent crimes, gangs and drugs and briefly ran F. B. I. counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan. “Not to push paper. ” This month, Ms. Hess will take over the office in Louisville, the eighth move in her career. At the F. B. I. there have been many challenges for women. Female agents have repeatedly sued the F. B. I. for sexual harassment and discrimination. This year, a former agent accused her male   in the Denver office of behaving inappropriately and making disparaging comments. According to the lawsuit, a male agent was overheard talking about a female colleague: “I hope she quits. She can stay home in the kitchen. ” Beverly Andress, who joined the agency in 1983 and retired in 2006, recalled that she was often introduced as a “female agent” rather than just an agent. “You have to have a good sense of humor,” she said. “It’s a man’s world. ” F. B. I. officials say that if the numbers are looked at as an average over the last decade, the agency has a better record of women in senior agent positions  —   about 16 percent  —   than other federal law enforcement agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Drug Enforcement Administration and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Only the Secret Service had a slightly higher percentage of women in senior agent positions. Female agents say they will know the F. B. I. has made progress when a woman is finally put in charge of counterterrorism, criminal investigations, counterintelligence or is appointed as deputy director. For now, the stars in those divisions are overwhelmingly male. “We are playing ” said Voviette Morgan, a senior agent who runs the bureau’s internal investigations section and is a seasoned counterterrorism investigator. “In 2016, I hate the fact we say firsts. ” “We are behind the curve,” Ms. Morgan added. “There is no doubt about it. ”",0
8242,10 Questions (and Answers) About New Email Trove - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Just days before Election Day, and with voters in many states already going to the polls, the F. B. I. director made a stunning announcement on Friday: Agents had discovered new emails that might be relevant to the completed investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private server, a case that she had seemingly put behind her in July. Never in recent history has the F. B. I. been so enmeshed in a presidential race. With a vague   statement to Congress, the F. B. I. sent jolts through the campaign, leaving many voters unsure what to make of a case involving national security secrets, a disgraced congressman, racy text messages and a dispute among the country’s top law enforcement officers. Here’s what we know so far.  What happened on Friday? The F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, sent a letter to Congress that said agents had uncovered new emails that could be connected to the Clinton investigation. That investigation had examined whether Mrs. Clinton and her aides had mishandled classified information by sending it through Mrs. Clinton’s private email server. The inquiry was completed in July with no charges filed. Mr. Comey said on Friday that agents would review the new emails to see whether they contained classified information. The letter was sent 11 days before the presidential election, and it set off fierce criticism of Mr. Comey for appearing to meddle in politics. The F. B. I. director’s letter did not reopen the Clinton inquiry, though some Republicans, including Donald J. Trump, characterized the move that way. Agents could open a new inquiry if they find evidence that the earlier investigation had been impeded or that classified materials had been intentionally mishandled.  Where did these new emails come from? Mr. Comey did not say in his letter. But law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation said that agents had discovered the emails on a laptop owned by Anthony D. Weiner, the disgraced former congressman and estranged husband of Mrs. Clinton’s top aide, Huma Abedin. Last month, the F. B. I. began investigating allegations that Mr. Weiner had exchanged sexually explicit messages with a teenager. On Oct. 3, agents in New York executed a search warrant to obtain Mr. Weiner’s iPhone, an iPad and the laptop. Searching the laptop, they found evidence of a trove of emails similar to ones that had been examined in the Clinton investigation. Mr. Comey decided last week that agents should examine those emails to determine whether they contained national security information. That requires a court order, and officials said agents had not yet begun reading the emails.  Why does the F. B. I. care if there is classified information in the emails? Under federal law, mishandling national security information is a crime, one that the F. B. I. is responsible for investigating. In 2015, the bureau began investigating the personal email account that Mrs. Clinton had used exclusively as secretary of state. As part of that investigation, the bureau tried to find every electronic device  —   phones, tablets, computers  —   that Mrs. Clinton and her aides used. Agents could not find many of them, including several of Mrs. Clinton’s cellphones and two iPads. The agents knew that those devices, and others they were not aware of, might someday surface. But they completed the Clinton case because they found no evidence that anyone had intentionally broken the law. The newly discovered emails may  —   or may not  —   provide new information to the F. B. I.  Why did Mr. Comey send the letter? In July, Mr. Comey told Congress that the Clinton investigation was complete but that if new information came to light, the bureau would examine it. Mr. Comey pledged to be as transparent as he could with Congress about the investigation, and has since made public hundreds of pages of documents related to the inquiry. According to senior F. B. I. officials, Mr. Comey felt that he would be breaking his pledge of transparency to Congress if he did not reveal the new information from the Weiner case. And he believed that the bureau would be accused of suppressing details to benefit Mrs. Clinton  —   an accusation that he believed could do lasting damage to the F. B. I. ’s credibility.  Who is upset with Mr. Comey for sending the letter? Many Democrats and even some Republicans have called the letter vague, troubling and unprecedented. Senior officials at the Justice Department urged Mr. Comey not to send the letter, saying it violated the spirit of longstanding policies not to discuss current investigations or do anything that could be seen as meddling in an election. In the letter, Mr. Comey said that the F. B. I. had yet to determine whether “this material may be significant,” and that he could not predict how long the review would take. Mrs. Clinton’s campaign has pushed Mr. Comey to release more information about the emails. Her campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, said that “by providing selective information, he has allowed partisans to distort and exaggerate to inflict maximum political damage. ” What does all of this mean for Mrs. Clinton and her campaign? The short answer is that it is not yet clear. Polling on weekends can be unreliable, so it may be a few days before the effect of the development can be fully assessed. What is evident is that a campaign that has largely been a referendum on Mr. Trump  —   particularly since the first debate  —   is now not so  . The email development will certainly matter, but the question is just how much. Twenty million people have already voted, and millions more have already determined whom they will support. The country was already politically polarized before this election, and opinions are overwhelmingly cemented about these two   nominees. The email news could matter most in   races. After being on the defensive for weeks because of Mr. Trump’s behavior, Republican candidates now have a more helpful news media environment in which to make their closing arguments. And Republican voters who are otherwise demoralized may have been given one final nudge to show up to the polls.  What happens now? In the coming days, the F. B. I. will begin conducting a smaller version of the larger investigation it completed in July. Agents will go through the emails found on the laptop to determine whether they contain classified information. If so, the bureau will again look at the question of whether anyone intentionally committed a crime. Clinton campaign officials have said that Ms. Abedin gave the authorities all of the electronic devices that she believed had   emails on them. Many of the newly discovered messages are likely to be duplicates of others that the F. B. I. has already examined, investigators say. The review will be conducted by the same   F. B. I. agents who led the investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s emails. F. B. I. agents are all but certain that it will not be completed by Election Day, and believe it will take at least several weeks. Neither Justice Department officials nor F. B. I. agents say they know what to expect from Mr. Comey over the coming days. Normally, investigations are conducted secretly, but Mr. Comey’s public remarks have opened him up to demands from both campaigns that he make as much information public as possible as soon as it is available. What’s the   scenario for Mrs. Clinton and her aides? In July, Mr. Comey announced that the bureau had not found enough evidence to charge anyone with a crime for the mishandling of classified materials on Mrs. Clinton’s server. If the new emails indicate intentional efforts by her or her aides to move such information outside secure government systems, or if they tried to impede the earlier inquiry, the F. B. I. will most likely want to investigate further. But the bureau has just begun the process of combing through the new emails, and officials believe that at least some are duplicates of messages that have already been examined.  How rare is it for the F. B. I. to make a development like this public? Extremely rare. At times during trials or after cases are closed, the F. B. I. finds new evidence and either discloses it to defense lawyers or reopens a case. An F. B. I. director has never made such a disclosure to Congress so close to a presidential election.  How did Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the Justice Department feel about Mr. Comey’s letter? Senior Justice Department officials tried to discourage Mr. Comey from sending the letter, saying that it would violate department guidelines that advise against talking about current criminal investigations or being seen as meddling in elections. They urged Mr. Comey not to do anything before Election Day, and they said he should tell Congress when agents had read the emails, understood whether they were relevant and could put them in context. They stopped short, however, of issuing a direct order prohibiting him from sending the letter.",0
8243,La crisis de Twitter: nada es para siempre,"La crisis de Twitter: nada es para siempre No es un hecho que Twitter quiebre y desaparezca, pero sí es algo que podría suceder: un recordatorio para todos de que no es bueno establecer su estrategia de comunicación únicamente en las redes sociales. Así como las computadoras se hacen obsoletas más rápido que antes, las aplicaciones (apps) y las redes sociales también tendrán una existencia más efímera, incluido Facebook que hasta el momento parece invencible, como en su momento lo parecían IBM y también Microsoft.
Socios | 7 de noviembre de 2016 Gonzalo Monterrosa
Todo lo que sube tiene que bajar. Al principio nadie entendía Twitter. Al poco tiempo parecía indispensable; pero la lección es que nada es realmente indispensable, así que podría seguir el mismo camino que su app de videos cortos, Vine.
Hace un par de semanas Twitter se cimbró con la caída de sus acciones, derivada de que se hizo público (seguramente con esa intención) que existía un desinterés generalizado de grandes empresas por la red social de los 140 caracteres.
Recién se anunció que eliminarían Vine, su plataforma de videos cortos que hace 4 años anunciaba con bombo y platillo y que logró llamar la atención de millones de personas. “Un paso en la dirección correcta”, decían todos.
Ahora se encuentra en una franca reestructuración con despidos que afectarán aproximadamente al 9 por ciento de sus trabajadores, el tipo de problemas de cualquier empresa que está perdiendo su capital y el ingreso de ganancias no es claro. La publicidad avanza lenta y no es fácil para los pequeños negocios utilizarla, a diferencia de Twitter que además de llevarte de la mano insiste sobre los posibles beneficios a sus usuarios.
La red social cuenta con millones de usuarios registrados pero no todos se encuentran activos, no los que necesita Twitter para seguir brillando. Nos encontramos en un momento histórico en el que podría quebrar uno de los productos insignia que representaron por mucho tiempo el concepto de red social.
La app de video Vine se enfrentó a Snapchat y a Instagram y no ha podido competir con ellos a pesar de haber recibido mucho apoyo. Facebook ha ingresado a cada nuevo nicho que aparece en redes sociales, adquiriendo empresas o clonando conceptos que ofrece con algunas variaciones a sus miles de millones de usuarios.
Snapchat es una app para compartir fotografías y videos que se autodestruyen; comparte la misma circunstancia que vivió Twitter cuando surgió: nadie entendía para qué servía, aun así, Snapchat se está convirtiendo en el enemigo a vencer.
Vine no terminaba de posicionarse cuando Twitter comenzó a promocionar Periscope, que representa la posibilidad de la transmisión de video en vivo y que se hizo famoso por que los usuarios transmitían eventos deportivos de pago por evento desde países donde ese mismo evento aparecía en televisión abierta sin costo alguno. Vine estaba limitado a grabar unos cuantos segundos. Se percibió que lo habían abandonado a pesar de que para muchos fomentaba una creatividad visual para narrar historias en seis segundos (que después se incrementaron), al igual que Twitter lo hace al limitar lo que escribimos, lo que presenta un reto muy a pesar de sus detractores generacionales.
Fue en 2015 cuando la app poco a poco dejó de ser popular, desapareció de los listados de las 100 más descargadas tanto en la plataforma de Apple como en la de Android. Se acusa también a quienes generaban contenido de ser repetitivos y copiar las mismas historias, la gente se aburre. Quizá un aviso para los sitios que clonan notas todo el tiempo y generan la sensación de que todos los medios y los agregadores de noticias traen la misma información. Un aburrimiento que provoca que se busque otras fuentes, otros contenidos. Y con ellos se llevarán a los pocos anunciantes.
Y son los anunciantes un factor para la migración de los denominados influencers de Vine, que poco a poco se fueron a Instagram o Youtube, porque además de más herramientas que les facilitaban el trabajo, existían mejores posibilidades de monetizar su trabajo. Como ya se mencionó, Twitter no tiene una buena estrategia para monetizarse. Vine no es diferente, no cuenta con un sistema de monetización sencillo como sí lo tienen Instagram y Youtube.
Dentro de la debacle que sufre Twitter, aparece la noticia de que el sitio de pornografía Pornhub ofrece comprar la app como una propuesta que permitiría a Twitter obtener dinero que ya considera perdido. No se sabe qué tan serio sea el ofrecimiento pero sí genera dudas sobre el contenido final y sobre todo el contenido existente: se mezclará con pornografía o qué contenido planean subir. Lo más extraño será que las personas que subieron videos a la app, ahora pertenecerán y serán relacionados a una empresa de pornografía.

8244,"Remember Those Rumors Megyn Kelly is Leaving Fox News? Well, Her Contract Just Went Public","Getty - Jemall Countess/Stringer The Wildfire is an opinion platform and any opinions or information put forth by contributors are exclusive to them and do not represent the views of IJR. 
Megyn Kelly is a bit of a hot commodity nowadays, though one might not be able to tell that from the ire she is drawing from Trump fans. 
The Week, and other publications, kicked up a media frenzy this summer by speculating that Megyn Kelly was leaving Fox News, much to the delight of her Trump-supporting detractors: 
Megyn Kelly's contract at Fox News will expire after the election, and the star anchor has publicly confessed that she doesn't know what's going to happen after that. “I've had a great 12 years here, and I really like working for Roger Ailes. I really like my show, and I love my team. But, you know, there's a lot of brain damage that comes from the job,” she told Variety this spring. Image Credit: Mike Coppola/Getty Images for People.com 
In an “exclusive” report from Breitbart, the bigwigs at the network were purportedly forming an alliance to “block” her, and in an eye-opening bit of potential foreshadowing for TrumpTV , the website wrote: 
At least one top talent inside Fox News has confirmed to Breitbart News that a major talent meeting among various different hosts is scheduled, and they are considering leaving with Roger Ailes to form a new network to compete with Fox. 
“Everyone here hates Gretchen and Megyn,” the anonymous source reportedly told the website. Gretchen Carlson would later leave Fox News . 
Of course, Roger Ailes was to be forced out after he was blitzed by sexual harassment accusations from a number of female employees, including a claim by Megyn Kelly. New York Magazine reported : 
According to two sources briefed on parent company 21st Century Fox’s outside probe of the Fox News executive, led by New York–based law firm Paul, Weiss, Kelly has told investigators that Ailes made unwanted sexual advances toward her about ten years ago when she was a young correspondent at Fox. Kelly, according to the sources, has described her harassment by Ailes in detail. Image Credit: Stephen Lovekin/Getty Images 
Ailes would find safe harbor with the Trump campaign , whose presidential nominee Donald Trump later found himself under siege from sexual assault accusations . Recently, Vanity Fair published a story that the two media potentates had a “ falling out .” 
In August, Fox News appointed two executives to attempt filling Ailes' shoes: Bill Shine and Jack Abernethy, who were named as co-presidents. Due to a colossal media merger of AT&T and Time Warner, CNN executive Jeff Zucker is believed by some to have the inside track on taking over at Fox News. The Hollywood Reporter writes : 
CNN’s Jeff Zucker who, having worked for GE when he ran NBC, might be considered a more logical bridge to AT&T and, if rebuffed, might likely be open to the Murdoch sons' interest in having him come to run Fox News. 
The Murdoch brothers are not believed to share their father's conservative sensibilities, and thus there are concerns that the two would reshape the network into a much less conservative one. Image Credit: Paul Zimmerman/Getty Images 
With Sean Hannity riding high as a conservative pundit on the strength of his vocal Trump support, his ratings have even eclipsed Kelly's... at least for now. There is a strong belief by many that the host's unwavering support is an audition for TrumpTV, should The Donald lose the election. 
It's in this tumultuous environment — filled with intrigue at the network and turmoil across the media landscape — that Megyn Kelly's future has become uncertain. A leaked discussion of her contract negotiations sheds more light. 
As reported by Politico: 
Contract negotiations between Megyn Kelly and Fox News Channel have spilled into the media, with Fox News interim CEO Rupert Murdoch talking on the record to The Wall Street Journal (which he also owns via his other company, News Corp.) about the matter. 
According to the Journal's Joe Flint, “Mr. Murdoch said in an interview that she is important to the network and he hopes to get a contract signed 'very soon,' but noted, 'it’s up to her.'” 
Then Murdoch hinted, not unsubtly, “We have a deep bench of talent, many of whom would give their right arm for her spot.” 
As noted by the publication, Kelly is shopping around her talents as well, booking an expected appearance as co-host of ABC's “Live with Kelly!” Image Credit: Paul Morigi/Getty Images 
Megyn Kelly is also seeking a more lucrative contract: 
Flint reports that Kelly, who will make around $15 million this year, is aiming to get north of $20 million per year with her new contract. He also said he wants to keep Bill O'Reilly on as the channel's 8 PM host. O'Reilly's contract is also up next year. 
Murdoch also attempted to put rumors of a less conservative Fox News outlet to rest in the Wall Street Journal interview: 
“We’re not changing direction…that would be business suicide.” 
If TrumpTV indeed becomes a reality, the winds of change may shift again. Fox News will have a very different look — with or without Megyn Kelly — as a feud looms over who is the real “conservative” leader in cable news. ",0

FBI Wants you to Believe It Examined 650,000 Emails in 691,000 Seconds In no surprise to anyone paying even marginal attention, the FBI’s clearing Hillary Clinton of wrong... Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/fbi-wants-you-to-believe-it-examined.html In no surprise to anyone paying even marginal attention, the FBI’s clearing Hillary Clinton of wrongdoing in its briefly reopened investigation — however, the time the agency took to reach this conclusion is not only bereft of logic and reason, it constitutes the most hubristic of insults to the public’s intelligence. In just 691,000 seconds from announcement to conclusion, FBI Director James Comey wants you to believe agents thoroughly examined over 650,000 emails newly ‘discovered’ on Anthony Weiner’s computer — including any threads resulting, as well as all attachments — before deciding Clinton innocent of wrongdoing.We, the people of this planet, are just not that stupid — nor are we even mildly amused by this farcical bullshit passed off as a credible investigation.Seriously.Indeed, the lightning pace of this putative second investigation not only boggles the mind, it forces uneasy questions concerning the true motivation and apparent exceeding necessity to ensure Hillary Clinton walks away scot-free amid rapidly mushrooming evidence of flagrant corruption and mendacious collusion.Just a cursory comparison of two investigations shows such marked differences it would be impossible not to question legitimacy of the FBI’s findings.In the summer of 2015, the FBI commenced its first probe into the former secretary of state’s use of a private email server during her tenure in office, after John Giacalone — then Director of the National Security Branch — met with Comey to voice concerns emanating from the Intelligence community about classified information possibly handled carelessly.For nearly a full year — 365 days, or 31,536,000 seconds — a sizable task force of FBI agents pored over an enormous cache , first comprised of 30,000 emails, but later totaling 44,900 after additional documents not originally handed over by the Clinton camp to the State Department were discovered. This means — rounding off the rough estimate of one year — the bureau combed an average of just over 123 documents every day. While that might seem to be manageable with a slew of investigators on the job, a basic comparison of the two probes proves the literal inanity of the reopened investigation.Later in the day on October 28, Comey announced the commencement of the secondary probe — albeit to the consternation of current and former officials who felt his telling Congress broke a number of investigatory guidelines, including possibly influencing the outcome of the presidential race.According to Comey, an additional 650,000 documents located on the computer of Clinton aide Huma Abedin’s now-disgraced and estranged husband Anthony Weiner deserved careful scrutiny for pertinence and relevance to the original investigation of the Democratic nominee.Public and official speculation predicted a months- or years-long investigation, even with substantial manpower dedicated to the task.But on Sunday, November 6, in yet another shocker of an announcement from the FBI director, Comey inexplicably declared nothing of relevance to the Clinton investigation —“ no new conclusions ”— had been revealed in its secondary probe. This means — again rounding for brevity to eight days the total length of the investigation — FBI agents inspected some 81,250 documents each day. Granted, both estimates have been averaged and roughened, but only for comparison’s sake — and that contrast doesn’t survive the scantiest litmus test of believability.Not at all.Before the nay-sayers jump in with a there’s no comparison deflection, consider the following points.Although an algorithm or program combing those documents might indeed retrieve subjects of interest to investigators — keywords, germane subjects, accordant people’s names, and the like — in no way would such technological gatekeepers reveal subtle nuance as has been displayed in emails published by Wikileaks from Hillary Clinton, campaign chair John Podesta , and the Democratic National Committee.Such fine gradations of meaning, naturally found in the English language but also purposefully employed to throw off investigators and interlopers, could not possibly be revealed by artificial means — at least not that quickly and particularly not with currently-available technologies.Still not convinced?Consider that if such technology did indeed exist to that discerning level of scrutiny in our heightened and overarching surveillance and police states, no criminal would ever roam free.Law enforcement departments and the National Security Agency together have amassed astonishingly voluminous data sets on every person in this country, including through emails and online activities. A technology advanced enough to comb for subtleties in language would hone in on criminal behavior and activity with incredible frequency.And while NSA programs have been revealed to hunt for keywords, there are limits to its effectiveness — no terrorist plot has yet been halted in progress because the intelligence to discover it hasn’t yet solidified to that point.Technology experts immediately weighed in claiming such technology does indeed exist, is frequently employed, and can do the job perfectly in a mere eight days — no worries.But, as Wikileaks rebutted in a number of tweets, it isn’t quite so simple.Emails between Clinton, her campaign staff, the DNC, and other insiders have proven to be a literal trove of revealing details — including Hillary’s use of the name of aide Huma Abedin as a deflection, and President Obama’s use of a pseudonym to communicate on the private server in an attempt to thwart future investigators.Programs and algorithms would have to be fed such information, but not all of those pseudonyms were known — and that represents only one such complication. Even working around the clock, as Comey alleged the FBI did in its second probe, 82,000 documents daily isn’t even worth comparing to the 123 averaged each day in the initial investigation. So, what are we to believe about the clearing of Hillary Clinton for a second time?That’s up to you — to each of us — to draw a conclusion.But to characterize that second investigation as anything other than a charade to placate an irate public would be criminal willful denial of conspicuous evidence — criminal willful denial that the utter bullshit the FBI just brazenly served the American people doesn’t somehow stink.

8246,Housing Bias Outlasts Ruling in a Long Island Village - The New York Times,"GARDEN CITY, N. Y.  —   Mary Crosson, a housing activist, remembers moving to Long Island from Bayside, Queens, in the 1990s and being struck by the sharp divisions that seemed to keep blacks and whites apart. “I come from South Carolina, so I understand discrimination,” said Mrs. Crosson, 68, who is black and lives in the village of Hempstead, where nearly half the residents are  . “In Queens, it was more of a mixed neighborhood. I came out here and I felt like I went back to the South all over again. ” A federal appeals court found last month that such segregation was not an accident. The court ruled that Hempstead’s   neighbor, Garden City, a wealthy village where 1. 2 percent of the residents were black in 2010, had violated federal antidiscrimination law by rezoning land specifically to block multifamily housing  —   and the potential for minorities to move in. “Something was amiss here,” a   panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit wrote in its decision. “Garden City’s abrupt shift in zoning in the face of vocal opposition to changing the character of Garden City represented acquiescence to   animus. ” The ruling, which affirmed a 2013 decision by a Federal District Court judge, is a pivotal development in the long struggle to dismantle housing segregation as the federal government, courts and advocacy groups shift the battle beyond cities to white suburban enclaves that have deliberately erected barriers to integration. The more aggressive posture reflects a growing impatience with the persistence of segregation a   after the passage of the federal Fair Housing Act, and an effort to apply more pressure on communities to finally open themselves up to black and Latino residents. “It’s another signal that the tide is turning in terms of fair housing,” said Prof. Robert M. Silverman, of the School of Architecture and Planning at the State University of New York at Buffalo, who has written extensively on the subject of housing segregation. “There’s a historic pattern of segregation that those places have experienced. ” In the case of Garden City, however, the legal victory may have come too late. The litigation dragged on for so long that a courthouse is now planned for the land at the center of the case, and local officials, advocates said, claim there are few other parcels on which to build. The judges who ruled in the Garden City case raised the possibility that discrimination went beyond one community, directing the district court to determine whether officials in Nassau County, which includes Garden City and Hempstead, had deliberately steered affordable housing to   areas with largely minority populations. Experts on fair housing say discrimination cases are flaring where the need for more affordable housing is greatest: cities where housing costs are high and their suburbs. In recent years, legal challenges have been raised in Westchester County, N. Y. Marin County, Calif. and the city of Dallas, among other places. The litigation in Nassau County is entering its next phase as a new rule issued by the Obama administration takes effect, requiring communities that receive federal housing aid to detail how they plan to reduce racial inequality in housing. The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development has given local governments data and mapping tools to help them address segregation. Bryan Greene, the agency’s general deputy assistant secretary for fair housing and equal opportunity, said the requirement would help prevent what happened in Westchester, where some of the country’s most affluent communities sit next to hardscrabble towns and where, a judge found, officials had failed to consider race when they certified that the county had taken steps to promote fair housing. Westchester, which entered a sweeping desegregation agreement with the federal government in 2009, helped “illustrate to many people nationwide that communities were getting millions and millions of dollars in block grant funding” without evaluating the problem of racial segregation, Mr. Greene said. In the case of Garden City, local officials had not received federal housing money, but the Fair Housing Act applies to all housing transactions and policies, even when federal money is not involved. The lawsuit that led to the appeals court ruling last month was filed against the village and Nassau County in 2005. It accused the village of discrimination by catering to residents who had protested the board of trustees’ initial embrace of a zoning classification that would have allowed multifamily housing on a   parcel that the county owned and planned to sell to a private developer. While the classification did not specifically refer to affordable housing, the appeals court said, residents who opposed the move raised the specter of such housing being built and urged the trustees to “play it safe” by allowing only townhouses or   homes on the property. The trustees did just that. Using what the appeals court called code words, residents said that multifamily housing would change the “flavor” and “character” of the village and would lead to “four or 10 people in an apartment,” and demanded a guarantee that the housing be “upscale. ” “The tenor of the discussion at public hearings,” the judges wrote, and a flier that circulated in the village, “shows that citizen opposition, though not overtly   was directed at a potential influx of poor, minority residents. ” Garden City officials have yet to decide whether to appeal. The trustees said in a statement that the village had already begun to apply remedies ordered by the district court judge, Arthur D. Spatt, adopting a   resolution and appointing a   compliance officer. Judge Spatt also ordered Garden City to require that 10 percent of new residential developments with five units or more be set aside for residents with household incomes of 80 percent or less of Long Island’s median income. Advocates doubt the village will create such housing anytime soon. “They’ve been saying to us the whole time that they don’t have enough land to build anything,” said Diane Goins, chairwoman of the Long Island chapter of New York Communities for Change, a plaintiff in the case. Nonetheless, Ms. Goins, who lives in Hempstead, called the ruling historic. “Having grown up in   communities on Long Island, I always knew that we were locked into certain places,” she explained. “You could visit Garden City, but you could not stay. ” The lawyers for the plaintiffs said Garden City and Nassau County were not unusual. “There are many violations going on all across the country, but unless someone catches them, it’s of no moment,” one of the lawyers, Frederick K. Brewington, said. The broader implications of the case, and the appeals court’s question about whether Nassau had engaged in racial steering, could be  . Nassau “is one of the most segregated counties in the country,” said Stanley J. Brown, another lawyer for the plaintiffs. In Westchester, the events that eventually produced a desegregation agreement started with a challenge by an advocacy group, the   Center, which accused the county of lying when it claimed to have followed   requirements while applying for federal housing money. A federal judge agreed, ruling that the county had “utterly failed” to meet its obligations. The county said it would build 750 units of affordable housing in 31 overwhelmingly white communities. The units  —   intended for working,   families  —   were to be aggressively marketed to nonwhite residents. At the end of 2015, according to county officials, financing was in place for 649 units, 588 of which had building permits or certificates of occupancy. But a thornier element of the Westchester settlement required the county to “use all available means as appropriate” to promote nondiscriminatory housing. That included pressing local governments to change zoning rules that discouraged the construction of apartments. The federal housing agency has repeatedly accused Rob Astorino, the Westchester County executive, of moving too slowly on the issue. He, in turn, has accused the agency of trying to expand the agreement’s scope. In a recent opinion  article  in a local newspaper, Mr. Astorino, a Republican, said the housing agency was trying to “assault local zoning. ” The Nassau and Westchester cases have their roots in a much older   battle near New York: a seminal case in Mount Laurel, N. J. The Mount Laurel case began in the 1960s when a group of   found themselves priced out of the township, a Philadelphia suburb. They sued in 1971, after local officials blocked an   project. The case reached New Jersey’s highest court, which in two key rulings limited the use of exclusionary zoning to prevent the construction of affordable housing. More important, the ruling, known as the Mount Laurel doctrine, asserted that all municipalities had an obligation to provide a “fair share” of affordable housing. Since the   a total of more than 65, 000 units have been built across New Jersey’s 21 counties. Professor Silverman of SUNY Buffalo said continued litigation of   cases highlighted both the intractable nature of the problem and the robust enforcement now unfolding nationally. “The fact that discrimination has been sustained over time, despite a series of different court challenges, has kept the issue salient,” he said. “People see the inequalities. ”",0
8247,"Anonymous: World War 3 Is On The Horizon, Prepare..","It has been said a number of times over the past year, that WWIII could be on the horizon. Recent events and statements between Russia and the United States have people believing it’s closer than ever. But is this really the case? Should we be worried? 
Via CollectiveEvolution 
Since almost everything real and important taking place is kept from the masses while we are distracted by mainstream media and pop culture, it’s tough to say what is really going on. But if we begin to look at the various things going on in the world, we can piece together some interesting things.
Scroll Down For Video Below In this case, anonymous is hinting that WWIII is inching closer. Some people even believe it has already begun. But you know what? I’m not sure we need to move into fear. First check out the video, then read on.
Not All Bad News Right off the bat many start worrying about nuclear bombs, and that’s fair. But there is also an interesting fact to consider: UFOs have been shooting down nuclear threats over the last few decades.
Dozens of foreign governments have released thousands of pages of UFO related documents –here is an example of the latest batch released from the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defense in June 2013. Other country’s governments who have done the same include Mexico, France, Argentina, Russia and Belgium, just to name a few.
The fact that governments have released and documented information that detail UFO encounters with the military, as well as supposed extraterrestrial encounters with people, tells us that they’ve had and do have a high level of interest when it comes to the topic of UFOs and extraterrestrials. Had this information remained classified, nobody would officially be able to say that governments have allocated resources to investigate this phenomenon, and it would have remained in the “conspiracy” realm. At the same time, it’s important to remember that this issue goes far beyond and well above government control.
“It is ironic that the U.S. should be fighting monstrously expensive wars allegedly to bring democracy to those countries, when it itself can no longer claim to be called a democracy when trillions, and I mean thousands of billions of dollars have been spent on projects which both congress and the commander in chief know nothing about.” – Paul Hellyer, Former Canadian Defense Minister (source) 
“Everything is in a process of investigation both in the United States and in Spain, as well as the rest of the world. The nations of the world are currently working together in the investigation of the UFO phenomenon. There is an international exchange of data.” – General Carlos Castro Cavero (1979). From “UFOs and the National Security State, Volume 2″, Written by Richard Dolan
“Behind the scenes, high ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense.” Former head of CIA, Roscoe Hillenkoetter, 1960 (source) 
Just last year at the Citizens Hearing on Disclosure , a United States congresswoman voiced her opinion that the US government should disclose this existence, pointing to the fact that a number of foreign governments have already done so -you can read more about that story here. 
War is something none of us want I’m sure we could agree on, and just because UFO’s may be shooting down nukes doesn’t mean we are OK with war. But what can we do when it comes to such large worldly events? There must be something… Consciousness!
What you focus on, what your thoughts are each day, how you feel and how you treat one another is important. It has a huge impact on what plays out in our world. This has been proven numerous times when studies examine the impact of people meditating or focusing on something specific. Collective consciousness is real and it can be impacted.
Here is an example of meditation helping in war zones. 
You are not small, you can impact millions, we can impact billions because we are all connected. Focus on the world you want and share that with others.
As for physical action, again what you choose to do to be in alignment with your purpose is powerful. But we can also continue to raise awareness about what is going on in our world and make decisions and choices that opt out of the things we no longer want to see and support.
Meditation, intention, being a good person, aligning with your soul purpose, being of service to others and doing things like voting with your dollar is no passive, it is powerful when you understand how our reality works.

Greetings World, We are Anonymous.
For the last two months, we have been consistently reporting on a possible global conflict, World War 3 between the United States and its allies in the West, and Russia and its allies in the East.
The dispute on the South China Sea has severely damaged the United States relations with the Peoples Republic of China. After the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague ruled that China’s nine-dash-line claim in the South China Sea, and its land reclamation activities on islets are invalid and unlawful, the United States has been preparing to sail in the area under a so-called Freedom of Navigation principle.
This has angered the Chinese. In August, the Chinese Defense Minister, Chang Wanquan told his country’s citizens to prepare for, what he described as the peoples war at sea. Mr Wanquan was referring directly to the United States planned provocation under the pretext of Freedom of Navigation. China has since vowed to take all necessary measures available to protect its sovereignty over the South China Sea, revealing that it had the right to set up an air defense zone on the sea.
China has also since been positioning and testing its nuclear weapons, and planning military drills on its waters with Russia. Even the United States has confirmed that China has tested an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, which is capable of striking everywhere in the world within half an hour.
Moving away from the South China Sea, we arrive in Syria. It is an open secret that the civil war in Syria is a proxy war between the United States and Russia. Russia has even intervened physically on the request of the Syrian government. The United States, unable to get any invitation, has been openly and secretly arming many rebel groups in the country, with open plans to overthrow the Syrian government.
Of course, since Russia honored the invitation of the Syrian government last year, the war has been turning in favor of the Syrian government, which was falling before Russia’s intervention.
As we speak now, tension is mounting between the United States and Russia. Nerves are at their highest since the Cold War era. The United States, at the moment, is sitting on tenterhooks. Many officials in the president Obama administration are frustrated and confused regarding the situation in Syria.
The United States has announced that it has ended all contacts with Russia in Syria. This announcement by the United States comes as Russia, beginning on September. 22nd, intensified its military operations in Syria, with the intentions to capture the city of Aleppo for the Syrian government. Diplomatic efforts to put an end to the fighting in Syria, have collapsed.
As the Aleppo operation continues, Russia has given the United States a stern warning not to take any action against the Syrian government forces. In fact, there are many Russian jet fighters stationed in Syria, ready to shoot down any United States jet fighter that attempts to strike on the Syrian government forces.
These developments from Moscow are not going down easily with the United States. The United States Secretary of State, John Kerry, is said to have urged president Obama to intervene and face the consequences from Russia. He is said to have even favored a nuclear deterrent against Russia.
However, it appears that before Kerry could even make this suggestion to president Obama, the Russians had already gathered intelligence on the happenings within the White House. According to Zvezda, a Russian defense ministry Television channel, the country has started preparing its citizens for a possible nuclear war with the United States – because of the mounting tensions in Syria. Russia has since moved to deploy nuclear-capable Iskander missiles in its western-most region, Kaliningrad, which borders on NATO members of Poland and Lithuania.
Due to how the situation has become, some top officials at the United States defense headquarters have finally spoken. These Pentagon officials have admitted that World War 3 is imminent, and that its going to be deadly and fast. The military generals were speaking on a future-of-the-army panel in Washington.
“A conventional conflict in the near future will be extremely lethal and fast, and we will not own the stopwatch,” Major General William Hix said. General Hix also stated that China and Russia’s armies are becoming increasingly technological, and that the Pentagon was getting ready for violence on the scale that the United States Army has not seen since Korea.
His comments were also echoed by lieutenant Gen Joseph Anderson and Chief of Staff, Gen Mark A. Milley, who described war between nation states as almost guaranteed. The generals also said apart from the conventional battle, cyber battle, too, has become a reality against the United States, revealing that even smaller nations are launching it against the country.

8248,"Trump’s New Ban Leaves Few Spots for Refugees, Even the Hunted - The New York Times","SAN SALVADOR  —   Veronica picked up some modeling clay, molded it into little human figures with her hands  —   and then dug holes into the sculpture’s face. “Look,” said Veronica, 9, showing off the creation to her aunt. “That’s how Mamá ended up. ” For more than a year, Veronica and her sister have been in hiding here in El Salvador, hoping to receive refugee status in the United States. The two girls were doing homework at their dining room table when masked men burst in and gunned down their grandparents  —   the community’s only two health workers  —   on rumors that the couple had been tipping off the police about gangs in the neighborhood. Like many thousands of others, Veronica and her sister applied for sanctuary in the United States under a special Obama administration effort to grapple with the violence that has gutted Central America and sent waves of its people on a desperate march toward the American border. But on Monday, the Trump administration announced a   suspension on all refugee admissions to the United States so security procedures can be improved and, perhaps most significantly, cut the number of total refugees allowed into the country by more than half. “We can’t remain in the same place,” said the girls’ aunt, Reina, who is seeking refugee status for her nieces, witnesses to the double homicide. “We got a call last weekend telling us that they’d find us under whatever rock we were hiding. ” When President Trump first tried to freeze the nation’s refugee program in January, the courts jumped in and thwarted his executive order. But one vital limit that the courts did allow  —   and which Mr. Trump’s new order continues  —   is a drastic reduction in the number of refugees admitted to the United States this fiscal year, from 110, 000 under President Barack Obama to Mr. Trump’s revised cap: 50, 000. And those seats are mostly taken already. More than 37, 000 refugees from around the world have been admitted to the United States since the fiscal year began in October. By Monday morning, with seven months to go in the fiscal year, fewer than 12, 700 slots remained under Mr. Trump’s limit. In a statement on Monday, John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary, said the new executive order would “make America safer, and address   concerns about the security of our immigration system. ” “We must undertake a rigorous review of our visa and refugee vetting programs to increase our confidence in the entry decisions we make for visitors and immigrants to the United States,” he said. “We cannot risk the prospect of malevolent actors using our immigration system to take American lives. ” Altogether, the United Nations referred more than 100, 000 refugees from around the globe last year for resettlement in the United States. The Obama administration accepted nearly 85, 000 of them in the 2016 fiscal year, before raising the ceiling considerably for 2017. Now Mr. Trump’s order will effectively leave tens of thousands of families in limbo, all vying for the sliver of seats still available. Veronica and her sister  —   whose last names are being withheld to protect their identities  —   have been waiting to find out whether they will be among the chosen. They and their father have been interviewed a total of four times, but months have passed. Members of El Salvador’s most notorious gang,   have made menacing phone calls suggesting that more killings are coming, the family says. So the girls, their father, aunts and uncles abandoned their houses and ran. But in a country the size of Massachusetts, there are only so many places to hide. They have already moved twice. Officials and immigrant advocates in Central America fear that as the Trump administration cites the danger of admitting potential terrorists cloaked as refugees from nations like Syria, it is disregarding the tens of thousands of people here who are being terrorized by street gangs that actually originated in the United States. In 2014, the Obama administration began setting up a program to offer refugee status or special entry for some Central American children, hoping to stanch the  tide of minors making the dangerous journey to the United States on their own. More than 11, 000 people have applied through the program, and just over 2, 400 had been admitted to the United States by Feb. 22, according to the State Department. In Mr. Trump’s first month in office, 316 people were admitted, the department said. The undertaking has always been slow. With the bar for eligibility high, and the application process lengthy, comparatively few of the people at risk applied. Many children chose to flee the country rather than wait for approval and risk danger while their cases were reviewed. American officials expanded the program in July to include additional family members, not just children. But countless adolescents all over El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras are hoping to leave their countries because gang members are stalking the young, forcing boys to join their ranks and threatening to rape girls. “I have a client who has not left his house since July,” said Berta Guevara, a lawyer at the Independent Monitoring Group of El Salvador, which helps people with their refugee applications. Ms. Guevara said that many people in danger now believe that the United States no longer wants them. “A   delay to a person who, on any day if they are seen, they will be killed  —   to that person, every day is a terrible day,” Ms. Guevara said. Even before Mr. Trump’s executive order on Monday, officials at the Department of Homeland Security said they had not been taking on any new cases since the president first sought to suspend refugee admissions in late January, effectively freezing new applications to the program. The new executive order will prolong that freeze for at least another 120 days, leaving children under threat in the region with some daunting choices, including staying where they are or making the long, dangerous trek to the southwest border of the United States to apply for asylum or some other form of humanitarian relief. “There’s still this ambivalence in regarding the Central American situation as a refugee crisis,” said Wendy Young, the president of Kids in Need of Defense, a Washington organization that offers legal assistance to unaccompanied immigrant children. “There’s a perception in today’s world that refugees are people who are fleeing war, and that gang and drug violence is not war,” she said. Longer term, the Obama program in Central America could also be under threat because of its frequent reliance on a special provision called humanitarian parole, which allows certain immigrants to enter the United States temporarily even if they do not qualify as refugees. Some Republicans who want to limit immigration call humanitarian parole an overused back door to entering the United States. And Mr. Trump, in an executive order last month that sought to tighten border security, took aim at “the abuse of parole and asylum provisions. ” Veronica’s aunt, Reina, said she was more scared than ever. Arrests have been made in the case, prompting more threats in recent days. “I have been offered help to leave the country, but I just cannot leave here until these girls are safe,” Reina said. She said she already borrowed $6, 000 to pay a smuggler to take her    son, who also witnessed the killings, to Dallas. Oscar Torres, a prosecutor who runs the homicide division in the area where Reina’s mother and stepfather were killed, acknowledged that the entire family was in grave danger, whether they witnessed the murders or not. Of the seven people who participated in the killings, he said, four are in jail pending trial, one is still wanted, another was killed in a shootout with the police and a minor is out on bail. One of the accused is a gang leader known as El Tigre. Gang members are particularly known to kill the families of potential witnesses when a gang leader has been accused, he said. “If these guys come to be sentenced, they are not going to like that their gang leader, their homeboy as they say, was convicted, so this family becomes a target,” Mr. Torres said. “Where do these people go? What path is left for them?”",0

8250,"First Brexit, Now Trump … What’s Next?","  WashingtonsBlog 
CNN’s Jake Tapper hit the nail on the head last night, as he was speaking about why people voted for Trump. 
Tapper said that most Americans are sick of the income inequality, globalization, and politics-as-usual that the status quo have given us. 
He even pointed out that only a handful of people have gotten rich off of globalization, and a lot of people have been left behind . 
Indeed, exit polls last night showed that the economy was the number 1 concern for voters. The Guardian reports : 
“It’s the economy, stupid” was a phrase coined by her husband’s adviser James Carville in the 1992 election and, in many ways, it ought to have helped Democrats again in 2016. Barack Obama helped rescue the US from the financial crash and presided over a record series of consecutive quarters of job growth. 
Unfortunately for Clinton, many Americans simply did not feel as positive. Stagnant wage levels and soaring inequality were symptoms of the malaise felt by many voters. Trump successfully convinced them to believe this was caused by bad trade deals and a rigged economy. 
Despite being pushed in this direction by Sanders in the Democratic primary, Clinton never really found a satisfactory response. Her volte-face on trade sounded – and was later proved by leaked emails – unconvincing at best; deeply cynical at worst. 
Similarly, Brexit – the other recent vote which went against all political forecasts – was largely a vote by those who lost out on the benefits of globalization … that only a handful of fatcats really profited from. 
Leaders of the Brexit campaign noted the confluence of the two votes: 
Jeremy Corbyn described Mr Trump’s victory as “an unmistakable rejection of political establishment” . 
Ukip leader Nigel Farage – who went to the US to appear at a Trump campaign rally – said he was handing over his mantle as the creator of political earthquakes to the new President, saying that 2016 was “the year of two great political revolutions”, adding: “I thought Brexit was big, but boy, this looks like it’s going to be even bigger”. 
N igel Farage has issued this statement following Donald Trump’s victory. 
“Today, the establishment is in deep shock. Even more so than after Brexit. What we are witnessing is the end of a period of big business and big politics controlling our lives. 
Voters across the Western world want nation state democracy, proper border controls and to be in charge of their own lives. 
I commend Donald Trump for the courage with which he has fought this campaign and I look forward to a closer relationship between the USA and the UK. We now have a President who likes our country and understands our post-Brexit values. 
Prepare for further political shocks in the years to come.” 
Voters in the UK and the world’s strongest nation, the U.S., have both rebuked the status quo, including neoliberal trade and economic policies. 
What’s next? 
The rebellion will spread … 
For example, it’s so probable that Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party will be thrown out on its ear that Merkel is already trying to distract with silly claims that the Russians will hack the German election. 
Postscript: There are, of course, other reasons that Trump won. But the economy is the main one.",0
8252,California Prepares for Long-Denied Star Turn in Presidential Race - The New York Times,"BURLINGAME, Calif.  —   This is the most populous state in the nation, but in presidential elections, it has almost always found itself on the sidelines. The last time a Republican primary in California mattered was 52 years ago, when the party nominated Barry Goldwater. But California will finally play an important role in the drama of presidential politics. The 172 Republican delegates up for grabs in the state’s June 7 primary, which in most years has taken place well after the party’s presidential   was known, will determine whether Donald J. Trump can clinch the nomination on the last day of voting and avoid having to wrangle uncommitted delegates at the national convention in July. All three Republican presidential candidates, along with hundreds of reporters, turned up for the party’s state convention here over the weekend, the biggest show in memory of presidential candidate firepower at this yearly gathering. “California is at a crossroads  —   California is going to decide this Republican primary,” Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who may need a win in Indiana on Tuesday to keep his hopes alive here, told hundreds of conventiongoers Saturday. “Who’d have thunk it?” The sudden interest in California, on one hand, has been a cause for celebration in a state that has been starved for attention in presidential contests. A meaningful primary means extensive campaigning, and a national focus on issues of particular concern to the electorate here, rather than the usual brief touchdowns to raise money or appear on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” Mr. Cruz, for one, drew appreciative applause when he denounced environmental regulations that he said were depriving   farmers of water in the Central Valley. A rival, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, all but gushed: “I’m not a big panderer, but I do have to tell you, I love California. I have been coming here for a very long time. ” As desirable as the attention may be, the prospect of the presidential campaign’s arrival in California also poses a threat to the state’s Republican Party, which has been politically marginalized, with Republican registration at just 28 percent. A Republican has not won a statewide election since Arnold Schwarzenegger was   governor in 2006. Republican leaders are in the midst of a major effort to reposition the party ideologically as it seeks to revive its appeal in a state that is increasingly Democratic and Latino. In large part, that means distancing the state party from national Republicans on issues like immigration and   marriage. Yet Mr. Trump landed on Thursday night in Orange County with a blistering speech attacking immigrants who are in the country illegally and suggesting that Mexicans illegally crossing the border were responsible for a recent spike in crime in Los Angeles. And Mr. Cruz trumpeted the endorsement of former Gov. Pete Wilson, who championed a state initiative in 1994 that would have cut benefits to those in the country illegally and that is widely seen as one of the reasons the party is struggling today. Even if Mr. Trump wins in Indiana and convincingly proclaims himself the presumptive nominee, he is almost certain to continue campaigning aggressively in California to amass enough delegates to fend off any challenges at the Republican National Convention. That is a prospect some Republicans here do not welcome. “It does set back Republican efforts in California,” said Bill Whalen, a fellow with the conservative Hoover Institution who served as a senior adviser to Mr. Wilson. “The California party is in a phase of rebuilding and rebranding. And that means toning down the message and developing a message that appeals to a widening swath of Californians. I can’t think of a more toxic situation than him coming in alienating women and Mexicans. ” Chuck Page, a Republican State Senate candidate from Saratoga, said he was worried about how the presidential campaign here might affect Republicans like him. “It makes it harder for me,” he said in the atrium of the convention hotel here, protests against Mr. Trump clearly audible outside. “I’m a     kind of guy. ” There was a time when it seemed the fight between Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont would also remain up in the air until June, providing California Democrats with their own rare opportunity to help decide a national primary. But with Mr. Sanders’s chances of overtaking Mrs. Clinton fading, the biggest question here may be whether he will make a strong enough showing to provide her one more embarrassment as the primary calendar runs out. In general elections, California’s 55 electoral votes are the biggest prize on the map. But the state has swung decisively Democratic in recent years: A Republican has not carried the state since George Bush beat Michael S. Dukakis in 1988. California’s presidential primary is most often scheduled to coincide with the June state primary  —   largely to avoid the cost of separate elections. By that point, though, presidential nominations have usually been decided. And when the presidential primary has been held earlier  —   as in 2008, when Mrs. Clinton defeated Barack Obama in the state  —   California has had to compete for attention with other states holding contests the same day. “We were pretty relevant in ’68,” said John Burton, the state Democratic chairman, who has been involved in state politics for 50 years. He paused. “Yeah, that’s a long time ago. ” Understandably, the prospect of another relevant campaign here has stirred much excitement. When Mr. Kasich, who has won just one state this year, showed up on Friday for an evening news conference, 15 television cameras awaited him. The convention hotel’s atrium was packed with volunteers passing out buttons for Mr. Cruz or trying to sign up delegates for Mr. Kasich. (Strikingly, no such organizational presence was visible for Mr. Trump.) “I’ve never seen anything like this this far out,” said Jim Brulte, the state Republican chairman, who was besieged by delegates, campaign aides and reporters as he moved through the convention hall. The convention site, as it happened, was 10 miles from the Cow Palace, the scene of the bitterly divided Republican National Convention that picked Mr. Goldwater in 1964. The party is reaping a windfall from the heightened interest: Tickets to hear Mr. Cruz, Mr. Trump and Mr. Kasich speak were $100 each. Yet there was a cost, too, in the protests outside, and in a   banner smuggled into the hotel and unfurled down a wall, reading, “Stop Hate. ” A greater cost, some Republicans fear, could come in setting back efforts to reposition the party on immigration and to appeal to political independents in a state where Latinos make up 39 percent of the population. Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz, by contrast, are appealing to core Republican primary voters who, polls show, embrace their tough immigration language. “It’s devastating to us here,” said Rob Stutzman, who was deputy chief of staff to Mr. Schwarzenegger and is leading the   movement in California. “It’s so toxic to our brand. ” And Marty Wilson, a Republican strategist, said the damage extended beyond Latino voters. “It hurts us even more with Asian voters,” he said. “Our growth in California comes because of immigrants from the Pacific. ” Lanhee J. Chen, a California Republican who advised Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign, warned that “a discussion that is as caustic and bitter about immigration as Trump wants is problematic for the   prospects of the party. ” He said that prospects for state candidates in 2016 were “nearly impossible” already, and that even 2018 would be tough. “It’s hard to get good candidates,” he added, “to do kamikaze missions. ”",0

As the media and the general population in the United States remain distracted by the sham elections, the US military is waging undeclared war across the middle east. Just t his week, we reported that 60 civilians were killed, and over 200 injured during a US-led airstrike in Iraq. 
Now, only a day later in Syria, 300 innocent civilians have died as a result of 11 different airstrikes conducted by a US-led coalition. 
The killings were largely absent from the major headlines in American mainstream media, but the operations were condemned by human rights organization Amnesty International. 
The organization stated that the US Central Command (CENTCOM) “may have… carried out unlawful attacks” in Syria, killing civilians. 
Lynn Maalouf, Deputy Director for Research at Amnesty International’s Beirut regional office said that the CENTCOM is downplaying the human cost of the recent attacks 
“We fear the US-led coalition is significantly underestimating the harm caused to civilians in its operations in Syria,” she said. 
“It’s high time the US authorities came clean about the full extent of the civilian damage caused by coalition attacks in Syria. Independent and impartial investigations must be carried out into any potential violations of international humanitarian law and the findings should be made public,” she added. 
According to witnesses, “double tap” airstrikes, in which the same target is attacked multiple times, ended up killing numerous first responders who were trying to save innocent victims trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings. 
Amnesty international estimated that 300 civilians were killed in the attacks based on satellite imagery, eyewitness reports as well as media documentation from the front lines. 
“At this point, I had a two-month-old baby boy in my arms whom I had rescued. The hit caused me to fall and drop him… I fell into the hole made by the air strike. That was what saved me… My mother, aunt, wife and children – a daughter who was four years old and a son who was two and a half were all killed. The woman and her son who I’d rescued were killed. Everyone but me was killed,” one survivor told reporters. 
“Given the likely increase in air strikes by the US-led Coalition as part of the Iraqi offensive to recapture Mosul, it is even more pressing that CENTCOM be fully transparent about the impact of their military actions on civilians. And it is crucial that they adhere scrupulously to international humanitarian law, including by taking all feasible precautions to spare civilians and to minimize harm to civilian homes and infrastructure,” Maalouf of Amnesty International said. 
This is not the first time such a large death toll has occurred recently in Syria. Amnesty also documented that over 200 civilians were killed in a US-led attack on the city of Manbij, Syria.

As Twitchy reported, Hillary Clinton held a brief press conference Friday to address news that the FBI had found — in the process of investigating Anthony Weiner’s alleged sexting of a 15-year-old girl — new emails that warranted further investigation into her own email scandal. 
Obviously not pleased by this latest development, Clinton called on the FBI to release whatever it had. Hillary Clinton: ""We don't know the facts, which is why we're calling on the FBI to release all the information it has … let’s get it out."" 
— New York Post (@nypost) October 28, 2016 
Despite that not being how FBI investigations work, Hillary’s call for the FBI to lay its cards on the table inspired Sharyl Attkisson of Full Measure News to make a simple suggestion: There's no mystery as to what's in the Huma Abedin emails–to Huma. She can fill in the Hillary campaign. 
— Sharyl Attkisson (@SharylAttkisson) October 29, 2016 
What didn’t Hillary think of that? Abedin is right there with her on board her campaign plane — it’s not like she’s hard to track down. Unless, of course, neither one can recall what they wrote to each other. It happens. More than 1,000 potentially relevant emails found on Weiner computer, including some between Huma and HRC. https://t.co/hVHL61vqrk

8257,"G.O.P. Convention Day 2 Takeaways: A Party Unites, at Least for a Night - The New York Times","The second night of the Republican National Convention was a whipsaw of conflicting themes and messages. The printed schedule suggested a focus on jobs and economic policy. The reality: A party learning to acclimate itself to Donald J. Trump, figure out if he can win a national election, and help him (if possible). Our takeaways: They didn’t want him. They fought against him. Privately, they still resent him. But in the early minutes of the evening, as the party’s senior leadership executed a final quashing of lingering   efforts on the convention floor, they presided over Mr. Trump’s installation as the duly chosen Republican Party presidential nominee. They did it because the rules obligated them to, but also because it was politically necessary. If Trump loses the White House, it is imperative to the party’s establishment that he do so convincingly, undeniably, without sabotage, so that they cannot be blamed for the defeat. Ten minutes of Paul D. Ryan made that clear. In many respects, Mr. Ryan, the House speaker, delivered the classic speech of a major party nominee: papering over the nastiness of the primary, providing a positive vision of governing, and giving the party’s disparate factions a narrative they could all get behind. It was not the most original or soaring speech in convention history. But it was utterly different from virtually any Trump speech, or from most of the speeches by Mr. Trump’s surrogates on the convention stage so far. Mr. Ryan’s speech was a reminder of how unconventional Mr. Trump is  —   the quality that got him this far, but may now limit him. For all the controversy unfolding over the borrowed lines in Melania Trump’s remarks on Monday, two of Mr. Trump’s children gave the most effective and heartfelt speeches on Tuesday. Tiffany Trump, his    daughter with his second wife, sprinkled her speech with anecdotes about him making notes on her report cards and being the first to call her after the death of a good friend  —   the kind of softening material unexpectedly missing from his wife’s speech. Donald Trump Jr. an executive at the family business, gave a longer biographical tale of his father, told with sincerity and affection, dusted with a sprinkle of a Trumpian economic policy. (But just a sprinkle.) Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey is famously competitive, so it was no surprise that he was let down when Mr. Trump passed him over for the ticket. But Mr. Christie’s speech seemed designed to make the nominee wonder if he had made a mistake. In contrast to the   Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, Mr. Christie, a former federal prosecutor, laid out a case against Hillary Clinton as though he were in a courtroom. It was hard not to remember that Mr. Trump once said he wanted an “attack dog” for his running mate, something that Mr. Pence, who has previously denounced negative campaigning, has not yet proved skilled at. Mr. Christie, in what may be the last major speech of his political career, reminded the hall  —   and maybe the nominee  —   that it is what he does best.",0
8258,Gov. Bill Weld Encourges Supporters to Stop Trump,"Gov. Bill Weld Encourges Supporters to Stop Trump page: 1 Statement by Gov. Bill Weld This is basically a backwards endorsement of Hillary. “Against that backdrop, I would like to address myself to all those in the electorate who remain torn between two so-called major party candidates whom they cannot enthusiastically support. I’m speaking particularly to those Republicans who feel that our President should exhibit commonly accepted standards of decency and discipline. *snip “After careful observation and reflection, I have come to believe that Donald Trump, if elected President of the United States, would not be able to stand up to this pressure and this criticism without becoming unhinged and unable to perform competently the duties of his office. I wonder what effect this will have on Libertarian Party members if any. I think it's unfortunate that people are feeling forced to support Hillary in order to stop Trump. Trump supporters need to take a long hard look in the mirror and realize that such a repulsive person, a man some voted for just for the lulz has ensured a Clinton presidency. You didn't stand up to the establishment you sent people fleeing to it. a reply to: Kali74 Check out the pretend libertarian! If I were libertarian, I'd be ticked off. Here's part of my supposed ticket endorsing one of the least libertarian candidates ever by making a fear play. what a bunch of doo doo feces this thread is. so voting for trump isnt standing up to the establisment? have you not watched veritas? have you not read anything from wikileaks? at this point im completely convinced if hillary wins this election, every women in america will be wearing a hijab within her presidency. the draft will make a return because we will be at war with russia and china. ok trump isnt a politician. and at this point, i dont think thats what we need. being president doesnt mean you have to be involved in politics your whole life. president of the us should be someone who has the values of america instilled in their heart. they should have america first mentality. hillary wants a 550% increase in muslim refugees. the same ones murdering and raping women throughout europe. the same ones who think because a woman isnt islamic, they can do whatever they want to them. hillary wants amnesty and open borders... great, so lots more columbian drug lords sending people over our border i want to feel safe in my own country. thats all i want. not fancy tax plans, free college, more jobs. trump makes me feel safe.",0
8259,Does Putting Three Dots And A Question Mark At The End Of A Headline Make People Curious Enough To Click…?,"0 Add Comment 
STUDIES have shown that websites which fill their pages with headlines that end with three dots and a question mark have to do very little else to attract thousands of clicks from unsuspecting web users. 
The findings come after a year-long internet study, which found that content hosting sites can survive simply by exploiting the human brain’s natural tendency to seek the answer to a question that is seemingly directed straight at them, even if they have very little interest in the subject at hand. 
Web users are just as likely to click through on headlines such as ‘Did Amy Huberman show too much flesh at last night’s event…?’ as they are on headlines such as ‘Can this tractor pull this other tractor up a hill…?’, meaning that little or no effort is required to run a thriving media empire. 
“Can this kitten reach his food…? Does this grandmother know all the words to Lose Yourself…? Who cares, it’s all clicks” said one entertainment website owner. 
“Once we worked out the old three dots and a question mark formula, then we knew we were set for life. People just can’t help but click on that. It’s like catnip for the bored mind”. 
It is believed that the success of the formula is so great, that all news will come in that format in the near future. Already, Brian Dobson is working on his delivery of news headlines such as ‘Were there many people killed in the Middle East today…?’ and ‘Did the government get the 8th amendment sorted out…?’.",0
8260,What to Expect During Juno’s Mission to Jupiter - The New York Times,"With the exception of the sun, Jupiter is bigger than everything in the solar system put together. But little is known about the interior beneath its colorful cloud stripes. Now that Juno has arrived at its destination, it will orbit the planet 37 times over the next 20 months, with the hopes that it will collect data and images that offer clues to the origins of our solar system and the formation of the planets and moons. Several spacecraft have flown past Jupiter, beginning with Pioneer 10 in 1973. NASA’s Galileo spacecraft, entering orbit in 1995, dropped a   probe into Jupiter’s atmosphere, sending back data that showed Jupiter had strong, turbulent winds and offering details about the composition of its atmosphere. During its eight years at Jupiter, Galileo confirmed ideas of how Jupiter’s diaphanous rings formed out of dust particles blasted off Jupiter’s small inner moons. It measured the sizzling   temperatures of volcanoes on Io, one of the planet’s four large moons, and it found evidence of   oceans on the other three moons of Europa, Callisto and Ganymede. Unlike Galileo, Juno will be in an orbit passing over Jupiter’s poles, providing a first close look at those regions. With repeated close passes over the cloud tops, the spacecraft will measure microwave emissions, the gravity field and the magnetic field, offering glimpses into what is deep inside Jupiter. It might seem odd to care about the water on Jupiter, but it is one of the main issues that Juno scientists are focusing on. “That’s in some ways our premier measurement,” said Steven Levin, the mission’s project scientist. On Mars, NASA’s strategy seeks to find out whether there was water there that would have ever made Mars cozy enough for life. Jupiter, with its crushing gravity and   radiation, clearly is not a hospitable place for life, but that’s not why scientists are interested about water there. Rather, the question is, “Where’s the oxygen?” Jupiter has greater concentrations than the sun of most of the heavier elements like nitrogen and carbon, except for oxygen, which is scarce. Thus, scientists expect that oxygen atoms have each been tied up with two hydrogens to form water molecules. The measurements collected by Juno of microwave emissions emanating out of Jupiter will tell both the temperature and how much water there is, because water molecules absorb microwaves. If Juno finds a lot of water, that suggests Jupiter formed farther from the sun in the colder, icier regions and later migrated to its current orbit. Why does Jupiter have more of the heavier elements, anyway? That’s a mystery, too. One hypothesis is that the heavier elements came from comets that crashed into Jupiter and it absorbed them. Does Jupiter have a rocky core at its center? Measuring Jupiter’s gravity field will tell the distribution of mass within. If there is a rocky core, planetary scientists will have to explain how rocky bodies formed that early in the solar system. If there is not, then Jupiter formed out of a collapse of a gas cloud, much as the sun did. Jupiter is almost entirely hydrogen and helium, the two simplest and most abundant elements in the universe. Cool these two gases, and they change to a liquid. Inside Jupiter, hydrogen is believed to undergo another transformation, to a metal. Scientists have not been able to recreate metallic hydrogen on Earth. In laboratory experiments, hydrogen, squeezed to tens of millions of pounds per square inch between two diamonds, has remained stubbornly nonmetallic. The pressure inside Jupiter is hundreds of millions of pounds per square inch. By studying Jupiter’s magnetic fields, probably generated by currents of metallic hydrogen, scientists will receive hints about the properties of this elusive substance. Lots. “I’m confident it’s going to work,” Scott Bolton, Juno’s principal investigator, said before the announcement Monday night that the spacecraft had arrived, “but I’ll be happy when it’s over and we’re in orbit. ” Some of the ways that this could have turned into a bad day: If Juno blew up. In August 1993, NASA’s   Mars Observer spacecraft vanished. An inquiry concluded that a fuel leak caused the spacecraft to spin quickly and fall out of communication. While Juno’s setup is different, there is always a chance of an explosion with rocket fuel. If the engine did not fire at all. The Japanese probe Akatsuki was all set to arrive at Venus in December 2010, but its engine didn’t fire properly, and Akatsuki sailed right past Venus. Last year, Akatsuki crossed paths with Venus again, and this time, using smaller thrusters, it was able to enter orbit. If it crashed into something. Jupiter does not possess the majestic rings of Saturn, but it does have a thin ring of debris orbiting it. Juno passed through a region that appeared clear, but that did not mean it actually was. Even a dust particle could cause significant damage, as Juno was going 130, 000 miles per hour relative to Jupiter. If it flew too close to Jupiter and was ripped to pieces. In one of NASA’s most embarrassing failures, the Mars Climate Orbiter spacecraft was lost in 1999 because of a   between English and metric units. Climate Orbiter went far deeper into Mars’ atmosphere than planned. Juno traveled within 2, 900 miles of Jupiter’s cloud tops, so a miscalculation could have been catastrophic. If the computer crashed. On July 4 last year, the mission controllers of the New Horizons spacecraft that was about to fly by Pluto experienced some nervous moments when the spacecraft stopped talking to them. The computer on New Horizons crashed while trying to interpret some new commands and compressing some images it had taken, the electronic equivalent of walking while chewing gum. The controllers put New Horizons back in working order within a few days, and the flyby occurred without a hitch. For Juno, the scientific instruments have been turned off for its arrival at Jupiter. “We turn off everything that is not necessary for making the event work,” said Dr. Levin, the project scientist. “This is very important to get right, so you don’t do anything extra. ” The intense barrage of radiation at Jupiter could have knocked out Juno’s computer, even though it is shielded in a titanium vault. Usually, when there is a glitch, a spacecraft goes into “safe mode” to await new instructions from Earth, but in this case, that would have been too late to save Juno. The spacecraft had been programmed to automatically restart the engine to allow it to enter orbit. “If that doesn’t go just right, we fly past Jupiter, and of course, that’s not desirable,” Dr. Bolton said. Juno has been executing an automated sequence of actions since Thursday. A timeline of Juno’s arrival (all Eastern time): 9:13 p. m. Start of transmission of single frequency “tones” that will provide updates on the spacecraft’s condition. 9:16 p. m. Juno begins turning away from the sun to position the engine in the right direction to slow the spacecraft for its arrival at Jupiter. 10:41 p. m. With the main antenna pointing away from the sun, Juno switches to a smaller antenna for sending the tones. 10:45 p. m. Juno adjusts itself to eliminate any wobbling. 10:56 p. m. Juno speeds up its spin rate from two rotations a minute to five rotations a minute, a process that takes about five minutes. 11:18 p. m. The main engine begins firing. 11:38 p. m. The spacecraft has slowed down enough to be captured into orbit around Jupiter. 11:53 p. m. The main engine shuts off, leaving Juno in the desired orbit. 11:55 p. m. The spacecraft starts slowing its spin rate back down to two revolutions per minute. 12:07 a. m. Tuesday Juno changes direction to point its antenna back at Earth. 12:11 a. m. Juno ends the transmission of status tones and switches to its   antenna. 12:16 a. m. Juno begins transmitting detailed telemetry, although it may take 20 minutes or longer to lock into the signal. The first two highly elliptical orbits will be 53 days in duration, lasting until  . Then Juno will fire its engine again on Oct. 19 to move to a   orbit when the science measurements begin in earnest. Three   solar panels provide a mere 500 watts to power Juno and its instruments. On Nov. 3, people will be able to start voting on where Juno should point its camera. On the 37th orbit, on Feb. 20, 2018, Juno is to make a suicidal dive into Jupiter, ending the mission, the same way the Galileo spacecraft was disposed in 2003. That is to ensure there is no possibility that Juno would crash into Europa and contaminate it with microbial hitchhikers from Earth. Europa is regarded as one of the most likely places in the solar system to look for life. It took five years to get to Jupiter, and the mission costs $1. 1 billion, yet Juno will have a far shorter stay than the eight years Galileo spent exploring Jupiter in the moons. The close approaches to Jupiter means Juno will pass through intense bombardment of the radiation belts. As the mission progresses, Juno’s orbits will receive more direct hits of radiation. In the best outcome, the mission might be extended for a few months. But over time, the spacecraft’s electronics will fail.",0

Tickets were free. There were reportedly only 240 chairs in the room, although many more were standing. The Sacramento Bee reported that during the event, Feinstein said she somewhat enjoyed the outbursts. The moderator reportedly “asked the audience to settle down so that he could continue asking questions” when “Feinstein admitted, ‘I kind of enjoy it. ’” The protesters were from the San Francisco chapter of Indivisible, a liberal group that has crashed talks in recent weeks to push their “  Trump” agenda. The Bee notes that they held up signs reading, “Hold a real town hall. ” Others held up a green “agree” and a red “disagree” sign. At another point during the event, Feinstein reportedly said there was not much she could do to remove Stephen K.

8263,6 Places Voter Fraud Has Already Happened…But Don’t Worry,"Remember the last debate when the internet blew up because Donald Trump said he wouldn’t necessarily accept the results of the election ? People were bemoaning him as a fascist and no one in the mainstream wanted to admit that our election process is entirely rigged. The trouble is, voter fraud on a grand scale can be tough to prove . As it turns out, voter fraud on a smaller scale has been detected in 6 locations already, according to today’s Drudge Report . But don’t worry. These are just “glitches” or “too few to make a difference.” 1) Chicago In the Windy City, the dead have been voting for decades. Two investigators have admitted finding proof of this, but they refuse to say that there is fraud. Relatives of the Voting Dead feel differently. They say that they’ve reported the deaths of their loved ones repeatedly, but that the names have not been removed from the rolls. But that isn’t the worst of it – not only are these people on the rolls – they’ve repeatedly voted since their deaths. Don’t worry, though. It’s just a few hundred dead voters that they’ve been able to confirm. No biggie. ( source ) 2) Philadelphia Chicago is not alone with the dead folks voting.There are also reports from Philadelphia that people are making their voices heard from beyond the grave. *cough* Local station Action News 6 investigated and found that a stunning number of people have been deemed “active voters” for many years since their deaths. Don’t worry, though. The local voting board says these mistakes are simply “human error” and that there aren’t enough dead voters to actually sway the election. ( source ) 3) Hollywood, Maryland A woman in Maryland has reported another incidence of “vote flipping.” She voted a straight Republican ticket, then checked after it was submitted. Her vote for Trump had been switched to a vote for Clinton. Don’t worry, though. The election officials there told her to just vote again. Of course, this would “undo” the vote for Clinton, but would it really count as a vote for Trump? I’m sure it’s fine. The election officials would want to be scrupulous about something like that. ( source ) 4) Miami-Dade County, Florida Two women have been charged with felony counts of tampering with the election. One, a temporary election worker, was caught marking ballots by her co-workers. The other was caught filling out voter registration paperwork for people who did not exist. Don’t worry, though. These were isolated incidents that have been dealt with. In the words of State Attorney Katherine Fernández Rundle, a Democrat, “Anyone who attempts to undermine the democratic process should recognize that there is an enforcement partnership between the elections department and our prosecution task force in place to thwart such efforts and arrest those involved. Now we need to move forward with the election.” ( source ) 5) Alexandria, Virginia A guy in Virginia who was formerly employed by the New Virginia Majority, an advocacy group aligned with the Democratic party, was caught using fake names to fill out voter registration applications. But don’t worry. Commonwealth Attorney Bryan Porter said, “Since the fraudulent applications involved fictitious people, had the fraud not been uncovered the risk of actual fraudulent votes being cast was low.” ( source ) 6) Lots of places in Texas Much like the report in Maryland, voters in various locations in Texas have reported that when they chose a straight Republican ticket, the voting machines opted for Clinton/Kaine instead of Trump/Pence. Voters in Amarillo, Arlington, Corpus Christi, San Antonio, Cypress, Mesquite, and El Paso have all reported vote flipping from Trump to Clinton. But don’t worry. Election officials in the state say it’s not a problem with the equipment. It’s just those silly voters who don’t know how to use it. ““Typically, we’ve found it’s voter error with the equipment. Sometimes they vote straight party and then click on other candidates … or do something with the wheel….There is not an issue with the equipment.” ( source ) If you’re worried about election fraud… You can add a smartphone app by True the Vote called VoteStand to report incidents of fraud. Don’t let anything slide. If you are voting, make sure your choice is accurately recorded. Article first posted at DaisyLuther.com Submit your review",0
8264,"Trump Leaves Science Jobs Vacant, Troubling Critics - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   On the fourth floor of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, the staff of the White House chief technology officer has been virtually deleted, down from 24 members before the election to, by Friday, only one. Scores of departures by scientists and Silicon Valley technology experts who advised President Trump’s predecessor have all but wiped out the larger White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Mr. Trump has not yet named his top advisers on technology or science, and so far, has made just one hire: Michael Kratsios, the former chief of staff for Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley investor and one of the president’s wealthiest supporters, as the deputy chief technology officer. Neither Mr. Kratsios, who has a bachelor’s degree in political science from Princeton, nor anyone else still working in the science and technology office regularly participates in Mr. Trump’s daily briefings, as they did for President Barack Obama. “The impression this leaves is that Trump isn’t interested in science and that scientific matters are a low priority at the White House,” said Vinton G. Cerf, a computer scientist, vice president of Google and one of the chief architects of the internet. The dwindling of the White House science and technology staff for scientific research could have   consequences, Mr. Cerf said. It is unclear whether the vacancies are the result of the Trump administration’s overall slowness in hiring or a signal that the president places less importance on science and technology than Mr. Obama did. A White House official who asked not to be identified cast the issue as one of timing: Mr. Trump, the official said, is still reviewing candidates to be his chief science adviser, considers the science and technology office important and will soon have a new staff for it. But critics see the empty offices as part of a devaluation of science throughout the Trump administration, including the reversal of Mr. Obama’s climate change policies and proposals to sharply reduce spending for research on climate change, science and health. They note that Mr. Obama appointed his top science adviser, John P. Holdren, a Harvard physicist and   expert, in December 2008, weeks before his inauguration. At the same time, conservatives  —   including a member of Mr. Trump’s transition team  —   have called for getting rid of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. (The chief technology officer is a part of that larger office.) They argue that the office, created by Congress in 1976, is a bloated bureaucracy that duplicates expertise already found at government agencies. “Eliminating the O. S. T. P. (or at least electing not to staff it until Congress can act) would not block the president from access to science and technology advice,” James Jay Carafano, who advised Mr. Trump’s transition team, wrote in a report issued last summer by the conservative Heritage Foundation. “Rather, it eliminates a formal office whose purpose is unclear and whose capabilities are largely redundant. ” Mr. Trump has echoed that sentiment, at least when it comes to government jobs over all. Last month he responded to criticism about the high number of vacancies across his administration by telling Fox News that “a lot of those jobs, I don’t want to appoint, because they’re unnecessary to have. ” “You know, we have so many people in government, even me,” Mr. Trump said. “I look at some of the jobs and it’s people over people over people. I say, ‘What do all these people do?’ You don’t need all those jobs. ” If Mr. Trump applies that logic to the science and technology office, he will end decades of tradition in which the president increasingly relied on his own advisers for expertise on federal research budgets, emerging trends and technical crises. Mr. Trump’s first budget proposes slashing $5. 8 billion, or 18 percent, from the National Institutes of Health and $900 million, or about 20 percent, from the Energy Department’s Office of Science, which runs basic research at the national laboratories. The Environmental Protection Agency would be cut by 31 percent. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump issued executive orders that roll back Mr. Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which would have closed hundreds of   power plants in an effort to curb   carbon dioxide emissions. Those actions have been taken without advice or guidance from scientists and engineers inside the White House. The few remaining policy advisers have ceased distributing daily memos on policy issues like climate change,   regulation, or the ethics of big data collection. “They are flying blind when it comes to science and tech issues,” said Kumar Garg, who left the Office of Science and Technology Policy as a senior adviser after the election. There is no question that the science and technology bureaucracy at the White House expanded in recent years. In the George W. Bush administration, there were 50 people in the office, but Mr. Obama more than doubled the staff, to 130, and moved the office into a building on the White House grounds. Mr. Obama turned to the science office during crises like the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Africa the 2011 nuclear spill in Fukushima, Japan and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. The staff of the science office developed the White House’s recommendations for regulation of commercial drones and driverless cars at the Transportation Department. Last year, the staff produced an   report that raised concerns about the threat that robots posed to employment and that advocated retraining Americans for   jobs. The staff also put on the annual White House science fair. In 2011, when lawmakers proposed an online piracy bill known as the Stop Online Piracy Act, internet architecture engineers on the team advised the president to veto the bill because of security and privacy issues it would create. “The agenda was always huge in scope and ambition, and something was always happening,” said Nicole Wong, a former deputy chief technology officer under Mr. Obama. The departure of science and technology experts from the White House means dozens of science and technology programs begun under Mr. Obama have gone untended in the weeks since Inauguration Day. “The O. S. T. P. is the conduit for scientific perspective and scrutiny to the president and is a priority in White House decision making,” said Danny Weitzner, a former deputy chief technology officer in the Obama administration and now the director of internet policy research at M. I. T. Under Mr. Obama, the science and technology office included 19 policy advisers in the environment and energy division, 14 in the national security and international affairs division, nine in the science division and 20 in the technology and innovation division. “We are all sitting on the edge of our seats hoping nothing catastrophic happens in the world,” said Phil Larson, a former senior science and technology adviser to Mr. Obama. “But if it does, who is going to be advising him?” Current White House officials declined to say how many people remained in each division. But four former officials who recently left the office said that a wave of departures scheduled for Friday could potentially reduce the number of people left to a handful, not counting about eight administrative staff members.",0
8265,Comment on 5 Signs You’re Giving Your Power Away & How To Reclaim It by Hijacked,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter There are times in my life when I have been a victim – a victim of circumstance, or so I thought. I wondered why things often didn’t work out in my favour, and how I got so “unlucky.” I used to push to create the things that I wanted, forcing them to happen; if I couldn’t, I lived out the fantasy in my mind. Little did I realize that I was unconsciously creating these scenarios to teach me about power.   It is very common for us to relinquish our power, to give it away without realizing. We do this on a daily basis sometimes, and this behaviour becomes a habitual cycle of disempowerment. For example, some of the comments we make are actually disempowering: “I didn’t get the job that I wanted” “My relationship is falling apart” “My health is in shambles” “I can’t seem to make enough money” These are the types of thoughts that make us feel powerless . When we feel powerless, we get stuck in a cycle of creating difficult situations that make us feel even more powerless. So what is power? Power is ultimately the ability to create a desired result. It’s the ability to attract and create circumstances that lead to our gain, which in turn build our own sense of power. In other words, we become even more powerful each time we use our power responsibly to create what we want; it has a cumulative effect. Not All Power Is Created Equally One of the key reasons we may shy away from or suppress our own power is because we are afraid of creating negative consequences. There are plenty of examples throughout history where power has been misused with dire outcomes. The ultimate fear is using our power to dominate others. If we become powerful will we fall victim to the same fate? Deep down, we all want to feel powerful. We all know the power we have inside of us to create reality. It is up to us to notice the signs of giving our power away so we can consciously “reclaim” it. As Marianne Williamson says: 
“Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us.” As human beings we have a natural desire to feel powerful, so when we don’t feel powerful in our own right, we will orchestrate our outer lives in a way that makes us feel powerful. For example, trying to control others’ behaviour, acquiring unnecessary possessions, and spreading drama and gossip. However, this only results in a deeper feeling of disempowerment and disillusionment about what it takes to have the lives we desire. We seek to control the things we feel we can control, rather than tapping into our own innate power source. Why People Give Their Power Away The more power you have, the more responsibility you have to use it wisely. A great example is someone who earns millions of dollars a year: they have to then manage that money, which requires a great amount of responsibility for what happens to it. So, the less money you earn, the less money you have to manage, and the less responsibility you have. Many people don’t want to take on a higher level of responsibility, as they would then have to face their deepest fears of feeling inadequate and powerless. With power comes the responsibility of being conscious of your choices and how they impact your reality. What will you choose? It is common for spiritually aware people to give their power away because they are aware that their actions could harm people or the planet in ways they have witnessed in others. Yet what they don’t realise is the harm they are doing to themselves because they are turning their power inwards and creating unnecessary problems and dramas in their own lives – especially their relationships, their finances, and/or their health. How To Know When You’re Giving Your Power Away As a result of not wanting to acknowledge and effect our power, we “give it away” – often without knowing that we make things outside of us rulers of our realities. Here are five signs you may be stuck in this cycle: 1. Any Addiction When we become addicted to anything – foods, shopping, technology, drugs, TV shows, sex, pets, people, and so on – we are giving our power to that external “thing.” We allow it to control our behaviour over and over again. The underlying belief is that we cannot be happy, be ourselves, or be free without that “thing,” so we keep going back for more to get our “fix.” 2. Repetitive Relationship Patterns When you find yourself facing the same difficult scenarios in relationships, whether it’s with the same person or different people, you are stuck in a repetitive behavioural pattern of giving your power to your partner as well as taking your power from your partner. This pattern usually shows up as blame, resentment, over-dependence, and in the same arguments that keep arising. Underlying this cycle is the belief that “I need someone else to give me <insert need here>.” 3. Financial Challenges Money problems are a tell-tale sign of giving our power away, simply because we need to feel powerful, to some degree, to create wealth and abundance. It is common to let money dictate how we feel about ourselves, yet it is the other way around: our money situation is a reflection of how powerful we feel. 4. Health Issues When we have pain, illness, or dis-ease in our bodies, it is a sign that we are out of balance; that we are giving power to heal ourselves away. We all have the power within us to create good health, but when we develop physical dis-ease our bodies are communicating to us that we are losing our life force energy; this energy is needed to heal. 5. Depression Depression happens when we feel out of control in our lives. We don’t feel like we can change the status quo to create what we want, so we “opt out” of life to some degree. What precedes depression is often a feeling that you cannot control, such as grief or anger. In effect, a depressed person is suppressing their power, and controlling what they can control: feeling nothing. You Can Reclaim Your Power Now Once you recognize the signs and you are willing to reclaim your power, it can shift within you very quickly, and your outer reality subsequently changes. There are many techniques to reclaim your power, but the most effective and fast-acting one that I’ve come across is to look at how your relationship with power began by asking: “Which part of me doesn’t want to grow up and realize how powerful I truly am?” The act of giving our power away begins at a young age – it’s our way of getting what we want. If you can pinpoint the age where you consciously chose to give away your power for the first time, you can speak to this younger version of yourself and invite her/him to make a different choice. This is a very simple technique which can have a profound impact on living a more powerful life.

8266,Bridge Case Verdict May Hinge on Officials Who Weren’t Tried - The New York Times,"NEWARK  —   Prosecutors opened the case against two former aides to Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey with a stunning assertion: The governor himself knew during the lane closings at the George Washington Bridge that they were meant to punish a mayor for declining to endorse him. Over the past six weeks in federal court, prosecutors have portrayed Mr. Christie and his top aides as relentlessly and crassly political. Orders to freeze out enemies came “directly from gov,” as his campaign manager relayed in one text message. “Gov!” Lee Cortes, a prosecutor, said in his closing argument. “The governor!” But to borrow an old legal term, having rung that bell loudly and repeatedly, prosecutors now want jurors to pretend they did not hear it. The jury began deliberations on Monday about the two aides: Bridget Anne Kelly and Bill Baroni. To decide their fate, the jury has to confront two apparent contradictions in the prosecution’s case. One is the fact that Mr. Christie, a Republican, is not on trial, even though prosecution witnesses have described it as practically Christie administration policy to use government resources to promote his ambitions. The other is the government’s star witness, David Wildstein, who has pleaded guilty to orchestrating the   scheme. Prosecutors admit he is a serial liar and inveterate prankster who, as lawyers repeatedly reminded the jury, once stole the jacket of a   United States senator to embarrass him in a debate. “The guy who stole Frank Lautenberg’s coat? That’s who you relied on?” Mr. Cortes challenged Mr. Baroni in his  . That is also whom the government is relying on, as Mr. Baroni’s lawyer happily noted in his summation. If prosecutors so trusted Mr. Wildstein as a witness, the jury might wonder, why did they not bring charges against Mr. Christie, who, Mr. Wildstein testified, was told about the plot midway through the week of the lane closings in September 2013, when he had the power to reverse them? Judge Susan D. Wigenton instructed the jury not to pay attention to Mr. Christie or the other names prosecutors have mentioned over and over. “The fact that these persons are not on trial here must play no part in your deliberations,” she told jurors. “Their absence should not influence your verdict with respect to the defendants on trial at this time. You are not called upon to return a verdict as to the guilt or innocence of any other person or persons. ” But will jurors decide, in the memorable words of Ms. Kelly’s lawyer, Michael Critchley, that prosecutors went after a whale and ended up with a minnow? When Paul J. Fishman, the United States attorney for New Jersey, announced the indictments in May 2015, he said that he was bringing charges against only the people prosecutors believed a jury would convict. There is not as much documentary evidence that others in the administration were involved in the lane closings and the   Ms. Kelly alone sent the notorious email proclaiming “time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee. ” But given everything the jury has heard about Mr. Christie and his other aides punishing local officials, and scrambling to cover up the lane closings, will jurors decide that Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly are more guilty? Or were they simply less discreet in doing what everyone else was doing, too? And if the jury believes that others were involved, what would be more unfair: that it convicted two for the sins of many, or that it acquitted them, and no one paid for the catastrophic traffic jams that paralyzed Fort Lee? The prosecution did not call many potential witnesses who could have told more about what was really happening in the governor’s office. The judge, in a conference with lawyers, said she could think of “about five” potential witnesses for the jury, suggesting as a start Kevin O’Dowd, the governor’s former chief of staff, and Bill Stepien, his   campaign manager. Mr. Critchley seized the point in his closing argument on Monday, cupping his hands to his mouth and hollering: “Chris Christie, where are you? Kevin O’Dowd, where are you?” And, referring to another Christie confidante, he said, “Michele Brown, where are you?” “You know what that’s called?” Mr. Critchley told the jury. “Cowards. They want the mother of four to take the fall for them. ” The best example of the fine line the government is walking is an episode that prosecutors portrayed as kind of a preview of the main event: the Christie administration’s retribution against Mayor Steven Fulop of Jersey City. Like Mayor Mark Sokolich of Fort Lee, he was a Democrat who had declined to endorse Mr. Christie after a long courtship. Three weeks before Ms. Kelly’s infamous email, Mr. Stepien, then the campaign manager, wrote in an email to her that Mr. O’Dowd, then the chief of staff, would be calling her to cancel a special day’s worth of meetings set up between Mr. Fulop and administration officials. Ms. Kelly told Mr. Stepien to tell the mayor that the meetings had been canceled. “Boom,” Mr. Stepien wrote. “Thanks. ” Ms. Kelly, then in her new job as deputy chief of staff for about three months, expressed regret about having to cancel the meetings. Mr. Stepien, whom prosecutors characterize as her mentor, reassured her: “No, this is perfect. It will send a good message to this guy. ” Mr. Baroni asked whether one of Mr. Christie’s closest confidants, the chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, was allowed to reschedule a meeting with the mayor. “Per Stepien, no meetings with Fulop,” Mr. Wildstein responded in a text message. “Order that Fulop be frozen out comes directly from gov. ” Will the jury accept that in the scheme to freeze out Mr. Sokolich just three weeks later, Mr. Wildstein, Ms. Kelly and Mr. Baroni acted on their own? Prosecutors also savaged Mr. Baroni, once Mr. Christie’s top appointed official at the Port Authority, for his trust in Mr. Wildstein. The defendants said they believed that the lane closings were a legitimate traffic study because Mr. Wildstein told them so. “Noted traffic expert David Wildstein?” Mr. Cortes asked Mr. Baroni. Mr. Baroni’s lawyer, Michael Baldassare, told the jury it was “insulting” for prosecutors to make fun of his client for relying on Mr. Wildstein. “It’s O. K. for them to trust him,” Mr. Baldassare said. “It’s O. K. for them to ask you to trust him. But when Bill trusts the guy, suddenly, apparently, it’s a crime. ” In their closing arguments, prosecutors accused defense lawyers of trying to divert attention from the defendants’ actions. The case, they argued, did not hinge solely on Mr. Wildstein. It is backed up by emails, in which Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly seem to know about the attempt to punish Mr. Sokolich and delight in it. “Is it wrong that I am smiling?” Ms. Kelly wrote, hearing of Mr. Sokolich’s complaint that schoolchildren were stuck in the traffic jams. The defendants spoke of “radio silence” as their strategy to ignore his panicked calls for help. “That’s not the language of victimization,” a prosecutor, Vikas Khanna, said in a final rebuttal on Monday. “Those emails, those text messages, those actions, those are the actions of the defendants, that no one did to them,” he said. “They chose exactly what they were doing. ”",0
8267,SpaceX Rocket Explodes at Launchpad in Cape Canaveral - The New York Times,"A spectacular explosion of a SpaceX rocket on Thursday destroyed a $200 million communications satellite that would have extended Facebook’s reach across Africa, dealing a serious setback to Elon Musk, the billionaire who runs the rocket company. The blast is likely to disrupt NASA’s cargo deliveries to the International Space Station, exposing the risks of the agency’s growing reliance on private companies like SpaceX to carry materials and, soon, astronauts. The explosion, at Cape Canaveral, Fla. intensified questions about whether Mr. Musk is moving too quickly in his headlong investment in some of the biggest and most complex industries, not just space travel but carmakers and electric utilities. This is not the first problem Mr. Musk has suffered as he tries to create space travel that is cheap and commonplace. Each of his companies, including Tesla and SolarCity, has hit major stumbling blocks recently. The owner of a Tesla car died in May in a crash using the company’s autopilot software, and SolarCity faces major financial challenges. “SpaceX is running a punishing schedule,” said Scott Pace, the director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University and a former NASA official. “There is probably some human factor involved here. To what extent was human error part of this? And if so, why? Are you running your people too hard? What are your safety requirements?” Dr. Pace said an internal investigation would have to look at the company’s operations as it tried to ramp up the pace of launches. The company’s president, Gwynne Shotwell, said in a statement, “Our No. 1 priority is to safely and reliably return to flight for our customers, and we will carefully investigate and address this issue.“ The Falcon 9 rocket burst into flames in a violent series of blasts starting at 9:07 a. m. spewing plumes of dark smoke around the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and sending vibrations felt by residents nearby. The rocket had been set to launch on Saturday, carrying a satellite for Spacecom, an Israeli company. The explosion was particularly painful news for Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, who is touring Kenya, promoting a program reliant on the satellite, known as   with entrepreneurs in the country. He had promised them connectivity. Just hours after the news of the explosion broke, Mr. Zuckerberg expressed disappointment on his Facebook page “that SpaceX’s launch failure destroyed our satellite,” a swipe at Mr. Musk and his team, who were still trying to figure out what went wrong. Mr. Musk did not respond publicly to Mr. Zuckerberg. But he posted a brief explanation on Twitter: “Loss of Falcon vehicle today during propellant fill operation. Originated around upper stage oxygen tank. Cause still unknown. More soon. ” The Falcon 9, developed by SpaceX with NASA financing, has had previous problems. In June 2015, a rocket carrying NASA cargo to the International Space Station fell apart   when a strut holding a helium bottle snapped, setting off a chain of events that destroyed the rocket moments later. This latest episode is likely to push back the timetable NASA had after hiring SpaceX and Boeing to carry astronauts to the space station by the end of next year. NASA said it was too soon to say how the explosion would affect its space station operations, asserting that it remained “confident” in its commercial partners. “Today’s incident  —   while it was not a NASA launch  —   is a reminder that spaceflight is an incredible challenge, but our partners learn from each success and setback,” the agency said. SpaceX’s next cargo mission to the space station is scheduled for November. Coincidentally on Thursday, a report released by NASA’s inspector general, Paul K. Martin, said SpaceX and Boeing were likely to face additional delays in their launch schedules anyway. Launches with crews will probably not lift off before the second half of 2018, three years later than planned, the inspector general said. Changes that SpaceX is making to the design of the capsule, to allow landing in water instead of on land, are causing the latest delays, Mr. Martin said. In addition, NASA has been slow in examining safety reviews submitted by the companies, and as a result, late and costly redesigns might be needed, Mr. Martin said. SpaceX lists about 40 launches of satellites and other cargo on its manifest for commercial companies, NASA and the Air Force. Space industry experts say that Mr. Musk faces risks in balancing SpaceX’s backlog of contracts  —   spanning the next few years  —   without cutting corners to stay on the company’s busy schedule. “Whenever you have a failure along these lines, you of course face delays, which inevitably sets back some of your commercial and government satellite contracts,” said Marco Cáceres, senior space analyst and director of space studies at The Teal Group, an aerospace research firm. “They have to fight the temptation to keep to a schedule, even if that means setting back their launches into next year. ” SpaceX had hoped for 18 rocket launches this year so far, eight have occurred. Over all, SpaceX has had 27 successful launches of Falcon 9 rockets. An episode like Thursday’s is rare. Jonathan McDowell of the   Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. who tracks rocket history, said the last time such an explosion happened on a Cape Canaveral launchpad, before the ignition of engines for liftoff, was in 1959. SpaceX is rebuilding a separate launchpad, one of the two formerly used for NASA’s space shuttle missions, for the astronaut launches. That launchpad is scheduled to be ready by the end of the year. Business analysts were mixed on the effects of the explosion on Mr. Musk’s other investments at a time when he is under considerable financial pressure with the planned merger of Tesla and SolarCity. Mr. Musk draws vocal admirers and detractors, some of whom are “short” investors betting that Tesla cannot execute on its business plan. Trip Chowdry, a senior analyst at Global Equities Research who studies Tesla’s performance, described Mr. Musk’s situation as a “  sword. ” “When things work out well, people believe Musk to be a superstar,” Mr. Chowdry said. But when things go wrong like an explosion at a separate company, Tesla investors tend to make more general inferences, too. “When all is said and done, does it have any impact on Tesla stock? No,” he said. “But events at SpaceX do create headline risk for Tesla stockholders. ” The demise of the satellite, called   puts a significant damper on Facebook’s Internet. org initiative, a grand plan spearheaded by Mr. Zuckerberg to provide wireless connectivity to nations across the world that do not otherwise have easy internet access. In a partnership with Eutelsat, a French satellite provider, Facebook planned to use   to offer internet coverage to large parts of   Africa. Along with satellite coverage, Facebook is teaming with local internet providers to offer access, and is also building its own drones  —   the first of which is named Aquila  —   to beam internet connectivity down to cities. Its Internet. org initiative had already sustained a setback when the company’s aggressive overtures were rejected by local regulators in India earlier this year. On Thursday, Mr. Zuckerberg struck an upbeat tone in his post about the rocket failure, noting that the company has other strategies in the works to expand internet connectivity across the world. Aquila, the   drone, he noted, recently undertook its first successful flight in the desert. Still, the setback will delay Facebook’s ambitious plans and even more ambitious timetable. Shortly after his SpaceX comments, Mr. Zuckerberg struck a cheerier note by posting some “good news” from the region: A family of baby giraffes was seen on his safari.",0
8268,"Ban on Head Scarves at Work Is Legal, E.U. Court Rules - The New York Times","LONDON  —   The European Union’s highest court waded into the politically explosive issue of public expressions of Muslim identity on Tuesday, finding that private employers can ban female workers from wearing head scarves on the job. The ruling comes as Europe is beginning a critical election season, with races in the Netherlands, France and Germany, and with     populism rising in many countries. Dutch voters go to the polls on Wednesday, and the   party of the   politician Geert Wilders is expected to fare well. In its ruling, the European Court of Justice found that company regulations banning “the visible wearing of any political, philosophical or religious sign” did not constitute direct discrimination  —   so long as such prohibitions applied to religious garb from all faiths, a requirement that legal experts say could also encompass a Sikh turban and a Jewish skullcap, among other religious symbols. “It is a very bold step,” said Camino   a research fellow at the Center for European Reform in Brussels, describing the ruling as a landmark decision, if also a political and pragmatic one. “Recently we have seen the court being much more attentive to the political winds rather than being so legalistic, because of the recognition that the E. U. is at risk of collapse. ” She characterized the ruling as further evidence that the European court has been pivoting after years of rulings that favored the rights of minorities. This month, the court ruled that European Union member states were not obliged to issue visas to people who planned to seek asylum in their countries, even if they were vulnerable to inhuman treatment or were threatened with torture.   leaders surely would have pounced had the court ruled differently. Along with Mr. Wilders, the French   leader Marine Le Pen has stirred up   anger by accusing Muslims of failing to integrate. Europe has been struggling to accommodate huge numbers of migrants, many from predominantly Muslim countries. Few issues are more politically fraught in Europe than the issue of the rights of observant Muslim women to cover their faces and bodies. Last summer, for instance, a few French municipalities generated global headlines  —   and outrage  —   when Muslim women were prohibited from swimming in the sea while wearing a body covering known as the burkini. Several countries  —   including France, Belgium, Austria and the Netherlands  —   have either passed laws that led to bans on full   veils in public, or are considering legislation that would do so. Those laws, however, apply to public and government spaces. The ruling on Tuesday, which experts said was the first time the court had issued a ruling on women wearing head scarves while on the job, applies only to the workplace and provides a minimum legal standard that member states must meet. The European Court of Justice, based in Luxembourg, interprets the law for the   European Union, and its decisions are binding for member states. Its ruling on Tuesday followed advisory opinions in two distinct cases before the court. In a case in May, Juliane Kokott, an advocate general with the court, issued an opinion saying that a company could prohibit a Muslim employee from wearing a head scarf, provided that the policy applied to attire for all religions and did not single out Islam. That opinion came after a complaint by Samira Achbita, a Muslim woman in Belgium, who was fired as a receptionist for the international security services company G4S after she insisted that she be allowed to wear a head scarf at work. Ms. Achbita sued the company, and the Belgian Court of Cassation asked the European Court of Justice for clarification about what European law required. The Court of Justice concurred on Tuesday with the advisory ruling, saying that Ms. Achbita had not been subject to discrimination because the internal directive was broadly written and did not single out Islam. The court said it was up to the Belgian Court of Cassation to determine whether an employer had committed “indirect discrimination” if any directive ultimately affected “persons adhering to a particular religion or belief. ” In a separate case, from July, Eleanor Sharpston, another advocate general for the court, said that Micropole, an information technology consultancy, had engaged in unlawful discrimination when it fired a Muslim woman, Asma Bougnaoui, in 2009 for refusing to remove her head scarf when dealing with clients. Ms. Bougnaoui took her case to a French court, which referred it to the European Court of Justice. In her advisory opinion, Ms. Sharpston said the company’s decision to dismiss Ms. Bougnaoui had constituted “direct discrimination” based on religion or belief. Ms. Sharpston said there was no evidence to suggest that Ms. Bougnaoui’s scarf interfered with her ability to perform her job as a design engineer. If she had covered her face completely, the opinion found, the situation would have been different, because    contact was important in Western business interactions. But the court on Tuesday found that, in the absence of an internal company policy, it was not enough for an employer to simply justify a dismissal by pointing to a customer’s desire not to interact with someone wearing a head scarf. Legal experts said the court’s ruling could give greater leeway to employers across Europe to regulate religious attire in the workplace, as long as they did so with neutral policies that did not target Muslims. Simon Cox, a senior legal officer specializing in   issues with the Open Society Foundations, said the ruling “will force employers to choose which side they are on and open the door to a greater willingness not to employ women in head scarves. ” Maryam H’madoun, a policy adviser who is also with the Open Society Foundations, expressed concern that the ruling could potentially help exclude many Muslim women from the work force. “This disappointing ruling weakens the guarantee of equality that is at the heart of the E. U.’s   directive,” she said. Colm O’Cinneide, a professor of human rights and constitutional law at University College London, said the ruling could lead to more bans on religious attire in workplaces. He also noted that the ruling required that any ban on religious attire be “objectively justified” and that imposing a ban could be difficult when employees were not the public face of the company or interacting with customers directly. “Depending on a country and its internal debates, companies that want to have a head scarf ban will feel more comfortable doing so, and this ruling gives them some legal cover,” Mr. O’Cinneide said.",0
8269,Expulsions of Protesters at Rio Olympics Draw Rebukes - The New York Times,"RIO DE JANEIRO  —   The expulsions of ticket holders from Olympic sites after they protested Michel Temer, Brazil’s interim president, is fueling a debate over the limits of freedom of expression in a country that remains on edge amid a period of extraordinary political upheaval. Videos, news reports and   accounts that circulated widely in Brazil on Sunday on social media showed the removal of several fans at a women’s soccer match in the city of Belo Horizonte. They had lined up wearing   reading “Out with Temer” while holding aloft letters that read in English, “Come back democracy. ” Juca Kfouri, one of Brazil’s most prominent sports columnists, called the expulsions “repressive stupidity. ” “This will only encourage new demonstrations,” Mr. Kfouri said. The protest in Belo Horizonte, along with others at sites in Rio de Janeiro, pointed to the low approval ratings of Mr. Temer, 75, the career politician who emerged victorious in a power struggle against Dilma Rousseff, who was suspended to face an impeachment trial over claims that she had manipulated the federal budget to conceal economic problems. Ms. Rousseff, like Mr. Temer, is also deeply unpopular. But as she strays from the spotlight, Mr. Temer is receiving greater scrutiny over testimony tying him to illegal campaign financing operations. Executives at the construction giant Odebrecht told investigators that Mr. Temer had requested more than $3 million for his centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party. As part of a plea deal they are seeking, the Odebrecht executives said the payment had been made in cash through a unit used to deliver bribes, according to Veja, a newsmagazine. Mr. Temer has already been found guilty of violating campaign finance limits, a conviction that could make him ineligible to run for office for five years. In a statement, Mr. Temer’s media office acknowledged that he had requested the funds from Odebrecht but said they had been legally declared to the electoral authorities. Mr. Temer endured a chorus of boos when he briefly declared the start of the Olympics during the opening ceremony on Friday. Ticket holders appeared at various Olympic events over the weekend with placards reading, “Fora Temer” (Out with Temer.) A video of security personnel forcibly removing a protesting man from the stands of an archery competition provoked outrage among bystanders who witnessed the episode. Brazil’s Justice Ministry said in a statement that the man had been removed because he was “disrupting the concentration of the athletes. ” (Curiously, many Brazilian fans calling attention to themselves for loudly booing during an array of other Olympic competitions have not faced similar treatment from the security forces.) Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the Rio Olympics organizing committee, said in an interview that the Olympic charter included a policy prohibiting political propaganda in venues. “People who violate this requirement will kindly be asked to leave,” Mr. Andrada said. Still, many Brazilians are in no mood to be told where they can protest as the country fumes over colossal graft scandals involving political figures across the ideological spectrum. “Citizens should have the right to express their views in a peaceful way,” said Gabriel do Nascimento Guimarães, 31, an engineering professor. “I’m against removing anyone from a venue who is exercising their right of freedom of expression. ”",0
8271,"Putin: ""Saakashvili was an insult to the Ukrainian people""","November 21, 2016 - Fort Russ News -  PolitRussia - translated by J. Arnoldski -  


Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that Mikhail Saakashvili’s governorship of Odessa was an insult to the Ukrainian people. 
""This was simply a slap and insult to Odessans and the whole Ukrainian people. He couldn’t even get a working visa to the US and the universities he tried to find work at didn’t want to employ him in a permanent job. This means that he can’t fulfill the duties of being the governor of Odessa. And what, are there no decent, professional, and capable Ukrainians for such a job?”, Putin said in an interview with Oliver Stone for the documentary “Ukraine in Flames.” 

In early November, Saakashvili announced his intention to resign from the post of governor of the Odessa region over the unwillingness of Ukrainian authorities to fight against corruption. He also blamed Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko for patronizing criminal clans in the region.

8273,Got Wedding Jitters? Take a Hike (or Grab Your Blankie) - The New York Times,"For her wedding, Hannah Spinrad welcomed 250 guests to Greensboro, N. C. her hometown, on Memorial Day weekend last year. The guests stayed at the   Grandover Resort and enjoyed a stream of activities, from a golf tournament to snacking in the hospitality suite. The bride was always there to ensure that details were executed flawlessly and that guests were mingling and happy. For a few hours on that Saturday, however, Mrs. Spinrad, 30, who now lives in Atlanta with her husband, Kyle Spinrad, took a break from playing the perfect host to go on a   run with her father. Escaping her guests to exercise may have seemed odd since she was already inundated with activities and wanted to be there for everyone. But this was her tradition with her dad, something she always did when she was home, and it was a chance for them to connect and relax. In retrospect, it was one of the best decisions she made. Before the run, she felt stressed, worrying about how everything was going. Afterward, she had a clear head and a new perspective. “Much of that weekend was a blur to me, but I actually remember that run,” she said. “It was a sense of normalcy, a chance to say, ‘Everyone is here, everyone is happy, and we’re O. K.’ It was my relaxing moment. ” She didn’t get upset even when she had to move the ceremony inside because of rain. Most brides and grooms feel jittery, said Allison   a psychotherapist based in     Mass. who specializes in counseling   . Couples have the logistical stress of pulling off a wedding and dealing with all of the people and perspectives involved. They are also going through an emotional transformation. “You are making this profound identity change, and you are doing it in public, and you don’t know how you are going to react,” Ms.   said. “It’s overwhelming, and that’s O. K. It should be. ” Instead of being caught off guard by that tension, some brides and grooms are taking creative steps to calm themselves on the big weekend, some not all that far removed from having their teddy bears accompany them down the aisle. Some, like Mrs. Spinrad, are reserving time to exercise. Ben Oberman, 32, a doctor in Durham, N. C. was particularly nervous about his wedding because some relatives disapproved of his fiancée, now his wife, Jacquelyn Scott Oberman. “I knew part of my family wasn’t going to be there,” he said. “I thought, was I alienating my family? Was everything going to be fine?” Dr. Oberman and his best man took off on a hike in a petrified forest near the wedding site in Sonoma County, Calif. He shared his fears, rehearsed his vows and took in the natural beauty around him. By the end of the trail, he was ready to get married. “It was a soothing environment, and I was with someone I could trust and who would be there for me no matter what,” he said. Rachael Babington, a Manhattan yoga instructor, has received so many requests from women who wanted to attend a class before their weddings that she started the company Brides Love Yoga. In the busy summer, she has two clients a day. She arrives at sites with a yoga mat and shows brides poses that help to open their hearts and focus their minds. Mrs. Spinrad said it could be strange to do something restorative on your wedding day. “It’s already a   experience that is already supposed to be all about you, so you don’t necessarily think you need to take time for yourself,” she said. “But that means you have to do things to keep your perspective even more, because everything else seems like the biggest deal. ” Before leaving for her rehearsal diner at the Atlantic Golf Club in Bridgehampton, N. Y. last September, Claudia Davidson, 28, who works for UberEats in Washington, packed her clutch. Alongside her wallet and lip balm she put in a piece of her childhood blanket, which her late grandmother made. “It’s sort of something I take with me when I feel like I need backup,” she said. “I knew I was going to be overwhelmed being in the center of attention, so it was nice to have a little sentimental keepsake in my purse just in case. ” She turned to it during her rehearsal dinner, but felt confident enough to forgo it on her wedding day. Ms.   said: “I’ll call that a transitional object. Bringing along something that brings you comfort, why not? You are feeling vulnerable. ” Laurie Mehlman, 31, of Marietta, Ga. let her mother slip a red ribbon, an item that Jewish tradition says wards off evil, into her shoe before her wedding ceremony. “I had just started getting nervous, and having that little connection calmed me down,” she said. Her husband, Ross Mehlman, 30, had his own batch of nerves. “I think it was the   and everyone looking at you and you have to make a speech and everyone wants to talk to you that night,” he said. He dealt with his another way: He and his groomsmen watched his college team play football on television. “It quickly morphed from me sitting in a temple in a conference room waiting for my wedding to me and my best friends sitting around chilling out,” he said. Some people ask mental health professionals to help them with their anxiety. Hillary Evans, a hypnotherapist in Charleston, S. C. has brides come to her many reasons: They want to lose weight and can’t, they are fighting with relatives or friends, they are obsessing over details or they are terrified of giving their speeches. She uses traditional hypnosis to give them new perspectives. She teaches them how to visualize their success and slow down moments so they don’t get out of control and can be savored. Ellyn Gamberg, a psychotherapist in New York, encourages clients to see weddings as rehearsals for real life. “How you navigate what you do in preparing for the wedding and the actual wedding day will be the exact same issues, the same concerns, the same fears, the same dynamics with people and within your self that you will have to struggle with for the rest of your life,” she said. “So I say, ‘Get them right during the process so you get them right for life. ’” She spends months, even years, helping clients figure out the roots of their anxieties. But sometimes even that is not enough. Every year she attends many ceremonies, just to be there for clients in case they panic. “People bring things to weddings, their baby blanket, their pet, their lucky charm,” Dr. Gamberg said. “And some people bring their therapist. It makes them feel better. ”",0
8274,Hundreds of U.K. Police Officers Said to Have Sexually Abused Vulnerable People - The New York Times,"LONDON  —   Hundreds of officers and other employees of the police in Britain have used their power to sexually abuse vulnerable people, a report released on Thursday by a national watchdog said, the latest in a string of institutional abuse accusations in the country. Among those targeted, in what the independent agency called “the most serious corruption issue facing the service,” were victims of domestic abuse, drug and alcohol addicts, and people who work in the sex industry, some of whom were in custody at the time. The inquiry by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary, which assesses national police forces, found that there had been 436 accusations of sexual abuse by police officers in England and Wales over the two years through the end of March. It said the accusations involved 334 police employees, including 306 officers. The watchdog also emphasized that the scale of the problem was much larger. The leader of the inquiry, Mike Cunningham, a former chief constable of the Staffordshire police in central England, said the abuse was an egregious breach of officers’ roles as guardians and protectors. “What can be worse than a guardian abusing the trust and confidence of an abused person? There can be no greater violation of public trust,” he said in the report. “It is an exploitation of power where the guardian becomes the abuser. ” Britain has been grappling with a series of scandals that have called into question how institutions, including the news media, the church and sports teams, respond to those who are vulnerable to abuse. In February, a three   set up by the BBC concluded that a culture of fear and an overly permissive approach to celebrities had allowed Jimmy Savile, a celebrated TV and radio personality, to sexually abuse 72 victims, including children. A scathing report concluded that the   entertainer, who died in 2011 at 84, had raped at least eight people during his tenure at the BBC, including an   . More recently, the world of soccer was deeply shaken after the police said that at least 350 people had come forward in the last two weeks of November to report abuse by youth coaches in Britain. The issue came under the spotlight after at least six former professional players spoke out about having been molested as boys in youth programs. This year, Prime Minister Theresa May, who was then the home secretary, asked the independent agency to investigate the issue of sexual abuse by the police, saying she was concerned that victims were not being taken seriously enough by officers. Lurid cases of sexual abuse by the police have been reported in the news media in recent years, but many say that the problem has not received sufficient attention. In 2011, Stephen Mitchell, a police constable in Northumbria, in northern England, was sentenced to life in prison for raping and sexually assaulting women he had arrested or met on the job. Prosecutors said that Mr. Mitchell, a Glasgow native, had demanded sexual favors from his victims, who included heroin addicts and a disabled teenager. In another case, Steven Walters, a West Midlands police officer, who served in Birmingham, was sentenced in October to four years in prison for groping a woman at her home and, on another occasion, for assaulting a woman in his patrol car.",0

8276,"Democrat Responds to Trump Speech, Calls Himself ’Proud Republican’ - Breitbart","As part of the Democratic Party’s response to President Donald Trump’s address to a joint session of congress, former Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear referred to himself as a “proud Republican. ”[Addressing the camera from a diner in Kentucky, former Gov. Beshear appeared to tangle his words, stating that “I’m a proud Democrat, but first and foremost, I’m a proud Republican, and Democrat, and mostly, American. ”  Beshear went on to attack Trump on a number of issues, claiming that Trump planned to “rip affordable health insurance from Americans who must need it,” as Trump and Republicans formulate plans to fully repeal Obamacare. The former governor also accused Trump of being “Wall Street’s champion,” after one of Trump’s executive orders “makes it harder for families to even afford a mortgage,” while “rolling back rules that provide oversight of the financial industry and protect us against another economic meltdown. ” He also criticized Donald Trump’s cabinet picks, describing them as a “cabinet of billionaires and Wall Street insiders who want to eviscerate the protections that most Americans count on and help level the playing field. ” The tone of the response appeared to be a pitch to the working class Americans who helped propel Trump to victory last November, with the video set in a modest diner surrounded by people Beshear claimed were his neighbors, as well as a mix of both Democrats and Republicans. Donald Trump’s speech covered a number of issues, such as healthcare, defense spending, cutting the size of government, and the need for unity in a divided America. A CNN poll later found that nearly four out of five Americans had a “positive reaction” to the speech.

8279,First Day of Syria Peace Talks Quickly Descends Into Quarreling - The New York Times,"ASTANA, Kazakhstan  —   The first    meeting between Syrian rebel fighters and government officials in nearly six years of civil war ended abruptly on Monday when diplomatic talks quickly devolved into harsh words and competing accusations. The new round of talks arranged by Russia and Turkey in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, was meant to showcase Moscow’s increasingly dominant role in the diplomacy and its new understanding with the Turkish government, a leading sponsor of the rebels. But the Syrian delegations almost immediately began arguing and refused to negotiate directly. Mohammad   of the Army of Islam, in his opening statement, labeled the government “a bloody despotic regime” backed by “vengeful sectarian militias,” and called for it to release what he said were 13, 000 women being held as political prisoners and to end starvation sieges. That led to a heated exchange around a large circular table that forced Kazakh officials to call for calm, several participants said. The lead government negotiator, Bashar   speaking to reporters after the opening session, responded by calling the opposition delegation “armed terrorist groups,” and accused them of “impertinent” and “provocative” behavior. The tension demonstrated the challenges that remain for Russia, the Syrian government’s most powerful backer, as the Russian government tries to show its approach can accomplish more than the largely fruitless efforts led in past years by the United States and the United Nations. Expectations for progress had been low. Many diplomats and analysts say the more meaningful talks are those that have been held in recent months, largely in secret, among Russia, Turkey and Iran. The meeting in Astana, meant to send the message that Russia would seek to resolve the conflict in its sphere of influence, was markedly different from the United   talks that have taken place  in recent winters in Geneva. Delegates crisscrossed the towering atrium of the Rixos Hotel in the remote Kazakh capital built 20 years ago on the orders of Nursultan Nazarbayev, the former Communist boss who has been the country’s president since it became independent with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. He has a reputation as a pragmatic strongman and enjoys good relations with Russia and Turkey. Palm trees planted indoors belied the subzero temperatures and blowing snow outside, as a    duo wearing evening gowns played “Strangers in the Night” and the theme from “Titanic. ” Western diplomats, largely sidelined, huddled in the hotel’s Irish pub, and the United States ambassador to Kazakhstan, who was invited over Iran’s objections and attended only as an observer, avoided reporters. When the Americans had participated in previous rounds of talks in Geneva, the meetings took place at the Palace of Nations, one of the stolid lakeside edifices built in the first half of the 20th century that have housed the United Nations since it was formed after World War II. Those buildings symbolized a postwar order that tried to institutionalize human rights and the laws of war, an order associated with American leadership  —   or domination  —   amid the tensions of the Cold War. Now, the role of the United States in Syria and across the Middle East is widely seen as having receded under former President Barack Obama, and its future remains uncertain. Mr. Obama, while backing some rebel groups, resisted deeper American involvement in the Syrian conflict, ceding the leading role to Russia. His successor, President Trump, has signaled broad approval of Russian leadership and policies and sent mixed messages on Syria. Officially, all sides in the Syrian conflict describe the goal of the talks in Astana as reaffirming a tenuous   in order to revive the Geneva talks. The   started in December and known formally as a cessation of hostilities, is largely ignored in many parts of the country and excludes jihadist groups, including the Levant Conquest Front and the Islamic State. A strengthening of the cessation across Syria, the United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura said Monday, could pave the way for discussion of more substantive political issues at talks scheduled for February in Geneva. The United Nations initially resisted anything more than an observer role in the talks in Astana, but Mr. de Mistura at the last minute agreed to act as a mediator and was shuttling between the delegations who were in separate rooms. Western diplomats were also watching warily to see whether the talks in Astana could be a Russian effort to ultimately replace the Geneva discussions, which the Russian government has criticized. The Syrian government and the Russians have long argued that the Geneva framework, calling for a transitional body with full governing powers, does not require President Bashar   to step down, while the opposition has insisted that it does. But as a practical matter, an increasing number of Western countries, including the United States, and even some of the rebels’ backers in the Middle East, like Turkey, have moved toward the Russian position. With Turkey mainly concerned about checking Kurdish militants within its borders and in Syria, and the United States focused on battling Islamic State militants, they have stopped pushing loudly for Mr. Assad to step down ahead of a settlement, instead signaling that they could accept some role for him in a transitional political arrangement. There were signs on Monday of Russian willingness to apply pressure on the Syrian government to keep the talks on track. The tense exchanges in Astana were followed by a Russian statement unusually critical of the Syrian government: The   news agency RIA Novosti said monitors of a   in Syria were “particularly concerned about sporadic violations of truce by the Syrian government forces”  —   echoing a complaint of rebels. Russia’s   air campaign, which began in the fall of 2015, helped forces loyal to Mr. Assad drive rebels from their foothold late last year in half of the important city of Aleppo, an offensive criticized by the opposition for indiscriminate air and artillery attacks on civilians. Some rebel groups also shelled civilians in   areas. Now one of the main battles is over Wadi Barada, a besieged   area in the watershed that provides most of the drinking water for Damascus, the Syrian capital. Water supplies have been cut off for weeks, with the government blaming rebels and rebels blaming the government. Mr. Jaafari, the chief Syrian government negotiator and his country’s envoy to the United Nations, was incensed that Mr. Alloush, the rebel representative, had sounded the alarm over the plight of people in Wadi Barada. He said raising concerns about government attacks on Wadi Barada was tantamount to defending the Nusra Front, the former name of the Levant Conquest Front, which is excluded from the  . Residents and rebel fighters in Wadi Barada say that some Nusra fighters are present, but they are a minority among other rebel groups and civilians. Mr. Jaafari said that rebel groups had “misunderstood” the terms of the   adding, “We had guarantees from their guarantors that they would behave, but they did not behave. ” Fares Bayoush, a negotiator from an   rebel group who defected from the Syrian Army, said, “He is the one who misunderstood. ”",0
8280,"Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Edward Snowden: Your Thursday Evening Briefing - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. A New York   News poll shows a tightened presidential race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, two of the most unpopular candidates on record. Mrs. Clinton claims the support of 46 percent of likely voters nationwide, to Mr. Trump’s 44 percent. But differences at the state level suggest Mrs. Clinton still has a strong advantage. The Libertarian and Green Party candidates, Gary Johnson and Jill Stein, remain in the single digits but could have an outsize effect on the outcome. _____ 2. Mrs. Clinton resumed campaigning after a   break to recuperate from pneumonia. “People like me, we’re lucky,” she told an audience at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro. “When I’m under the weather, I can afford to take a few days off. Millions of Americans can’t. ” Mr. Trump unveiled a jobs plan that was short on details, though it did include the pledge to make allies pay the full cost of U. S. military resources used for their defense. Donald Trump Jr. came under fire for invoking Holocaust imagery in complaining about media double standards. If the Republicans did what Democrats were doing, he said, “they’d be warming up the gas chamber. ” _____ 3.  The   National Museum of African American History and Culture opens next week, filling the last museum site on the National Mall. The history begins with slavery in Africa and moves to the Americas, with a welter of piercing objects, like a   lockable neck ring. The collection, which ranges from Harriet Tubman’s missal to Chuck Berry’s red Cadillac, “is a   engrossing,   ” our critic writes. _____ 4. One of our most popular stories today is actually a short video narrated by Shawn Carter, better known as Jay Z. It’s a compelling, speedy recap of the U. S. fight against drugs going back to the Nixon administration, pointing out how   have been disproportionately targeted and penalized. “The war on drugs is an epic fail,” he concludes. _____ 5. The Philippines is struggling through its own devastating war on drugs. Its Senate heard explosive testimony from a   hit man who said that the country’s new president, Rodrigo Duterte, had presided over the extrajudicial killings of about 1, 000 criminals and political opponents over the years he served as mayor of Davao City. The Senate’s televised hearings have already heard that nearly 1, 800 people were killed by police officers and vigilantes in the war on drugs in Mr. Duterte’s first seven weeks as president. _____ 6.  Oliver Stone’s “Snowden” opens nationwide on Friday. Our reviewer calls it “a quiet, crisply drawn portrait of the world’s most celebrated ” and, “by Mr. Stone’s standards, a strikingly sober film”  —   with little in the way of wild conspiracy theories or bravura visuals. Human rights groups are taking advantage of the film’s splash to press President Obama to pardon Mr. Snowden, but lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee urged Mr. Obama not do so. _____ 7. China’s new class of   is bringing another novelty to the country: the stratospheric divorce settlement. In what appears to be the latest, the Chinese tycoon who holds a controlling stake in Grindr, the gay dating app, has been ordered to transfer some $1. 14 billion in shares of his own company, Beijing Kunlun World Wide Technology, to his wife. _____ 8. Our reporter on the hajj has had to cover her hair and robe herself, despite the heat. Even so, other women on the pilgrimage to Mecca have chastised her for not wearing socks. She relates her struggle with the limits that are Islam’s price of community, including a lesser place for women. “It can feel patronizing, and diminishing of our full humanity,” she writes. “It is why I started to lose faith after a childhood in an observant family and what I still struggle with, at 38, living a life that is secular but guided by Islamic values. ” _____ 9. An N. F. L. official said two Denver Broncos defenders were fined for hitting the Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton on the head in their season opener last week. Newton was hit on the head four times in the game, only one of which drew a penalty against the Broncos. But there were shining moments in the opening week of professional football, like the   34 completions the Kansas City Chiefs’ quarterback, Alex Smith, made against the San Diego Chargers. Tonight, the New York Jets play the Buffalo Bills. (8:25 p. m. Eastern, CBS) _____ 10.  Finally, good news: After years of planning and digitizing, much of the Museum of Modern Art’s sumptuous archives are now available on the museum’s website. “This is like a dream come true for me,” said the archives’ chief, Michelle Elligott, “because I’ve been playing around with this material for 20 years and I know the depth of what’s here. ” _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.

8281,Can The Oligarchy Still Steal The Presidential Election? — Paul Craig Roberts,"Can The Oligarchy Still Steal The Presidential Election?
Paul Craig Roberts
The election was set up to be stolen from Trump. That was the purpose of the polls rigged by overweighting Hillary supporters in the samples. After weeks of hearing poll results that Hillary was in the lead, the public would discount a theft claim. Electronic voting makes elections easy to steal, and I have posted explanations by election fraud experts of how it is done.
Clearly the Oligarchy does not want Donald Trump in the White House as they are unsure that they could control him, and Hillary is their agent. 
With the reopening of the FBI investigation of Hillary and related scandals exploding all around her, election theft is not only more risky but also less likely to serve the Oligarchy’s own interests.
Image as well as money is part of Oligarchic power. The image of America takes a big hit if the American people elect a president who is currently under felony investigation. 
Moreover, a President Hillary would be under investigation for years. With so much spotlight on her, she would not be able to serve the Oligarchy’s interests. She would be worthless to them, and, indeed, investigations that unearthed various connections between Hillary and oligarchs could damage the oligarchs. 
In other words, for the Oligarchy Hillary has moved from an asset to a liability.
A Hillary presidency could put our country into chaos. I doubt the oligarchs are sufficiently stupid to think that once she is sworn in, Hillary can fire FBI Director Comey and shut down the investigation. The last president that tried that was Richard Nixon, and look where that got him. 
Moreover, the Republicans in the House and Senate would not stand for it. House Committee on oversight and Government Reform chairman Jason Chaffetz has already declared Hillary to be “a target-rich environment. Even before we get to day one, we’ve got two years worth of material already lined up.” House Speaker Paul Ryan said investigation will follow the evidence.
If you were an oligarch, would you want your agent under this kind of scrutiny? If you were Hillary, would you want to be under this kind of pressure? 
What happens if the FBI recommends the indictment of the president? Even insouciant Americans would see the cover-up if the attorney general refused to prosecute the case. Americans would lose all confidence in the government. Chaos would rule. Chaos can be revolutionary, and that is not good for oligarchs.
Moreover, if reports can be believed, salacious scandals appear to be waiting their time on stage. For example, last May Fox News reported: 
“Former President Bill Clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offender’s infamous jet than previously reported, with flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the “Lolita Express” — even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights, according to records obtained by FoxNews.com.
“Clinton’s presence aboard Jeffrey Epstein’s Boeing 727 on 11 occasions has been reported, but flight logs show the number is more than double that, and trips between 2001 and 2003 included extended junkets around the world with Epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names, including “Tatiana.” The tricked-out jet earned its Nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls.”
Fox News reports that Epstein served time in prison for “solicitation and procurement of minors for prostitution.

This kind of behavior seems reckless even for Bill and Hillary, who are accustomed to getting away with everything. Nevertheless, if you are an oligarch already worried about the reopened Hillary email case and additional FBI investigations, such as the one into the Clinton Foundation, and concerned about what else might emerge from the 650,000 emails on former US Rep. Weiner’s computer and the NYPD pedophile investigation, putting Hillary in the Oval Office doesn’t look like a good decision.
At this point, I would think that the Oligarchy would prefer to steal the election for Trump, instead of from him, rather than allow insouciant Americans to destroy America’s reputation by choosing a person under felony investigations for president of the United States.
Being the “exceptional nation” takes on new meaning when there is a criminal at the helm.

8282,Gruesome Video Shows Turkish Soldiers Execute Female Kurdish PKK Fighters by Shooting in Their Heads,"4 Shares
3 0 0 1
Amateur footage emerged on Saturday showing what appears to be Turkish soldiers executing two female PKK insurgents at point-blank range.
Al-Masdar News that released the footage says they are not able to independently verify it.
A ceasefire between Turkey and the PKK ended last year and clashes have since claimed hundreds of lives on both sides.
The PKK operates primarily in the mountanious terrain of southeastern Turkey and often uploads footage of its Kurdish fighters ambushing Turkish government troops.
MORE... 2 bombers, stopped by police, blew themselves up in Turkey Dispute over Kurds and Coup attempt threatens U.S.-Turkey alliance The attempted coup d’état made Turkey band together Erdogan vows heavy price for coup plotters The tension between Kurdish fighters and Turkish government have always been high in past years. In yet one of the most recent cases, a Turkish court banned the co-leader of Turkey's pro-Kurdish opposition from traveling abroad as part of a court case in which she has been accused of being a member of an armed terrorist group, Hurriyet daily reported on Saturday, Reuters reported.
Figen Yuksekdag, co-chair of Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), is facing jail time up to 15 years over comments she made last year in the southeastern border town of Suruc. The prosecutor of the case requested the ban.
HDP described the court's decision to bar Yuksekdag from foreign travel as 'political and arbitrary', saying in a statement that it will make a formal appeal for its overturn.
The move comes days after the co-mayors of Diyarbakir, the largest city in the southeast, were detained as part of a security crackdown. Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast has been rocked by violence following the collapse of a ceasefire between the state and the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) last year.
President Tayyip Erdogan has accused the HDP of being a political extension of the outlawed PKK and repeatedly called for the prosecution of its members. He has also said the removal of elected officials and civil servants accused of links to the PKK was a vital part of the battle against it.
Several other HDP lawmakers including co-chair Selahattin Demirtas are also being prosecuted, largely over terrorism charges, after the parliament earlier this year lifted the immunity of HDP deputies, along with the immunity of MPs from other parties.
Meanwhile three Turkish soldiers were killed and five others were wounded by mortar fire from PKK militants near the southeastern town of Cukurca, security sources said.
Soldiers who were on an operation in Cukurca in Hakkari province bordering Iraq and Iraq returned the fire, sources said. Operations were under way to hunt down the militants.
The autonomy-seeking PKK took up arms in 1984, and more than 40,000 people have died in the conflict. It is considered a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union.",0

8284,"Dear Foreign Friends, Here’s Why Trump Won (From A Clevelander) | Katehon think tank. Geopolitics & Tradition","Home » Dear Foreign Friends, Here’s Why Trump Won (From A Clevelander) Dear Foreign Friends, Here’s Why Trump Won (From A Clevelander) Andrew Korybko 
Hi everybody. As you may know, I’m an American who was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio, although I made a life decision four years ago to permanently leave the US and move to the Russian Federation. If you’re interested in my specific background and what motivated me to take that step, I suggest that you check out the interview that I gave to Serbian-American journalist Stephen Karganovic about this last spring when I visited him in Belgrade. 
I’m addressing you all directly in a form which I never use in my articles, and that’s the first-person. I know that so many of you guys are confused and struggling to understand why Trump won, and I totally understand what you’re feeling because it’s very difficult for any foreigner to truly comprehend what just happened in the US. The best way for me to convey this to you all is to talk on a personal level in the hopes that my delivery will get through to you. I’m not expecting anyone to agree with the points that I make, but just to understand what motivated Trump supporters to get out to the polls and shake up The Establishment. 
Although I don’t live in the US anymore, I was born and raised in one of the most quintessential representations of what constitutes modern-day “average America”, and that’s Cleveland, Ohio. Despite being nearly halfway across the world, I never lost touch with where I came from and will always remember the formative experiences which shaped my worldview. I still stay in contact with my American family and several close friends so I remain up to date on what’s going on “back home”, and as they say, “you can take someone out of their homeland, but you can’t take the homeland out of the person”. 
For better or for worse, I’ll always embody certain “American” characteristics forged from my upbringing in Cleveland, and given that these idiosyncrasies are now representative of the prevailing political zeitgeist in the US as evidenced by Trump’s Triumph, I want to share some of them with you all in the hopes that everyone can get a better grasp on the fundamental changes that are taking place in the US today. A man who I call “Uncle Vinny” once inspiringly advised me when I was younger that “the difference between genius and crazy is in getting others to understand you”, so with that wisdom in mind, here’s the best that I can do in trying to help all my foreign friends understand the mentality of the typical Trump supporter. 
So many toxic individuals said that I and tens of millions of other people were “racists”, “fascists”, and “white supremacists” just because we’ve been publicly sharing our observations over the past year and a half that Trump’s rhetoric and platform represent the desires of many Americans, but we held our ground and doubled down because we knew that we were right and that the American People would ultimately choose Donald J. Trump to be the next President of the United States. 
This is why “outsiders” such as myself and everyone else who rallied behind Trump are so valuable to the larger conversations taking place because we consistently break through the narrow-minded groupthink of The Establishment and express what’s really going on, “political correctness” be damned. No foreigner can ever fully understand what happened yesterday, not even if they lived in the US for years unless they experienced what the middle class (not the academic-governmental-business class) experienced for their entire lives. 
Michael Moore, who’s also a native of the “Rust Belt” like myself and understands the mentality of the millions of Americans who revolted against The Establishment and historically broke through Hillary’s Midwest “firewall”, conveyed the reason why voters in this dilapidated and socio-economically “backward/forgotten” corner of the US would flock towards Trump in an address which was ironically supposed to be against the future President-elect. Trump supporters, however, decided to turn the most relevant and motivational part of Moore’s speech into a YouTube video filled with dramatic images and music, and I strongly suggest that everyone take five minutes out of their day to listen to what he had to say. 
When you live a life surrounded by drugs, poverty, crime, potholes, and hopelessness, the only thing that you feel that you have going for you are the sexual, alcoholic, and musical distractions that The Establishment shoves down everyone’s throat each and every day in order to placate the masses by “making it all better” just for a little bit of (“fun”) time. Turn off the TV or go to sleep after the party, and the same problems that people sought to escape from are still there the very next morning and not a damned thing has tangibly changed for the better, except that some people have now found a socially acceptable “go-to medicine” for dealing with the repulsive reality that they feel they have to put up with each and every day for the rest of their lives. 
A lot of Americans where I’m from don’t know what a “real vacation” is, in that they don’t go globetrotting around the world like the Europeans do on what they call their “holidays”. Many Midwesterners even have a hard time going from one part of the country to another just for fun because it’s a huge financial burden for the average Clevelander in our cheap and low-wage economy to gather up the funds necessary to jet set out to costly California just to take in some sunshine, for example. Another thing that most foreigners don’t realize is that people from my part of the country don’t even have the vacation/holiday days like the rest of the world does. If you’re working a low-wage service-sector job or are in a low-level office position, then you might never receive two back-to-back weeks of vacation in your life. If you get married, the best that you can dream for is a honeymoon to Niagara Falls for a week and that’s it, just because it’s conveniently nearby and not overly expensive. 
We grew up our whole lives hearing from The Establishment and its media shills how “great” and “powerful” the US is, how it’s the “best country in the history of the world”, yet all that we see around us is socio-economic devastation and we can’t imagine how it could ever be any different. So many factories have closed up shop and moved to Mexico, China, and countries that the average American in my part of the US never heard of or can even pronounce, and it’s all because of the post-Cold War globalization that started under Bill Clinton and NAFTA. But at the same time, however, we see that there are indeed some people around us who seem to be living a pretty good life but haven’t had to do much to achieve it. 

You foreigners might be shocked to hear this, but a lot of Clevelanders can’t believe that “refugees”, some minorities, and illegal immigrants are able to live ‘high off the hog’ as we say just because of the huge amounts of tax-payer-provided government assistance that they receive for not really doing a lot of anything other than being the “politically correct” category of people that they are. I don’t expect people outside of the US to understand this, and even many Americans who don’t live in the “Rust Belt” (and even some who do) will probably find this to be inconceivable, but so many of these types of folks who I just mentioned – and including a lot of whites, too – abuse the “benefits” system just so that they can get the most amount of free stuff as they can for the absolute least amount of work and effort. 
In the “politically correct” dystopian society that the “liberal-progressives” and Cultural Marxists of the Democratic Party have strove to create for decades, the state will house, feed, and pay people just because of their race and class, and while this might have been “originally intended” to temporarily help those who fell on hard times and couldn’t properly help themselves, it has been abused by so many people and turned into a slush fund for paying off loyal leftists who willingly choose to remain indefinitely dependent on The Establishment. These people have made a conscious choice to “settle for less” than they could ever hope to achieve if they worked hard and stayed focused because “The American Dream” is out of reach for many of them in this part of the country and they figured out how easy it is to scheme the system and have other Americans subsidize the less-than-ideal lifestyles that they’ve settled for. 
Remember, I’m not asking you guys to agree with any of what I’ve written, but I’m just telling you as a “voice from the inside” about why so many people in Ohio and the “Rust Belt” support Trump and are drawn to his promises to smash The Establishment that they’ve spent their whole lives seeing steal from them, neglect them, and unjustly help others who pledge their loyalty to the existing state of affairs. Don’t forget that it was people who think the way that I just described who decisively changed the course of American history on Election Day, and they take pride in being “politically incorrect” and rebelling against the system that they feel has held them down their entire lives. Be it through the abovementioned examples of unfairness and injustice, or through the incessant attempts to dismantle their identity by suppressing and trashing their religious liberties and traditions, people in the “Rust Belt” have had enough. 
See, that’s the thing that foreigners don’t realize, and it’s that Americans in this part of the country feel that they’re living under the boot of a tyrannical and totalitarian ideology which censors their dissent with “racist”, “fascist”, and “white supremacist” reputation-killing accusations and works 24/7/365 to brainwash them into thinking that they – and not the system – are the problem. Imagine George Orwell’s 1984 and you’ll have an idea about how a lot people view the ideology of “political correctness”. It is so pervasive, so controlling, that those who are suffering under it were bound to eventually revolt once the time was ripe. All of these anti-“political correctness” dissidents thought that they were alone and were the “crazy outlier” amongst their brainwashed compatriots, but then Donald Trump came along and gave them all the signal that this was the historic moment that they had been waiting their entire lives for to finally rebel against this totalitarian ideology. If there was no “political correctness”, then there would never have risen a Donald Trump to save the hard-working blue collar folks of the USA. 
The majority-blue collar inhabitants of the “Rust Belt” have been voiceless for decades and were seething with rage this whole time. They couldn’t speak out against the majority-black crime that ravages their neighborhoods because otherwise they’d be tarred and feathered as “racists”. They couldn’t condemn globalization and the outsourcing of their livelihoods to Mexico, China, and other countries or else they’d be mercilessly attacked as “fascists”. God forbid these people ever spoke publicly about building a wall with Mexico to stop the tens of millions of illegal immigrants and uncountable tons of deadly narcotics that have flooded the US since NAFTA, since then they’d be called the ultimate insult and accused of being “white supremacists”. These people thought that they were largely alone with their feelings because the system did such an effective job of self-censoring them and thus separating them from the silent majority of likeminded Americans, but then Donald Trump emerged on the scene and millions of people were finally united via his rallies and social-alternative medias to finally muster up the courage to collectively resist The Establishment and its allied social-pop culture-academic-political elite’s intimidation. 
When Election Day came, these dispossessed Americans didn’t back down and buy into The Establishment’s propaganda that Hillary was going to trounce Trump with an historic landslide but instead went to vote anyhow, knowing that this was the only hope left for them to ever possibly change their inescapably dismal life situations. 
The most intense psychological warfare operation ever conducted against Americans was a complete failure. The Establishment’s War on the People sought to convince them that Trump didn’t stand a chance to win and that voting for him just showed how “racist”, “fascist”, and “white supremacist” you were. “Political correctness”, globalization, and the unfettered illegal immigration and unvetted “refugee” resettlement of millions of people who staunchly refuse to assimilate and integrate into American Society or even speak English is just a fact of life that these “deplorable” citizens will be forced to put up and deal with until they die (or are killed by some of the “new arrivals” who flocked into their hometowns). But The Establishment and its social-pop culture-academic-political shills were wrong and Trump supporters knew it because they had finally connected with one another and were convinced that they truly embodied the silent majority, and the frustration, hopelessness, and pain that comes every single day living in a “politically correct” system is what sent millions of Americans into a rage against the system which was so widespread that it became impossible for Hillary to steal the election. 
The War on the People was waged by Americans, on Americans, and against everything that the silent majority believes that America stands for, which is why it was totally unprecedented in American history. Not even the divide-and-rule Color Revolution tactics that The Establishment dangerously and irresponsibly relied on with the help of George Soros and his “Black Lives Matter” urban extremists could succeed in intimidating the Trump Movement and compelling them to stop, which testifies to the deep conviction that Trump supporters have in their beliefs and the hope that they have that their candidate of choice will finally free them from the misery that has come to define their lives. 
Dear foreign friends, forget everything that you may have ever thought about the US system, national ideology, and the American People – from here on out, you and 99% of all other non-American observers begin at Day 1 in working to understand the inner nuances of Trump Country and Trump’s America. My state of Ohio had the highest honor of being the biggest upset to Hillary Clinton by 9%, something which has shocked The Establishment. We, the people of Ohio, are the heart of Trumpland. He didn’t win by a few percentage points like in every other swing state, but by almost double digits. This should be more than enough proof that everything that I, as a born-and-raised Clevelander, am revealing to you about how and why Trump won the “Rust Belt” and broke through Hillary’s firewall. Where I’m from, people don’t just have 1 or 2 Trump signs in their yard – they have 5, 10, or 20 of them, especially if they live in the farmland right outside of the city. 
I’m not expecting you to understand everything that I wrote, let alone to agree with it, but I felt obligated to do the best that I can to inform you all about why Trump won and the reasons behind the “Rust Belt” revolt against The Establishment which handed him the Presidency. For all of what you might think are their personal and ideological faults, Trump supporters feel validated by this election because it proved that the system and all of its shills were lying about Hillary’s “imminent landslide” this entire time. What had been derided for over a year and a half as the “conspiratorial thinking” of a “vast right-wing conspiracy” (one with phantasmal and invented links to the Russian secret services) was exposed as a fact – The Establishment was indeed lying this entire time and desperately waged what amounts to the most intense psychological operation against Americans ever conducted in history, and that’s the War on the People. Nobody can deny it any longer, the facts are the facts and all the “official” “thinkers”, pundits, and “experts” were wrong because they either deliberately refused to recognize the reality that was before their eyes or were complicit in siding with the system out of the self-interested expectation that they’ll somehow end up benefiting from its perpetuation. 
Tough times are ahead, and the nation is more divided and polarized than ever before, though this is largely due to the lingering psychological effects of The Establishment’s War on the People than anything else. The Second American Revolution was indeed a victory of the American People over The Establishment, but it’s now under threat from the Clintonian Counter-Revolution that’s broken out in the streets of many pro-Democrat American cities. It’s the height of irony that the people who just a few days ago criticized Trump for not pledging to blindly respect the results of the vote are now the ones who don’t recognize its outcome and are poised to tear America’s inner cities apart just because they couldn’t pull off stealing the election of our lifetime. 
I don’t think anybody knows how far the rioters will be directed/misled by their Hillary-Soros-neoconservative handlers to go, nor how President-elect Trump will respond to their unrest once he takes office in mid-January, but what I can in fact tell each and every one of you without an inkling of doubt in my mind is that the Trump supporters of the Midwestern “Rust Belt” who helped hand him his victory in the first place will form the vanguard Second Amendment-wielding citizens leading the Reverse-Color Revolution movement to legally safeguard the 45th President’s constitutional legitimacy if things disastrously get out of control.

8285,The Fatal Expense Of American Imperialism," The Fatal Expense Of American Imperialism
By Jeffrey D. Sachs
 Boston Globe "" - THE SINGLE MOST important issue in allocating national resources is war versus peace, or as macroeconomists put it, guns versus butter. The United States is getting this choice profoundly wrong, squandering vast sums and undermining national security. In economic and geopolitical terms, America suffers from what Yale historian Paul Kennedy calls imperial overreach. If our next president remains trapped in expensive Middle East wars, the budgetary costs alone could derail any hopes for solving our vast domestic problems.
It may seem tendentious to call America an empire, but the term fits certain realities of US power and how its used. An empire is a group of territories under a single power. Nineteenth-century Britain was obviously an empire when it ruled India, Egypt, and dozens of other colonies in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. The United States directly rules only a handful of conquered islands (Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands), but it stations troops and has used force to influence who governs in dozens of other sovereign countries. That grip on power beyond Americas own shores is now weakening.
The scale of US military operations is remarkable. The US Department of Defense has (as of a 2010 inventory) 4,999 military facilities, of which 4,249 are in the United States; 88 are in overseas US territories; and 662 are in 36 foreign countries and foreign territories, in all regions of the world. Not counted in this list are the secret facilities of the US intelligence agencies. The cost of running these military operations and the wars they support is extraordinary, around $900 billion per year, or 5 percent of US national income, when one adds the budgets of the Pentagon, the intelligence agencies, homeland security, nuclear weapons programs in the Department of Energy, and veterans benefits. The $900 billion in annual spending is roughly one-quarter of all federal government outlays.
The United States has a long history of using covert and overt means to overthrow governments deemed to be unfriendly to US interests, following the classic imperial strategy of rule through locally imposed friendly regimes. In a powerful study of Latin America between 1898 and 1994, for example, historian John Coatsworth counts 41 cases of successful US-led regime change, for an average rate of one government overthrow by the United States every 28 months for a century. And note: Coatsworths count does not include the failed attempts, such as the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba.
This tradition of US-led regime change has been part and parcel of US foreign policy in other parts of the world, including Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Wars of regime change are costly to the United States, and often devastating to the countries involved. Two major studies have measured the costs of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. One, by my Columbia colleague Joseph Stiglitz and Harvard scholar Linda Bilmes, arrived at the cost of $3 trillion as of 2008. A more recent study, by the Cost of War Project at Brown University, puts the price tag at $4.7 trillion through 2016. Over a 15-year period, the $4.7 trillion amounts to roughly $300 billion per year, and is more than the combined total outlays from 2001 to 2016 for the federal departments of education, energy, labor, interior, and transportation, and the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and the Environmental Protection Agency.
It is nearly a truism that US wars of regime change have rarely served Americas security needs. Even when the wars succeed in overthrowing a government, as in the case of the Taliban in Afghanistan, Saddam Hussein in Iraq, and Moammar Khadafy in Libya, the result is rarely a stable government, and is more often a civil war. A successful regime change often lights a long fuse leading to a future explosion, such as the 1953 overthrow of Irans democratically elected government and installation of the autocratic Shah of Iran, which was followed by the Iranian Revolution of 1979. In many other cases, such as the US attempts (with Saudi Arabia and Turkey) to overthrow Syrias Bashar al-Assad, the result is a bloodbath and military standoff rather than an overthrow of the government.
WHAT IS THE DEEP motivation for these profligate wars and for the far-flung military bases that support them?
From 1950 to 1990, the superficial answer would have been the Cold War. Yet Americas imperial behavior overseas predates the Cold War by half a century (back to the Spanish-American War, in 1898) and has outlasted it by another quarter century. Americas overseas imperial adventures began after the Civil War and the final conquests of the Native American nations. At that point, US political and business leaders sought to join the European empires  especially Britain, France, Russia, and the newly emergent Germany  in overseas conquests. In short order, America grabbed the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Panama, and Hawaii, and joined the European imperial powers in knocking on the doors of China.
As of the 1890s, the United States was by far the worlds largest economy, but until World War II, it took a back seat to the British Empire in global naval power, imperial reach, and geopolitical dominance. The British were the unrivaled masters of regime change  for example, in carving up the corpse of the Ottoman Empire after World War I. Yet the exhaustion from two world wars and the Great Depression ended the British and French empires after World War II and thrust the United States and Russia into the forefront as the two main global empires. The Cold War had begun.
The economic underpinning of Americas global reach was unprecedented. As of 1950, US output constituted a remarkable 27 percent of global output, with the Soviet Union roughly a third of that, around 10 percent. The Cold War fed two fundamental ideas that would shape American foreign policy till now. The first was that the United States was in a struggle for survival against the Soviet empire. The second was that every country, no matter how remote, was a battlefield in that global war. While the United States and the Soviet Union would avoid a direct confrontation, they flexed their muscles in hot wars around the world that served as proxies for the superpower competition.
Over the course of nearly a half century, Cuba, Congo, Ghana, Indonesia, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Iran, Namibia, Mozambique, Chile, Afghanistan, Lebanon, and even tiny Granada, among many others, were interpreted by US strategists as battlegrounds with the Soviet empire. Often, far more prosaic interests were involved. Private companies like United Fruit International and ITT convinced friends in high places (most famously the Dulles brothers, Secretary of State John Foster and CIA director Allen) that land reforms or threatened expropriations of corporate assets were dire threats to US interests, and therefore in need of US-led regime change. Oil interests in the Middle East were another repeated cause of war, as had been the case for the British Empire from the 1920s.
These wars destabilized and impoverished the countries involved rather than settling the politics in Americas favor. The wars of regime change were, with few exceptions, a litany of foreign policy failure. They were also extraordinarily costly for the United States itself. The Vietnam War was of course the greatest of the debacles, so expensive, so bloody, and so controversial that it crowded out Lyndon Johnsons other, far more important and promising war, the War on Poverty, in the United States.
The end of the Cold War, in 1991, should have been the occasion for a fundamental reorientation of US guns-versus-butter policies. The occasion offered the United States and the world a peace dividend, the opportunity to reorient the world and US economy from war footing to sustainable development. Indeed, the Rio Earth Summit, in 1992, established sustainable development as the centerpiece of global cooperation, or so it seemed.
Alas, the blinders and arrogance of American imperial thinking prevented the United States from settling down to a new era of peace. As the Cold War was ending, the United States was beginning a new era of wars, this time in the Middle East. The United States would sweep away the Soviet-backed regimes in the Middle East and establish unrivalled US political dominance. Or at least that was the plan.
THE QUARTER CENTURY since 1991 has therefore been marked by a perpetual US war in the Middle East, one that has destabilized the region, massively diverted resources away from civilian needs toward the military, and helped to create mass budget deficits and the buildup of public debt. The imperial thinking has led to wars of regime change in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, and Syria, across four presidencies: George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. The same thinking has induced the United States to expand NATO to Russias borders, despite the fact that NATOs supposed purpose was to defend against an adversary  the Soviet Union  that no longer exists. Former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev has emphasized that eastward NATO expansion was certainly a violation of the spirit of those declarations and assurances that we were given in 1990, regarding the future of East-West security.
There is a major economic difference, however, between now and 1991, much less 1950. At the start of the Cold War, in 1950, the United States produced around 27 percent of world output. As of 1991, when the Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz dreams of US dominance were taking shape, the United States accounted for around 22 percent of world production. By now, according to IMF estimates, the US share is 16 percent, while China has surpassed the United States, at around 18 percent. By 2021, according to projections by the International Monetary Fund, the United States will produce roughly 15 percent of global output compared with Chinas 20 percent. The United States is incurring massive public debt and cutting back on urgent public investments at home in order to sustain a dysfunctional, militarized, and costly foreign policy.
Thus comes a fundamental choice. The United States can vainly continue the neoconservative project of unipolar dominance, even as the recent failures in the Middle East and Americas declining economic preeminence guarantee the ultimate failure of this imperial vision. If, as some neoconservatives support, the United States now engages in an arms race with China, we are bound to come up short in a decade or two, if not sooner. The costly wars in the Middle East  even if continued much less enlarged in a Hillary Clinton presidency  could easily end any realistic hopes for a new era of scaled-up federal investments in education, workforce training, infrastructure, science and technology, and the environment.
The far smarter approach will be to maintain Americas defensive capabilities but end its imperial pretensions. This, in practice, means cutting back on the far-flung network of military bases, ending wars of regime change, avoiding a new arms race (especially in next-generation nuclear weapons), and engaging China, India, Russia, and other regional powers in stepped-up diplomacy through the United Nations, especially through shared actions on the UNs Sustainable Development Goals, including climate change, disease control, and global education.
Many American conservatives will sneer at the very thought that the United States room for maneuver should be limited in the slightest by the UN. But think how much better off the United States would be today had it heeded the UN Security Councils wise opposition to the wars of regime change in Iraq, Libya, and Syria. Many conservatives will point to Vladimir Putins actions in Crimea as proof that diplomacy with Russia is useless, without recognizing that it was NATOs expansion to the Baltics and its 2008 invitation to Ukraine to join NATO, that was a primary trigger of Putins response.
In the end, the Soviet Union bankrupted itself through costly foreign adventures such as the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan and its vast over-investment in the military. Today the United States has similarly over-invested in the military, and could follow a similar path to decline if it continues the wars in the Middle East and invites an arms race with China. Its time to abandon the reveries, burdens, and self-deceptions of empire and to invest in sustainable development at home and in partnership with the rest of the world.

Some entrepreneurs have made it work (or are trying) with quirky products whether earnest (like the Star of David tree topper) or mildly subversive (like the Santa Claus yarmulke or a   bong). Some purveyors of these seasonal products, like Neal Hoffman, never expected to be in the Hanukkah business. Mr. Hoffman was shopping in a Nordstrom in 2012 when his son ran up to him holding an Elf on the Shelf, the popular Christmas toy. That turned out to be both complicated and fortuitous: complicated, because Mr. Hoffman is Jewish, his wife is Catholic, and they had decided to raise their children Jewish. And fortuitous because of what happened next. “I was like, ‘Dude, you can’t have that,’” said Mr. Hoffman, who previously had worked at Hasbro, the toy giant. “‘You can have a’  —   and I was like, what would be Jewish I could rhyme with?” he said. “And then I said, ‘I’m going to get you a Mensch on a Bench. ’” After raising more than $22, 000 on Kickstarter, Mr. Hoffman produced his first run of Mensch on a Bench dolls for the next holiday season, and he has been selling them ever since. They come with a storybook that situates the bearded character, who wears a black hat and a Jewish prayer shawl, in the Hanukkah story: He watches over the oil in the Maccabees’ temple to ensure it burns for eight days. “Elf on a Shelf is a great product,” Mr. Hoffman said. “But they just left the Jewish market sitting there saying: ‘What about us? What about our kids? ’” That first year, 2013, sales of Mensch on a Bench, which retails for $30, reached about $100, 000, mostly through Mr. Hoffman’s own website. In 2014, Bed Bath  Beyond picked up the product and Mr. Hoffman appeared on “Shark Tank,” and sales climbed to $900, 000. Revenues were $800, 000 last year and will be about the same this year  —   which suits Mr. Hoffman, who works out of his home and enjoys the lifestyle of a niche product entrepreneur. “We pull in a   profit, I get to do something I love, and I work maybe 20 hours a week during most of the year,” said Mr. Hoffman, who this season introduced a plush talking toy, Ask Bubbe. Amy Kritzer, who with her brother Andrew owns Modern Tribe, an online Judaica store with an offbeat edge, said that Hanukkah accounted for about 40 percent of annual revenue. Popular this year is the Emoji Menorah from Rite Lite ($30) with each candle base wearing a different expression, and the Jewdolph Knit Koozie ($12) a bottle sleeve with a   reindeer whose antlers form a menorah, from Freakers. Also on the website is the Yamaclaus, a fluffy    Santa Claus hat in the shape of a yarmulke. Alan Masarsky started Yamaclaus with his boyfriend, Larik Malish. Both grew up in interfaith homes, and both were fans of the 2003 episode of “The OC” that popularized the term “Chrismukkah,” a portmanteau for a merged Christmas and Hanukkah celebration. On the episode, characters wore what they called a yamaclaus. The couple had no inkling of starting a business when, in 2011, they hosted a holiday party and made their guests a crude version of the beanies out of red construction paper and cotton balls. They were a hit, so they checked to see if the trademark for Yamaclaus was available (it was) and if they could raise $2, 500 on Kickstarter to start production (they did). In 2013, Yamaclaus ($11) began selling on the company’s website, which today accounts for about 70 percent of sales. Mr. Masarsky, a marketing manager at Facebook who lives in San Francisco, said    sales had increased 200 percent this year, as it had the previous two, but declined to provide more financial details. Yamaclaus wearers who post photos on social media tend to be in nonreligious settings. “Tons of our customers wear them when they’re lighting a menorah,” Mr. Masarsky said. “But not at shul  —   not at a synagogue. ” Michael Krasny, author of “Let There Be Laughter,” a book about Jewish humor, said many jokes make light of Jews’ “anxiety of being assimilated and turning into Christians. ” Products that intertwine Christian and Jewish culture may be a positive force, he said. “They can have it both ways,” Mr. Krasny said. “We can call it an homage to Christians at the same time as it’s bringing to the fore something that’s associated with Jewishness. ” Interfaith households are on the rise. From 2005 to 2013, 58 percent of Jews who wed married gentiles (usually Christians) compared with 35 percent who did so from 1970 to 1974, according to the Pew Research Center. Morri Chowaiki grew up in a Jewish home his wife, Marina, grew up in an interfaith one. “She always wanted a Christmas tree, and I was like, no way,” said Mr. Chowaiki, who in 2005, after they were married about a decade, relented. “I said, ‘All right, just don’t go crazy  —   if I walk into the front room and there’s a nativity scene there, I might have a little issue with it. ’” Ms. Chowaiki bought and decorated a tree, then unveiled it. And her husband was impressed  —   it was festooned with dreidels and blue and silver ornaments. But at the top of the tree: a   star. “I laughed and said, ‘You couldn’t at least find a Jewish star to put at the top of the tree? ’” Mr. Chowaiki said. She told him she had looked  —   and found nothing. By 2009, he had designed and trademarked one, the Hanukkah Tree Topper, and sold about 2, 000. By 2013, the product had been picked up by retailers including Bed Bath  Beyond and SkyMall and sold 35, 000 units  —   and earned Mr. Chowaiki a spot on “Shark Tank. ” On that episode, Daymond John, the investor who founded FUBU, purchased a 35 percent stake in the business for $50, 000, and Mr. Chowaiki agreed to license out the product to Kurt S. Adler, a wholesaler that specializes in holiday items. There are now several versions of the product available online, starting at about $12. Once the tree topper was licensed, Mr. Chowaiki ceased to be involved in    operations. And in April, Mr. John hired him to head the sales and retail division of his company, the Shark Group. The Menorah Tree grew out of a similar marital dynamic: Michael Patchen, who is Jewish, wanted something festive to suit his wife, Jenny, who is half Catholic and half Jewish. In 2006, Mr. Patchen and his brother, Alex, made a menorah out of wood and artificial pine garland, decorated it with ornaments and lights, and surprised her with it. Now they sell a metal version that is seven feet high, assembles like an artificial tree and sells for $295 on their website. They’ve sold in the “low to  ” since introducing the product in 2013, said Alex Patchen, who declined to be more specific. In 2012, David Daily had an idea for how to make the Hanukkah party he and his wife were hosting in Austin, Tex. memorable: a menorah bong. Mr. Daily, who owns Grav Labs, a glass bong and pipe manufacturer in Austin with annual sales of $12 million, made the bong himself. It was about two feet long and had eight bowls with stems that could hold candles. “I definitely had a Jewish experience growing up of enjoying cannabis with all my cousins,” Mr. Daily said. “And this menorah bong obviously is meant to be shared. ” Their guests were, in every sense, bowled over, but Mr. Daily never planned on marketing the menorah bong. It sat on a shelf in his home for a couple of years. Then an online head shop, 420 Science, borrowed it and made a video of it in action. It garnered about two million views on Facebook and YouTube and has been shared on social media about 100, 000 times. Grav recently produced 100 menorah bongs. At 14 inches, they are less cumbersome than the original. They cost $700 from retailers including 420 Science. But Dr. Dreidel may not be widely available until next Hanukkah. Hannah Rothstein, a conceptual artist, conceived of the dreidel in 2014 and has made fewer than a hundred of the wooden tops on a commission basis, charging $150. The dreidel features images of Dr. Dre, the rapper and record producer, and a   version will retail for about $40  —   barring complications. “I have not gotten any    letters from Dr. Dre’s lawyers,” Ms. Rothstein said. “And if he wants to go in on the idea, we could make a million together. ” Next year she also hopes to produce a Hanukkah homage to Macklemore, another   artist: the  .",0

8288,Doctors Cover-Up 5-Month-Old’s Death After Given 8 Simultaneous Vaccinations,"by Augustina Ursino 
Matthew Gage Downing-Powers passed away on October 9, 2013. He was 5 ½ months old and died less than 2 days after receiving 8 vaccines. After Matthew’s lifeless body was taken to the hospital, his parents were kept from seeing him, to say their good-byes. A month and a half later, he was returned cremated. Then Matthew’s parents were denied a copy of his autopsy report. 
Matthew’s mother, Crystal Downing-Powers, found a vaccine injury attorney to help her file a vaccine injury claim. This vaccine injury attorney was handling this case for six months and then one day, he sent Crystal a letter in the mail saying he didn’t have enough evidence regarding the death of Matthew, so he was dropping them. That was it. There was no further correspondence from him. 
With no progression on their case, Matthew’s parents were further shattered. They were unsure of what to do next, because the deadline to file a vaccine injury claim is two years after a parent loses their baby to vaccines. This left them with barely any time to find another vaccine injury attorney to help them. 
Crystal was distraught and in tears, feeling more helpless than ever at this point. The VacTruth team immediately helped her find another vaccine injury attorney. It is very difficult for any vaccine injury attorney to win a vaccine injury case, involving a child who died after being vaccinated. Nearly seventy percent of vaccine injury claims get denied. It takes a lot of time to fight these cases and some attorneys just aren’t willing to put in the time or effort. Others just don’t have the experience. 
Thankfully, this new attorney has been fully supportive and understanding of the situation and is willing to fight for Matthew’s family. Crystal was thankful that her new attorney filed their claim in September 2015, less than one month before the deadline. He also submitted a request to receive Matthew’s autopsy report, being denied to his parents. Weeks continued to pass after the request was put in. 
In January 2016, Matthew’s autopsy report was finally provided in full to the lawyer, detailing the vaccines Matthew received prior to his death, the time he was vaccinated and the time he passed away. 
Matthew’s death was ruled UNDETERMINED. 
Crystal was thankful the autopsy report was finally available but had no words to describe the pain this has caused them and the frustration of having to wait more than two years and three months to get a copy of their son’s autopsy report. 
When her lawyer viewed the report, he mentioned of the many autopsy reports he has reviewed, viewing Matthew’s was one of the most difficult to look at. Even he felt it would be too much for Crystal to look at, or for anyone to look at. The images of her son in that report remain unseen by Crystal to this day. 
After losing her son, Crystal wants us to know she is optimistic they will win their case. Once they do win, she wants to go as far as she can go, to open people’s eyes! She has seen 13 babies die in the past year from vaccines, even though the vaccines are denied as the cause of death, parents know the truth. This breaks her heart to see this and makes her relive the worst nightmare in her own life. 
Crystal wants people to know that these innocent children dying from vaccines needs to stop and if she has to be that person to stop this, then she will be. 
Crystal has since given birth to their rainbow baby Wyatt. This term represents a baby born after a baby lost. Wyatt is an extremely healthy child. She has witnessed first-hand, like many parents before her, how he is the healthiest child of hers, because he is unvaccinated. 
Crystal reminds us that none of their children will ever receive any further vaccines and she has filed vaccine exemptions for them in California. She is also disgusted that SB277 passed, after what happened to her son. It became clearer to her that these politicians don’t care about people’s health, because when the vaccines harm, the injured get ignored. 
Matthew’s parents always feel a part of them missing. Their precious gift of life is dead now because of poisonous injections that didn’t protect him from any disease. 
We are outraged at what is happening to families and at those who are in a position to do something, to change things, but continue to do nothing to help the vaccine-injured community and to prevent these tragedies from continuing. 
We are incredibly sorry for Matthew’s loss. His parents live each day with so much pain, knowing the vaccines took the life of their fourth son. Matthew’s brothers suffer each day too, they miss their brother tremendously. 
Matthew would be turning 3 years old today. 
We hope you never forget him and what his short life has taught us. 
Original Publication: February 26, 2015 
Parents in California are distraught after losing their infant son after being vaccinated. He died in his sleep and was taken to the hospital already deceased. Hospital staff ruled his death as sudden infant death syndrome. The couple was told an autopsy was required to be performed on their son. 
After returning home, waiting to get an update, they never received one. Numerous phone calls were made to get answers. Weeks went by. Finally, they received verbal confirmation and told their son was best not to be seen prior to being cremated, because of the condition he was in. Once cremated, they could pick up the remains of their child from the crematory. They were not given the chance to say their goodbyes. 
More than one year and four months have passed and the family has yet to receive his autopsy report. It turns out their son was given a vaccine not approved for his age and an extra dose of the hepatitis B vaccine that he shouldn’t have received until later on. 
This harrowing story is a reminder that vaccines can be lethal. Parents shall maintain the rights to choose what medical interventions they feel are safe for their child. After all, they are the ones who have to live with the consequences. 
Crystal Downing shares with us what happened to her son Matthew, in hopes to remind parents to research vaccines before offering their child to be injected with whatever the doctor says. 
One Less Baby Boy 
“Our sweet little fussy bear Matthew Gage Downing-Powers was born healthy on April 26, 2013. In the hospital, he was given the Hepatitis B vaccine after birth. That’s what they do here in the United States and what the CDC recommends newborns receive, following the current schedule. His reactions to the shot were deemed normal and I have older children that have been fully vaccinated, so I was aware of what to expect. 
I took Matthew in for his 2 month well baby checkup on July 2, 2013. During this appointment, he was given 8 vaccines for DTaP (3 in 1), Polio, Hib, Hep B, Pneumococcal PCV and the oral Rotavirus vaccine. Then I was late getting him to his 4 month checkup. I brought him as soon as I was able. 
On Monday October 7, 2013, when Matthew was 5 ½ month’s old, I brought him in for his 4 month delayed visit. The doctor said they could get him caught up on his shots. I thought ok, you can do that. Matthew received 8 vaccines, DTaP, Polio, Hib, Pneumococcal, Hep B and Hep A. These would be the last vaccines he would ever receive. 
After the shots, he didn’t have a fever or a low grade one. We didn’t give him Tylenol. He was just grumpy and crying some. We checked him every hour. His temperature stayed normal but he wasn’t his happy go lucky self. All my kids got grumpy after their shots. 
I didn’t call the doctor on Tuesday. I knew these were typical behaviors after the kids received the vaccines. He is my 4th son. We had our other 3 vaccinated and knew what to expect. 
I thought I would give it another day to see if he was still grumpy but we didn’t get to the next day. Matthew was gone by then. He was found lifeless. He went to bed that Tuesday night and my husband found him Wednesday morning. 
My husband Zack and I both performed CPR on our son and so did my dad and step mom. He had some light pinkish-brown tinged mucous coming from his nose and mouth. I wasn’t willing to believe he was gone. None of us were willing to give up on him. 
My husband called 911 but they were taking so long. I ran my baby to the hospital that was 2 blocks away. I took him to Needles hospital which is called Colorado River Medical Center in Needles, CA. The hospital also did CPR on him and said he died of SIDS, soon after I brought him in. He had been gone for hours they said. They told me he passed sometime between 11 PM (after he was put to bed) and 7 AM Wednesday morning (shortly before he was found). 
My life has been full of heartache since we lost our baby. That was the worst day of my life, seeing my son that way but still believing he would come back to me. 
Hospital staff said I would be under investigation and it was California law when a baby passes, to undergo an autopsy. From the hospital in Needles, Matthew was transferred from that hospital to the coroner’s office, in San Bernardino, CA. We had chosen to have Matthew cremated at a funeral home in San Bernardino. 
After leaving Matthew at the hospital, we were told to go home and wait for an update when the autopsy would be done. We planned to see him at the funeral home we picked out, after deciding we would have him cremated. I was told I’d be informed when the autopsy was to be done and when it would be completed and that I could view him before being cremated. 
I didn’t write down the names of the staff members I left my son with. I didn’t think of that when it happened. But I should have. No one called me to inform me what was going on. I called numerous times and kept getting the runaround. Absolutely no one would give me answers. 
Weeks went by before I received a call back. By this time, I was informed Matthew was not in a condition I’d want to remember him in. I felt helpless and convinced I should sign a paper letting them cremate him. Prior to this, the funeral home confirmed the remains were Matthew’s. They asked me what urn I would like and then confirmed it was him. I also sent a picture of him, to make sure. 
Matthew didn’t get brought back to our home in Needles, California until November 20, 2013. A month and a half after he passed away. 
I don’t think they cremated him before telling me but part of me feels they did, to cover up his death. I will never know but my instincts tell me something was being hidden. I think the funeral home did a nice job, they were very patient with me, they understood why I kept calling them so many times, to see if somebody there could tell me what happened to my son’s body. 
I didn’t know where my sons body was. I didn’t know what was going on at the coroner’s office. I was never notified whatsoever and to be honest, I was really flipping out. I wanted to know what was going on with my baby and what answers did they have for me so far. 
The coroner was informed of the vaccines Matthew had just received. I had even asked the coroner if it was possible the vaccines killed my son. The coroner straight lied to my face, or more, over the phone, saying that no, it was not the vaccinations that killed him. 
There was only one time they contacted me and that was over how many people had done CPR on him. And that was the last time I heard from them. 
I did contact him after we had received his death certificate saying pending investigation still and I asked if they had finished with his autopsy report. They told me no. I called once more and they told me that they couldn’t give me anymore information and that I would have to call the coroner’s office here in Needles, California. I have done that and still no answer, no nothing. 
The coroner said it wasn’t my fault and sometimes this just happens. I couldn’t believe what I was just told. 
It took me a long time to speak up and share my story because of this pain. I decided to come forward because I don’t want Matthew to die in vain because of vaccine manufacturers not doing a better job making safer vaccines, before pushing them onto unsuspecting parents and their innocent babies they view as profitable beings. 
Why are infants getting so many at one time? Has it been proven it’s safe to give these kids all the vaccines they are shooting them up with during these well baby checkups? From what I’ve learned since all of this, the answer is no. 
Later, I learned two of the vaccines given at his last appointment, should not have been given to him. Babies are not supposed to be given the Hepatitis A vaccine until at least 1 year of age and this was given to Matthew at 5 1/2 months old. 
I also learned he was given the third dose of Hepatitis B too soon. Matthew wasn’t supposed to get that until his next visit during the 6 month checkup which would’ve also been delayed to space out the shots, because we were late getting him the 4 month vaccines. 
I think it was right after the funeral I learned that they had given him the Hep A vaccine too soon. When I had learned this, it killed me. I started blaming my self and still do because I never took the time to know what vaccines were supposed be given to a child, at what month, how many doses, etc. 
I felt because I didn’t do the research until after Matthew died, I was foolish and this was somehow my fault. I felt in some way this was my fault because I was late on his vaccinations. My thoughts were if I would’ve followed the CDC’s schedule and not been late to that 4 month check up, he probably would not have gotten the wrong vaccines. Now he’s gone. 
I do understand he could’ve been taken sooner even if the correct vaccines were given on the schedule. It’s just something I live with. 
It’s been over a year and four months since Matthew passed on October 9, 2013 and I still haven’t gotten the autopsy report that I told them I wanted a copy of. I keep getting the run around! 
I went to the doctor’s office recently and found out the nurse that injected Matthew is no longer working there. I was told she got fired because she didn’t know what she was doing when giving vaccines. 
I said to the office if it turns out his death was because of her ignorance, I will be going after them all. My son shouldn’t have died because you guys were too lazy to train her to give vaccines properly. They didn’t even apologize to me. I’m just beyond angry at this point. I can’t wait to get my answers. 
They said my baby is the only one who had passed away since she started working, until the end of her working. Who knows if that is true? There could’ve been more lives taken and they wouldn’t admit it. 
I want to tell other parents, they say vaccinations are safe, but in reality, they aren’t. 
Ask questions and know which vaccines they plan to give to your baby. Know the risks associated with all of the vaccines they plan to give during the checkup. And remember, it’s your choice. It’s your child. And whatever you do, don’t let them mix the vaccines into one needle or give them so many at once because if you don’t think this won’t harm your child, then look at the child I lost. It is possible. 
Matthew was given DTaP, IPV, Hib, PCV, Hep B and Hep A in 3 shots, one in his right arm and two in his left leg. 
Now I’m pregnant with my 5th child. I have to stay strong. I have too. I have to remain less stressed for my family and during my pregnancy. I have 3 boys, a hubby and soon my rainbow baby, all counting on me, to hold this family together. 
In all honesty though, sometimes I feel so overwhelmed because I miss Matthew so much and people are so unaware how often vaccines take the lives of infants. I’m beyond angry that this has happened to my baby. And scared it can happen again with the kids I do have. And that I’ll be forced to vaccinate this unborn baby. 
A bill was currently put forth by our California state politicians to take away my right to exempt my children from further vaccines due to personal beliefs. If this passes, this would take my parental right away, to choose vaccinating my children in the future. What they should do is create a new exemption for parents to file that took one for the team! We should be able to opt out for that reason alone. 
Was it not enough Matthew was taken? He should be honored by these people but instead, they deny his existence by pushing bills that slap parents in the face that have lost their child to vaccines or to those parents with vaccine injured children. Maybe if they would make safer vaccines, more would want to get them. 
My son was injected with 8 vaccines, if you don’t know what is in them, learn! When I did, I was shocked and mad at myself for not questioning this before. Matthew is the reason I opened my eyes, to see what vaccines can really do to a baby, let alone anyone. I’m not the only one who believes vaccines are not what they claim they are. I really hope this opens parent’s eyes who do vaccinate their children. 
My older son is having a hard time, my second son said he is afraid of the shots now and my third son is 3 years old, he just knows his baby brother is gone. As for my hubby, he keeps it in, so it’s kind of hard to know what he is feeling. 
To this day, I still haven’t received his autopsy report. They keep giving me the run around. So the investigation is still pending. I have filed a report with the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS). I’ve learned they sometimes don’t follow up with parents, which prevents them from reporting a reaction. Until I receive an autopsy report, it makes it difficult to file a claim with the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP). I feel they are stalling us because the time frame to file when you lose a child to vaccines is 2 years, it’s going on a 1 ½ years for us. We won’t give up. My son should still be here. 
His shot records don’t lie! They shouldn’t cover up these reactions to vaccines these kids suffer from. They should not stifle parents from pursuing the already time consuming and deterring recourse they’ve set up, talking about the vaccine injury compensation program. 
Since I looked into this more, I’ve learned how common it is for babies to die right after getting vaccinated. I just want it to be known that this can happen and I hope mothers ask questions first, before handing their child over to get shot up. How many of us moms helped hold our own child down, to keep them restrained while being vaccinated, knowing we helped them hurt our own? 
Matthew’s death was a high price to pay in the name of preventing any of these diseases my kid would’ve been fine dealing with. 
I didn’t believe a few people who told me this can happen, but it did. And now I have to live with that for the rest of my life, knowing I should have asked questions and researched first, before blindly agreeing to them injecting or giving him anything. I didn’t research. I didn’t question what vaccines were given to all of my children. I had no reason to distrust doctors, until now. Since this happened to Matthew, my eyes are wide open now. Now I’m not afraid to question everything that is done to my children. 
It’s a parent’s decision to make, to vaccinate their child or not. Parents need to research both sides, for and against. Then make their decision on the matter. My dad told me I didn’t get sick till after I started school and had to have those required vaccines. After that, my dad never vaccinated me again. My dad said it a few times before all of this happened, but I didn’t pay attention. I wish I had listened to him. 
I just let the doctors and nurses do what they said was needed. No questions asked. I thought they would tell me if there were severe risks involved. Nobody told me anything like that. I trusted them with my child’s life and would’ve liked to have known that death from vaccination is an associated risk. Why didn’t the doctors or nurse tell me this? I really wished I researched and asked questions instead of just trusting the system and doctors. And now because I didn’t, my child is gone. 
There are a lot more parents out there like me. Some don’t come forward due to fact they are afraid of what people would say. Sometimes people can be really cruel and not understand what parents like me go through. 
I just want his story to be told. My hubby and I say thank you to everyone lending their support. We are so blessed to have the short time we had with our little fussy bear. I hope sharing this will help mothers know it can happen. 
I want it well known I’m not telling parents not to vaccinate their child. I’m simply saying to research before you vaccinate. Learn if you choose to vaccinate, then that is your choice, not someone else’s to make because you will be stuck with the consequences. 
Don’t disrespect parents like me, who have lost their child to vaccines. And don’t disrespect parents of living vaccine injured children. Our rights to choose these medical interventions need to be preserved. It is beyond disturbing that bought politicians think they can choose what gets injected into our children. They don’t care about your child’s health. Clearly many are dying and getting injured from these vaccines and they turn a blind eye. That should tell you something. 
I miss my baby so much. A huge part of me was taken when he was. I cannot let this happen again. I cannot put my other children at risk of being vaccine injured any longer. 
Matthew took one for the team and his life didn’t matter to those wanting to strip my rights to opt out of further vaccinating. Why does he not matter? Why do mild cases involving the measles get reported all over the news, but not babies dying after getting the MMR shot or other vaccinations? Why don’t the vaccine injured children matter? 
We miss and love you so much Matthew. You are always thought of every day. You are always in my heart and I will never stop loving you. 
Love Your Momma,",0
8289,House Passes Bill Allowing 9/11 Lawsuits Against Saudi Arabia White House Hints at Veto - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The House on Friday approved a bill to allow families of those killed in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to sue Saudi Arabia for any role in the terrorist plot, setting up a rare bipartisan showdown with the White House. The measure was never debated on the House or Senate floors. It reflects a growing desire to   Washington’s alliance with the kingdom, which for decades has been a cornerstone of American foreign policy in the Middle East. Other measures, like a bipartisan one that would seek to block the sale of some tanks to the kingdom, are also on the horizon. But President Obama says he is strongly opposed to the measure, and the White House has signaled that he would veto it. Lawmakers felt intense pressure from families of the victims of the attacks, who wanted the legislation passed before the 15th anniversary of   on Sunday. That may account for the bill jumping from a committee room to an expedited vote on the House floor. “The families have been asking for this for over a decade,” said Terry Strada, whose husband, Thomas S. Strada, was killed in the attack on the World Trade Center towers. She has long lobbied Congress on the issue. “We don’t feel this is   in any way, shape or form,” she said. Mr. Obama has voiced opposition to the effort for months, fearing that it could expose the United States to lawsuits by people in other countries. A White House official said this week that the administration’s position has not changed even after some changes were made to the bill to mollify critics. The bill “is a politically   way for Congress to send a signal of seeming seriousness about terrorism on the dawn of the 15th anniversary of ” said Jack Goldsmith, a professor of law at Harvard who served in the Department of Justice under President George W. Bush. “Congress itself could have investigated lingering questions about   but instead is delegating those tasks to the unelected judiciary. The costs of the law will be borne by courts, which are an awkward place to ascertain Saudi responsibility for   and especially the president, who will have to deal with the diplomatic fallout with Saudi Arabia and other nations. ” The bill addresses a 1976 law that gives other countries broad immunity from American lawsuits. It amends the law to allow for nations to be sued in federal courts if they are found to have played any role in terrorist attacks that killed Americans on home soil. It also allows Americans to direct financial claims against those who funded the attacks. The administration has argued that it would put Americans at legal risk overseas. That position seemed at least somewhat validated when Pierre Lellouche, a member of the French Parliament who is chairman of the rough equivalent in France of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he would pursue legislation that would permit French citizens to sue the United States with cause. “I have sympathy with the notion of hitting those countries which actively support terrorism,” Mr. Lellouche said Friday. But the American bill “will cause a legal revolution in international law with major political consequences. ” The Saudi government, which has denied any involvement in the Sept. 11 attacks, has warned that it might liquidate hundreds of billions of dollars worth of American assets if the bill becomes law, which many experts believe to be a false threat. The bill was pushed by a bipartisan coalition in the House and Senate led by members from New York who have long felt the powerful and enduring passions of families who lost loved ones in the attacks. “Anyone who facilitates a terrorist attack on our people should be brought to justice,” said Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, who was a lead Democratic sponsor of the bill in the House. Several Republicans moved to block the bill in the Senate, but it ultimately sailed through by unanimous consent. In the House, there seemed little appetite for the bill this spring, when it landed in the House Judiciary Committee, but was then suddenly pushed to the House floor without any debates. In May, after visiting Saudi Arabia, Speaker Paul D. Ryan warned that Congress ought to make sure “we’re not making mistakes with our allies. ” The Obama administration had counted on a firewall in the House against the bill. But Mr. Ryan was recently in New York where he saw many   families who pressed him to move forward. To make the bill more palatable to critics, lawmakers added a provision that would allow the executive branch to halt the litigation if it proves in court that its members were engaged in   settlement negotiation with a nation, preserving the executive branch’s purview over foreign policy while still giving a pathway for family members to sue. Mr. Goldsmith said this was inadequate, noting that “a circumstance that may be hard to satisfy in important cases, especially concerning the   claims against Saudi Arabia. ” Based on the vote totals in the House and Senate, Congress has enough votes to override a veto should Mr. Obama issue one. But it is possible that members may have second thoughts, under pressure from the administration and foreign governments may be persuaded to change positions. “We were able to get some changes to make it less damaging to potential dangers over time,” said Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. “We as a nation have got more to lose on sovereignty issues than any other nation in the world. If the White House actually vetoes this, I think there will be whole levels of discussion. ” Still, many members of Congress expressed continued support this week for the bill. “Unanimous passage of this bill, I believe, sends an unmistakable message that we will combat terrorism with every tool we have,” said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas. “And just as importantly, we will make sure that simple justice is available to the victims of terrorist attacks on our soil by not erecting any unnecessary roadblocks to their pursuit of justice in the courts of law. ”",0
8290,"Theresa May, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton: Your Wednesday Evening Briefing - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Mourners lined the streets and police cars filled church parking lots as funerals were held for some of the five Dallas officers killed by a sniper last week. President Obama gathered law enforcement officials, civil rights activists and political figures at the White House and spoke about building trust between law enforcement and communities of color. Our latest poll shows that almost 70 percent of Americans say race relations are generally bad, an extraordinarily high level of racial discontent. _____ 2. Hillary Clinton portrayed Donald Trump as an existential threat to American democracy in a speech in Illinois, and mocked him for egotism and ignorance. She also addressed police violence and attacks on the police, invoking Abraham Lincoln, who in the same spot in 1858 proclaimed that “a house divided against itself cannot stand. ” With enough work for unity, she said, “We, in fact, will be indivisible  —   with liberty and justice for all. ” _____ 3. Mr. Trump, who is in the final stages of choosing a running mate, met with several candidates in Indiana, after his plane broke down. He also called for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to resign from the Supreme Court. “Her mind is shot,” he tweeted after she publicly disparaged him twice. Separately, our political reporter interviewed dozens of people, including Trump supporters, white nationalists and scholars of race, to understand how Mr. Trump fosters a sense of white identity. “Everyone’s sticking together in their groups,” explained a Long Island housewife, “so white people have to, too. ” _____ 4. “We face a time of great national change,” Britain’s new prime minister, Theresa May, said. It was an understatement, given the country’s internal ruptures and profound uncertainty over the vote to leave the European Union. She appointed Boris Johnson, the provocative former London mayor and Brexit leader, as foreign secretary, naming his predecessor, Philip Hammond, as chancellor of the Exchequer. _____ 5. Ringling Bros. bowing to   concerns, is debuting its new   circus in Los Angeles. Its   show, “Out of This World,” offers some old standbys, like aerialists, a lion tamer and acrobats on horseback, but adds an ice floor, an elaborate narrative and a smartphone app. There are still plenty of animals: tigers, dogs, pigs and even a kangaroo. _____ 6. Police officers flooded a gritty patch of Brooklyn, N. Y. a day after 33 people suffered what appeared to be overdoses of synthetic marijuana known as   or Spice. “It’s like a scene out of a zombie movie, a horrible scene,” said a man who saw three people collapse. Mayor Bill de Blasio said any stores found selling the drug would be shut down, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo compared its prevalence to the crack epidemic. _____ 7. The renowned portraitist Chuck Close, 76, has radically upended his style and his life, leaving his wife and worrying his children. In one of our   stories today, a man who has known the artist for years grapples with the metamorphosis. “He was producing startling new work that I wanted to understand,” the author writes, “but it seemed to emerge from a spirit of liberation that left a path of devastation behind. ” _____ 8. The U. N. Security Council met to decide whether to send more troops to South Sudan, where a devastating civil war has entered its third year. The U. N. peacekeepers have struggled with the mandate to protect civilians, coming under harsh criticism for failing to prevent an ethnic massacre at this U. N. camp in  . _____ 9. The Federal Election Commission fined three nonprofit groups for activities in 2010, when they were linked to the political network overseen by the wealthy, conservative Koch brothers. The groups agreed to pay more than $200, 000 in fines, but did not concede that accepting guidance from a Koch consultant had led to violations of federal rules. _____ 10. Finally, Boston is a city lacking tall major landmarks. No Statue of Liberty, no Space Needle. So this Citgo sign is, for many Bostonians, their icon.

8291,Security Council Backs António Guterres to Be Next U.N. Secretary General - The New York Times,"UNITED NATIONS  —   The United Nations Security Council reached a surprisingly swift consensus Wednesday on its choice for the next secretary general of the United Nations: António Guterres, a former prime minister of Portugal. Mr. Guterres, 67, who ran the United Nations refugee agency for 10 years, had been the clear   for the last several months. That a deeply divided Security Council rallied around him was a clear signal that Russia and the West saw him as someone they could work with. Thirteen candidates, including a record seven women, had vied for the job two had dropped out. “We have a clear favorite, and his name is António Guterres,” said Vitaly I. Churkin, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations, who is presiding over the Security Council this month. Mr. Churkin made the announcement outside the Council’s chamber on Wednesday, flanked by his American counterpart, Samantha Power, in an unusual display of cooperation. The envoys of all the other members of the Council were also there, looking as if they, too, were surprised by their unity. “In the end, there was a candidate whose experience, vision and versatility across a range of areas proved compelling, and it was remarkably uncontentious, uncontroversial,” Ms. Power said. “And I think it speaks to the fact that each of us represents our nation and each of us know how fundamentally important this position is in terms of the welfare of our own citizens. “Every day we go into Security Council, we aspire for the kind of unity we saw today,” she added. “And on a crisis with carnage as horrific as that in Syria, the urgency of achieving that unity is no secret to anyone. And it’s not something we’ve achieved up to this point. ” Mr. Guterres will face a formal Council vote on Thursday morning and will then have his name submitted to the   General Assembly for approval, which will most likely happen next week. If elected, he will succeed the current secretary general, Ban   whose second   term expires at the end of this year. The United Nations is faltering in carrying out its chief mandate, to stop the scourge of war, and is confronting a widening rift between Russia and the West. Mr. Guterres was in Portugal when the announcement was made. The Portuguese mission to the United Nations said he would comment publicly only after Thursday’s formal vote. The choice of Mr. Guterres dashed the hopes of many diplomats and   activists that the United Nations would be led by a woman for the first time in its   history. One of the women contending for the job, Christiana Figueres of Costa Rica, said on Twitter that the results were bittersweet: “Bitter: not a woman. Sweet: by far the best man in the race. Congrats Antonio Guterres!” Mr. Guterres has promised gender parity in senior posts within the organization, but beyond that, what he will do to advance the rights of women through the work of the United Nations remains to be seen. Antonia Kirkland, program manager for Equality Now, an advocacy group, said that while it was “disappointing” that a man would run the body again, “we are at least hopeful that he will continue the feminist agenda, including, first of all, ensuring gender parity among his staff at the Secretariat, and also prioritizing violence and discrimination against women as a pivotal issue. ” Trained as a theoretical physicist, Mr. Guterres is a veteran politician and a member of his country’s Socialist Party. His first major diplomatic test will be to rally Russia and whoever wins the presidency in the United States to address the carnage in Syria. He will also face a range of thorny conflicts elsewhere, from South Sudan to Yemen, and nuclear brinkmanship in North Korea. He will have to repair the United Nations’ reputation for peacekeeping, sullied by repeated accusations of sexual abuse, and show that the secretary general’s office can stand up to political pressure from rich and powerful countries. Michael W. Doyle, a former United Nations official who is now a Columbia University professor, said that as the high commissioner for refugees, Mr. Guterres had demonstrated both charisma and an ability to maneuver. “In the agency, he was known as someone who could sit down and hammer out agreements under difficult circumstances,” he said. “Moscow has to understand that. ” Mr. Guterres’s first order of business will be to fill plum posts, and there, he is likely to face   lobbying by the world powers. Russia had insisted that it was an Eastern European’s turn to be secretary general, so it remains to be seen how much it will push for its favored diplomats for key positions, including deputy secretary general and head of the United Nations’ political affairs division. The way the Council selects the world’s top civil servant has long been opaque, though frustration on the part of many countries and a campaign by   groups have allowed a bit of sunlight into the process. This year, for the first time, candidates faced hearings with members of the Security Council. Most of them took part in public debates and took questions from the news media. The Council had taken five informal polls over the last few months, but there was no way to distinguish how the five   permanent members had voted. On Wednesday, for the first time, the permanent five  —   Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States  —   voted on red ballots, and the others on white ballots. This was designed to show which candidates might face a veto. When the counting was finished, it was clear that Mr. Guterres would not.",0
8292,"Trump: First Saudi Meetings Will Bring Americans ’Jobs, Jobs, Jobs’ - Breitbart","President Donald Trump described the first day of his overseas trip in Saudi Arabia as “a tremendous day”  —   referring to billions in investments  —   in his first remarks at the top of one of several bilateral meetings. [Trump’s first remarks to reporters on Saturday included:  That was a tremendous day. I just want to thank everybody. But tremendous investments in to the United States, and our military community is very happy, and we want to thank you and Saudi Arabia. But hundreds of billions of dollars of investments into the United States and jobs, jobs, jobs. During a signing ceremony, the U. S. President signed a joint vision statement, private sector agreements, and defense cooperation agreements with Saudi Arabia. The defense agreements are worth $110 billion effective immediately and worth an additional $350 billion over ten years, according to a White House official. At one point during the day, the President’s Chief Economic Advisor Gary Cohn answered reporters’ questions as to what was being signed. He said that the signing was “to invest a lot of money in the U. S. and have a lot of U. S. companies invest and build things over here. ” He continued, “They’re going to hire U. S. companies   …     a bunch of infrastructure related things   …     A lot of money. Big dollars. Big dollars. ” Cohn told reporters that things were going “really well. ” During brief remarks to reporters at the top of a meeting between President Trump and the Deputy Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, Trump said, “It was a great day. ” Jared Kushner, Cohn, Stephen K. Bannon, and Dina Powell were also in the room. Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana ",0
8293,Michael Moore Wants A Spot in Hillary’s Cabinet,"Given the shameless, over-the-top, almost breathtakingly cloying pro-Hillary promotional hype that Michael Moore has been spouting recently (roughly, since mid-July), the only explanation is that this man—this pride of Flint, Michigan, this modest film documentarian who grew up middle-class but is now worth upwards of $50 million—secretly harbors a desire to play a role in a Hillary Clinton administration.
If not a Cabinet post, then something else. It’s more likely he has his eye on an ambassadorship. Maybe he covets being posted in a fun country, preferably a “resort country,” a country with a temperate climate and friendly people, a country where they speak English and don’t get all carried with civil unrest. The Honorable Michael Francis Moore, U.S. Ambassador to the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. You have to admit, it has a nice ring to it.
Don’t laugh. How do you think people get these ambassadorships? It’s never been about anything having to do with “qualifications.” Ambassadorships are handed out in return for loyal service, in return for an important political favor, in return for keeping a potential troublemaker quiet, and in return for helping to raise a shit-pot of campaign donations. It’s “quid pro quo” writ large.
Of course, when it comes to countries that might actually require a modicum of diplomatic ability, the administration has to be careful. You can’t just take someone off the street and make them ambassador to a place like Russia or China or Brazil, not if the U.S. wishes to maintain its credibility. But still, there are plenty of places in the world where you can pretty much dump anybody.
Take President Clinton’s administration, for example. In 1994, Bill Clinton rewarded congresswoman Maxine Waters for her long-time support, along with her role in securing African-American votes, by appointing her husband, Sidney Williams, to the post of U.S. Ambassador to the Bahamas. Prior to becoming an ambassador, Williams played football in the NFL, and ran a Cadillac dealership in Los Angeles. Life in Nassau was good.
Again: “Michael Francis Moore: U.S. Ambassador to the Commonwealth of the Bahamas” has a nice ring to it. If not the Bahamas, then how about Barbados? There’s whole array of places to pick from. Granted, picturing Moore in a silk top hat and coattails instead of his usual baseball cap and sweatshirt is a bit of a stretch, but with a little coaching, there’s no doubt he can pull it off. After all, isn’t that why people in these positions have “personal assistants”?
So best of luck to you, Michael. Let’s hope that when you or your “people” casually mention to Hillary that being an ambassador would be a cool job, she gets the hint. On the other hand, don’t count your chickens before they hatch (to coin a phrase). Because this is big-time politics, there will be a long list of people seeking the same job. Debbie Wasserman and Donna Brazile immediately come to mind.

8294,Obama Says He Told Putin: ‘Cut It Out’ on Hacking - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   President Obama said for the first time on Friday that he had held back from retaliating against Russia’s meddling in the presidential race for fear of inciting further hacking “that could hamper vote counting. ” But he said he was weighing a mix of public and covert actions against the Russians in his last 34 days in office, actions that would increase “the costs for them. ” Mr. Obama said he was committed to sending the Kremlin a message that “we can do stuff to you,” but without setting off an escalating cyberconflict. “There have been folks out there who suggest somehow if we went out there and made big announcements and thumped our chests about a bunch of stuff, that somehow it would potentially spook the Russians,” he said. “I think it doesn’t read the thought process in Russia very well. ” The president did not reveal what steps he was considering and suggested that some of the options, if they were carried out, could remain secret. “Some of it we will do in a way that they will know, but not everybody will,” he said. Mr. Obama made his comments at an annual    news conference. His remarks were tinged with melancholy at the impending end of his presidency, with foreboding about the changes that could follow   Donald J. Trump into office next month and with uneasiness about the role Russia played in the political upheaval that has resulted from his election. The president spoke hours after Hillary Clinton, addressing campaign donors in New York, bluntly accused President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia of orchestrating the hacks of her campaign and the Democratic National Committee computers “to undermine our democracy,” as part of a “personal beef against me. ” Mr. Obama declined to place the blame so squarely on Mr. Putin, though he noted, “Not much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin. ” Mr. Obama also sought to diminish the specter of Russian influence over the American political process, saying Russia was a smaller, weaker country that “doesn’t produce anything that anybody wants to buy, except oil and gas and arms. ” Still, the president was clearly wrestling with what he said the hacking affair and the reaction to it revealed about the state of American politics. Citing a recent poll that showed more than a third of Trump voters saying they approved of Mr. Putin  —   “Ronald Reagan would roll over in his grave,” Mr. Obama said  —   the president appealed to Americans not to allow partisan hatred and feuds to blind them to manipulation by foreign powers. “Unless that changes,” Mr. Obama said, “we’re going to continue to be vulnerable to foreign influence because we’ve lost track of what it is that we’re about and what we stand for. ” Mr. Obama offered a long list of accomplishments that he said marked his eight years in office. But the messy aftermath of Mr. Trump’s victory has raised questions about Mr. Obama’s   response to the hacking, ignited a nasty squabble between Mr. Trump and the nation’s intelligence agencies, and left a residue of suspicion over the vote itself. The president continued to defend his cautious approach to reports of hacking  —   an approach that has come under criticism from Democrats after it emerged last week that the intelligence agencies had concluded Russia was trying to help Mr. Trump win the election. “We were playing this thing straight  —   we weren’t trying to advantage one side or the other,” Mr. Obama said. “Imagine if we had done the opposite. It would have become one more political scrum. ” The president, however, is likely to face further questions after his C. I. A. director, John O. Brennan, issued a statement Friday disputing reports of a rift between the intelligence agencies and the C. I. A. over Russia’s motives in hacking the D. N. C. and handing over emails to WikiLeaks, which released them in the weeks leading up to the vote. In his statement, first reported by The Washington Post, Mr. Brennan said he had met with the director of the F. B. I. James B. Comey, and the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper, and “there is strong consensus among us on the scope, nature and intent of Russian interference in our presidential election. ” That statement will also challenge Mr. Trump, who has seized on reports of an interagency squabble to undermine the credibility of the hacking findings. He has criticized the C. I. A. analysis, saying it was supplied by the same agency that provided erroneous intelligence about Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction before the Iraq War. Mr. Obama held out hope that when Mr. Trump takes office, he would take a more sober approach. He said he had had “cordial” conversations with his successor, and that Mr. Trump had listened to his suggestions about “maintaining the effectiveness, integrity, cohesion of our office, our various democratic institutions,” though he was not specific. The president defended the F. B. I. which has come under fierce criticism from Mrs. Clinton and her aides because of Mr. Comey’s   announcement that the bureau was considering reopening its investigation of Mrs. Clinton’s email, which she has said cost her the election. Mrs. Clinton’s remarks on Thursday underscored longstanding differences she has had with her former boss in how the United States should view Mr. Putin. For his part, Mr. Obama also made a startling admission as he described how his administration had reacted to the Russian hack: He said it was not until the “beginning of the summer” that the White House was “alerted to the possibility that the D. N. C. has been hacked. ” That was nine months after an F. B. I. agent had first contacted the Democratic National Committee with evidence that a major,   hacking group was inside the committee’s networks, raising the question of why it took so long for that news to reach the president. Mr. Obama made it clear that he went out of his way to play down the news, because “in this hyperpartisan atmosphere” he did not think he or anyone else at the White House could talk about it without risking to appear to be acting on behalf of Mrs. Clinton. But the unintended result, as some of Obama aides concede, was that the Russians faced very little resistance. Not until September, when Mr. Obama pulled Mr. Putin aside at a Group of 20 meeting in Hanghzhou, China, was the Russian leader given a warning directly from the United States. Mr. Obama said he told him “to cut it out, there were going to be serious consequences if he did not. ” The president made it sound like that worked, saying “we did not see further tampering of the election process. ” But the leaks of D. N. C. emails, and those of John D. Podesta, the Clinton campaign manager, continued, because they were already in the hands of WikiLeaks, which doled them out to an eager news media until the last days of the campaign. The Russian government’s motives were hardly a mystery, Mr. Obama said, “because you guys wrote about it every day, every single leak about every little juicy piece of political gossip, including John Podesta’s risotto recipe. ”",0

8296,Russian Hackers Find Ready Bullhorns in the Media - The New York Times,"As the dust settles on Russian interference in the United States election, journalists are confronting an aspect that has received less scrutiny than the hacking itself but poses its own thorny questions: Moscow’s ability to steer Western media coverage by doling out hacked documents. Reporters have always relied on sources who provide critical information for   reasons. The duty, tricky but familiar, is to publicize information that serves the public interest without falling prey to the source’s agenda. But in this case, the source was Russia’s military intelligence agency, the G. R. U.  —   operating through shadowy fronts who worked to mask that fact  —   and its agenda was to undermine the American presidential election. By releasing documents that would tarnish Hillary Clinton and other American political figures, but whose news value compelled coverage, Moscow exploited the very openness that is the basis of a free press. Its tactics have evolved with each such operation, some of which are still unfolding. Thomas Rid, a professor of security studies at King’s College London who is tracking the Russian influence campaign, said it goes well beyond hacking: “It’s political engineering, social engineering on a strategic level. ” Great powers have long meddled in one another’s affairs. But Russia, throughout 2016, developed a previously unseen tactic: setting up fronts to seed into the press documents it had obtained by hacking. “Doing public relations work in order to get the hacked material out as an exclusive story with the Daily Caller or Gawker or the Smoking Gun, that is new,” Mr. Rid said. That public relations work was initially done by two web presences that appeared this summer, Guccifer 2. 0 and DCLeaks, each posing as   in the mold of Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks chief. Though neither acknowledged it, and the links were not immediately known, online security experts later concluded that both were Russian fronts. Guccifer 2. 0 claimed to be a Romanian ”freedom fighter” who had hacked the Democratic National Committee. Using Twitter’s private message service, the account conducted weekslong exchanges with journalists, pointing them to certain documents that had been hacked from the D. N. C. and other targets. “Whoever is doing this understands media. They understand the way that media works and how to manipulate media,” said Sheera Frenkel, a BuzzFeed News reporter who interacted with the fronts throughout the summer. DCLeaks, established separately and with its own sets of hacked documents, claimed to be “launched by the American hacktivists who respect and appreciate freedom of speech. ” The fronts sold the act by peppering their messages with slang and emojis. When Ms. Frenkel asked Guccifer whether it would release more D. N. C. documents, the reply came, “Yeah baby :)” Journalists who interacted with the accounts say their tone and facility with English varied widely, suggesting each was run by multiple users. A reporter with Motherboard, a technology site, quizzed Guccifer on the technical aspects of the hacking and on rudimentary Romanian. Guccifer failed both, lending credence to theories that it was a front. Those suspicions were initially restricted to security experts, trickling out only after firms such as ThreatConnect were able to unmask the fronts in detailed reports. In July, for instance, DCLeaks published emails belonging to retired Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove. The Intercept, a   site, covered the emails in a story that portrayed Mr. Breedlove as trying to foment hostility against Russia. The story did not note Russian links to the hack. Its lead author, Lee Fang, said he had no interactions with DCLeaks and pointed out that the group’s suspected Russian ties were not widely publicized at that time. Some reporters were offered documents exclusively, a familiar tactic of government press offices and public relations firms that want to shape coverage. In September, DCLeaks contacted Peter Hasson, a reporter at the Daily Caller, a   site, with an offer:   access to hacked emails belonging to Colin Powell, the former secretary of state. The Daily Caller’s story also did not note the growing belief that the documents had been hacked by Russia and leaked as part of an influence operation. Mr. Hasson said he was unaware of the alleged Russian links at the time. After awareness grew, the front organizations dropped the pretense. The newest group called itself Fancy Bears Hack Team  —   a breathtakingly overt reference to “fancy bear,” the name that some Western security groups use for G. R. U. hackers. Tom Cheshire, a reporter with the British network Sky News who has dealt with Fancy Bears, said they behaved “almost more like a P. R. firm, really” and were “very businesslike,” doling out scoops and trying to shape coverage. “It’s the sort of horse trading you do with all sorts of sources, really,” Mr. Cheshire said, hitting on a key to the operation’s impact: the way that it played within the bounds of established journalistic norms. Any leak by any source  —   Russian agent or citizen    —   poses a similar set of quandaries for reporters. Do you emphasize the hacking itself in your coverage, knowing that this will undercut the source’s agenda but could also be a disservice to readers by putting less focus on newsworthy information in the release? Do you withhold newsworthy documents, even only temporarily, to check their veracity and provenance? What if they have already been reported by other outlets that were shown the documents first? If they did turn out to be hacked as part of a hostile foreign operation, does that really make their contents less newsworthy? These are old questions for journalists, but they have taken on new urgency with the scale of Russia’s hackings and aims. Though the calculus of reporting on   leaks may be familiar, one aspect of the Russian operation stands out: the lengths to which the fronts go to mask their identities and motives. Because the internet gives any outlet the potential to reach millions, all it takes is one   leak to send the document flying across the web. Last year,   hackers infiltrated the United States   Agency, most likely in retaliation for accusations of   doping among Russia’s Olympic athletes. But Fancy Bears struggled to place the stolen documents with American or British outlets. Reporters who saw the files said their news value did not outweigh the risk of serving Russian interests. When Fancy Bears offered the files to The Associated Press, the reporters instead published a story on the   group itself. Fancy Bears ultimately persuaded sportswriters with Spiegel, a prominent German outlet, to report on emails that appeared to show American athletes requesting medical exceptions to take restricted drugs. The article noted a possible Russian link only in the final lines, alongside a quote from an American official arguing that the leak was intended to distract from   doping. If mainstream outlets pass on a hacking,   fronts can always pass the documents to peripheral outfits who will lend them less weight but can still send them across social media. That has often included the website InfoWars, which was founded by the   radio host Alex Jones and often publishes conspiracy theories. Guccifer 2. 0 approached Mikael Thalen, a writer for InfoWars, with D. N. C. documents that showed Democrats’ plans for attacking Paul Manafort, a campaign manager to Donald J. Trump who had worked on behalf of the   Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, a Kremlin ally. Mr. Thalen had come to believe, after many interactions with the front groups, that they “would reach out based on who would best carry the story the way they wanted it carried. ” He feared that Moscow was hoping InfoWars, by publishing the files, would muddy the water around accusations against Mr. Manafort, indirectly aiding Mr. Trump’s   campaign. Breaking with InfoWars’ usual reliance on such files, he declined to publish the documents. Because everyone has secrets, even if it’s only a few embarrassing personal emails, and because no network is impenetrable, skilled hackers can dig up compromising material on virtually any target. Democracies, which give privilege to competitive politics and free media, are particularly susceptible. “An open society is by choice more vulnerable than a closed society to some form of influence operation,” said Mr. Rid. “That is why we’re strong, but it’s also why we’re weak. ” The more that journalists and readers understand the motivations of foreign government leakers, he argued, the better they will be able to place those leaks in context, undercutting the hackers’ agenda without hiding newsworthy information. He compared this to a healthy body developing antibodies against a disease  —   foreign influence operations  —   that cannot be wholly immunized against while maintaining democratic openness. Still, some media trends  —   polarization, fake news, the   nature of social media  —   cut against those hopes. “This polarized election presented itself as a target of opportunity of the first order,” Mr. Rid said. Reporters may at times be hindered by a lack of transparency between media organizations, which are often highly competitive and prize speed and scoops. This has left reporters vulnerable because they cannot easily pool lessons on spotting foreign operations or, say, warn one another that a certain front is exaggerating the newsworthiness of its latest leak. “The more light shone on this, the more information you have when dealing with a source, the better decisions you’re going to make,” Mr. Cheshire said. Mr. Thalen, the InfoWars reporter, said he was increasingly turning down leaks that he knows his audience would read avidly and reward with acclaim, but that he considered exaggerated to advance Russian interests. Still, he was unsure it had made much difference. “A lot of people have swayed their reporting with their biases, and I didn’t want to do that,” he said. “People are believing what they want to be true. ”",0
8297,Helicopter Trip Becomes Another Stumble for Mayor de Blasio - The New York Times,"The grass of a baseball field in Prospect Park shuddered under the blades of a New York Police Department helicopter on Friday afternoon. Dust flew in the air. Soon, Mayor Bill de Blasio clambered aboard. In a car, it might have taken 30 minutes or longer for him to make the roughly   drive from his old Brooklyn stamping grounds to an event in Queens. By air, the trip  —   a fantasy of nearly every New Yorker ever caught in traffic on the   Expressway  —   was considerably shorter. But the headache it caused Mr. de Blasio on Monday might not have been worth the trip, as a photograph and a video of the copter incongruously parked in the middle of a city park ricocheted around the internet, and reporters waited outside City Hall to ask him about it. The attention to his flight presented a   situation for Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat who has been criticized for arriving late to events and now finds himself justifying his attempts to arrive on time. The mayor, like his predecessors, has occasionally availed himself of the Police Department’s helicopters to get to important events. Former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, an experienced helicopter pilot, did not hesitate to use city helicopters when necessary, or his own private helicopter. In 2012, Mr. Bloomberg, a political independent, was caught using a helipad in Midtown Manhattan for weekend jaunts during times when it was closed. Mr. de Blasio, for his part, has been less of a fan. Last year he told Grace Rauh of the news channel NY1 that riding in a helicopter was “not my thing. ” And in January, he announced a reduction in flights of tourist copters, citing “the nonstop din of helicopters” as a “major    issue for New Yorkers living near heavily trafficked routes. ” Eric F. Phillips, the mayor’s top spokesman, said Mr. de Blasio had flown to Rikers Island to Jacobi Medical Center, to be at the bedside of injured firefighters and to Hofstra University, for the first presidential debate last month between Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton, whose campaign Mr. de Blasio has ardently supported. He traveled by plane to campaign for her in Ohio on Saturday. In each case, Mr. Phillips said, the decision to go by helicopter was made by the mayor’s police detail. He described the flights as “infrequent,” and directed questions about the total number of trips to the Police Department, whose officials declined to provide the data, saying it would have to be requested under the state Freedom of Information Law. “The security and transportation of the mayor are determined by the N. Y. P. D.,” the department said in a statement attributed to John Miller, the deputy commissioner for counterterrorism and intelligence. “We do not discuss the specifics of security. ” Besides saying Mr. de Blasio had a “series of meetings,” City Hall officials would not describe the mayor’s preflight activities in Brooklyn, where he regularly travels to go to the gym and also goes for meetings at favorite restaurants in his old neighborhood. His public schedule listed a morning speech and two   radio appearances earlier in the day. “We don’t detail internal or personal meetings,” Mr. Phillips said, raising the possibility that Mr. de Blasio had been engaged in a personal errand that delayed him enough to necessitate air travel over the   Expressway. “He had a series of meetings in Brooklyn. ” Pressed as to whether the meetings were personal or city business, Mr. Phillips repeated himself: “I’m saying he had a series of meetings in Brooklyn, and I’m declining to make public the details of nonpublic meetings. ” Maggie Lehrman took video of the helicopter landing in Prospect Park just before 4:30 p. m. on Friday as she walked her    son in a stroller near 15th Street in Park Slope. “I’ve never seen that before in Prospect Park I’ve lived in Park Slope for a long time,” she said. “I don’t want to judge too harshly. It was definitely unusual. It seemed a little odd. ” The mayor took the helicopter and landed in another city green space, Hunters Point South Park, in Long Island City, Queens, before traveling to a training center in the area for a 6:30 p. m. event hosted by the Joint Industry Board of the Electrical Industry. The administration’s explanation that the police detail had made the decision to use the helicopter recalled the mayor’s response early in his tenure when, after unveiling a traffic safety plan that included lowering of the speed limit on most city roads, his city vehicle was caught speeding. “I have great respect for N. Y. P. D. security training and protocols,” Mr. de Blasio said after the incident, pointing to a remark by the commissioner at the time, William J. Bratton, who said the detail had been moving with the flow of traffic as it was trained to do. “I’m very comfortable with what Commissioner Bratton said, and I refer you to his comments. ” As the mayor arrived at City Hall on Monday afternoon  —   by   sport utility vehicle  —   Mr. de Blasio was asked about his helicopter trip. He declined to comment.",0
8298,"Trump as Champion of Working Class? ‘Come On,’ Obama Says - The New York Times","CLEVELAND  —   President Obama on Friday implored voters here to “reject a dark and pessimistic vision” offered by Donald J. Trump and urged a robust turnout on behalf of Hillary Clinton in a state where the presidential candidates are locked in a   contest. Following by a day Michelle Obama’s deeply personal denunciation of Mr. Trump, the president also assailed the Republican nominee as a morally compromised and intellectually inferior person who fakes his concern for the working class in America. “The guy spent 70 years on this earth showing no regard for working people,” Mr. Obama said, describing Mr. Trump as a wealthy opportunist who is pretending to be something he has never been. “And then suddenly, he’s going to be the champion of working people? Come on. Come on, man. ” Mr. Obama cited a litany of statements from Mr. Trump as evidence that the Republican nominee is unfit to be president, and said people do not have to be “a husband or a father” to know that Mr. Trump’s comments about women were unacceptable. “You just have to be a decent human being,” Mr. Obama told a crowd of Democrats at a rally on the banks of Lake Erie, with Cleveland skyscrapers as a backdrop. The president’s searing critique of Mr. Trump is an indication of the Clinton campaign’s hope that it can emerge victorious in Ohio despite recent polling that suggests a very close race in the Buckeye State. Just weeks ago, Ohio  —   with its many economically struggling communities of mostly white,   voters  —   seemed to be trending toward Mr. Trump, with several polls indicating a small lead for the Republican nominee. Mrs. Clinton went several weeks this fall without visiting the state. But the avalanche of news since the publication of a lewd recording in which Mr. Trump demeans women appears to have benefited Mrs. Clinton’s chances here. An NBC   Street   poll released Friday showed the race in Ohio between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton essentially tied among likely voters, with Gary Johnson, the libertarian candidate, getting almost 10 percent of the vote. For Mrs. Clinton to win Ohio’s 18 electoral votes, she will need overwhelming support in   centers like Cleveland, where slightly more than half of the residents are black. Early voting began this week, and Mr. Obama on Friday repeatedly urged the crowd and those watching on television to take nothing for granted. “Ohio is always close,” Mr. Obama told the crowd. “You can go vote early right now. Early voting started on Wednesday. This is an opportunity for you to exercise your right to vote, your civic responsibility. ” The president’s stump speech has evolved over the last several weeks, with Mr. Obama testifying to Mrs. Clinton’s qualifications, but also lashing out at Mr. Trump in increasingly blunt terms. As Mrs. Obama was in her assault on Mr. Trump in New Hampshire on Thursday, the president has become unleashed in his criticism of the Republican nominee. In a speech Thursday night to Democrats in Columbus, Ohio, Mr. Obama assailed what he called “the swamp of crazy” that Republicans have allowed to fester in recent years. He said Mr. Trump was merely the outgrowth of a political worldview that Republicans have increasingly embraced in Washington and around the country. “You claim the mantle of the party of family values, and this is the guy you nominate?” Mr. Obama told the crowd in Columbus. “You’re the party that is tough on foreign policy and opposes Russia, and then you nominate this guy, whose role model is Vladimir Putin, the former head of the K. G. B.? I’m sorry, what happened?” Mr. Obama repeated that criticism of Republicans on Friday morning, blaming the party’s elected officials for failing to stand up to Mr. Trump’s brand of politics until polls showed that it might damage their own fortunes. “Republicans who knew better stood by silently and even during the course of this campaign didn’t say anything,” Mr. Obama said. He acknowledged that a number of Republicans have denounced Mr. Trump in the wake of the lewd recording, but added, “What, you weren’t appalled earlier when he was saying degrading things about women?” During much of his speech, Mr. Obama seemed almost bemused by the turn the campaign has taken, with Mr. Trump becoming an easy target for the president’s criticism on domestic policy, foreign affairs and personal temperament. But the president clearly understands that Mrs. Clinton needs help in establishing the kind of passionate connection with voters that he had in 2008. Several times during his remarks, Mr. Obama described Mrs. Clinton as tough and qualified and urged voters to embrace her. During the campaign, he said, Mrs. Clinton has not been “complaining or whining or fighting. ” “She was just doing the work,” he said. “And that’s what you want from a president: someone who is going to sit there and do the work for you. ” As he has in the past, Mr. Obama described his   secretary of state as the most qualified person ever to seek the presidency. He said “she’s going to be great at it,” and he urged those who supported Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who challenged Mrs. Clinton in the primaries, to back her now. “If you ‘felt the Bern’ in the primaries, you need to vote,” he said to big cheers from the crowd. But in the end, the case Mr. Obama made Friday morning was to reject Mr. Trump. His voice rising in a singsong cadence, the president said that courtesy, equality, honesty and kindness were all on the ballot. “Democracy itself is on the ballot right now,” the president bellowed above a roar from the crowd. “Send a message of progress. Send a message of hope. ”",0
8299,Pakistani Man Pleads Guilty to Smuggling Fellow Countrymen Into U.S.,"A Pakistani national pleaded guilty in a District of Columbia federal court to a charge of smuggling illegal aliens from Pakistan and other countries into the U. S.[Sharafat Ali Khan, a    citizen of Pakistan and former Brazilian resident, pleaded guilty before District of Columbia District Court Judge Reggie Walton to one count of conspiracy to smuggle undocumented migrants into the United States for profit. Khan worked with other conspirators to create a complex human smuggling network to move illegal immigrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and other countries through Brazil to Central American and Mexico before crossing the borders into the U. S. information obtained by Breitbart Texas from the Department of Justice and U. S. immigration and Customs Enforcement revealed.  Court documents obtained by Breitbart Texas (attached below) exposed the complexity of Khan’s smuggling operation. Kahn and his conspirators forced many of the smuggled immigrants of the immigrants to travel in dangerous conditions in journey’s lasting up to nine months. Kahn received between $3, 000 and $15, 000 USD per immigrant as a fee for conducting the smuggling operation. Immigrants would be forced to pay additional fees along the way to various conspirators of the smuggling network. While not specifically stated in the court documents, Kahn and his conspirators likely have worked with Mexican drug cartels during the final parts of their trip. The immigrants listed in the indictment and criminal complaint entered the U. S. through Texas and California. Their smuggling routes would take them from their home countries to Dubai  —   Brazil  —   Peru  —   Ecuador  —   Colombia  —   Panama  —   Costa Rica  —   Nicaragua  —   El Salvador  —   Guatemala  —   and into Mexico before they would cross the U. S. border.  Their trips included travel by air, sea, and land. Kahn’s conspirators forced many of the travelers to take a dangerous hike through the Darién Gap along the border between Colombia and Panama. Prosecutors stated the Darién Gap is a “dangerous, wild tropical forest area that stretches approximately 100 miles from the north to south coast of Panama. ” The jungle stretches the breadth of the country and is not accessible by vehicle. The aliens received little food or water for their journey which would take up to ten days to complete. OutsideOnline. com called the Darien Gap, the “world’s most dangerous jungle. ” Writer Jason Motlagh investigated the smuggling route at about the same time Kahn sent his human cargo through the jungle. He wrote: For centuries the lure of the unknown has attracted explorers, scientists, criminals, and other dubious characters to the Gap, a    rectangle of swamp, mountains, and rainforest that spans both sides of the border between Colombia and Panama. Plenty of things here can kill you, from venomous snakes to murderous outlaws who want your money and equipment. We’ve come to find the most improbable travelers imaginable: migrants who, by choice, are passing through the Darién region from all over the world, in a   bid to reach the United States and secure refugee status. As traditional pathways to the U. S. become more difficult, Cubans, Somalis, Syrians, Bangladeshis, Nepalis, and many more have been heading to South American countries and traveling north, moving overland up the Central American isthmus. The worst part of this journey is through the Gap. The entire expanse, a roadless maze that travelers usually negotiate on foot and in boats, is dominated by narco traffickers and   guerrillas who’ve been waging war on the government of Colombia since 1964. Hundreds of migrants enter each year many never emerge, killed or abandoned by coyotes (migrant smugglers) on ghost trails. Also during this time period, Breitbart Texas broke the news report that U. S. Border Patrol agents apprehended five Pakistani men and one man from Afghanistan approximately 16 miles into the U. S. It is not known if these illegal aliens traveled via Kahn’s human smuggling network. The apprehension of the group occurred late on Monday night, November 16, 2015. One year later, Breitbart Texas Managing Director Brandon Darby published an exclusive report confirming that officials working under the U. S. Customs and Border Protection umbrella arrested three other Pakistani males inside the U. S. in the Tucson Sector. One of the individuals had traveled to many countries that were not along his direct route to the U. S. This incident occurred shortly after officials arrested Kahn and extradited him from Qatar. Kahn instructed the aliens to communicate with him via WhatsApp, a private instant messaging system. He told them to delete all communications from their app before surrendering to U. S. Immigration officials at the U. S. border where they would claim asylum. He also instructed them not to explain how they traveled from their home country to their arrival at the U. S. Port of Entry. During questioning, the aliens identified Kahn and other conspirators from photo arrays presented by investigators. Kahn reportedly supplied some of the immigrants with forged documents. Kahn’s involvement in the conspiracy included the management of “safe houses” along the journey. He also coordinated with other human smugglers to move the human cargo along the route. He admitted to smuggling between 26 and 99 illegal aliens into the United States for personal profit, including the aliens listed in the indictment. The convicted Pakistani human smuggler now faces a sentencing hearing on July 6, 2017. The judge could impose a penalty of between two and five years in prison and a fine of up to $150, 000. Immigration officials will remove him from the United States upon completion of his prison term as part of the plea agreement.

8300,G.O.P. Accused of Playing ‘Hide-and-Seek’ With Obamacare Replacement Bill - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   It was “find the Affordable Care Act replacement” day on Thursday as   Democrats  —   and one frustrated Republican  —   scampered through Capitol corridors, hunting for an elusive copy of a bill that Republican leaders have withheld from the public as they search for party unity. Just a week before two powerful House committees plan to vote on the measure, opponents spent hours making the point that almost no one has actually seen legislation that would affect the lives and pocketbooks of millions of Americans. “The Republicans have played    with us,” said Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas. Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said party leaders were determined to plow ahead with repeal legislation, despite lingering disagreements among Republicans and outright opposition from Democrats. “I am perfectly confident that when it’s all said and done, we’re going to unify, because we all, every Republican, ran on repealing and replacing, and we’re going to keep our promises,” Mr. Ryan said. The Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicaid, and the Ways and Means Committee, which is responsible for tax legislation, are tentatively scheduled to vote next week on the repeal bill, setting the stage for the full House to vote on it later this month, House Republican leaders said. While Republicans discussed details of the health care bill, Democrats went from office to office, hunting for a copy. Lawmakers were told that Republican members of the Energy and Commerce Committee could inspect the bill on Thursday in the basement of a House office building. When Democrats arrived, they were directed to a room on the first floor of the Capitol. The House Democratic whip, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, and Representative Paul Tonko, Democrat of New York, went to that room, but could not find the bill there. Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who has criticized the repeal bill, also tried and failed to see it. “I have been told that the House Obamacare bill is under lock  key, in a secure location,  not available for me or the public to view,” Mr. Paul said on Twitter as he set off in search of the document, carrying a portable copy machine and trailed by television cameras and a pack of journalists. Mr. Paul supports repealing the Affordable Care Act, but said the measure described publicly by House Republican leaders included “Democratic ideas dressed up in Republican clothing. ” Mr. Hoyer, whose quest for the bill was broadcast live on Facebook, paused to address a large bust of Abraham Lincoln. “I can’t find the bill,” he said, adding, “I know, Mr. Lincoln, you are as upset with your party as I am today. ” The theatrics reflected serious concerns. “Republicans are hiding their draft A. C. A. repeal bill in a basement room,” said the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California. The bill, she said, would produce “a big transfer of wealth to the wealthiest people in our country,” cutting their taxes while increasing costs for others. It is not unusual for controversial bills to be written by the majority party, with little or no input from the minority. But Democrats relished the opportunity to turn the tables on Republicans. In 2009 and 2010, Republicans excoriated Democrats for making “  deals” to pass the Affordable Care Act. Democrats, defending the bill they had written with President Barack Obama, were shouted down at town   meetings by Tea Party members chanting, “Read the bill. ” Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, denied he was hiding the bill or doing anything out of the ordinary. Republicans, he said, “are continuing to discuss and refine draft legislative language. ” Asked if he was hiding the bill, Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said: “We don’t have a bill. We’re continuing to work with the Congressional Budget Office and our members on the final product. ” Republicans had promised an open process. Speaking on the House floor on Jan. 13, Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, the vice chairman of the House Republican Conference, said the health law had been enacted “after months of   deals, in the middle of the night,   deals, and without giving the American people enough time to even read the bill. ” “That is not what is going to happen this time,” he said. The Congressional Budget Office has not completed an estimate of the cost of the repeal bill or its effects on coverage, and Republicans are still trying to narrow their differences on issues like Medicaid and tax credits to help people buy insurance. But, as of Thursday, they were determined to move ahead. “We are going to mark up the legislation next week,” said Representative Billy Long, Republican of Missouri and a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, after a   meeting of House Republicans. “They say we’ll be there all night. I’m going to bring an air mattress. ” Mr. Ryan presented members of his party on Thursday with a timeline leading to passage of the bill by the House within three weeks. The Senate is working closely with House leaders. Mr. Ryan told House Republicans that President Trump supported the bill drafted by House Republican leaders, according to aides who were in the room. Ever since Mr. Obama signed the law in March 2010, Republicans have been trying to uproot it. When Congress convened this year, Republicans thought they could achieve their goal with a quick strike on the law, which has provided insurance to some 20 million Americans. The task has proved more difficult than they expected. Polls show the law has become somewhat more popular as Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans try to kill it. Under a draft of the bill that became public last week, the government would offer tax credits to help lower the cost of insurance for people who did not have access to coverage through an employer or a government program. The tax credits, as initially proposed, would be available to people regardless of their income. Representative Phil Roe, Republican of Tennessee, said the credit should not be available to people with incomes above a certain level, around $118, 000. “I don’t think I need a tax credit, with my salary,” Mr. Roe said. As a member of Congress, he has been paid $174, 000 a year.",0
8301,Turkey Punishes 2 Opposition Leaders as Crackdown Continues - The New York Times,"IZMIR, Turkey  —   Turkish officials handed down punishments on Tuesday to two leaders of a major opposition party who have become casualties of a   crackdown on dissent that escalated after a failed coup  in July.  Selahattin Demirtas, a leader of the   Peoples’ Democratic Party, was sentenced on Tuesday to five months in jail for insulting the Turkish state, the Turkish nation and their institutions. Hours earlier, Figen Yuksekdag, the other leader of the party, was expelled from Parliament after the country’s top court upheld her conviction for a terrorism offense. Both have been in custody since being detained in raids in November. Thousands of members of their party, known as the H. D. P. have also been arrested since the breakdown of Kurdish peace talks in 2015, including at least a dozen of their 59 members of Parliament. The arrests of party members accelerated after the failed coup, which also set off an even larger purge of government officials and people suspected of being dissidents. More than 45, 000 government officials, soldiers, police officers, teachers and journalists have been arrested since the coup attempt, most of them suspected of having connections to the Gulenist movement, a group led by Fethullah Gulen, an exiled cleric living in the United States, that Turkey believes was behind the attempted putsch. The government accuses the H. D. P. of links to a Kurdish militia that has been designated a terrorist group by Turkey, NATO and the European Union. But on Tuesday, the H. D. P. said it was being targeted as part of a wider crackdown on political opposition ahead of a controversial April referendum in which President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is encouraging Turks to grant him greater executive powers. “It is totally about the referendum,” Hisyar Ozsoy, an H. D. P. member of Parliament, said by telephone on Tuesday. “He’s committed to paralyzing the H. D. P. organizationally so that we can’t carry out an effective ‘no’ campaign. ” The H. D. P. Turkey’s   party, received just over 10 percent of the vote in the most recent parliamentary elections, but its leaders believe its supporters could make the difference in a close vote on the referendum. A charismatic leader, Mr. Demirtas had widened the party’s appeal beyond its Kurdish base before the crackdown intensified. Mr. Erdogan’s opponents say that a victory for him in the referendum would lead to   rule, while his supporters argue that it would merely create a United   presidency and bring stability to Turkey. The Turkish news media has reported that the government is worried enough about a victory for the “no” campaign that officials in Konya, a city in central Turkey, recently withdrew from circulation an antismoking pamphlet that contained the word “no. ” A local member of Parliament there from Turkey’s governing party said the pamphlets had been recalled to avoid “confusion,” the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet Daily News reported. Mr. Erdogan has previously told reporters “those who say no will be siding with July 15,” referring to the date of the coup attempt. Andrew Gardner, the Turkey researcher for Amnesty International, said, “It’s hard to imagine how the situation could get any worse in the   to the April referendum. ”",0
8302,Ann Coulter: Can I Be the Poster Child Against Obamacare?,"Like millions of Americans who are paying thousands of dollars a year for health insurance no doctors will take, I would love to be flying to Washington this week, pleading with members of Congress, spearheading   campaigns and appearing as a witness, to tell everyone about my experiences with Obamacare. [But none of us can, because we’re too busy working so we can afford to pay for the health care of 22 million poor, entitled or irresponsible people under Obamacare.  Just yesterday, for example, in addition to working, I had to spend an hour  —   on top of days and days last month  —   figuring out which few remaining clinics provide mammograms under my   now third Obamacare insurance plan. My original plan was made “illegal” by Obamacare, and the next two plans  —   fully approved under Obamacare  —   went bankrupt and were shut down by state and federal regulators. Now I just have to pray I don’t get cancer or break a bone before Obamacare is repealed because, even at $700 a month with a gigantic deductible, there is NO PLAN on the individual market accepted by the two premier hospitals in my area for cancer or broken bones. Those $700 premiums go to pay for the pregnancies and dental care of welfare recipients and immigrants, not cancer treatment for Ann. Democrats love to get on their high horses about the wonderful things Obamacare has done for the uninsured. They should be asked why they refuse to live under it. After they spend 800 hours changing insurance plans every year, ending up with increasingly expensive and increasingly useless plans  —   all so that their premiums can pay for the poor  —   I’ll be fascinated to hear about their love for the downtrodden. Same with Republicans who are, once again, being bamboozled by lobbyists, to the detriment of their taxpaying constituents who don’t have time or money to fly to Washington and tell them our   stories. Insurance lobbyists have somehow convinced politicians, who have very little experience in the private sector, that health insurance is wildly different from every other product  —   even car insurance and homeowner’s insurance  —   because of its need for a large pool of enrollees. Everyone talks about the enrollment problem as if this is a bug unique to the health insurance industry. What product, do they imagine, does not need lots of customers? How could restaurants afford those chefs, fresh flowers, industrial kitchens, one hundred sets of plates, napkins and silverware and a staff of waiters  —   without customers? AHHHH! THEY’LL GO OUT OF BUSINESS! !! THE MODEL DOESN’T WORK WITHOUT LOTS OF PARTICIPANTS! CONGRESS MUST GET INVOLVED. Publishers couldn’t have editors, proofreaders, lawyers, paper plants and marketing departments  —   unless there’s a large pool of book buyers. Pipe manufacturers couldn’t have hundreds of employees, huge machines and factories unless  —   you get the idea. Why is “having customers” treated like some freakish need of this one industry? People are a lot less interested in buying hotel rooms, restaurant meals and pipes than they are in buying health insurance. Everyone knows someone who has died of cancer or had some other major medical problem, and most people are not insane. Even with the hell of Obamacare, requiring hundreds of hours of work  —   to research, sign up for, be thrown off of, then sign up for a different,    plan, year after year  —   the   taxpayer is doing all that in order to maintain some form of health insurance. So apparently, no matter how awful you make it, this is a product Americans are desperate to buy! Republicans all say they want to save the   “good parts” of Obamacare. Because who knows better what the American consumer wants than a member of Congress! I keep imagining Congress designing a “comprehensive hotel reform bill,” promising to save the popular parts: “BUT PEOPLE LIKE HAVING TV’S IN THEIR HOTEL ROOMS!” How could we ever get TVs in hotel rooms without Congress writing a law? It turns out, people running a business have an uncanny ability to figure out what’s popular with their customers. Any “popular” features of Obamacare obviously, manifestly, inevitably will be preserved by the free market. If parents like keeping their useless millennial kids on their plans, guess what? Any insurance company forced to compete with other insurance companies WILL OFFER THAT. As for covering people with “  conditions”  —   there are   conditions and   conditions. Does this mean the unfortunate few with some exorbitantly expensive medical problem? Or does it mean people who have a “  condition” because they waited to be diagnosed with cancer before buying insurance? The first category of people was dealt a bad hand. Eventually, they will be taken care of by the market when excess coverage policies are common and reinsurance companies pop up to cover the primary insurance companies. Until then, a separate program can pay for the unlucky. That’s not a reason to wreck the health insurance market for everyone else. There aren’t 22 million people with horrifyingly expensive medical conditions. They’re being used as the baby seals to sell subsidized health care for the irresponsible. The second category is a lot less sympathetic, which is precisely why the two cases are always conflated. You can’t buy flood insurance after your house has already floated away. But we won’t let people die in the streets, so  —   as Trump said at the very first GOP debate  —   they will be dealt with “through a different system. ” They probably can’t go to Sloan Kettering, but then again, neither can I. Right now, my $700 a month pays for them to go to Sloan Kettering. Both cases are of zero practical importance to the vast majority of people who just want to buy health insurance on the free market, rather than what we’re doing now, which is giving shiftless layabouts and irresponsible   an unlimited health care credit card  —   paid for through our insurance premiums. We’d come to Washington and tell you that, but we’re working to pay for the pediatric dental care of illegal aliens.",0
8303,AT&T Profiting From Data Mining for Government,"Email 
In 2013, Americans learned that AT&T had been providing data about countless telephone calls to federal drug agents without proper search warrants as part of a secret program called Project Hemisphere . Now it emerges that the telecommunications giant is not just eagerly cooperating with the government but also turning a hefty profit — at taxpayer expense — in the process. 
The New York Times broke the 2013 story about Hemisphere based on a PowerPoint presentation obtained from West Coast police agencies by a Washington state peace activist. The paper described the program as “a partnership between federal and local drug officials and AT&T” whereby “the government pays AT&T to place its employees in drug-fighting units around the country,” where they “supply [agents] with the phone data from as far back as 1987” on the basis of a subpoena issued by the agency, not a search warrant approved by a judge. 
“The scale and longevity of the data storage appears to be unmatched by other government programs, including the N.S.A.’s gathering of phone call logs under the Patriot Act,” the Times wrote, noting that “Hemisphere covers every call that passes through an AT&T switch” and “includes information on the locations of callers.” 
As bad as that makes Hemisphere sound, the reality is much worse. The Daily Beast ’s Kenneth Lipp reported Tuesday: Hemisphere isn’t a “partnership” but rather a product AT&T developed, marketed, and sold at a cost of millions of dollars per year to taxpayers. No warrant is required to make use of the company’s massive trove of data, according to AT&T documents, only a promise from law enforcement to not disclose Hemisphere if an investigation using it becomes public. 
AT&T, which owns more than three-quarters of U.S. landline switches and is second only to Verizon when it comes to wireless infrastructure and cellphone towers, “stores details for every call, text message, Skype chat, or other communication that has passed through its infrastructure,” wrote Lipp, adding that this comes to “trillions of records.” What’s more, the company retains those records much longer than other carriers. 
“The database,” penned Lipp, “allows its analysts to detect hidden patterns and connections between call detail records, and make highly accurate inferences about the associations and movements of the people Hemisphere is used to surveil.” 
Not surprisingly, government agencies love having access to this vast treasure trove of data, especially since they can obtain it without a warrant. Thus, even though Hemisphere may initially have been created to fight the unconstitutional war on drugs, its use quickly expanded to other types of investigations, including Medicaid fraud and homicide. 
How much does the program cost taxpayers? According to Lipp, “Sheriff and police departments pay from $100,000 to upward of $1 million a year or more for Hemisphere access.” And since they love having access to this kind of data, they’ll keep shelling out more for it every year, particularly since Washington is picking up the tab. Harris County, Texas, started out paying the relatively modest sum of $77,924 in 2007; four years later, its annual tab had shot up to $940,000. 
“Did you see that movie Field of Dreams ?” American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) technology policy analyst Christopher Soghoian asked Lipp. “It’s like that line, ‘if you build it, they will come.’ Once a company creates a huge surveillance apparatus like this and provides it to law enforcement, they then have to provide it whenever the government asks. They’ve developed this massive program and of course they’re going to sell it to as many people as possible.” 
Besides matters of cost, there are “serious Fourth Amendment concerns” and “profound privacy concerns” with Hemisphere, ACLU deputy legal director Jameel Jaffer told the Times in 2013. That explains why the program is kept so hush-hush. The slides obtained by that newspaper told law enforcement “to never refer to Hemisphere in any official document.” An AT&T statement of work obtained by the Daily Beast says, “The Government agency agrees not to use the data as evidence in any judicial or administrative proceedings unless there is no other available and admissible probative evidence.” 
“I’d speculate that one reason for the secrecy of the program is that it would be very hard to justify it to the public or the courts,” Jaffer told the Times . 
That’s why investigators who obtain leads from Hemisphere often turn around and use more legal and constitutional means to obtain the same evidence, a practice known as “parallel construction.” By doing so, they can introduce the evidence in court without revealing where they first obtained it. 
“At a minimum there is a very serious question whether they should be doing it [searching Hemisphere] without a warrant,” Electronic Frontier Foundation staff attorney Adam Schwartz told Lipp. “A benefit to the parallel construction is they never have to face that crucible. Then the judge, the defendant, the general public, the media, and elected officials never know that AT&T and police across America funded by the White House are using the world’s largest metadata database to surveil people.” 
AT&T claims that it is merely complying with lawful requests for data, not doing anything special. Soghoian begs to differ, telling Lipp, “They say they only cooperate with law enforcement as required, and frankly, that’s offensive when they are mining the data of millions of innocent people, and really built a business and services around the needs of law enforcement.” 
Some are wondering if these revelations will have any effect on AT&T’s attempt to merge with Time Warner, which has yet to be approved by federal regulators. Reason ’s Scott Shackford thinks that, if anything, the fact that AT&T has been so helpful will only play in its favor. “AT&T is essentially the company the federal government made it become,” he wrote, recalling what happened to telecom companies like Qwest that didn’t play ball with Uncle Sam. “Imagine them trying to get permission for this merger with Time Warner if they hadn’t been so cooperative with the federal government with surveillance.” 
Americans who are concerned about their privacy should keep that in mind. Outrage at AT&T is certainly warranted, but the brunt of their anger should be directed at the politicians and bureaucrats who have created a government with the power to compel — or at least strongly encourage — businesses to collaborate in the destruction of our God-given liberties.

8305,Things India should do to improve its Olympic performance,"Things India should do to improve its Olympic performance Posted on Tweet (Image via catchnews.com) 
In August 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had formed a task force to plan for the next three Olympics. This was followed by our mainstream media writing the usual “ 10 things the task force should do to improve Indian sports ”, “ 7 ways India can ensure a better showing at Tokyo 2020 Olympics ”, “ How to win 20 Olympic medals by 2020 ” or “ India can get you 10 medals in 2020 if you spend Rs 480 crore ” kind of stuff. Two months down the line, all is forgotten. 
Since we are not a satire site but a serious website, it was against our ethos to jump the gun and write such an article. Instead we have done painstaking research for the last 2 months and come up with our suggestions. 
Here are our suggestions: 
(A) Due to our colonial mindset, cricket dominates the sporting scene in India. Cricket in its purest form was meant for the aristocratic families of England who had nothing better to do with their time and wanted a game which would keep them occupied for days. It is not suitable for common working class Indians who have to earn a living. India was once the superpower in hockey and there is no reason why we cannot be once again. 
Our Verdict: Create a social media campaign to boycott cricket. Force organizations who sponsor cricket to donate at least 5 Crore rupees for sponsoring other sports. Impose hefty fines on cricket commentators. Force Ravi Shastri to do commentary for hockey and kabaddi matches. 

(B) It is common to find people in Delhi and the surrounding NCR region flaunting their power and influence. One has often heard the phrase “Tu Janta hai mera baap kaun hai?” flaunted by these folks. This craving for recognition through power has prompted several impressionable kids in the NCR Region to take up aggressive sports to flaunt their power. Just look at the number of Olympic medalists from the NCR region who have won Olympic medals in aggressive sports: 
Abhinav Bindra(2008) – Shooting Sushil Kumar (2008 and 2012) – Wrestling Yogeshwar Dutt (2012) – Wrestling Sakshi Malik(2016) – Wrestling 
Further, Gagan Narang who won the bronze in shooting in 2012, was brought up in Chennai and Hyderabad but his parents hail from the NCR region which explains it. 
The ripple effect from NCR is so strong that even Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore from neighboring Rajasthan won silver medal for shooting in 2004. 
Poor Saina Nehwal found it difficult to practice a non-aggressive sport like badminton in NCR and had to shift to Hyderabad to become a champion and win a bronze medal in 2012 Olympics. 
Our verdict: Channelize the aggressive and power flaunting energy of the NCR kids early on and we can be assured of a few medals from here in every Olympics. 

(C) Eastern and southern India has produced many Olympic medalists like Karnam Malleswari in Weightlifting, Mary Kom in Boxing, Leander Paes in Tennis and P. V. Sindhu and Saina Nehwal in badminton along with the likes of Dipa Karmakar who show a promise in a sport where India was never in the reckoning. 
Our verdict: Just provide encouragement and things will improve. 

(D) Our intellectuals and elites attribute the poor showing of India to poverty. But then what explains western India’s poor show considering that it has two of the most prosperous states, Gujarat and Maharashtra. 
The last medal a person from Maharashtra won at the Olympics was Khashaba Dadasaheb Jadhav in Wrestling in 1952. But then Maharashtra is home to cricket legends like Sunil Gavaskar, Sachin Tendulkar and of course the cricket commentary of Ravi Shastri. This explains it. 
But what about Gujarat then? We are not mainstream media and we do not claim to have expertise on everything and we admit we do not have the answer. But the mainstream media which questioned Modi on everything else has kept quiet about this. Why? 
Our verdict: We do not have an answer to this. But we will not keep quiet like the mainstream media. Why did Gujarat not produce a single Olympic medal winner? Will Modi answer? 

(E) Given that the elites blame the lack of facilities in our country for our poor show in Olympics, what stops the kids of these elites from excelling at sports? With cheap skilled manpower to help, they should have done well. Unfortunately, the Indian elites believe in a sense of entitlement and are not willing to work hard. Sport is a meritocratic activity and only performance matters. That is the reason sport is one stream in India which is dynasty free, except for brave exceptions like Rohan Gavaskar who are willing to fight against all odds. 
A friendly media and intellectuals’ ecosystem can make a failed politician look successful, a failed actor a superstar or a news trader a journalist. But this ecosystem cannot make a cricket duck look like a cricket century. 
This explains why the son of one of India’s greatest cricketers, Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi, who captained Indian cricket team despite having vision in only one eye, chose his mother’s profession rather than his father’s. His biggest sporting achievement to date remains winning a 100 meters sprint in an Amul Macho ad. 
Now, you also know why the daughter of Prakash Padukone chose acting or why the son of Dilip Sardesai chose journalism. 
Of course, there are exceptions like Leander Paes who went on to become a tennis star despite his father being a member of Indian hockey team and mother being member of Indian basketball team. He is also wise in that he choose tennis over hockey or basketball. Given his ability to get in trouble with his doubles partners, may it be Mahesh Bhupathi, Rohan Bopanna or Sania Mirza, one wonders how he would have fared in basketball or hockey which has a team of more than 2 players. 
Our verdict: Lack of facilities is not an excuse, at least for the Indian elites. 

(F) Every other Indian boy wants to become a cricketer. For those boys who look beyond cricket, analysis of Indian Olympic winners show that men have only won in hockey and aggressive sports like shooting, boxing and wrestling, except for Norman Pritchard in 1900 who was anyway born to British parents and moved to Britain soon after winning the medals. 
Of course Leander Paes is an exception but we already told you why he did not play hockey and also how aggressive he is even towards his partners. 
Our verdict: Do not expect anything from Indian men beyond hockey and aggressive sports. 

(G) Compared to Indian men, Indian women have won medals in a variety of sports and have been very inclusive, such as Karnam Malleswari in weightlifting, Saina Nehwal and P. V. Sindhu in badminton, Mary Kom in boxing and Sakshi Malik in wrestling. The fact that women got opportunity to train and win in sports like boxing and wrestling that are considered the domain of men show how fake the propaganda of the feminist intellectuals is. 
These feminists intellectuals will form stereotypes based on their opinions and peddle it as facts. Being into responsible journalism, we cannot do that. So we decided to explore an angle we thought was a cause for concern. While it’s true that this decade has seen the rise of likes of P. V. Sindhu and Sakshi Malik, what concerned us was, “Why is there no one to carry forward the legacy of P. T. Usha and Anju George? Why is Indian falling backwards in women’s athletics?” 
We did some investigative journalism and the results will shock you. The reason is not patriarchy but colonial hangover. All of India’s women medal winners have won in indoor sports like boxing, wrestling, badminton and weightlifting. As per our investigation, small school girls are interested in participating in difficult indoor games like gymnastics but they are scared to play any outdoor games for fear that it will darken their skin. Naturally, India is falling behind in women’s athletics. 
Our verdict: Ban fair skin creams. This single action will ensure India wins more medals. Change the slogan “Beti bachao, beti padhao” to “Beti bachao, beti padhao, gorepan ka dabaav na dalo.”",0
8306,Comment on Are Breast Screenings The Biggest Catastrophe In Women’s Health Today? by Surgeons admit that mammography is outdated and harmful to women | |,"  I think if a woman from the age of 50 has a mammogram every year, or every two years, she’s going to get breast cancer as a direct result from that – Dr. Patrick Kingsley, Clinical Ecologist (take from the documentary trailer below) Breast screening, also known as a mammogram, is a regular examination of breasts in order to detect breast cancer in its early stages. According to the Centers For Disease Control (CDC), it’s the most effective way to detect breast cancer, as opposed to a breast self examine – where you check your own breasts for lumps – or a clinical breast exam where a doctor or nurse will examine the breast for a lump. In 2011 (latest year with available data) 220,097 women and 2,078 men   were diagnosed with breast cancer, and 40,931 women and 443 men   died from breast cancer. It has become the most common type of cancer among women. Below is a trailer to a documentary entitled, “ The Promise .” The film interviews various researchers, scientists, doctors (and more), all of whom are hoping to shed light on a practice which is turning out to be not only useless, but harmful to those taking part. There is more information below the video, but I highly recommend you watch the documentary. The Science & Research 
There is a wealth of scientific data concluding that mammograms are not, as the CDC claims, the most effective way to detect breast cancer. In fact, having a mammogram is likely the last thing you want to do if you have breast cancer.   
Let’s take a look at some research that has many scientists, policy makers, and members of the medical community questioning the practice of breast screenings. 
Starting off with recent research, a 2014 study published in The European Journal of Public Health titled “Trends in breast cancer stage distribution before, during and after introduction of a screening programme in Norway ” found that breast screenings actually increase the incidence of localized stage cancers without reducing the incidence of advanced cancers. ( 1 ) 
The study, which used a huge population sample of 1.8 million Norwegian women diagnosed with breast cancer from 1987 – 2010, found that: 
“The annual incidence of localized breast cancer among women aged 50–69 years rose from 63.9 per 100 000 before the introduction of screening to 141.2 afterwards, corresponding to a ratio of 2.21 (95% confidence interval: 2.10; 2.32). The incidence of more advanced cancers increased from 86.9 to 117.3 per 100 000 afterwards, corresponding to a 1.35 (1.29; 1.42)-fold increase. Advanced cancers also increased among younger women not eligible for screening, whereas their incidence of localized cancers remained nearly constant.” ( 1 ) This study outlines how Norway’s breast screening program has actually increased the chance of being diagnosed with early stage breast cancer by more than 200%, as well contributing to an increased chance of receiving advanced stage breast cancer diagnosis by 35%. This is the opposite of what mammograms are supposed to do; if they were useful then the incidence of cancers would be lower and not higher. The study concluded that: Incidence of localized breast cancer increased significantly among women aged 50–69 years old after introduction of screening, while the incidence of more advanced cancers was not reduced in the same period when compared to the younger unscreened age group.( 1 ) It’s important to note that, “ although the study did measure the impact of Norway’s breast screening programme, a comparison of trends between participants and non-participants in the age group eligible for screening warrants further investigation. Also the causal link between stage distribution and mortality needs to be investigated in the context of screening .” ( 1 ) A paper published in 2011 in the British Medical Journal set out to prove that breast screening by mammography is associated with a steeper fall in mortality cancer compared to other countries who were not offering this service. They did not expect to find the complete opposite; they found a drop in breast cancer mortality among women who were not screened. They concluded that the recent downward trend in breast cancer mortality had nothing to do with screening and everything to do with improvements in treatment and service provision. ( 2 ) The new data published in the BMJ now suggests that none of the gratifying falls in breast cancer can be attributed to screening and that the very existence of a NHSBSP (national breast screening programme) should be questioned. Unless there is public pressure for an independent inquiry to challenge the status quo, it will be business as usual for the screening programme. Furthermore, the Department of Health has painted itself into a corner and it is no longer a question of scientific debate – the subject has become too politicized by those who like to avoid U-turns at all costs. – Michael Baum, Professor Emeritus of Surgery and visiting Professor of Medical Humanities at University College London, is a leading British surgical oncologist who specializes in breast cancer treatment ( source ) This would be an asymptomatic woman walking along the high street, having a mammogram, and then two weeks later she’s told she has to have a mastectomy. This is so cruel that it should make you weep. (quote taken from the documentary trailer above) As Sayer Ji, founder of Greenmedinfo.com points out, a National Cancer Institute commissioned expert panel concluded that “early stage cancers” are not cancer, they are benign or indolent growths. This means that millions of women were wrongly diagnosed with breast cancer over the past few decades and have been subjected to harmful treatment, when they would have been better off leaving it untreated or diagnosed; frighteningly, it is not uncommon for a breast cancer misdiagnosis to occur. Another study that was recently published in the British Medical Journal concluded that regular mammogram screenings do not reduce breast cancer death rates. And they found no evidence to suggest that mammograms are more effective than personal breast exams at detecting cancer in the designated age group. The study involved 90, 000 Canadian women and compared breast cancer incidence and mortality up to 25 years in women aged 40-59.( 3 ) The study was conducted over a period of 25 years. Many Studies Showing The Same Thing The sheer number of studies that have been published on breast mammography examinations and their failure to produce a benefit in screened populations is overwhelming. What’s even more disturbing is the fact that these types of examinations have also been shown to increase the risk of breast cancer, and to have negative implications for both physical and mental health. 
For a database of published studies on this topic, you can click HERE . You can also find access to more research here . U-turns do not embarrass clinical scientists, unlike politicians: if the evidence changes then our minds must change. As the national programme began to run its course, two disturbing observations made me begin to question my original support. First, about 10 years after the initiation of the service, updated analyses of the original data set by independent groups in Europe and the US found that the initial estimate of benefit in the reduction of breast cancer mortality was grossly exaggerated. – Michael Baum, Professor Emeritus of Surgery and visiting Professor of Medical Humanities at University College London, is a leading British surgical oncologist who specializes in breast cancer treatment ( source ) Source:",0

An unidentified supporter of Republican presidential candidate and alleged unregistered sex offender Donald Trump took to violently harassing members of the media at a Saturday night rally held in Phoenix, Arizona. 
The man, wearing a “Hillary for Prison” t-shirt, screamed into the press area, “You’re going down! You’re the enemy! You’re the ones working for the devil!,” before adapting the crowd’s “USA” chant into “Jew-s-a,” all the while continuing to scream at the members of the media in the press pen. 
Candace Smith, of ABC, was one of the reporters to capture the man’s disturbing behavior on tape. She posted video of the disturbing press area encounter to Twitter, a video which is featured below.

Smith included in the text accompanying her video post a question, saying in reference to seemingly intentional hand gestures on the part of the Trump supporter, “Does anyone know what those hand signs mean?” 
Smith got at least a couple noteworthy and credible responses. 
Clayton Swisher, whose Twitter bio reads that he is an “investigative reporter and author,” suggested that the Trump supporter’s hand gestures are a variation of the “88” hand sign used by white supremacists and described by the Anti-Defamation League as follows: 
‘One of the most popular white supremacist symbols is the numeric symbol 88, which stands for “Heil Hitler” (substituting letters for numbers, 88 means HH, i.e., “Heil Hitler”). It is thus not surprising that white supremacists occasionally attempt to display 88 as a hand sign.’

A Twitter user with the username “@puppymnkey” countered, however, that the Trump supporter’s hand gestures didn’t quite match the Schwurhand, and instead pointed to a hand gesture version of the number “666” employed by conspiracy theorists, a group almost certainly the man at the Trump rally. @57MCM @CandaceSmith_ nope.

However, Russia’s experts are divided in their assessments of his chances in the 2018 presidential elections Prominent opposition figure and anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny has announced he plans to run for the presidency, with criminal charges against him suspended. However, Russia’s experts are divided in their assessments of his chances in the 2018 presidential elections. 

Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny during an interview to the Associated Press in Moscow. Photo: AP 
Last week Russia’s Supreme Court suspended the criminal charges against Russia’s well-known opposition activist and anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny, who was accused of embezzlement of assets belonging to ;the state-run timber company ;Kirovles. 
The decision came after the European Court of Human Rights reviewed and endorsed Navalny’s complaint about the trial, which the defendant found unfair and politically motivated. The Russian authorities are to reassess their decision in light of the February ruling, which called for Navalny to be fully acquitted and for Russia to pay $8,000 each to him and his co-defendant Pyotr Ofitserov plus legal costs. 
Also read: "" Khodorkovsky drums up support in Europe for an alternative to Putin "" All this means that the criminal charges against Navalny are at least suspended, if not canceled. The accused is rehabilitated and has chances to stand for Russia’s presidency in 2018. Navalny confirmed his presidential bid last week and has left his intention to run as an alternative candidate in no doubt. Russian oligarch and opposition activist Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who now lives in London, has approved Navalny’s candidacy . Meanwhile, the Kremlin is reticent about the anti-corruption campaigner’s intentions to run for the presidency. 
“This question is not on our agenda now,” said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. “The presidential elections will take place in 2018.” ; ; ; ; ; ; 
Too early for forecasts Meanwhile, experts argue that it is too early to talk about the 2018 presidential elections and the chances of their candidates. For example, democratic activist and politician Leonid Gozman believes that Navalny has enough political heft, but the fact that he is associated with the opposition will hinder his chances. 
“Alexei Navalny is a celebrity,” he said. “He is a well-known figure with an interesting history, which has its own flaws and advantages.” ; ; 
Gozman argues that t he opposition candidate’s major disadvantage is an unfavorable political environment within the country and people's distrust of opposition, with him fighting against those at the helm . However, Navalny might be able to turn this disadvantage into an advantage and earn political credentials not only inside, but also outside Russia. According to Gozman, Navalny’s anti-corruption political platform is a valuable and very meaningful asset, which he will be able to use in his favor. 
Likewise, Mikhail Vinogradov, the chairman of the Petersburg Politics Foundation, argues that Navalny has enough political heft and can be compared with Russian President Vladimir Putin to a certain extent. 
“Navalny is the No. 2 politician in Russia’s public politics,” he told ; Russia Direct . “That’s why he’s more effective and interesting than the leaders of the parliamentary parties, which have been competing with each other for so long. He has well-developed political instincts. In addition, he has much better chances in the elections than those retirees who head the parliamentary parties. From the point of view of populist potential, Putin and Navalny are comparably equal.” 
Vinogradov is sure that Navalny is capable of recruiting a large number of supporters in a short period of time, as indicated by the results of the 2013 Moscow mayoral elections, when he won more than 27 percent of the vote. However, at that time he focused primarily on the protest electorate . Today, there are a lot of people who are not satisfied with the current situation in the country and Navalny is capable of winning their votes as well as the votes of those who support the authorities, Vinogradov speculates. 
However, it remains to be seen if the opposition activist will be able to use his tactics to help win nationwide support. “This is one of the major intrigues,” said Vinogradov. 
A dose of legitimacy for Russia’s elections At the same time, Gozman argues that the participation of Navalny in the presidential elections will make them more interesting and less artificial. 
“His bid is useful for the elections themselves,” he said. “This means that a campaign with Navalny will look more real than one without him.” 
Also read: "" Hawks vs. doves: Who will dominate in the Kremlin before the 2018 elections? "" Gozman gives an example of the 2013 mayoral campaign, which he sees as ""more natural” because Navalny challenged Sergei Sobyanin and encouraged him to change his tactics. In contrast, Alexei Mukhin, the ;general director of the Center for Political Information, ;a Moscow-based think tank, argues that the participation of Navalny will be a bigger disadvantage for regional campaigns rather than an advantage. According to him, the opposition figure will bring instability and disorder, while pursuing a sole goal: self-promotion."" 
“Navalny is a professional troublemaker,” he told ; Russia Direct . “He is likely to look for a trade-off with the authorities. For example, he will withdraw his bid if the Kremlin offers him some political privileges."" 
“It is a matter of a pure political calculation. He is not a populist — he is a political strategist,"" Mukhin added. "" He is a sort of dealer within politics and he can use skills to earn political points. Moreover, a refusal to register Navalny as a presidential candidate will be a big asset for him, because it will give him a reason to claim that the authorities are afraid of him. It may strengthen his political heft .” 
Populist or not? 
Unlike Mukhin, Gozman sees Navalny as a potential populist in the upcoming presidential campaign. However, it is too early to talk about specific positions or a platform he is going to stick since it is unclear what kind of environment the 2018 elections will be held in. 
“A populist is easy to recognize only in a specific environment,” he said. “Most importantly, it is necessary to know what position his opponents will take. It is a matter of debates: You’re inclined to take a tougher position in a dispute than under other circumstances, at least because you need to prove your point of view.” ; 
When discussing populism in presidential campaigns, most Russian experts give the example of Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the firebrand leader of Russia’s Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR). Throughout his political career, he has garnered about 10 percent of the vote. For instance, the results of the recent parliamentary elections showed that his party even improved its record in comparison with previous years. This indicates that Russians are easy to manipulate and they are ready to support a populist candidate. However, the populism of Zhirinovsky is not taken very seriously. 
Recommended: "" Inside the anti-corruption campaign against Russia's liberals "" “If a new populist like [U.S.-President-elect Donald] Trump , who would avoid Zhirinovsky’s buffoonish style, emerges in Russia’s political arena, the rest of the politicians, including Navalny himself, are likely to take a more moderate position. If such a populist doesn’t appear, somebody else will fill his shoes,” ;says Gozman. 
Mukhin doesn’t agree. He argues that Russia’s political system prevents such populists from coming to power. The most obvious example is Zhirinovsky himself, who is seen as something of a clown. ; 
What most pundits agree on is that Navalny’s odds of winning in the 2018 elections are slim: It will be extremely challenging for him to launch a presidential bid and win enough support from voters , partly because Putin , who still enjoys high approval rankings and wields political heft, doesn’t support his candidacy, according to Vinogradov and Gozman. This is the very logic of Russia’s current political system, in which elections are not a game-changer: Their results are always predictable.

by Israel Shamir 
I envy you, American citizens. I do not care about your military might, nor for your supreme currency, the US dollar. I envy your chance to deal on 11/8 a decisive blow to the rule of the Masters of Discourse. 
Though the Masters control the entirety of world media, and they decide what people may think and say from Canada to Hong Kong, only you, American citizens, can defeat them. This is a great chance, a unique opportunity not to be missed. 
The Masters of Discourse can be defeated. They are not stronger than any ruler of past. Trump has a great quality making him fit for the task: he is impervious to labels and libels. He had been called everything in the book: anti-Semite, racist, women hater, you name it. And he still survived that flak. Such people are very rare. 
We know he is against the Masters because every newspaper is against him. I never saw a similar onslaught but once, in Russia in 1996. Then President Yeltsin, an old drunkard who had brought Russia to collapse, had to run for his second term. His popularity was next to zero. Two per cent of Russians intended to vote for him. And then the oligarchs turned on their propaganda machine. Yeltsin’s competitor Gennady Zyuganov, a mild church-going post-communist, had been presented like a Hitler of his days. All the Russian media of the day belonged to oligarchs, and all of it participated in the onslaught. Zyuganov surrendered. 
Perhaps he won the election, but he congratulated Yeltsin with his victory. It was said that he was threatened with assassination unless… Others say he was bribed. I do not exclude both explanations, but for sure the might of united media can crush a timid man. 
In the days of the Jewish Temple, there was a Magrepha, a wind instrument able to produce diverse and frightening sounds. There is no agreement among the scholars about what sort of thing it was. Whenever it sounded, people were scared. 
The media of our days is a new Magrepha. If all of its outputs are united, they produce a terrible roar. A Magrepha, the organ of the ancient Hebrews in the synagogue. 
Yes, the onslaught of the media upon Trump has been exceedingly unfair, but he survived it. 
What is even more important, you survived it, it does not matter what the polls say: they say what the newspapers tell them to say. Even people answer the polls according to the media prognoses: they are shy of saying they would vote for a man who … But at the moment of actual vote, they do what they know is right for them. Not for transgenders, not for Muslim brokers, not even for single mothers, but for themselves. 
You have a very good chance to win, and to defeat the witch and her supporters. We learned that the British people voted for Brexit, though all the media said that proposal had no chance. But we also learned from Brexit, that nothing is over until it is over. The Masters of Discourse will try every trick to steal the elections, and only their fear of armed rising may finally force them to acknowledge their inevitable defeat. We know that in 2015, when Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister, was afraid of losing the elections, he revealed that the American intelligence has some superior software which allows them to falsify the elections. Perhaps, but he won despite this magical software, despite Obama’s wrath. Even in Israel, that favorite son of the Masters, the Masters are hated. The New York Times is always speaking good about Israel, but still Israelis do not like the newspaper. Nobody likes them, nobody likes an old aunt who tries to tell us what we can say and what we can’t. If Netanyahu could win, Trump can win twice. KEY STATES TILTING TOWARD TRUMP AFTER FBI’S OCTOBER SURPRISE 
After the first debate of Trump and Clinton, people said: She won! But we shall vote for him. This was a very encouraging sign. Indeed every woman worth its salt would win an argument with her husband or son-in-law, let alone a pretender. That is the way we are made. 
The story of sirens enforces the belief that if you listen to a woman, she will bewitch you. Sirens actually ate the bewitched sailors; our womenfolk do not go to such extremes, but they can cause us a lot of trouble. 
Trump seems to be almost pure of heart and deed, as even the extremely prejudiced media could not find anything really incriminating about him but bragging about having his way with women. 
I shall not recount so many proven accusations against Hillary. All of that can be found in the emails revealed by Julian Assange and his great Wikileaks team. The media kept mum about it, but the secrets can’t be kept forever. 
There are many practical things Donald Trump will be able to fix. He can return industries home, he can return American GIs home from four ends of the world, he can improve life for a lot of working men and women. But he surely will set all of us free from the annoying bondage of the Masters. Just for that reason, go and vote, for yourself and for millions of us who aren’t entitled to.

8312,Democrats Are in Worse Shape than Even They Think,"Warnings  —   or, in some cases, celebrations  —   that the Democrats are on the verge of a disastrous collapse have been growing more frequent recently. [Since the election, Rush Limbaugh has been hammering the point that the campaign has only continued  —   and extended the trend set in 2010, when Democrats lost the House.   Since then, Democrats have lost 1200 national and statewide seats. And earlier this week, Stewart Lawrence, writing in the Daily Caller, and picking up on a study by the centrist “Third Way” think tank, noted that the Democrats are now almost exclusively a coastal party, with a couple of lone interior outposts such as Chicago and Minneapolis.  According to the study, while Hillary Clinton beat Trump in California, New York and Massachusetts by 30% Trump won the rest of the states by  %.  Some 32 state legislatures are in Republican hands, but in only five states do Democrats control both houses of the legislature and the governor’s mansion. And, as many (including Lawrence) note, in 2018 the Democrats must defend 10 U. S. Senate seats in states that Trump won.  Meanwhile, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, once thought dead in the water, won   in 2016, as did John McCain in Arizona, despite the fact that many conservatives, sick of his antics, voted for the Democrat. If the left can’t win these seats  —   the most   of fruit  —   where can they win? The fact is, although we now know the polls were horribly wrong, Trump’s victory was quite small compared to what it might have been. Consider: Trump lost these seven states by a total of 510, 000 votes  —   shifting 51 electoral votes and narrowly denying him a massive landslide territory. The “flip factor”  —   what is needed to reverse the decision  —   was a mere 260, 000 votes. Trump gained 290, 000 votes more than Romney in Pennsylvania alone between 2012 and 2016. In short, the fake news media is missing a much larger story: that the Democrats are teetering on the edge of an abyss that could see them utterly wiped out in 2018 and 2020. Larry Schweikart is the c&  with Breitbart News’ Joel Pollak, of the new book, How Trump Won: The Inside Story of a Revolution, is available from Regnery.  ",0
8313,Ann Coulter: Give Me Your Tired Arguments...,"Everything said about President Trump’s “Muslim ban” is a lie  —   including that it’s a Muslim ban. [The New York Times wore out its thesaurus denouncing the order: “cruelty   …     injury   …     suffering   …     bigoted, cowardly,     …     breathtaking   …     inflammatory   …     callousness and indifference”  —   and that’s from a single editorial!  Amid the hysteria over this prudent pause in refugee admissions from seven countries whose principal export is dynamite vests, it has been indignantly claimed that it’s illegal for our immigration policies to discriminate on the basis of religion. This is often said by journalists who are only in America because of immigration policies that discriminated on the basis of religion. For much of the last   Soviet Jews were given nearly automatic entry to the U. S. as “refugees. ” Entering as a refugee confers all sorts of benefits unavailable to other immigrants, including loads of welfare programs, health insurance, job placement services, English language classes, and the opportunity to apply for U. S. citizenship after only five years. Most important, though, Soviet Jews were not required to satisfy the United Nations definition of a “refugee,” to wit: someone fleeing persecution based on race, religion or national origin. They just had to prove they were Jewish. This may have been good policy, but let’s not pretend the Jewish exception was not based on religion. If a temporary pause on refugee admissions from seven   countries constitutes “targeting” Muslims, then our immigration policy “targeted” Christians for discrimination for about 30 years. Never heard a peep from the ACLU about religious discrimination back then! According to the considered opinion of the Cato Institute’s David J. Bier, writing in the New York Times, Trump’s executive order is “illegal” because the 1965 immigration act “banned all discrimination against immigrants on the basis of national origin. ” In 1966, one year after the 1965 immigration act, immigrants from Cuba suddenly got special immigration privileges. In 1986, immigrants from Ireland did. People from Vietnam and Indochina got special immigration rights for 20 years after the end of the Vietnam War. The 1965 law, quite obviously, did not prohibit discrimination based on national origin. (I was wondering why the Times would sully its pages with the legal opinion of a Grove City College B. A. like Bier! Any “expert” in a storm, I guess.) In fact, ethnic discrimination is practically the hallmark of America’s immigration policy  —   in addition to our perverse obsession with admitting the entire Third World. Commenting on these ethnic boondoggles back in 1996, Sen. Orrin Hatch said: “We have made a mockery” of refugee law, “because of politics and pressure. ” We let in one ethnic group out of compassion, then they form an ethnic power bloc to demand that all their fellow countrymen be let in, too. As the former Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, described “diversity” in Der Spiegel: “In multiracial societies, you don’t vote in accordance with your economic interests and social interests, you vote in accordance with race and religion. ” That’s our immigration policy  —   plus a healthy dose of Emma Lazarus’ insane idea that all countries of the world should send their losers to us. (Thanks, Emma!) Americans are weary of taking in these pricey Third World immigrants, who show their gratitude by periodically erupting in maniacal violence  —   in, for example, San Bernardino, Orlando, New York City, Fort Hood, Boston, Chattanooga, Bowling Green and St. Cloud. The Muslim immigrants currently being showcased by the left are not likely to change any minds. The Times could produce only 11 cases of temporarily blocked immigrants that the newspaper would even dare mention. (Imagine what the others are like!) For purposes of argument, I will accept the Times’ glowing descriptions of these Muslim immigrants as brilliant scientists on the verge of curing cancer. (Two of the Times’ 11 cases actually involved cancer researchers.) Point one: If the Times thinks that brilliance is a desirable characteristic in an immigrant, why can’t we demand that of all our immigrants? To the contrary! Our immigration policy is more likely to turn away the brilliant scientist  —   in order to make room for an Afghani goat herder, whose kid runs a coffee stand until deciding to bomb the New York City subway one day. (That was Najibullah Zazi, my featured “Immigrant of the Week,” on May 1, 2012.) Point two: I happened to notice that even the stellar Muslim immigrants dug up by the Times seem to bring a lot of elderly and sickly relatives with them. Guess who gets to support them? House Speaker Paul Ryan’s driving obsession (besides being the Koch brothers’ lickspittle) is “entitlement reform,” i. e. cutting benefits or raising the retirement age for Social Security and Medicare. I have another idea. How about we stop bringing in immigrants who immediately access government programs, who bring in elderly parents who immediately access government programs, or who run vast criminal enterprises, stealing millions of dollars from government programs? (I illustrated the popularity of government scams with immigrants in Adios, America! by culling all the news stories about these crimes over a   period and listing the perps’ names.) Point three: Contrary to emotional blather about the horrors refugees are fleeing, a lot are just coming to visit their kids or to get free health care. One of the Times’ baby seals  —   an Iraqi with diabetes and “a respiratory ailment”  —   was returning from performing his responsibilities as an elected official in Kirkuk. That’s not exactly fleeing the Holocaust. While it’s fantastic news that most Muslim refugees aren’t terrorists, the downside is: They’re not refugees, they’re not brilliant, they don’t have a constitutional right to come here, and they’re very, very expensive. Until politicians can give us more government services for less money, they need to stop bringing in the poor of the world on our dime.",0

“Man shot dead after stabbing guard at US Embassy in Kenya,” By Tom Odula | AP October 27 at 1:01 PM 
NAIROBI, Kenya — A man was shot dead after stabbing a policeman guarding the perimeter wall of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi and trying to take his gun, a Kenyan police official said Thursday. 
The policeman who had been stabbed opened fire in self-defense and killed the attacker, said Vitalis Otieno, the officer in charge of the Gigiri area that hosts several embassies and the U.N’s African headquarters. 
“He fired first and shot the person and the person died on the spot,” Otieno said. 
The identity of the attacker, a Kenyan from the volatile region of Wajir near Somalia, is known to police, Otieno said. 
Federal Bureau of Investigation personnel were seen collecting evidence at the scene of the shooting.

8315,Surprise! Hillary Receives DEVASTATING News On Her Poll Lead Over Trump,"Share This Hillary Clinton is undoubtedly having a terrible day after finding out the FBI investigation has been reopened. However, she’s was instantly steamrolled with more devastating news concerning her recent poll lead. 
Hillary Clinton and her leftist lapdog media have been busy celebrating her “imminent” victory, practically declaring her president before the election is even over. However, in an unbelievable turn of events, she just received some potentially devastating news about her poll lead over Donald Trump that has the nation in an uproar. 
Just recently, Hillary and her team of liberal shills were busted “rigging elections” with both massive voter fraud at the polls and working with mainstream media outlets to perpetuate a bias against Trump to cover her own felonious scandals. The partiality and voter fraud are so severe that many were left wondering if there’s really any way to beat Hillary or if it’s a predetermined selection from the liberal elitists. 
Just as Hillary thought she was going to hobble straight into the White House again, however, she received some news that crucially threatens her election during the most critical time. 
Breitbart reports that less than one week after Trump was suffering an immense lag behind Hillary in the polls, the gap is suddenly coming to a close with the Republican nominee leaping forward a massive 5 points, leaving him just 4 behind the Democratic opponent. Even though Trump was at 38 percent on October 22, he has since rapidly climbed to 44 percent and is expected to seal the gap. 
The unbelievable rise in Trump’s support comes just before the FBI announced that it is reopening their investigation into Hillary’s private email server, meaning that his approval rating is sure to skyrocket even further with the great chance that he’ll surpass the scandalous liberal candidate just as voters head to the polls. Even before the FBI announced it will re-investigate Hillary Clinton’s private email server, Trump was already closing the polling gap. It’s likely that he will easily catch up to her since more classified emails have been leaked. 
What’s even more miraculous is that Trump is fighting against all odds, including a stifling media bias that’s found to wholly working against him with 91 percent of 184 opinionated statements considered to be negative. However, even this buying of the mainstream media hasn’t stopped the hypothetical Trump train, as the underdog candidate even won early votes in Florida and is the only Republican to do so in the critical swing state. 
Although Hillary and her media pets have been tirelessly scheming around the clock to discourage citizens from voting for Trump, reporting fake poll numbers that show her in a major lead, even the left-leaning ABC and Washington Post couldn’t deny Trump’s rapid incline. Not only has Trump gained 5 points, according to their tracking poll, Hillary fell 2, meaning that either undecided or Hillary voters are beginning to support Trump. 
Ironically, even Hillary’s campaign manager Robby Mook was forced to admit that Trump could very well be the next U.S. President. 
“Donald Trump has been going around telling people not to listen to the polls, and saying that he can still win this race. Well, you know what, he’s absolutely right,” Mook announced in a video. 
Just minutes after FBI Director James Comey officially announced the reopened investigation, the stocks suddenly started to tank , which many believe is indicative of a Trump win. It appears as though the liberal elite and Wall Street bankers are panicking at the idea that the easily bought Hillary might not make it to November 8. 
Regardless of your stance on the presidential election, it’s clear that the mainstream media has been purchased and is striving to scare Trump voters away from the polls. Considering that this is true, imagine just how many more potential Trump voters are staying home because they feel as though a victory is hopeless — when, indeed, it’s obviously not.",0
8316,Comment on The Clinton Crime Family. “Hillary is the Most Dangerous Presidential Aspirant in US History” by Toby,"What Is At Stake In This Election — Paul Craig Roberts ‹ › Since 2011, VNN has operated as part of the Veterans Today Network ; a group that operates over 50 plus media, information and service online sites for U.S. Military Veterans. The Clinton Crime Family. “Hillary is the Most Dangerous Presidential Aspirant in US History” By VNN on October 30, 2016 Hillary is the most recklessly dangerous presidential aspirant in US history, 
by Stephen Lendman 
The Bill and Hillary crime family long ago should have been held accountable for high crimes against peace and numerous others. Hillary is the most recklessly dangerous presidential aspirant in US history, supporting endless imperial wars and state terror, once saying “(w)hat do we have NATO for if not to defend our way of life.” There was never a war Hillary did not support – Crimes against Humanity She endorses first-strike nuclear weapons use, calling them peacekeeping deterrents, mindless of their power to destroy life on earth. She’s militantly anti-Russia, earlier compared the nation to Nazi Germany, Putin to Hitler, claiming “he doesn’t have a soul,” has revanchist aims, wanting Russian greatness restored – all of the above a perversion of truth, not to mention a pretext to wage war on Russia. The so-called Clinton Foundation is a suspected criminal enterprise, masquerading as a charitable NGO. It promotes Big Lies about “improving global health, increasing opportunity for women and girls, reducing childhood obesity and preventable diseases, (as well as) creating economic opportunity and growth…” Film producer Frank Huguenard believes Hillary Clinton faces impending federal racketeering charges under the 1970 Racketeering Influence and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Enacted to fight organized and white collar crime, racketeering is defined to include fraud, bribery, money laundering, embezzlement, drugs trafficking, murder, and various other offenses under the Federal criminal code (Title 18), even acts of terrorism. According to Huguenard, Obama-appointed FBI chief James Comey will recommend Attorney General Loretta Lynch treat “the Clinton Foundation (as) an ongoing criminal enterprise engaged in money laundering and soliciting bribes in exchange for political, policy and legislative favors to individuals, corporations and even governments both foreign and domestic.” Morning Joe Destroys Corrupt Clinton Foundation – “Total Corruption” Strong stuff if only partly true! Huguenard cites credible evidence, indicating the Clinton Foundation is largely a money laundering, influence peddling racket. Less than 10% of “tens of millions of dollars donated” went for charitable purposes, the rest for self-enrichment. “There is ample evidence already in the public record that the Clinton Foundation qualifies as a criminal enterprise and there’s no doubt that the FBI is privy to significantly more evidence than has already been made public,” said Huguenard. If Comey recommends Attorney General Lynch indict Hillary Clinton, it’s unlikely she’ll prosecute a woman she’s had close ties to for years. Bill Clinton appointed her US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York – serving from 1999 – 2001. From 2003 – 2005, she was a Wall Street controlled New York Federal Reserve Bank of New York board member – the mother bank most complicit with its member bank crooks. From 2002 – 2010, she was a Washington-headquartered Hogan & Hartson (H & H) law firm partner. Its New York-based partner Howard Topaz filed income tax returns for Bill and Hillary Clinton, beginning in 2004. In May 2004, H & H filed patent trademark documents for Denver-based MX Logic Inc., the computer software firm responsible for developing email encryption technology used to manage Hillary’s private email server, beginning in July 2013. Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton According to Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton, if H & H (now Hogan Lovells following a 2010 merger) “represented the Clintons on tax matters,” Lynch is responsible for disclosing any involvement she may have had, direct or indirect. In April 2008 during Hillary’s first presidential campaign, The American Lawyer called H & H one of her largest legal industry supporters.   Partner Christine Varney was chief counsel to the Clinton/Gore 1992 campaign. The ties between H & H, Lynch and the Clintons are longstanding. In November 2014, Obama announced her appointment as attorney general, succeeding Eric Holder, effective April 27, 2015 after Senate confirmation. It’s hard imagining her biting a hand contributing greatly to her career advancement. Key for Clinton is how much more of her dark side becomes public knowledge besides what’s already known. If enough despite Lynch declining to indict and supportive media scoundrels downplaying or whitewashing her offenses, the Democratic (sic) National Committee (DNC) might be forced to jettison her as damaged goods. She’d be red meat for Trump to take full advantage of in the fall campaign. Would Bernie Sanders party bosses don’t want become Democrat standard bearer in July? Or will Joe Biden or another high-profile party member perhaps be chosen as a late-stage establishment nominee, a brokered convention manipulating things? America’s political system is too debauched to fix. Duopoly power eliminates governance of, by and for everyone equitably. Republicans and Democrats are two sides of the same coin – special interests served exclusively, ordinary people betrayed, the same outcome every electoral cycle. Whoever succeeds Obama, likely worse than ever governance will follow. The greatest concern is preventing possible WW III. Clinton’s rage for endless wars, along with her Sino/Russian hostility makes the unthinkable possible. Stephen Lendman lives in Chicago. He can be reached at .

(New York Times) The architects of the Affordable Care Act thought they had a blunt instrument to force people — even young and healthy ones — to buy insurance through the law’s online marketplaces: a tax penalty for those who remain uninsured. 
It has not worked all that well, and that is at least partly to blame for soaring premiums next year on some of the health law’s insurance exchanges. 
The full weight of the penalty will not be felt until April, when those who have avoided buying insurance will face penalties of around $700 a person or more. But even then that might not be enough: For the young and healthy who are badly needed to make the exchanges work, it is sometimes cheaper to pay the Internal Revenue Service than an insurance company charging large premiums, with huge deductibles.",0

8319,Assad Aide: US May ‘Navigate & Direct’ ISIS From Mosul Into Syria,"  Carol Adl in Middle East , News , US // 0 Comments 
According to President Assad’s media adviser, the way the US-led coalition is conducting its operation in Mosul suggests that Washington may be planning to “navigate” ISIS terrorists into Syria in accordance with its longstanding strategy for the region. 
Islamic State terrorists fleeing from Mosul into Syria would become a “huge danger to our sovereignty, to our country,” Dr. Bouthaina Shaaban told RT adding that “Russia and Syria are looking at this issue extremely seriously. We’re not going to sit and watch… The way they encircle Mosul shows they would like these terrorists to move into to Syria…” 
RT reports: 
“They’re navigating terrorism from one place to another, limiting terrorism in one place, directing it to another place. That’s the absolute truth of what is happening in our region,” she explained. 
Western states only “speak about fighting terrorism” and in meantime supply so-called “moderates” who eagerly share Western aid with not so “moderate” militants, according to the aide. 
“Unfortunately, Western partners speak about fighting terrorism, but they honestly do not. Quite the contrary, what they do on the ground is to supply weapons and armaments to terrorists whom they call ‘moderate’, while we know that on the ground there’s no ‘moderate terrorism.’ They all exchange weapons and armaments on the ground. And they all constitute danger not only to Syria, but to the region and to mankind as well,” Shaaban said. 
“We see Western countries announcing that they will be supporting what they call ‘Syrian moderates’. There are no ‘Syrian moderates’, they are carrying on butchering people. Those are not ‘moderates’ for sure.” 
A never-ending storm in Western media, which are trying to diminish all the counter-terrorism efforts of Damascus and its allies, is a deliberate campaign that started at the very beginning of the Syrian crisis, Shaaban said. It was always “absolutely incredible, full of lies and falsifications” and totally “irrelevant to reality.” 
“One of the great challenges we’re facing in the 21st century is the Western corporate media, that is no longer a media that depends on investigation, or cares about its credibility, or cares about the truth. Give me the names of Western journalists who are on the ground on Syria and who are actually looking at what is happening and reporting to Western people…” 
The attempts to pin the alleged airstrike on an Idlib school on Damascus or Moscow is one of the most recent examples of that campaign. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, which debunked the Idlib “hoax,” the latest smear campaign is waged with a purpose to diverse the attention of international community away from the “war crimes committed by the US-led coalition” during the Mosul offensive. 
The US-led coalition and the US itself proved to be very untrustworthy partners in battling terrorism, unable to live up to their pledges, she said. 
“Russia signed an agreement with the United States and the United States was not able to implement its own agreement… The Pentagon prevented the White House from implementing an agreement.” 
Following Friday’s meeting between Russian, Iranian and Syrian diplomats, Shaaban said Damascus is interested in attracting additional “credible” partners to the alliance, in order to battle the “most challenging” issue of our age. 
“We’re in an alliance against terrorism, we’re in a war against terrorism, we have so many joint interests among our countries. … [The meeting was] focused on what is the best way to try and gather more regional and international forces to truly and honestly engage in a battle against terrorism, as we all understand that terrorism is the most challenging issue for the humanity in the 21st century,” Assad’s adviser said. 
Damascus believes more countries will join in the counter-terrorism alliance of Russia, Iran and Syria, Shaaban said. 
“I’m sure this nucleus of alliance is going to attract more countries. Now, if you think of India, or Brazil, or South Africa, or Algeria, or Tunisia, naturally you believe that there’s no problem that these countries probably in the future joining… I’m sure there are many countries who would like to be more active, China for example, who should be more active in fighting terrorism.”",0
8320,Wheelchair-Bound Teen Stands For American Flag At Homecoming Parade,"Benghazi Survivor Reveals Plan To Defeat Radical Islam 
Trenholm suffers from spina bifida, a birth defect that impairs the development of the spinal cord. It has kept the teen confined to a wheelchair for the past 10 years. 
Despite the inability to stand on his own , the boy has always been patriotic, his mother said, standing in his own manner whenever he sees the flag or hears the national anthem or Pledge of Allegiance. The teen even owns a number of pairs of leg braces emblazoned with a stars-and-stripes motif.   
The picture of young Trenholm standing as his school’s Junior ROTC color guard marched past was snapped by his uncle, Myron Leggett, a professional photographer. 
“He didn’t have to do that. He has an excuse to stay seated,” said Leggett. “Nobody told him, nobody encouraged him and he did it on his own. I admire him for that and I’m very proud of him.” 
The subsequent posting of the picture to social media brought a vast amount of attention, earning thousands of likes, comments and shares, even from national media outlets. 
This should serve as an inspiration to all those who are tired of seeing the flag and anthem and country they represent being disrespected by individuals pushing a divisive agenda.  ",0
